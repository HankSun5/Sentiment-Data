48499461,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=768971,1752877825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48499461.jpeg,"Jack Dorsey's Block is joining the S&P 500, stock surges by 10%",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jack-dorseys-block-is-joining-the-sp-500/,"Block is getting bumped up to the S&P 500, and investors are not wasting time reacting. On Friday, shares of the company jumped more than 10% after hours, according to S&P Global, which announced that Block will replace Hess in the index starting before the opening bell on July 23. The shake-up follows Chevron’s $54 billion acquisition of Hess, completed after the oil giant came out on top in a legal fight with Exxon Mobil over drilling rights in Guyana. The change is one of two this week. On Monday, S&P Global also confirmed The Trade Desk will take over Ansys’ place after Synopsys closed its deal to acquire the software firm on Thursday. While most of these index swaps happen during regular quarterly rebalancing, mergers like this one fast-track the process. Last week, Datadog moved into the index to fill the spot left by Juniper Networks. Block takes the seat, tech gets bigger This latest move gives the index more tech weight, continuing a trend that’s been building for years. Block, which used to be called Square, was launched by Jack Dorsey in 2009. The company made a name for itself with sleek payment terminals before branching out into crypto, lending, and broader financial services. It rebranded as Block in 2021 to match its growing interest in blockchain infrastructure. Block’s rise into the S&P 500 puts it above many of its peers in terms of valuation. Even though its stock has dropped 14% this year, it still holds a market cap of around $45 billion, which is well above the median for companies in the index. For context, the Nasdaq is up over 8% this year, and the S&P 500 itself has gained about 7%, meaning Block’s underperformance hasn’t stopped it from climbing into the top tier. The stock jump didn’t come from better earnings or any new product drop. This is all about portfolio managers being forced to buy Block to track the S&P 500 exactly. When a company gets added to the index, massive funds have no choice but to load up. That buying pressure sent the price up instantly. Still, things haven’t exactly been smooth for the company. In May, Block reported first-quarter results that missed expectations, and it followed up with a downbeat forecast for the second quarter and the full year. That guidance came with a warning about the overall U.S. economy, especially following tariff actions by President Donald Trump that tightened conditions for a lot of businesses. “We recognize we are operating in a more dynamic macro environment, so we have reflected a more cautious stance on the macro outlook into our guidance for the rest of the year,” Block wrote in its latest quarterly filing. The next major checkpoint for the company is coming fast. Block is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on August 7, after markets close. Investors, already tied to the stock through index exposure, will be watching closely.

The FPPE token fuels these platforms, providing incentives and rewards for creative engagement. Its ongoing “double your tokens” presale promo is driving massive traction, positioning FPPE as a meme coin with serious functionality. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Backbone of DeFi Chainlink remains the most trusted oracle network in the DeFi sector, connecting blockchains with off-chain data and real-world assets. With growing institutional collaborations like those with SWIFT and DTCC, LINK is expanding beyond retail DeFi use cases. Staking mechanisms and broader adoption of RWAs continue to strengthen Chainlink’s fundamentals. For investors focused on infrastructure and scalability, LINK continues to be a reliable long-term asset. Source: Coingecko – Chainlink Comparing Utility and Investor Incentives BTC Bull focuses on sentiment trading and caters to Bitcoin Maxis with limited direct utility. FloppyPepe offers AI meme tools and NFT creation, combining meme appeal with actual monetization features. OpenFundNet (OFNT) stands out with its zero-fee structure, allowing users to launch presales, DAOs, and staking platforms without coding. Qubetics integrates AI and blockchain for scalable infrastructure, focusing on real-world enterprise solutions. Real Utility Tokens Will Outlast the Hype Utility tokens are proving to be more than just short-term plays — they’re forming the backbone of the next crypto wave. While meme tokens like FloppyPepe inject energy into the space, it’s utility-rich assets like OpenFundNet that are powering the infrastructure behind the scenes. Whether through launching DAOs, staking platforms, or crowdfunding mechanisms, OFNT delivers real tools for real builders. For investors seeking long-term relevance and explosive upside, OFNT stands out as one of July’s most strategic allocations.

This Y Combinator-backed startup embarked on an ambitious journey to revolutionize how we interact with our computers using AI agents , specifically targeting the complex environment of Microsoft Windows. The Bold Vision for AI Agents in Windows Imagine a world where your computer understands and executes tasks seamlessly, driven by intelligent AI agents . This was the revolutionary promise of Pig.dev, a participant in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch. Their initial focus was on developing agentic AI technology capable of controlling a Microsoft Windows desktop, a frontier many believe is crucial for AI’s broader integration into the workforce. The concept was akin to giving AI a pair of hands and eyes to navigate the digital world, automating complex workflows and boosting productivity. Unpacking the Challenges of Windows Automation Despite its visionary potential, the path to seamless Windows automation proved more challenging than anticipated for Pig.dev. While the idea of AI agents interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like Windows desktops holds immense promise, practical implementation faces significant hurdles. The Y Combinator podcast highlighted that long-term computer use by agents, extending beyond minutes to hours, remains a major stumbling block. As the context window for reasoning expands, an agent’s accuracy can waver, and the computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs) escalate dramatically. Pig.dev’s founder, Erik Dunteman, encountered a fundamental disconnect with the market. Customers in the legacy application automation space weren’t seeking a cloud API product or even a developer tool; they wanted a complete, hands-off solution. Essentially, they desired a consultant to build and manage their desired Windows robotic process automations, a service model Dunteman was unwilling to pursue, preferring to build scalable development tools instead. From Pig.dev to Muscle Mem: A Strategic Startup Pivot In May, facing these realities, Pig.dev announced a decisive startup pivot , abandoning its Windows automation efforts. Erik Dunteman shifted his company’s focus entirely to Muscle Mem, a novel cache system designed for AI agents. This strategic move was not a surrender but a re-evaluation of how best to tackle the core problems of AI agent efficiency. Muscle Mem’s purpose is to allow AI agents to offload repeatable tasks, freeing them to concentrate on complex reasoning, new problems, and handling edge cases. This approach directly addresses the challenges of accuracy and cost by optimizing how agents manage information and execute routine operations, chipping away at the ‘computer use’ problem from a different, yet equally vital, angle. Insights from the Y Combinator Podcast on Agentic AI The significance of Pig.dev’s journey and pivot was a central topic on a recent Y Combinator podcast, sparking a dynamic conversation among tech luminaries. YC partner Tom Blomfield likened Pig.dev’s original vision to ‘Browser Use’ – another YC alum that gained popularity for enabling AI agents to navigate web browsers by converting website elements into a text-like format. The podcast, featuring Amjad Massad (CEO of Replit), Blomfield, and YC partner David Lieb, underscored that while agentic technology is advancing, sustained, long-term computer interaction remains a significant hurdle. Blomfield even suggested that founders should explore applying technologies like Browser Use or Windows automation (like Pig.dev’s original concept) to specific enterprise verticals. Massad echoed this sentiment, stating, ‘The moment that technology works, those two companies are going to do really, really well.’ This dialogue highlights the immense market potential for solutions that truly unlock persistent AI agent capabilities. The Broader Landscape of AI Technology and Automation Pig.dev’s pivot underscores a crucial point about the evolution of AI technology : innovation often requires adapting to market needs and technical realities. While Pig.dev moved on, the pursuit of Windows automation is far from over. Microsoft itself is actively engaged in this space. In April, Microsoft announced the integration of computer use technology into Copilot Studio for graphical user interfaces like Windows, released as a research preview. Furthermore, Microsoft recently unveiled an agentic tool within Windows 11 designed to assist end-users in managing system settings. These developments indicate that major players recognize the importance of intelligent automation within desktop environments. Muscle Mem, Dunteman’s new venture, represents a complementary approach, focusing on the underlying efficiency of AI agents, which is critical for any form of successful automation, whether on a desktop or in the cloud. The ‘last mile’ of computer use, as Dunteman puts it, remains a compelling challenge that will continue to drive innovation in the AI sector. The story of Pig.dev is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of startup innovation, especially in the cutting-edge field of AI. While their initial foray into Windows automation faced insurmountable market and technical challenges, the strategic pivot to Muscle Mem demonstrates resilience and a continued commitment to solving fundamental problems in AI agent efficiency. This evolution highlights that the path to truly autonomous and useful AI agents is multifaceted, requiring both direct automation solutions and foundational infrastructure improvements. As the AI landscape continues to mature, such pivots are not failures, but crucial steps in refining solutions that will ultimately shape our digital future.

Now in its eighth report, HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt reinforces the platform’s philosophy of value investing, early discovery, and quality priority, curating a list of seven standout assets that combine market momentum with long-term narrative. This is not merely a hotlist of weekly top gainers. It’s a forward-looking curation of projects positioned to outperform over longer cycles. HTX New Listing Winners The Selected Seven Assets: From Meme Coins and GameFi to DeFi and L1 Narratives HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt #8 features seven cherry-picked assets from several trending sectors with prosperous narratives. These sectors cover meme coins, GameFi, DeFi and RWA innovations, and public blockchain infrastructure. L1 Public Chain: Time-Honored Infrastructure, New Catalysts ● TRON ($TRX) | Rated S: TRON’s native token $TRX was recently adopted by Nasdaq-listed firm SRM as part of its strategic reserve, making TRON one of the first blockchain networks bridging into U.S. capital markets. This also makes TRON as a battle-tested Layer 1 network with a fresh off-chain narrative. While its price move of +16.7% is modest, its global exposure and off-chain integration signal a longer-term value growth. Meme Coins: Narrative Continues with Strong Community Backing ● BONK ($BONK): As one of Solana’s OG meme coins, $BONK is back in the spotlight, thanks to the Solana ecosystem revival. According to LetsBONK.fun, BONK has surpassed Pump.fun in on-chain activity, gaining a 193.2% surge over the period. ● MemeCore ($M): The top gainer, with a jaw-dropping +378.3% performance. Recently listed on both HTX and BN futures markets, its liquidity and social buzz continue to scale. ● Banana For Scale ($BANANAS31): A dark horse from the BNB Chain, up 347% since launch. Fueled by the light-hearted vibe and community energy, its memetic power still shows further viral marketing potential. ● Build On BNB ($BOBBSC): Another rising star of meme coin on BNB Smart Chain, $BOBBSC has surged over 200%, leveraging the BNB ecosystem’s benefits. It now plays at a low market cap, ideal for early value investment. GameFi: Legacy Tokens, New Momentum ● FUNToken ($FUN): A veteran in the GameFi space, now seeing renewed interest. With a robust tokenomics model and real in-game utility, $FUN has rebounded nearly by 94%, positioning itself as a strong recovery asset in the GameFi comeback story. DeFi + RWA: Real-World Asset Tokenization Heats Up ● Maple Finance ($SYRUP): The rising star of DeFi’s institutional pivot, specializing in on-chain credit and RWA lending. While Maple is tokenizing high-quality real-world assets with strong compliance narratives, $SYRUP has gained a 71.1% increase since its launch on HTX, driven by demand for yield-generating, regulation-friendly assets. Beyond the Charts: Why These Projects Matter These seven assets in HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt #8 share a key trait: they are actively delivering on their narratives, not just promising them. From TRON’s growing real-world footprint to BONK’s strong rise on Solana, from the explosive virality of MemeCore and Build On BNB to the yield-driven momentum of Maple behind RWA’s building, these aren’t flash-in-the-pan plays. They’re structurally supported stories with runway left to go. HTX’s research team carefully tracks narrative fulfillment, not just speculation. This forward-focused methodology aims to help users identify long-term value, especially as retail sentiment continues to chase short-term price spikes. As the market heats up and narratives rotate at breakneck speed, the report stands as a reminder that the next bull cycle won’t be won by hype alone and the true gems may already be on-chain yet underexposed.

The crypto space is full of promises, but most coins never move beyond flashy headlines. Real-world tools, community activity, and growing demand often separate strong projects from weak ones. That’s why looking into the highest potential crypto options now can make a real difference. This list covers four projects: BlockDAG, SUI, SEI, and Jupiter, that stand out for their working features, rising adoption, and future plans. While all four bring something valuable, one of them is showing signs of being a major breakout in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: No Vesting Pass and 3,025% Launch ROI BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly gaining attention as one of the highest potential crypto projects heading into 2025. The network already has a live testnet, mobile mining app, and tools like smart contracts and a block explorer. Over 2 million people have downloaded its app, and that number is still rising. The latest NO VESTING PASS offer gives early access buyers a clear benefit. For the next 8 days, all purchases come with 100% coin access at launch, no lockups. This is a huge shift from typical presales. The price is currently $0.0016 , while the confirmed launch price is $0.05. That means those buying now could see up to 3,025% profit. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already sold over 23.9 billion coins and raised more than $342 million. It’s also forming partnerships beyond the crypto space, including with Inter Milan and the Seattle Seawolves. With the full launch nearing, BlockDAG stands out for its working tech, open access, and big upside, making it a clear leader among the highest potential crypto picks. 2. SUI: User Activity Rises With Developer-Friendly Design SUI earns its place among the highest potential crypto picks thanks to its real-world focus. Built as a fast Layer-1 blockchain, SUI supports DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, all areas where speed matters. Developers like building on it, and users are starting to follow. A 145% surge in daily active users proves the network is picking up pace. SUI is also growing through new wallet activity and integrations, like the recent link with tBTC through Threshold Network. The coin is trading around $3.94, just 26% below its high of $5.35. If it stays above the $4 range, a move to $10 could happen during the next bull run. For those looking at the highest potential crypto options, SUI’s growth and speed make it worth watching from both tech and price angles. 3. SEI: Built for Speed and Trading Efficiency SEI is another project in the highest potential crypto group that’s built with purpose. As a Layer-1 chain focused on fast trading, it’s not trying to do everything. Instead, SEI is designed to deliver speed and scale for financial apps. In just 30 days, SEI jumped 105% in price, now sitting near $0.37. Its Total Value Locked crossed $682 million, reflecting growing network strength. The platform is moving past resistance points and attracting more interest, especially from users focused on DeFi tools. Analysts say SEI could break the $0.50 mark soon and possibly hit $1.14 by year-end. With rising usage and a focused mission, SEI continues to show why it’s among the highest potential crypto choices for 2025. 4. Jupiter: Driving Liquidity Across Solana DEXs Jupiter (JUP) is gaining steady ground as one of the highest potential crypto picks. As Solana’s main DEX aggregator, Jupiter routes around 80% of all decentralized trades on the network. It also gives users tools like limit orders and recurring buys, helping more people manage trades smoothly. Thanks to Solana’s rising use, driven by meme coin interest, Jupiter is also seeing increased traction. On-chain data reveals more users are holding JUP, a bullish sign for its future. The coin trades near $0.85, but past highs at $2.04 leave room for strong movement. Some expect a return to $5 if the market continues its upward trend. For a project offering real value through trading tools, Jupiter holds its place among 2025’s highest potential crypto picks. Wrapping It Up These four projects all stand out in different ways. SUI shows speed and network growth. SEI focuses on fast, on-chain trades. Jupiter supports Solana’s DeFi boom. But BlockDAG is shaping up to be the one with the widest reach. With over $342 million raised, 23.9 billion coins sold, a $0.0016 price now, and a NO VESTING PASS offer for 8 more days, its path to launch looks strong. Among the highest potential crypto picks of 2025, BlockDAG leads with real tools, access, and value.

The filing was submitted by Tom Farley, the firm’s CEO and former president of the NYSE. Tom now leads Bullish as it aims to scale beyond the private markets it’s been operating in. The IPO filing also revealed raw numbers. As of March 31, Bullish has processed over $1.25 trillion in total trading volume since launching. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, it reported $2.5 billion in average daily volume, which places it in the top five exchanges globally for spot Bitcoin and Ether trades. That’s based on internal data provided directly by the company. Bullish builds on big names, big volumes, and big politics The exchange started with cash from Founders Fund, Thiel Capital, Nomura, Mike Novogratz, and others. In 2023, Bullish bought crypto news outlet CoinDesk, adding media muscle to its platform. It now competes directly with Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, as noted in the public prospectus. Tom didn’t comment directly in the filing, but the document did include a line from Bullish’s leadership that read: “In the first quarter of 2025, Bullish exchange executed over $2.5 billion in average daily volume, ranking in the top five exchanges by spot volume for Bitcoin and Ether.” This year has already seen multiple crypto companies try to grab a piece of the public market. Circle, the stablecoin issuer, went public in June and its valuation has climbed more than sevenfold since. In May, Etoro also debuted with a platform that allows users to trade crypto assets. Novogratz’s own company, Galaxy Digital, migrated its listing from Toronto to the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Gemini, the exchange created by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, quietly filed for its own U.S. IPO last month. Bitcoin hasn’t been sitting still either. It’s currently trading above $117,000, a major jump from the $94,000 range it was hovering around at the start of 2025. Capital is still pouring into the sector, and that momentum is giving firms like Bullish more leverage when approaching public markets. On the regulatory side, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on the same day as Bullish’s IPO filing. The act introduces new stablecoin regulations to protect consumers. These digital tokens are supposed to be pegged to things like the U.S. dollar and are marketed as less volatile alternatives to regular crypto. Bullish’s SEC filing made its intentions clear: the company said it aims to “drive the adoption of stablecoins, crypto, and blockchain technology.” That wording wasn’t a throwaway. It’s directly tied to the bigger political forces backing this entire move. Thiel, Elon Musk, and David Sacks, who currently leads Trump’s AI and crypto strategy team, have all dumped massive funding into Trump’s reelection campaign. They’ve also pushed hard for laws that formally legitimize crypto exchanges and assets at the federal level. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Trading above all EMAs while RSI at healthy 64.37 suggests a technical reset amid institutional positioning uncertainty. A strong structural foundation emerges, with the price 16.9% above the 200-day EMA ( $97,723 ), while the MACD maintains bullish momentum despite a pullback from historic highs. The market cap stands at $2.34 trillion, with a daily volume of $82.25 billion, as Charles Schwab launches Bitcoin trading and Trump’s “Genius Act” opens a $9 trillion retirement market to crypto investments. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, retirement market developments, institutional adoption acceleration, and historic high implications to assess BTC’s 90-day trajectory amid a critical inflection point that determines whether the continuation or correction will occur. Technical Crossroads: Historic High Pullback Tests Bull Market Validity Bitcoin’s current price of $117,600 reflects a minor 1.32% daily decline from its historic all-time high of $123,091 , achieved on July 14th , marking a critical consolidation phase. The $3,505 intraday range represents 3.0% of the current price, demonstrating controlled volatility during institutional position adjustment periods. Source: TradingView RSI at 64.37 , a healthy level , provides optimal positioning with room for continued appreciation without overbought concerns, suggesting a technical reset rather than a trend reversal. This positioning suggests a sustainable bull market structure rather than an exhaustion spike, although decisive action above the $121K resistance remains crucial for validation. MACD indicators display strong bullish momentum, with a positive histogram at 2,836.92, confirming underlying strength despite a short-term pullback. Source: TradingView The combination of healthy RSI positioning and strong MACD signals creates an optimal setup for continuation toward $125K-$127K targets once consolidation completes. Retirement Market Revolution: Trump’s “Genius Act” Opens $9 Trillion Gateway President Trump’s planned signing of the “Genius Act” represents a revolutionary catalyst opening the $9 trillion US retirement market to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. This development could trigger unprecedented institutional demand as 401(k) and pension funds gain regulatory approval for digital asset allocation. The retirement market integration addresses previous regulatory barriers that prevented institutional participation, creating sustainable demand drivers beyond speculative trading. Professional retirement fund managers, who are subject to fiduciary compliance, now have a regulatory framework for allocating Bitcoin to their treasuries. Charles Schwab’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services validates the mainstream financial services’ embrace of cryptocurrency infrastructure. The $10 trillion asset manager’s entry provides credibility, attracting conservative institutional capital that was previously excluded from direct cryptocurrency exposure. Market Dominance Dynamics: Altcoin Season Speculation Builds Bitcoin’s market dominance, at 60.86% , shows a slight decline as altcoin season speculation intensifies following BTC’s historic high. This dominance shift creates a binary scenario in which Bitcoin either maintains its leadership or capital shifts toward altcoin alternatives. BTC dominance dropping “hard” according to analysts suggests a major utility season ahead as institutional capital explores high-performance blockchain alternatives. This rotation pattern has historically preceded significant altcoin appreciation cycles, while Bitcoin consolidates its gains. Historical Context: ATH Achievement Creates Psychological Inflection Bitcoin’s July 14th all-time high of $123,091 represents the culmination of institutional adoption momentum that had been building throughout 2021 . Current 4.36% discount to ATH provides attractive positioning while maintaining the psychological significance of historic breakthrough achievement. The 15% appreciation from June’s $108,799 close demonstrates sustained institutional demand despite broader market uncertainty. Historic high achievement creates a psychological inflection point where Bitcoin either validates a new valuation paradigm through continued appreciation or experiences a correction as early adopters secure profits. The next 30-60 days remain critical for determining the long-term trajectory. Support & Resistance: EMA Strength Provides Foundation Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $117,316 , reinforced by psychological support at $115,000-$116,000 . The exceptional EMA positioning, with prices 3-17% above all major moving averages, confirms the success of institutional accumulation and validates trend strength. Major support extends through the 20-day EMA at $113,968 and the 50-day EMA at $109,338 , providing multiple safety nets during any correction periods. This support structure appeals to institutional risk management, as it requires defined downside protection during historically high valuation levels. Critical resistance begins at today’s high around $120,821 , followed by psychological resistance at $121,000-$122,000 . Breaking above this zone would signal continuation toward major resistance at $125,000-$127,000, representing next institutional profit-taking and psychological milestone levels. Market Metrics: Institutional Validation Sustains Momentum Bitcoin maintains a historic $2.33 trillion market capitalization, accompanied by a robust 24-hour trading volume of $81.67 billion , which represents institutional validation of its store-of-value status at unprecedented levels. The 18.9% volume increase demonstrates continued professional participation despite pullback from highs. The circulating supply of 19.89 million BTC represents 94.7% of the maximum 21 million supply, creating increasing scarcity dynamics that appeal to institutional treasury allocation strategies. The approaching supply maximum intensifies deflationary arguments in favor of premium valuations. Current pricing is 4.36% below all-time highs, with extreme gains of 241,999,061% from 2010 lows, providing a compelling institutional narrative for continued appreciation. This risk-reward profile appeals to professional investors seeking exposure to a proven digital store of value with regulatory clarity. Social Sentiment: Community Division Reflects Market Uncertainty LunarCrush data reveals mixed community engagement with AltRank declining to 763 while maintaining 81% positive sentiment. The 130.79 million total engagements with 385.92K mentions demonstrate Bitcoin’s ability to capture attention during historic periods. A social dominance of 18.85% with declining creator participation suggests community uncertainty about the direction following a historic high achievement. Recent themes have focused on the potential for an altcoin season and validation of institutional adoption, rather than continued BTC appreciation. #Altcoin Season Index is Indicating the biggest and the final altcoin season of this cycle. pic.twitter.com/zv8PSsC1GG — Mags (@thescalpingpro) July 18, 2025 The sentiment division between 81% positive outlook and declining engagement metrics reflects broader market uncertainty about whether historic highs represent the continuation or culmination of current cycle dynamics. 90-Day BTC Price Forecast Institutional Momentum Continuation (Bull Case – 40% Probability) Successful retirement market integration and Charles Schwab adoption could drive continued appreciation toward $130,000-$140,000 , representing 11-19% upside. This scenario requires breaking above the $121K resistance and confirmation of sustained institutional positioning. Technical targets include $125K , $130K , and $140K based on psychological levels and institutional flow projections. The retirement market catalyst could attract massive conservative capital seeking digital store-of-value exposure with regulatory compliance. Historic High Consolidation (Base Case – 45% Probability) Extended consolidation between $115K and $125K could persist through Q3 2025, as institutional positioning develops and regulatory implementations advance. Support at the EMA cluster, around $109K-$114K, would likely remain stable during consolidation, with volume normalizing to approximately 60-70 billion daily. This sideways action provides institutional accumulation opportunities while preserving uptrend structure for eventual continuation. Correction from Historic Levels (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below EMA support at $114K could trigger a correction toward $100K-$105K , representing 11-15% downside. This scenario would require significant institutional demand disappointment or broader market weakness affecting digital asset adoption. The strong institutional adoption backdrop and regulatory clarity trends limit extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $100K-$105K providing a psychological foundation for future recovery cycles. BTC Forecast: Digital Gold Meets Institutional Infrastructure Bitcoin’s current positioning reflects the convergence of historic valuation achievements, institutional adoption acceleration, and regulatory integration advancements. The 42-signal analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency is positioned at a critical inflection point between the validation of a new paradigm and the consolidation requirements. Combined with historic high achievement and sustained institutional interest, these developments provide compelling continuation arguments. The $121K resistance breakthrough represents the definitive test of Bitcoin’s new valuation paradigm following historic ATH achievement. A successful breakout validates the institutional adoption thesis and triggers continuation toward $130K+ targets, while failure suggests a healthy consolidation phase before the next institutional catalyst wave.

Bitcoin Holder Rotation May Derail Rally According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor IT Tech, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) – those holding BTC for over 155 days – have transitioned into net distribution, suggesting seasoned investors are engaging in profit-taking. Meanwhile, short-term holders (STH) – those who have held BTC for less than 155 days — have recently turned net positive, indicating they are buying into BTC’s current rally in anticipation of further gains. Historical data shows that similar trends among LTH and STH were observed back in April 2021 and November 2023. During both these instances, BTC witnessed a cooling phase or a local top when spot demand faded. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Spike After $123,000 Peak – Signs Of Short-Term Cooling? In their analysis, IT Tech suggested keeping an eye on exchange inflows and funding rates for confirmation. If spot BTC inflows to crypto exchanges surge, it could hint that sell-pressure is likely to increase, which may derail the digital asset’s bullish trajectory. Supporting this view, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain noted that the Spent Output Value Ranges (SOVR) indicator shows a spike in BTC transfers to exchanges from wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC – typically associated with whales. For the uninitiated, the SOVR indicator tracks on-chain BTC transfers by value buckets to identify which investor segments are active. It helps reveal whether retail, mid-sized, or institutional players are driving market activity. This aligns with IT Tech’s observations on long-term holders. If selling pressure intensifies, BTC could correct down to a support level near $111,800. Not All Analysts See Rally Exhaustion Although Bitcoin LTH entering distribution phase, and whales increasing their deposits to crypto exchanges may point toward a potential end for the current rally, not all analysts share the same sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? For instance, the STH Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) suggests BTC may still be undervalued, indicating potential for further upside. If that holds, Bitcoin could climb as high as $150,000 before any major pullback. Additionally, a fresh injection of $2 billion in liquidity to major crypto derivatives platforms could help reignite bullish momentum. However, caution remains warranted. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been climbing steadily, giving early signs of an overheated market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,754, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

This isn’t just another corporate announcement; it marks a pivotal moment for Jack Dorsey’s Block , signaling its maturation and increasing influence within the dynamic fintech stock market . For investors and enthusiasts alike, this inclusion, effective before trading opens on July 23rd, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, offers a fresh perspective on the company’s trajectory and its potential impact on the broader economy. It’s a testament to Block’s journey from a disruptive startup to a major player, and it naturally sparks questions about what this means for SQ stock analysis and the future of digital finance. What Does S&P 500 Inclusion Mean for Block S&P 500? The S&P 500 is more than just a list of companies; it’s widely considered the benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, representing approximately 80% of the total market capitalization. For a company like Block to earn its place alongside corporate giants, it must meet stringent criteria, including market capitalization, liquidity, and sustained profitability. Block’s inclusion, replacing Hess Corp., is a powerful endorsement of its financial health and market standing. So, what are the tangible benefits of this prestigious entry for Block S&P 500 ? Increased Visibility and Prestige: Being part of the S&P 500 significantly elevates Block’s profile. It signals stability and reliability to a wider range of investors, both institutional and retail, who often look to the index as a barometer of market strength. Enhanced Liquidity: A substantial portion of investment funds, particularly passive index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are designed to track the S&P 500. This means that as Block enters the index, these funds will automatically purchase its shares (SQ stock) to rebalance their portfolios, leading to a surge in demand and improved trading liquidity. Lower Cost of Capital: Increased investor confidence and liquidity can translate into a lower cost of capital for Block. This means the company might find it easier and cheaper to raise funds for future investments, expansions, or acquisitions, further fueling its growth. Broader Investor Base: Many institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers have mandates to invest only in S&P 500 companies. Block’s inclusion opens the door to this vast pool of capital, diversifying its shareholder base and potentially stabilizing its stock price over the long term. In essence, joining the S&P 500 is akin to receiving a gold star in the corporate world, confirming Block’s status as a robust, influential, and investment-worthy entity. The Visionary Behind the Move: Understanding Jack Dorsey’s Block At the heart of Block’s innovative trajectory is its co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey . Known globally for co-founding Twitter, Dorsey’s pivot towards Block (formerly Square) and his passionate advocacy for Bitcoin have defined the company’s unique path. His vision for a decentralized financial future, where individuals have greater control over their money, permeates Block’s various ventures. Block’s ecosystem is multifaceted, encompassing: Square: The foundational business, providing payment processing hardware and software for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). This includes point-of-sale systems, payroll services, and business loans, empowering countless entrepreneurs. Cash App: A hugely popular mobile payment service that allows users to send and receive money, invest in stocks, and even buy and sell Bitcoin. Cash App has become a significant driver of Block’s growth, especially among younger demographics. TBD: A platform focused on building decentralized financial services, particularly around Bitcoin. This aligns with Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin as the internet’s native currency. Spiral (formerly Square Crypto): An independent team dedicated to advancing Bitcoin development through open-source projects. Dorsey’s steadfast commitment to Bitcoin, often expressing his belief that it will eventually unite the world, positions Jack Dorsey’s Block as a unique player in the financial sector. Unlike many traditional fintech companies, Block actively explores the intersection of conventional payments and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, striving to make digital assets more accessible and useful for everyday transactions. This forward-thinking approach has not only fueled its growth but also differentiated it in a crowded market. How Will SQ Stock React to This Landmark SQ Stock Analysis? For investors holding or considering SQ stock , the S&P 500 inclusion naturally raises questions about its immediate and long-term price performance. Historical data suggests that companies often experience a positive bump in their stock price both leading up to and immediately following S&P 500 inclusion. This “inclusion effect” is primarily driven by the mandatory buying from index funds. However, a thorough SQ stock analysis requires looking beyond the immediate surge. While the initial demand from index funds is a powerful catalyst, the long-term performance of Block’s stock will ultimately depend on its underlying fundamentals, strategic execution, and ability to navigate market challenges. Potential scenarios for SQ stock : Short-Term Volatility: While index funds buy, some existing investors might use the opportunity to take profits, leading to short-term price fluctuations. However, the net effect is typically positive. Increased Analyst Coverage: Greater visibility often leads to more analyst coverage, which can bring more scrutiny but also more informed investment decisions. Investor Confidence: The S&P 500 stamp of approval can boost overall investor confidence, potentially attracting a new class of long-term holders who value stability and proven performance. Investors should remember that while S&P 500 inclusion is a significant milestone, it is not a guarantee of perpetual stock appreciation. Block’s ability to innovate, expand its user base, manage regulatory risks, and execute its Bitcoin-centric strategy will be crucial for sustained growth. Reshaping the Fintech Stock Market: Block’s Broader Impact Block’s journey into the S&P 500 is not just about one company; it reflects broader trends reshaping the entire fintech stock market . The financial technology sector has been a hotbed of innovation, challenging traditional banking models and offering more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly financial services. Block stands at the forefront of this transformation. Block’s influence extends across several key areas: Democratizing Finance: Through products like Cash App and its Square ecosystem for SMBs, Block has made financial tools accessible to individuals and small businesses that might have been underserved by traditional banks. This democratization of finance is a hallmark of the fintech revolution. Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance: Block’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, coupled with its mainstream payment services, positions it uniquely to bridge the gap between the nascent world of cryptocurrencies and conventional financial systems. This integration is crucial for wider crypto adoption. Competitive Landscape: Block’s success story puts pressure on both legacy financial institutions and other fintech players. Its agility, innovation, and focus on user experience set a high bar, driving competition and fostering further advancements across the sector. The inclusion of Block in the S&P 500 underscores the growing importance and maturity of the fintech sector within the broader economy. It signals that digital payment solutions, mobile banking, and even cryptocurrency-related services are no longer niche but integral components of modern finance. This could pave the way for more fintech companies to achieve similar recognition, further diversifying the S&P 500 and reflecting the changing economic landscape. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After S&P 500 Inclusion? While S&P 500 inclusion is a significant achievement, it also brings new responsibilities and challenges. As a larger, more visible public company, Block will face increased scrutiny from investors, analysts, and regulators. The journey doesn’t end here; it merely transitions into a new phase of growth and strategic development. What might the future hold for Block? Continued Innovation: To maintain its competitive edge, Block must continue to innovate across its product lines, from enhancing Cash App features to expanding its Square offerings and advancing its Bitcoin initiatives. Global Expansion: While Block has a strong presence in the U.S., there are vast untapped international markets where its solutions could thrive, offering new avenues for growth. Regulatory Navigation: The fintech and crypto spaces are subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Block will need to skillfully navigate these changes to ensure compliance while pursuing its vision for decentralized finance. Balancing Growth and Profitability: As a mature public company, Block will face increasing pressure to balance aggressive growth strategies with sustainable profitability, a common challenge for high-growth tech firms. Jack Dorsey’s Long-Term Vision: Dorsey’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin and decentralization suggests that Block will continue to push the boundaries of financial technology, potentially venturing into new areas like decentralized identity or web5 applications. The S&P 500 inclusion marks Block’s arrival as a financial titan, but its future success will depend on its ability to execute on these strategic imperatives, maintain its innovative spirit, and adapt to an ever-changing financial landscape. Conclusion: A New Era for Block and Beyond Block’s highly anticipated entry into the S&P 500 is far more than just a procedural update to an index; it is a profound declaration of the company’s success, resilience, and pivotal role in shaping the future of finance. For Jack Dorsey’s Block , it represents the culmination of years of innovation, strategic growth, and a steadfast commitment to empowering individuals and businesses through accessible financial tools. This milestone not only validates Block’s business model but also highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of fintech and digital payments within the traditional stock market . As SQ stock gains unprecedented visibility and institutional backing, its journey will undoubtedly serve as a crucial barometer for the evolving landscape where conventional finance intersects with the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrency. It marks a new era for Block, solidifying its position as a leading force in the global financial technology arena and paving the way for further transformative developments.

It’s a stamp of approval from the broader financial community. 2. When will Block officially join the S&P 500? Block is set to join the S&P 500 before trading opens on July 23rd, replacing Hess Corp. 3. How does S&P 500 inclusion typically affect a company’s stock? Historically, companies entering the S&P 500 often experience a positive surge in their stock price due to increased demand from index funds that must purchase shares to track the index. This “inclusion effect” can provide a short-term boost, but long-term performance depends on the company’s fundamental business strength and future growth prospects. 4. What are Block’s primary business segments? Block operates primarily through two main segments: the Square ecosystem, which provides payment processing and business tools for small and medium-sized businesses, and Cash App, a popular mobile payment service for individuals that also offers investing in stocks and Bitcoin. Block also has ventures like TBD and Spiral focused on Bitcoin and decentralized technologies. 5. What is Jack Dorsey’s stance on cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin?

Does S&P 500 inclusion guarantee Block’s continued success? While S&P 500 inclusion is a significant validation, it does not guarantee future success. It signifies past performance and current market standing. Block’s continued growth and profitability will depend on its ability to innovate, expand its services, manage regulatory challenges, and adapt to the evolving fintech and cryptocurrency landscapes.

What makes this announcement particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency world is the company’s explicit intention to allocate the majority of these funds towards a strategic Bitcoin acquisition . This bold decision, reported by BWEnews on X, places Aether Holdings squarely in the spotlight as a Nasdaq-listed entity embracing digital assets as a core component of its treasury strategy. Unpacking Aether Holdings’ Investment Strategy Aether Holdings, with a current market capitalization of $160.46 million, is making a clear statement about its long-term vision. The $40 million offering is not just about raising capital; it’s about strategically deploying it into an asset class that many traditional financial institutions are still hesitant to fully embrace. This commitment to a substantial Bitcoin acquisition reflects a growing confidence in the digital currency’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. For a company operating in the financial technology sector, this move could be seen as both a natural progression and a pioneering step. It aligns with the ethos of innovation that fintech companies often embody, while also setting a precedent for how public companies might manage their reserves in an increasingly digital economy. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin in their treasury management speaks volumes about their outlook on future economic conditions and the potential for digital assets to outperform traditional investments. Why Bitcoin Now? The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Aether Holdings is not operating in a vacuum. Its decision to adopt a corporate Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader trend that has seen several high-profile companies integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, advocating for its superiority as a treasury reserve asset over fiat currencies susceptible to inflation. So, why are more companies, including Nasdaq-listed ones, turning to Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, companies are seeking assets that can preserve or even grow purchasing power. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it a compelling long-term store of value, attracting corporations looking to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional cash and bonds. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial returns on their treasury investments. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. This evolving perspective highlights a fundamental shift in how corporate treasurers view their responsibilities, moving beyond mere liquidity management to active capital appreciation through strategic digital asset allocation. The Broader Trend: Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption Aether Holdings’ move is a powerful indicator of accelerating institutional crypto adoption . While retail investors have driven much of Bitcoin’s early growth, the entry of publicly traded companies, asset managers, and financial institutions lends significant legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency market. This wave of institutional interest is characterized by: Increased Regulatory Clarity: As regulators worldwide begin to establish clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutions feel more comfortable entering the space. Improved Infrastructure: The development of secure custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and institutional-grade trading platforms has made it easier and safer for large entities to acquire and manage digital assets. Growing Investor Demand: Shareholders and clients are increasingly looking for exposure to digital assets, pressuring companies and funds to incorporate them into their offerings or treasury strategies. The commitment from companies like Aether Holdings signals a maturation of the crypto market, transforming it from a niche investment into a recognized asset class within mainstream finance. Benefits and Risks of a Digital Asset Treasury Embracing a digital asset treasury strategy, particularly one centered on Bitcoin, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges that companies must carefully weigh. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: The most evident benefit is the potential for significant capital gains if Bitcoin’s value continues to climb. Innovation Leadership: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and innovative, which can attract talent and investors interested in cutting-edge financial strategies. Hedge Against Macroeconomic Instability: Offering a potential shield against currency devaluation and traditional market downturns. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Attracting a new segment of investors who are bullish on digital assets and appreciate a company’s progressive treasury management. Key Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which could impact a company’s balance sheet and reported earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the regulatory landscape for digital assets remains fluid and varies by jurisdiction, posing compliance challenges. Custody and Security: Securely holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security protocols to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment for digital assets can be complex and may vary, requiring careful consideration and expert advice. Aether Holdings’ decision implies they have carefully considered these factors and are prepared to navigate the complexities for the potential upside. What Does This Mean for Aether Holdings Investment and the Market? The news of a significant Aether Holdings investment in Bitcoin is likely to have several ripple effects. For Aether Holdings itself, it could: Boost Investor Confidence: Particularly among those who believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin and appreciate companies that are early adopters of new financial paradigms. Influence Stock Performance: The company’s stock (AETR on Nasdaq) might see increased volatility, potentially attracting both bullish crypto investors and cautious traditional investors. Strengthen Brand Image: Solidify its reputation as an innovative fintech leader, comfortable with emerging technologies and financial instruments. For the broader market, Aether Holdings’ move adds another data point to the growing narrative of institutional adoption. Each new public company that adds Bitcoin to its treasury reinforces the asset’s legitimacy and contributes to its increasing mainstream acceptance. It could encourage other mid-cap companies to explore similar strategies, further driving demand and potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings Aether Holdings’ strategic Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a single transaction; it’s a testament to a shifting paradigm in corporate finance. As the digital economy continues to expand, the concept of a “treasury” is broadening to include digital assets as a legitimate and potentially high-performing component. We may see a future where: More companies, irrespective of their industry, allocate a portion of their reserves to digital assets. Specialized financial products and services emerge to cater specifically to corporate digital asset treasury management. Regulatory frameworks become even more sophisticated, providing clearer guidelines for accounting, taxation, and custody of these assets. The journey of corporate Bitcoin adoption is still in its early stages, but moves like Aether Holdings’ signal a significant acceleration. It’s a compelling example of how companies are adapting their financial strategies to a rapidly changing global economic landscape, where digital assets are no longer just an alternative but a strategic imperative. Aether Holdings’ bold $40 million offering, primarily earmarked for a substantial Bitcoin acquisition , marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of corporate embrace of digital assets. This strategic decision by the Nasdaq-listed financial technology platform highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, signaling confidence in its long-term value and its potential as a hedge against economic uncertainties. It underscores the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption, pushing digital assets further into the mainstream financial consciousness. While challenges like volatility and regulatory nuances remain, the benefits of asset appreciation, innovation leadership, and enhanced investor appeal are clearly compelling for Aether Holdings. This move not only solidifies Aether Holdings’ position as an innovator but also contributes to the broader legitimization of Bitcoin, potentially inspiring other companies to explore the strategic advantages of a diversified digital asset treasury . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Aether Holdings’ primary reason for acquiring Bitcoin? Aether Holdings intends to allocate the majority of its $40 million offering towards Bitcoin acquisitions as part of its treasury strategy. This move is driven by a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and its potential for significant capital appreciation, aligning with a broader trend of corporate digital asset adoption. 2. How does Aether Holdings’ move compare to other companies’ Bitcoin strategies? Aether Holdings joins a growing list of public companies, including pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla, that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets.

This signifies a continued trend of institutional crypto adoption. 3. What are the potential risks associated with Aether Holdings’ Bitcoin acquisition? Key risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, which could impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space, as well as the complexities of secure custody and accounting for cryptocurrencies, also present challenges that Aether Holdings will need to manage. 4. How might this investment impact Aether Holdings’ stock? Aether Holdings’ stock (AETR on Nasdaq) could experience increased investor interest, particularly from those bullish on cryptocurrencies. It may lead to higher trading volumes and potential price appreciation if the market views this as a strategic, forward-thinking move. However, it could also introduce new volatility linked to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. 5. What is a ‘digital asset treasury’?

Greptile, an AI code review startup, is making waves with a potential Series A funding round that could redefine its trajectory and the broader AI landscape. This news, while not directly about crypto, highlights the massive capital flows into AI, a sector increasingly intertwined with the infrastructure and tools powering the decentralized future. Greptile Funding: A New Era for AI Code Review? Sources close to the deal indicate that Greptile, the innovative AI-powered code review startup, is on the cusp of securing a substantial Series A funding round. This pivotal investment is reportedly set at $30 million, propelling the company’s valuation to an astonishing $180 million. The round is expected to be led by Benchmark partner Eric Vishria, a notable name in the venture capital world. While the final terms are still fluid and the deal has not officially closed, the sheer scale of this potential Greptile funding round signals strong investor confidence in the nascent but rapidly growing AI code review sector. Benchmark Ventures’ Bold Bet: Why Greptile Stands Out The potential leadership of Benchmark Ventures in Greptile’s Series A speaks volumes about the startup’s promise. Benchmark is renowned for its early investments in groundbreaking tech companies, and their interest in Greptile underscores the unique value proposition the company brings to the table. Founded by Daksh Gupta shortly after his graduation from Georgia Tech in 2023, Greptile quickly gained traction, going through the prestigious Y Combinator Winter 2024 cohort and subsequently raising a $4 million seed round led by Initialized Capital. Gupta’s vision for Greptile is to create a bot that acts as an experienced coworker, deeply understanding a customer’s code to pinpoint bugs and issues human reviewers might miss. Navigating the Competitive Landscape of AI Startups The realm of AI startups , particularly in specialized areas like code review, is intensely competitive. Greptile operates in a crowded field, facing off against well-funded rivals. For instance, Graphite, another prominent player, recently closed a $52 million Series B round, drawing investment from Accel, Anthropic’s Anthology Fund, Menlo Ventures, and a16z. Coderabbit, a key competitor, also secured a significant $16 million Series A last year from CRV. This fierce competition is a driving force behind the demanding work culture at Greptile, as highlighted by its founder. Unpacking Greptile’s Series A Valuation: What It Means for the Market The proposed $180 million Series A valuation for Greptile, if finalized, represents a significant milestone for a startup so early in its journey. This valuation reflects not only the potential of Greptile’s technology but also the broader market’s appetite for sophisticated AI tools that enhance developer productivity. It suggests that investors are betting on AI-driven code review becoming an indispensable part of the software development lifecycle, capable of pinpointing bugs and potential issues with a depth of understanding that human reviewers might miss. Attracting an A-list VC like Benchmark at such a healthy valuation could prove invaluable in Greptile’s challenging journey. The Work-Life Balance Debate: A Glimpse into Startup Culture Perhaps one of the most talked-about aspects of Greptile’s early journey has been its demanding work culture. Founder Daksh Gupta’s candid post on X (formerly Twitter) in November, stating that Greptile ‘offers no work-life-balance,’ went viral. He elaborated that employees typically work from 9 am to 11 pm, including Saturdays, and sometimes Sundays. Gupta later clarified to various news outlets that such intense effort is deemed necessary to outcompete rivals in a winner-take-all market. His philosophy, ‘No one cares about the third-best company, or even the second-best company in any category in software. If you’re going to put in 95 percent effort, it’s the equivalent of putting in 0 percent effort,’ reflects a mindset common in high-growth, competitive startup environments, particularly within the fast-paced AI sector. While controversial, this commitment to maximum effort is presented as a direct response to the cutthroat nature of the AI industry. Greptile’s journey, from its Y Combinator origins to its potential landmark Series A funding led by Benchmark, encapsulates the dynamic and often intense world of AI startups. While the demanding work culture sparks debate, the significant valuation and high-profile investor interest underscore the immense potential seen in AI-powered code review. As AI continues to integrate deeper into every facet of technology, companies like Greptile are at the forefront, striving to revolutionize how software is built and maintained. The coming months will reveal if this bold investment pays off, solidifying Greptile’s position as a leader in the competitive AI landscape.

48502896,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=768986,1752882827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48502896.jpeg,Treasury Chief hails GENIUS Act as milestone in digital currency race,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/genius-act-as-milestone-in-crypto-race/,"Treasury Secretary Bessent has hailed signing the GENIUS Act as a “milestone achievement” for cryptocurrency regulation, marking what many see as a historic moment for the digital asset industry. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the US House, establishes a clear federal framework for digital assets, addressing key areas such as stablecoins, custody, and market structure. Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo Finance, said the bill opens the door for companies like his to expand operations nationwide, calling it “the start of a new regulatory era.” Speaking with news outlets, he said clear regulations are essential for major financial institutions to participate in digital asset infrastructure. He explained that the lack of legal clarity was the biggest barrier and added that clearer rules would lead to faster adoption. He also noted the involvement of Patrick McHenry, former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee and now Vice Chair at Ondo Finance. McHenry was with former President Donald Trump when the bill was signed. GENIUS Act sparks market optimism Crypto markets rallied on news of the GENIUS Act’s passage, and major digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gained momentum. This is no coincidence, industry leaders say. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Deputy CEO of Bitpanda, said the move shapes investor sentiment in the crypto space. He noted that the milestone drives broad market optimism, attributing the recent Bitcoin rally and growing interest in altcoins like XRP and DOGE to increased regulatory clarity. He added that investors need certainty to commit for the long term, and that certainty comes from clear, enforceable rules. Apart from these fluctuations, the bill could change how investment firms and hedge funds deploy capital. Obtaining prescribed rules will make it easier for institutions to manage risks when categorising types of crypto assets, trading platforms, and consumer safety. Tae Oh, CEO of Gluwa, focused on the bill’s impact on stablecoins. He said the GENIUS Act marks a major first step in establishing a federal framework for USD-pegged stablecoins. He described it as a strong endorsement of responsible innovation, consumer protection, and the potential for a competitive and dynamic global stablecoin industry. He explained that the bill forms the groundwork for adopting digital assets into the broader financial infrastructure, particularly payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and cross-border transactions. He said that when the fog clears on regulations, trust in stablecoins is a legitimate tool for everyday finance. Oh, also underscored the significance of the pending Federal Reserve policy meeting, adding that it would only take a hint of a policy pivot to have a big impact on risk asset classes, including crypto. US aligns with global crypto regulation trend The GENIUS Act and other similar efforts have been part of a global effort to create boundaries around the digital asset space. Analysts say the United States is starting to move in line with regulatory efforts in other large economies. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is being transposed into law across all Member States, provides a continental point of reference. Offering a single market for the issuance, trading, and storing of crypto assets, MiCA already has companies lining up for a regulatory jurisdiction in Europe. Similar measures are being developed in Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, whose digital asset guidelines will adapt to the fast-paced digital innovation. These developments, seen in combination, suggest that policymakers worldwide are increasingly of one mind: the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but not at the cost of hampering innovation. However, global strategies vary. Some, especially in the Global South, emphasize the redesign of financial infrastructure, while others, as with the US SEC, persist in enforcement using securities laws.

Bullish, a prominent crypto exchange with significant backing, has officially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the United States. This move marks a pivotal moment for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector, signaling growing maturity and a desire for broader mainstream financial integration. What does this bold step mean for the future of digital asset trading and the broader cryptocurrency market ? What is the Significance of Bullish’s SEC Filing? On July 18, Bullish, the crypto exchange that boasts the formidable backing of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, submitted its SEC filing for an Initial Public Offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends to list its shares under the ticker symbol “BLSH.” This formal submission follows earlier reports last month, which indicated that Bullish had already made a confidential filing, setting the stage for this public announcement. For context, an IPO is a process where a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. It’s a significant milestone that provides capital for growth and often increases a company’s visibility and credibility. For Bullish, and indeed for the entire cryptocurrency market , this Bullish IPO represents more than just a fundraising event; it’s a statement of intent regarding the long-term viability and legitimacy of digital assets within traditional financial frameworks. Institutional Focus: Bullish has positioned itself as an exchange primarily targeting institutional investors, offering high-performance trading and deep liquidity. This focus differentiates it from many retail-centric exchanges. High-Profile Backing: The involvement of figures like Peter Thiel, known for his early investments in Facebook and Palantir, lends significant credibility and strategic insight to Bullish. Regulatory Engagement: By pursuing an IPO in the U.S., Bullish is embracing the regulatory scrutiny that comes with public listings, potentially setting a precedent for other crypto firms. How Does Peter Thiel’s Involvement Boost the Bullish IPO? The name Peter Thiel carries immense weight in the technology and finance sectors. As a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in revolutionary companies like Facebook, his endorsement of Bullish is not merely a financial investment; it’s a powerful vote of confidence. Thiel’s involvement signals to both traditional investors and the crypto community that Bullish is a serious player with ambitious long-term goals. Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has a history of backing disruptive technologies. His association with Bullish suggests that he sees significant potential for the exchange to bridge the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. This high-profile backing could: Attract More Institutional Capital: Traditional financial institutions, often wary of the volatile crypto space, might view Bullish more favorably due to Thiel’s reputation. Enhance Credibility: The “Thiel effect” can elevate Bullish’s standing, making it more appealing to a broader range of investors, from seasoned Wall Street veterans to retail participants looking for stable crypto exposure. Influence Strategic Direction: Thiel’s experience in scaling tech companies could provide invaluable guidance as Bullish navigates the complexities of a public listing and rapid expansion in the competitive crypto exchange landscape. What are the Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market? The Bullish IPO is more than an isolated event; it’s a barometer for the evolving relationship between digital assets and mainstream finance. As more cryptocurrency-native companies seek public listings, it signifies a maturation of the sector and an increasing desire for transparency and regulatory compliance. This trend could have several far-reaching effects on the entire cryptocurrency market : Increased Mainstream Acceptance: A successful IPO by a major crypto exchange like Bullish could pave the way for greater institutional adoption and public trust in digital assets. It moves crypto from the fringes to the core of financial discussions. Regulatory Clarity (or Pressure): While the SEC filing process is rigorous, it forces companies to adhere to established financial reporting and governance standards. This could either pressure regulators to provide clearer guidelines for the crypto industry or lead to more stringent oversight. Benchmarking for Valuations: Public listings provide a clearer valuation metric for crypto companies, offering insights into how traditional markets assess the potential of digital asset businesses. This could influence future private funding rounds and M&A activities. Enhanced Investor Access: For retail investors, participating in a crypto exchange IPO offers a way to gain exposure to the underlying infrastructure of the crypto market without directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Bullish? While the prospect of a Bullish IPO is exciting, the journey to becoming a publicly traded company in the U.S. is fraught with challenges, especially for a company operating in the still-nascent cryptocurrency market . However, it also presents significant opportunities: Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC has been increasingly vigilant regarding crypto-related activities. Bullish will face intense scrutiny over its operations, token listings, and compliance measures. Market Volatility: The performance of a crypto exchange is inherently tied to the volatility and sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market. Significant downturns could impact its revenue and stock performance. Competition: The crypto exchange landscape is highly competitive, with established players and new entrants constantly vying for market share. Bullish must maintain its competitive edge. Opportunities: Capital for Growth: An IPO provides substantial capital that Bullish can use for technological development, expansion into new markets, and strategic acquisitions. Enhanced Brand Reputation: Being a publicly traded company can significantly boost Bullish’s brand image, making it more attractive to both users and top talent. Liquidity for Early Investors: The IPO offers an exit strategy for early investors and employees, providing liquidity for their holdings. The path for Bullish will be closely watched, as its success or struggles could influence other major players in the crypto exchange space contemplating similar moves. In conclusion, Bullish’s decision to pursue a U.S. IPO is a landmark event for the digital asset industry. Backed by visionary investors like Peter Thiel , this SEC filing signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies and the infrastructure that supports them. While challenges related to regulation and market volatility persist, the opportunities for growth, institutional adoption, and mainstream integration are immense. The Bullish IPO is poised to be a significant chapter in the ongoing narrative of the cryptocurrency market ’s journey into the global financial mainstream.

We worked hard. Thank you very much. Yeah, we worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS act. They named it after me. And I want to thank want to thank you. This is a hell of an act. You know, I did something very unusual. I said, this has been something it's been a lot of people thought it was impossible, some of the things that have been done. Then, of course, the great big beautiful idea, the word great, the great big beautiful bill, that was something that nobody thought possible. They thought it would be in anywhere from seven to maybe three. I'll go the opposite direction, but three to seven different bills. And we said, Let's just put it in one, because this way there's something for everyone. And there really is, is a lot of things for everyone. And when we get the word out how great that is for every single person in this country, virtually, and the all they have is a sound bite death. You know their sound bite is death. Aren't they nice that they are the most incompetent people. They've lost their confidence. They've lost everything, if you think about it, but Jasmine Crockett is on her way. She's on her way. That's She's the new star of the Democrat Party, Jasmine Crockett, they're in big trouble. But I have to tell you, that was great, and this was great, and I am so tired of making phone calls at 234, o'clock in the morning, getting calls from our great speaker, sir, we have 12 hard nos. I say, Mike, Mike, it's two o'clock in the morning. We have 12 hard Nos. The good news is I call up. Hello Jim. How are you, sir? You have my vote, Sir, you have my vote. I really just, they just want a little love. Unfortunately, it's always the same. It's always the same 12 people. That's, it's, it's five senators, and it's 12. And I actually said to John Thune, and I said to Mike, I said, Listen, I want to have a party, but not to those people that I have to speak to endlessly every time. And they're wonderful because they always seem to come through, other than a couple, Rand Paul Jr from Congress, and Rand Paul other than a few people. But I said, I want to have them over. We're going to have a party for everybody in Congress, everyone Congress, except 12. We're going to have and Mike is de I'll tell you what. Tom has definitely covered the whole group. Where are those 12 people? They're the only people I don't see. We could do it today. We don't have to vote. And I would say, of the 53 senators, 48 with a 48 in half, you won't even have to come to that one. But these are the greatest people, because they always vote yes, and we don't have to go crazy. You trust us. We trust you. That has been a very special group of people. We really do. I mean, 96% phenomenal. And 4% extremely difficult. Do you agree with that? But they get there, most of them, not all of them. Those are the ones we really don't like. But I want to thank you all for being here. This is really a big day. This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology as we signed the landmark genius Act into law. So congratulations to everybody.

Looks great. He's got the whole package. But, you know, I got to know him. He was ambassador to Japan, and we had a little problem with Japan on trade, but he was my ambassador to Japan, and I went to Japan, and he is speaking fluently Japanese. I said, Did you learn it as a child? No, no, I just learned it over the last four or five months. I said, you learn Japanese? Maybe the single hardest language to learn, it's actually breathing, rather than it's breathing. I'm not going to imitate it, because we'll end up with a big story, and I don't want that. But he spoke totally fluent Japanese. I said, That's very impressive. And he was introducing me to Mr. Honda. I said, Oh, are you in the car business? He goes, yes. I said, You're a very rich man. And then he said, Mr. Toyota. Right, Toyota. Then I said, What business are you in? Let me guess. He said, cars. He was my interpreter, and I was so impressed. And I was getting ready to leave. He said, Sir, I'd like to run for the United States Senate. I said, Where are you from? He said, Tennessee. I said, Well, I love Tennessee, but do they know you there? No, but if you endorse me, I'll win, right? And I endorse him, and he took a 48 point lead, and they didn't know who the hell he was, and he's turned out to be a great senator, and now they all know who you are. So you are, you're fantastic, and we thank you, and you just the fact that you're doing this, and you understand this is a complicated world, and you understand it, Bill, so you've been great. Thank you very much. We're also pleased to be joined by our great Vice President, J de Vance. JD, thank you very much. Good job. And he's been up speaking late at night on the phone, I said. JD, how about you take it three or four of these people, please, because three or four I cannot speak to. I just can't and he take them, and he'd come through, right? JD, also speaker Mike Johnson, he is unbelievable. He's an unbelievable I mean, if you go by what we're doing, if you keep at this pace, you can't keep it up for another 200 days. But I will tell you this, if you keep up this pace for another week, you go down as the greatest speaker in the house in history. So one more word. Who needs Tip O'Neill? Who needs Tip O'Neill? He's better looking than Tip O'Neill too. But no, he's been going. He's been going at a fervent pace. Would you say that's right? Your wife probably says You are crazy. You've been aging beautifully in front. He's an amazing actually, he's an amazing speaker, a great leader, and everybody likes him and respects him, and that's why we're with a very small majority, like three. We had a time when we were one. Remember, we said we're one heart attack away from losing the house, and we won a couple of seats and a couple of other now we have seven, maybe, maybe, if we're lucky, seven, but we win with nobody's ever done I don't think anyone's ever done this before to win with those of all, we had a little help from John too, right? And a lot of other people I want to introduce, also Secretary Howard lucknick, who's been fantastic. You have done a great job, Howard, we've got great deals coming out of our ears. We have so many trade deals. And I really mean this too. It's like, how do you deal with so many but you know, I always say, well, we send out the papers that was a deal. They don't want to the fake news doesn't want to hear that. When I send out the paper that you're paying 35 or 40% tariff, that's a deal. Then they'll call and see if they can make a little bit different kind of a deal, like opening up their country to trade. In some cases, they've never been open. But we're doing well, and we have a couple of big ones to announce pretty soon, right? Could almost do it today. Maybe we'll say it. Maybe later on, we'll do it. Senator Bernie Moreno, what a great victory? Bernie had a great victory. Great Victory. That was one of the truly tough races. A lot of people weren't sure anybody could win that scene, and you won it in easy fashion, right? We want it together when you think of it, but you want it in easy fashion. Did a great job. Great guy, House Majority Whip. This is a great leader, Tom Emmer, a great politician and leader, really good. And I like his wife, even better, his wife is, she's the boss, but she's, she's, you are married to a fantastic woman. And he knows that, and he likes, he likes hearing it, because some people don't, you know. They say, Sir, could you please stop saying that my wife is better than me, sir, because the guys that don't usually end up with a good marriage, you know, he's got a great marriage. So thank you Tom. You really are a fantastic leader and representative and representatives Troy downing French Hill. Where's French Hill? Where is French you have been so great. Thank you, Coach. I spoke to him a little late when he was walking down the hall of st French he said, I'm there, sir. You a great, great, great guy. Everyone respects you French. You know that? Bill heisinger, Bill, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good job. Dan muser, I thought he was going to become the next Governor of Pennsylvania, but he likes Congress better, I guess so. But I think you're terrific. And you know, I would have always been behind you that I can tell you. Tim Moore, Tim, thank you. Tim. John, Rose, John, hi. John, thanks. Good job. Brian style, Brian style, still young, still nice and young, it's good. GT, Thompson. GT, thank you. Andy Barr, good friend of all of ours. Thank you, Andy. Monica de la Cruz, Monica, she's here someplace. Thank you, Monica. Thank you. Monica. Mike herodopoulos, Mike, thank you, Mike, look good. Mike Lawler, Mr. Salt, well, it should guarantee your district. I mean, you worked hard for New York, right? And you're on television. I'm on television. So this should be good for a couple of points, but without you and your couple of friends from New York, that wouldn't have happened. That was not easy, right? Congratulations. Great job. Anna, Paulina, Luna, Anna, who is so great, I don't even if she's here or not here, I want to tell you that she has been so great and worked so hard to make sure we got it approved. Ralph Norman, Ralph, Ralph, what happened to Ralph? Nick? Begich, Nick, thank you, Nick, good job. Good job. Good, good votes. I just saw a great poll on you. Huh? Very good congratulations. Like Andy ogles. Andy, terrific friend. Beth Van Dyne. Beth, thank you. Beth, great job. Thank you. Thank you very much for the great support. Roger Williams, a great baseball player who also had to take a bullet, unfortunately, but he is a great guy. He was involved in that whole catastrophe, but he's fantastic, and has been from day one, along with a lot of other people that I won't call out because I have no idea where the hell you are. I think I saw Jason here somewhere. Where's Jason? Oh, it's lucky I called him. Ooh, it's lucky. They didn't put your name because I invited you at the last moment, right? He was over there doing some business in the White House, but you've been incredible in your position. Nobody knows more about taxes and finance than you do, so we appreciate it, right? Is that true? Howard, it's true. Thanks, Jason, great job, and you'll help out with that other matter. You make him so strong and powerful, right? Along with Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Michael Fauci de Where is Michael Good? Michael, how are you good? You'll help out over there. Okay, and Ambassador Ken. Howie. Ambassador, thank you, Ken, great job, Ken. I also want to recognize some of the countless industry leaders here today, including Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, you've done a good job, Brian, that's a big deal. Dave Ripley of Kraken, Jeremy Allaire of circle, it was a big day. Good job. Good job. Jeremy. Paolo ardino of tether, hello Paulo. Thank you. Paolo. Ryan McInerney of visa, that's a good company. Thank you. Chris Pavlov, Rumble, Chris, Chris, what happened to your location? Chris, you're always a front row guy. You're just being nice today. I think How's rumble doing good? Good. If Rumble is doing good, that means truth is doing good. Truth, that's great. You're doing a great job. Thank you. Chris, very much. Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. Vlad, thank you, Brad, thank you. Vlad, good Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, these are two smart, handsome guys. They got the whole package. They're of Gemini, but they have the whole pack. They have a lot of things, actually, but Gemini is just the one for today, right? They've got the all, they've got the look. They've got the the genius. Got plenty of cash. And it's great that you're on our side. You guys are great. I could never tell them apart, but their mother, can I ask? Can your mother tell you apart? And the answer is yes, easily, or is it tough for her? Easy? I think. Thank you very much. It's great to be with you. Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago, but this signing is a massive validation. And even before the signing, over the last year, year and a half, I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock, or just about more a couple of stocks that were pretty good, I will say. But you, you have, certainly, as an industry, gone up more than anybody. Nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time. But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two three years ago. So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America. This is going to make us stronger. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. You've made our dollar look really good and strong and powerful. It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country, and that's why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote. And they changed soon. You know, Biden's team, they changed tune right in the middle of the campaign. All of a sudden. They loved you guys. They dropped all charges. They did have, I got you guys out of so much trouble, because you remember, you remember they were very they treated you very unfairly, actually. So it's a great honor that we were involved and and it was, it was a tremendous amount of support that we got at the polls. We won. Think of it. We won every swing state. We won by millions of votes. We won the popular vote. We won the districts by 2700 districts too, by the way, every, every once in a while, that number can change, but it doesn't change by March, the map was almost totally red, and you guys were with us right from the beginning, exactly one year ago this month, many of you were with Nashville Tennessee. Do you remember that day? Right? It was a big day, Nashville Tennessee, and I became the first presidential candidate ever to address the Bitcoin Conference, and at this time and at that time, crypto members and founders were under relentless by the Biden administration, which is trying to crush your industry and crush you as people and go after vicious people don't realize the what Joe was doing guy but he was always known as a vicious guy. I guess if you're going to be in that you probably, if they're incompetent is better, right, because you don't want to have a vicious guy that's competent. If you did, I wouldn't be standing here today, but I pledge that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world, and that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further, you're going to do really well. And I'm so proud of what you've done in the last couple of years. And very important. On day one, I remember I did this, and I said this, and I mentioned this name, and I got the greatest applause of the whole campaign. We fired Joe Biden's, sec chair, Gary Gensler, you a speech. It was just a line in speech. And I said, and I will fire Gary guessing, the place exploded. I finished that one, and I said, What the hell did that guy do? Hatred there turned out as I got for rigged with everything, it turned out you were absolutely right. In his place, I appointed a visionary chairman who wants America to build the future and not block the future. He's going to be unbelievable. He'll go down as one of the greats and fall at me. The crypto guys, they said, everybody said, not only crypto every they all wanted Paul for the position, and he's a tough cookie too. He's just but they actually said, We don't care. We just think he's fair. All they learned was fairness. And they have somebody that you're really a champion of the street and you're a champion of the country, you do a fantastic job. I saw you interviewed the other night. I watched it two o'clock in the morning, this little thing called Sea Spanish. I don't know how many people were watching. Don't worry, you were in prime time too with that. But fantastic job. Absolutely so perfect for the job. Congratulations, Paul and Paul is here today among the commissioners, various commissioners, including pastor Pierce and Laura. Thank you very much, and thank you, Mark, wherever you may be here because of the thunderous applause, tremendous things about both of you. Thank you very much. My first week in office, I also established the first ever presidential Working Group on digital assets, and we have an executive director wiz behind a football player, right? Bo is a great football player, one of the better players in college football. So who would think that I know that Daniel a lot of things from he was a genuine player. I stopped the weaponization of government against crypto or Bitcoin, and we ended the lawless operation. Choke point 2.0 that was a bad operation, and I kept my promises to the community and granted a full presidential pardon to Ross Ulbrich. No idea how. I had no idea how important that day became. Was like a symbol, and his mother was unbelievable. His mother was an unbelievable woman, but it was so, so important to a certain group of people. And in the truly momentous Act last March, I signed an executive order establishing the US Strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as the United States Digital Asset stockpile, and that's all signed up, and With today's signing we're pushing even further into the exciting new frontier, just as I promised last year, the genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework To establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar backed stable coins. This could have been perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet. So a lot of people are saying that. I don't know. What do you guys think? Yes, we'll tell you many Americans are unaware that behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of days, many, many years out of days. You know that Paul and others are straightening it out the payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade using the state of the art crypto technology. Who would have thought we would have been saying that two years after I met you for the first time, the genius Act provides banks, businesses and financial institutions, a framework for issuing crypto assets back one for one, with real us, dollars, treasury bills and other cash equivalents, is really strengthening the dollar and giving the dollar great prominence. And you know, you have this little group called bricks. It's fading out fast, but bricks is they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar, and the standard of the dollar. And I said, anybody that's in the BRICS consortium of nations, we're going to tariff you 10% and they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up. Physically, no, no, we didn't want to. They didn't want to be tariffed today. It's amazing. Now we're not going to let the dollar slide. If we have a smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide. If you have a dummy that could happen, like the last one, he would have. You ever asked him about the dollar slide? He would have no idea. But we can't let that ever happen again. Consumers, vendors and people all over the world will then be able to use those stable coins for ultra low cost transactions that are cleared and settled in a matter of seconds, rather than weeks and months. And it's really an amazing thing with privacy, flexibility and decentralization of cash, this revolution has the potential to supercharge American economic growth and empower billions of people to study and transfer in US dollars. It's really all backed by the dollars. It's really a great thing. There'll be a lot of Democrat support. I have to tell you that I was shocked anytime we get one dem, but we had a tremendous amount of Democrat support, which we appreciated, which just shows you that you're doing the right thing. This will increase demand for US Treasuries, lower interest rates and secure the dollar's status as the world reserve currency for generations to come. The reserve currency is so important, you know, we lost that. That would be like losing a world war. We can never let anyone play games with us, and that's why, when I heard about this group from breaks six countries, basically, I hit them very, very hard, and they have a form. It will end very quickly. I will tell you to them. They won't. They won't be gone very long. I don't think they'll even they're virtually afraid to me, I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency in America will happen. You some of the Congress, men and women, and they wanted that so badly. You know, I was impressed that they knew what the hell it was to be honest. Please, sir, please the central bank, digital currency, will you have to make sure. And they say, What do you know about that? It's amazing the knowledge that people have made all of a sudden, we don't have problems with some of them. I said, we've already got it from the Fed, right from Congress and from an executive order. You don't need it a fourth house Sure. We have to get it. And it's but they knew their subject. I didn't, and we helped them out. My first week in office, I signed an executive order to ban the creation of a cbdc and the United States, and very soon, I look forward to signing legislation that will notify and ban the make it a permanent. Law put it in permanence. I'm also committed to selling animal crypto market structure legislation this year to grow the industry. We're going to be growing it even more, more than people ever thought. It's a really hot industry, and for a little while, two nights ago, we were really concerned, as we live short of bucks. I would say maybe we were about nine short, nine short at three in the morning. We were about four short at 330 in the morning, and we were in good shape at four o'clock in the morning. But the people, a few people, are fought harder for the bill that we're signing than some of the people here today. You have been unbelievable. It's our White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks and he has a show now become a show a couple of years ago. That's probably two years ago now in San Francisco, you kept it going a lot longer, and you got, is that still your eyes rated every show? Well, he knows what to say. Maybe 50 millions of people. They said, what's going on? But we had a great show. They said, You know, I had a really small decision. I get elected. I was running at that time, if I get elected, bring him into government and some of his work, unfortunately, we made a lot of money. They're very rich. He's a very rich media, but this is more important. Des, me too. It's like doesn't matter. This is much. I know how I talk about it all the time. How would you go back to those wonderful brokerage firm hire one or two people, and it's not the same. It's not the same as what you're doing, right? The biggest with one of the biggest deals in the world. Actually, the deal we're doing now in tariffs is the biggest where you ended up, the biggest deal ever made in history. It could be 1000 IBM, if you think of it. It's the biggest deal ever done. So it's hard to go back to a brokerage firm and $79,000 commission but I want to ask David, so David's been fantastic. He's done an incredible job. And I'd like to ask David come up say if you would. David Sacks Thank you, President Trump. It's a great Trump. It's a great, great honor to be here. And it's true that I never expected to work in government at all. And then everything changed after President Trump came on my podcast. And I, you know, I accepted this job as crypto as well because I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a President who really wants to get things done for the American people. And if anything, that's been an understatement. The first six months this administration have been more successful than any administration in American history. President Trump has worked at that tech speed we're used to working fast at Silicon Valley, but even this has passed for us in Silicon Valley, the speed of the team with President Trump's really incredible. And now today, you have another historic legislative achievement to make the United States a crypto capital of the world. This genius act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road. It will update arcade payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend US dollar anonymous, like you said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a US bank account, which will create trillions of dollars demand for US Treasuries. So that is the power of this bill, as you asked all the comments, this is a huge promise made and promise kept by President Trump. And there's just a few other people I'd like to thank, first, my family for being here. Thank you, fellow wise who President Trump mentioned, the director of our crypto Council. He released in a heavy lifting here, Tracy Johnson as well Harry and French Hill and all the congressman, senators, and we've already been met by President Trump, so I'll save the time, but it's really been hard for this is really a team effort, but most of all, to thank President Trump for accomplishing what nobody thought was possible. And it's true that just earlier this week, the media was reporting that this bill was dead. This bill was dead, and then the media didn't know one thing, that we have a secret weapon. We have a dealmakder in chief. And thanks to President Trump, he stepped in and save this bill, and it's because of your vision, your leadership, your determination, your skill that we're all here today. Donald Trump This is our superstar. She was the head of the Republican Party, and don't become beautiful two children, but she has been so good. She stepped into that position like there was nothing. That we want. And she said, Dad, I'd like to go home right now to my beautiful husband and my son and daughter, Rhett. They give you a fantastic job, and you work with a great gentleman too. He's doing a fantastic job. But I just want to thank you. I just need to stand here right now. I wanted to bring on. And thank you very much. Thank you. So under the Trump administration, as I just got back from Saudi Arabia, and we went to Qatar, we went to a number of countries, and I will tell you the the level of respect that this country has now is incredible. The UAE, I tell you what, we had a time there, but every leader said the same thing. They said, one year ago, your country was dead, and it said that way it was like supposed to be happy or insulted. But the truth is we were in deep trouble. But they said one year ago, your country was dead, and today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. And it's true, we have the hottest country in the world. We had a country where a laughing stock with the borders, people pouring in. Can you imagine last month, in the month of June, actually zero. Now I don't even believe that zero, if you have hundreds of 1000s pouring in, or get over seven zero, but they have it down to zero. And very liberal people take that particular Oh, so liberal. So they're not giving us any fairness in zero people coming through a border. Can you imagine that for literally hundreds of people? All over the world. They came from prisons, jails. They came from mental institutions, gang members. They were gangs. They came from all over the place, from every country they came from the Congo and Africa. A lot from the Congo. They came from South America. A lot of came from Venezuela. They emptied their jails into our country. Can you imagine? They allowed that empty de jails into our country, and they let them walk right into our country like perfect, 11,888 committed murder. 50% committed more than one person. They murdered more than one person, 50% of 11,088 and we had murderers, and we're getting them out, and Tom Holman and Kristi are doing a great job at Town Hallman. Okay, you see central casting or what, and it takes abuse, but they just, they just keep fighting, and they're winning, and we're winning in the courts, and we're winning everywhere. But we've got the hottest country in the world, and you're a big part of it. So the golden age of America is upon us, and with today, signing the beauty of crypto and crypto industry and US dollar working together because they really are hand in hand, because they'll be stronger and bigger and better than ever before. And I just want to thank everybody, some tremendous people in this room, and maybe you want to sign I'll ask some of our great senators and congressmen to come on up, some of the top crypto guys, please come on up, because you guys work very hard on this, and we'll sign this, and we'll get on to the next panel, and we'll win. But we're we're winning all over the world right now. It's not even close, not even to us, and We're going to keep it going. Thank you, everybody. You world, which is a big scandal that we're a Republican, it would really be a big it is One of the great standards. Thank you Very much.",Policy|Donald Trump|stablecoin bill|News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-18 23:59:10
48503189,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74836,1752883207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,No Asset Manager Has Filed for Shiba Inu (SHIB) ETF. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/no-asset-manager-has-filed-for-shiba-inu-etf-heres-why/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the largest meme-based cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, currently valued at over $9 billion. Yet, despite its size and active community, SHIB has not been the subject of any exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from mainstream asset managers. This absence is notable given the increasing interest in launching ETFs for even smaller and less established meme coins. ETF Filings Surge for Smaller Meme Coins Since January 2025, institutional interest in meme coin ETFs has accelerated. Dogecoin (DOGE) has led the trend, with multiple filings from asset managers including Rex Shares, Osprey Funds, and Bitwise. Grayscale submitted a proposal to convert its Dogecoin Trust into an ETF earlier this year, and 21Shares followed with a DOGE ETF application in April. Other tokens have also entered the ETF conversation. TRUMP coin was included in applications from Rex Shares and Osprey, and BONK, a Solana-based meme token, was listed in those same filings. By March, Canary Capital filed for a PENGU ETF, despite the token having a significantly lower market cap of just $1.9 billion. The rapid inclusion of lesser-known and lower-value tokens in ETF proposals has raised questions about SHIB’s absence, especially considering its significantly stronger market position. Lack of Transparent Leadership May Be a Barrier One of the key differences between SHIB and its ETF-listed peers may lie in its leadership structure. While Dogecoin operates as a decentralized project with no central figurehead, and TRUMP coin benefits from the public persona of the U.S. president, Shiba Inu’s development team remains anonymous. The lead figure behind SHIB, known pseudonymously as Shytoshi Kusama, has chosen to maintain their privacy despite taking on a visible role within the community. For regulatory-conscious asset managers, this lack of identifiable leadership may present concerns regarding project oversight and accountability, two factors that are often considered when evaluating ETF candidates. Absence of High-Profile Endorsements Another factor limiting institutional interest in SHIB may be its lack of prominent public endorsements. DOGE has benefited from the vocal support of Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, while TRUMP coin is explicitly tied to Donald Trump. These associations have played a significant role in increasing visibility and driving investor attention. SHIB, on the other hand, does not enjoy similar backing from well-known figures. Its popularity has grown primarily through grassroots momentum, which, although powerful, may not be as appealing to ETF issuers who often rely on mainstream media visibility and public sentiment to gauge investment potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Complex Ecosystem and Project Maturity Shiba Inu also differs from simpler tokens like DOGE in terms of its technical infrastructure. It has developed a broader ecosystem, including the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, Shibarium (a Layer 2 blockchain), NFTs, and plans for a metaverse. While this signals innovation, it may also complicate its suitability for a traditional ETF, which typically favors clear, singular use cases. Moreover, some of SHIB’s initiatives are still under development. Its tokenomics, such as the token burn mechanism and broader DeFi integration, are ongoing, which may lead asset managers to conclude that the project has not yet reached a mature or stable enough phase for ETF inclusion. Despite being the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, Shiba Inu has not yet attracted the attention of institutional ETF issuers. A combination of anonymous leadership, absence of celebrity affiliation, and a complex, evolving ecosystem may be contributing factors. Unless SHIB improves its institutional appeal, either through increased transparency or greater mainstream visibility, it may continue to be overlooked in the current wave of meme coin ETF applications.

48503193,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=338561,1752883218,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Brand-New Ethereum Ecosystem Altcoin Rips by Over 80% on First Day of Trading After Coinbase and Binance Listings,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/18/brand-new-ethereum-ecosystem-altcoin-rips-by-nearly-80-on-first-day-of-trading-after-coinbase-and-binance-listings/,"A brand-new Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem altcoin is skyrocketing after immediately securing listings on Binance and Coinbase. Caldera ( ERA ) is an application that allows the development of ETH-based layer-2 scaling solutions. The new ERA token launched on Thursday surged over 80% in just hours before continuing its rally to an all-time high of $2. ERA has given up some of its gains and is trading at $1.56 at time of writing. Coinbase listed the asset with an experimental label on Thursday. The top US crypto exchange uses the experimental label for tokens that pose certain risks, such as price swings and canceled orders, because of lower trading volume and availability. Binance, the largest crypto exchange platform in the world, had already announced the day before that it would support the asset via its HODLer Airdrops program. The HODLer Airdrops program, launched in 2024, rewards investors holding BNB with crypto assets based on previous snapshots of their balances. Caldera, which refers to itself as “the internet of rollups,” says on its official website that its metalayer enables developers to launch interoperable rollups – layer-2 blockchains designed to scale Ethereum by batching and compressing transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Ethereum. Caldera’s market cap has already surged past $263 million on its first day of trading.

Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market analytics, BTC soared to $118,012.31 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples of optimism throughout the entire financial landscape. This remarkable achievement isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s enduring strength, growing adoption, and its potential as a global store of value. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, this latest milestone prompts a crucial question: what exactly is driving this monumental rise, and what does it signify for the future of finance? Understanding the Monumental BTC Surge: What Does $118,000 Mean? When we talk about a BTC surge past such a formidable level, it’s essential to grasp the sheer significance. Reaching $118,000 is not merely an incremental gain; it often indicates a breakthrough past major psychological resistance levels or even, depending on the market cycle, a new all-time high. This specific price point reflects renewed investor confidence and substantial capital inflow. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements are characterized by periods of consolidation followed by explosive rallies, often fueled by a confluence of factors. This latest move could signal the beginning of another significant leg up in its long-term trajectory. It underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and their growing integration into traditional financial systems. Consider the journey Bitcoin has taken since its inception. From humble beginnings to now commanding such a high valuation, each milestone, especially a significant one like $118,000, reinforces its position as a leading financial innovation. This price action serves as a powerful indicator of demand outstripping supply, a fundamental economic principle driving value. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Rally? The ascent of Bitcoin price to new heights is rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s typically a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, institutional interest, supply dynamics, and evolving market sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. Institutional Embrace: The Big Players Are In One of the most significant catalysts behind recent Bitcoin rallies has been the growing embrace from institutional investors and large corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously added substantial amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a superior treasury reserve asset. Furthermore, the approval and success of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have opened the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs represent a massive pipeline for capital from pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, providing a level of legitimacy and accessibility previously unavailable. This institutional demand creates consistent buying pressure, underpinning the rally. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Inflation and Interest Rates In an era of fluctuating inflation rates and evolving central bank policies, Bitcoin’s narrative as a ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against inflation has gained considerable traction. As traditional currencies face inflationary pressures, investors seek alternative stores of value that are decentralized and supply-capped. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, presents an attractive option. Additionally, a dovish stance by central banks, leading to lower interest rates, can make yield-bearing traditional assets less appealing, pushing investors towards higher-growth, risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Supply Dynamics: Halving and Scarcity Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event approximately every four years, which cuts the reward for mining new blocks by half. This mechanism is hardcoded into Bitcoin’s protocol, ensuring its scarcity. Each halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, thereby increasing its inherent scarcity over time. Post-halving periods have historically been followed by significant bull runs, as reduced supply meets growing demand. While the most recent halving might be some time ago, its long-term effects on supply dynamics continue to influence the market’s perception of Bitcoin’s value. Retail Resurgence: The People’s Power While institutional money provides significant buying power, the collective interest of retail investors should not be underestimated. Social media trends, mainstream news coverage, and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) often drive substantial retail participation. As Bitcoin’s price climbs, it captures headlines, attracting new individual investors who see the potential for significant returns. This grassroots interest, coupled with easy access through various trading platforms, adds another layer of demand to the market. Navigating the Crypto Market: Key Dynamics and Investor Sentiment The current Crypto market landscape is complex, influenced by a myriad of technical indicators, on-chain data, and prevailing sentiment. For those participating or considering entry, understanding these dynamics is paramount. Technical Outlook: Key Levels and Indicators From a technical analysis perspective, breaking past $118,000 is a highly bullish signal. It suggests that previous resistance has now flipped into support, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. Traders often look at key moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and trading volumes to gauge the strength and sustainability of a rally. High volume accompanying a price surge indicates strong conviction from buyers. Conversely, a lack of volume on a price rise might suggest a weaker rally prone to correction. Table: Key Market Indicators to Watch Indicator What it Tells Us Implication for Bitcoin’s $118K Surge Trading Volume Strength of price movement High volume confirms strong buying interest Relative Strength Index (RSI) Overbought/Oversold conditions Indicates if the rally is sustainable or due for a pullback Moving Averages Trend direction and support/resistance Price above key MAs confirms bullish trend On-Chain Metrics Network activity, whale movements Growing adoption and accumulation by large holders On-Chain Metrics: What the Data Says Beyond traditional charts, on-chain analytics provide deeper insights into Bitcoin’s network health and investor behavior. Metrics such as exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and miner accumulation patterns can reveal underlying trends. For instance, decreasing Bitcoin balances on exchanges suggest investors are moving their holdings to cold storage, indicating a long-term holding sentiment rather than an intent to sell. Increased active addresses signal growing network utility and adoption. These data points often provide a more fundamental view of market strength than mere price action. The Volatility Factor: A Double-Edged Sword While the surge past $118,000 is exciting, it’s crucial to remember Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. Sharp price swings, both upwards and downwards, are common. This volatility presents opportunities for significant gains but also carries substantial risks. Investors must be prepared for potential corrections and understand that not every upward move is sustainable in the short term. Prudent risk management and a long-term perspective are essential when dealing with such dynamic assets. Investing in Digital Assets: Opportunities and Challenges Ahead The burgeoning world of Digital assets offers unparalleled opportunities but also presents unique challenges that investors must navigate carefully. The recent Bitcoin rally highlights both sides of this coin. Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin and Digital Assets Diversification: Bitcoin often exhibits low correlation with traditional assets, offering portfolio diversification benefits. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement. Technological Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the underlying blockchain technology, which is poised to revolutionize various industries. Global Accessibility: Digital assets can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection, fostering financial inclusion. Challenges and Risks Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, with potential for new rules that could impact the market. Market Manipulation: The relatively smaller size of the crypto market compared to traditional markets can make it more susceptible to large whale movements or coordinated pumps and dumps. Security Risks: While blockchain technology is secure, individual investors face risks from hacks, phishing scams, and loss of private keys. High Volatility: As mentioned, rapid price swings can lead to significant losses if not managed properly. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering investing or already holding Bitcoin, a few actionable insights can help navigate the current market. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Understand your risk tolerance and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly regardless of price, can help mitigate volatility. Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk profile, can also be a sound strategy. Staying informed about market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is key to long-term success. Expert Market Analysis: What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin? Following this impressive surge, the question on everyone’s mind is: what does the future hold for Bitcoin? Expert Market analysis suggests several potential scenarios, but certainty remains elusive in such a dynamic market. Potential Resistance Levels and Price Targets With Bitcoin crossing $118,000, analysts will be eyeing the next psychological and technical resistance levels. These could be round numbers like $120,000, $125,000, or even higher if the bullish momentum continues. Fibonacci extensions and historical price action are often used to project potential future targets. A strong break and sustained trading above these levels would reinforce the bullish narrative, potentially leading to an accelerated rally. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Bullish Scenario: Continued institutional adoption, further ETF approvals globally, favorable regulatory clarity, and sustained macroeconomic pressures on fiat currencies could propel Bitcoin to even greater heights. A narrative of Bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset or a widely accepted medium of exchange would solidify its long-term growth potential. Bearish Scenario: Conversely, unexpected regulatory crackdowns in major economies, a significant global economic recession, or a major security breach affecting a prominent exchange could trigger a substantial correction. Any loss of confidence in the underlying technology or a shift in the macroeconomic environment could also dampen enthusiasm. Ultimately, the trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on a delicate balance of these forces. While the current momentum is strong, a cautious and informed approach remains the best strategy for investors. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets Bitcoin’s spectacular rise above $118,000 is more than just a price milestone; it’s a powerful affirmation of its growing stature in the global financial system. This BTC surge is a culmination of increasing institutional interest, favorable macroeconomic conditions, inherent scarcity, and renewed retail enthusiasm. While the path ahead for the Crypto market will undoubtedly involve its share of volatility and challenges, the underlying trends suggest a continued expansion and integration of Digital assets into mainstream finance. For those seeking to understand and participate in this revolution, staying informed and exercising prudence, guided by sound Market analysis , will be paramount. The future of finance is rapidly evolving, and Bitcoin continues to lead the charge, promising an exciting, albeit unpredictable, journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused Bitcoin’s recent surge past $118,000? The recent surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased institutional adoption (like Bitcoin ETFs), macroeconomic conditions such as inflation concerns driving demand for inflation hedges, Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity due to its halving mechanism, and renewed interest from retail investors. 2. Is $118,000 an all-time high for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin has seen significant rallies, whether $118,000 is an all-time high depends on the specific market cycle and historical data at the time of this surge. However, it represents a highly significant psychological and technical milestone, indicating strong bullish momentum and breaking past previous resistance levels. 3. How does this surge impact the broader crypto market? Bitcoin’s strong performance often acts as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market. A significant Bitcoin rally typically creates positive sentiment, leading to an ‘altcoin season’ where other cryptocurrencies also experience price increases, though often with higher volatility. 4. What are the risks of investing in Bitcoin at this price? Investing in Bitcoin, especially after a significant surge, carries risks such as high volatility (potential for rapid price corrections), regulatory uncertainty, security risks (e.g., exchange hacks, personal key loss), and the inherent speculative nature of the asset. It’s crucial to understand these risks before investing. 5. Should I invest in Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should always be based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and thorough research. While the current rally is exciting, it’s advisable to avoid making impulsive decisions. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging and consult with a financial advisor if unsure. 6.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Baile recently noted that he would rather banks create a tokenized central bank deposit than a new private stablecoin. According to JPMorgan analysts, this is part of a larger breaking wave of regulation worldwide toward tokenized deposits , a more holistic and secure method, the authors claim, of modernizing finance. Tokenized deposit, a digital analogue of a conventional bank deposit, is released within the blockchain executor, and information is reflected in it. They preserve the protections encoded in the existing financial system, such as deposit insurance, compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, and access to central bank emergency funding. On the other hand, tokenized deposits imply that some parts of the benefits of the blockchain are already in place, such as time-to-settlement, visibility, programmability, and the possibility to interact with smart contracts. Authorities endorse non-bearer digital bank money According to JPMorgan analysts, there are two tokenized deposit types: bearer and non-bearer. A bearer tokenised deposit may be transferred and traded among parties. But as with anything else in the market, their value can go down, too, based on the interplay of supply and demand, or the risk of the issuer. This volatility is a menace to financial calm. It violates the central value proposition of “singleness of money” — the belief that all money in circulation within a nation’s borders can safely be exchanged for a stable quantity of goods and services. Non-bearer tokenized deposits, on the contrary, are non-transferable. They facilitate two-bank-to-two-bank, straight-through settlement of transactions, in central bank money, at one-to-one value. According to JPMorgan, the system helps protect the financial system’s integrity and prevents value differentials between the different forms of money. The analysts pointed to a paper, “Stablecoins versus tokenized deposits: implications for the singleness of money,” released in 2023, by economists Rod Garratt and Hyun Song Shin. But more ominously, the paper warns that transferable tokens, whether stablecoins or bearer deposits, “tend towards pricing error.” According to JPMorgan, non-bearer tokenized deposits offer greater certainty and interoperability within the banking sector. Their design ensures that when funds are transferred between banks, they retain their full face value—much like a standard electronic bank transfer—without any reduction or “haircut.” Traders favor stablecoins for liquidity Stablecoins have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny but remain powerful in the crypto economy . With high liquidity and universal availability on all markets, their simple movable nature attracts cryptos, Decentralized Exchange (DEX) traders, and remittances worldwide. Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) remain the top stablecoins by market cap. They represent hundreds of billions of dollars daily across crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, and remittance corridors. However, JPMorgan analysts said stablecoins typically don’t take money away from the banking system. Their reserves, which they have lent domestically, typically in short-term government securities such as United States Treasury bills, stay within the traditional finance channels. It’s the money market fund model, in which deposits are collected and invested in low-risk, short-term instruments. The JPMorgan analysts also asked if commercial banks would have cheaper issuance of stablecoins. A 2023 consultation paper from the Bank of England proposed that any bank issuing stablecoins could be held to back them with fully reserved deposits at the central bank, and these deposits might not pay interest. “All of that would put serious constraints on a bank’s ability to price to yield on customer deposits, as a stablecoin would be a very unappetizing business proposition under those rules. In the United States, meanwhile, regulatory sentiment remains friendlier to stablecoins. It will be law shortly after President Donald Trump signs the new GENIUS Act. Under the Act, banks could create stablecoins and incorporate them into the existing payment system. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Before he'd signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law after it swept through both chambers of Congress with major bipartisan votes, Trump basked in cheers and thanked several industry leaders in the East Room audience, including Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Outside, the executives talked about next steps. Ardoino amplified his plans for moving some of his global business into the U.S., where he said the focus will be on institutional users for a new token, but he added that he also intends to have Tether's stablecoin powerhouse USDT comply with the GENIUS Act as a foreign issuer. That'll mean a new auditing regime and changes to the vast reserves the company already maintains, which he says will require ""an adjustment"" but noted — with a smile — that his company ""made $13 billion in profits "" last year and will be able to manage it. ""Tether will comply with the GENIUS Act,"" he said, adding that the company will get to work now meeting the foreign-issuer standards. He said Tether has three years to work on getting into the U.S., and the company intends to manage two different versions of its stablecoins domestically — a jurisdiction it currently steers clear of. The U.S.-centric coin — a second flavor of Tether that hasn't yet been hatched — is envisioned as serving a very different purpose. ""Institutions are used to super efficient markets, and they will count the single basis point; and so, for that reason, we need to build something that is proper for this new market,"" he told CoinDesk in the interview. The product built for those institutions will ""focus on payments and high, high, high efficiency."" Circle's Allaire For Circle — a public company based in the U.S. — CEO Allaire said that the GENIUS Act ""really enshrines into law Circle's way of doing business."" ""We have always been trusted, transparent; we've been publicly audited for five years,"" he said. But he noted that the U.S. landscape for stablecoins has already been rapidly changing in anticipation of the new law, with ""major technology companies, major commerce firms, financial institutions"" lining up to participate, which he said he welcomes. ""Once you have that federal law, it really is a green light to all these types of institutions to know that they can depend on this technology, build on this technology, integrated into how they store and move money into other innovations that can be done with smart contracts and programabilities,"" Allaire said. To do business in the U.S., the GENIUS Act demands that extremely limited, highly liquid assets — mostly U.S. Treasuries — will back issuers' coins dollar-for-dollar, and it requires a stringent auditing process to constantly ensure that the assets are there. Tether's Ardoino said his company's new chief financial officer , Simon McWilliams, ""started to work"" to land a ""Big Four"" audit firm — one of the global leaders in financial auditing — which has only been a possibility because of the recent support from the Trump administration. His company has a special relationship with the administration , too, in which the former CEO of Tether's chief U.S. reserves manager, Cantor Fitzgerald, is Trump's secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick. Ardoino's appearance at the White House and direct thanks from the president is a sharp reversal of Tether's U.S. history, in which it settled investigations with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and New York Department of Financial Services. But past reports that the company remained under further U.S. investigation never developed into actions against the company or its officers. Trump boasted repeatedly on Friday that he dug the crypto industry out of legal trouble with his predecessor's administration. Coinbase's Armstrong A company that's developed into a lobbying and political giant in Washington in a short period, Coinbase, was represented in Trump's front row at the White House event, and CEO Brian Armstrong called the new law the ""beginning of a big financial revolution in the U.S."" Armstrong has spent a lot of time and effort, though, on the next major legislation pursued by the industry: a bill that sets regulations for crypto markets in the U.S. ""One down; one to go,"" he said. ""We've got to get the market structure bill through, as well. Seven percent of crypto market cap is stabecoins, so that's a very important first step. The other 93% is going to be addressed by that market structure bill."" In the minutes before passing the GENIUS Act, the House of Representatives also voted 294-134 to send its market structure legislation known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to the Senate with a resounding bipartisan result. Armstrong's company has been one of the primary backers of political action committee Fairshake, a towering super PAC that's spent incredible amounts of money congressional races, supporting candidates who commit to pro-crypto legislation. After success in dozens of races last year, Coinbase's largesse continued with another recent $25 million addition that brought Fairshake's war chest to $141 million well before the genuine start of next year's races. ""We feel like it's important to stand up for our customers' rights, and the job's not done yet,"" he said. Even after the market structure bill, he said, ""I'm sure there'll be other things that come up in the future."" Armstrong said that Trump's chief crypto adviser, David Sacks, has assured the industry that he's serious about a recently discussed deadline for the next congressional effort: September 30. For his part, President Trump talked about the GENIUS Act as if he'd already accomplished the monumental task of lifting U.S. crypto into place to modernize the financial system. ""Under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade, using the state-of-the-art crypto technology,"" the president said before sitting at a table to sign the bill, mobbed by Republican lawmakers and crypto executives. ""Tomorrow is a new day, a new era,"" Ardoino said after the event. ""We are very proud to be here and to be called out directly from the president, because it is the testament of all the good work that our team has done for the last years.""

This initiative suggests a strategic foray into a more centralized domain, specifically planning a launch on Kraken’s Ink network. This move, as cited by DL News from a DAO proposal published on July 17, represents a significant departure from Aave’s traditionally decentralized ethos and has ignited a crucial debate within the crypto community. What’s Driving Aave DAO’s Bold Foray onto Kraken Ink? The core of this ambitious proposal involves deploying a licensed, centralized version of the Aave codebase onto Kraken’s layer-2 Ink blockchain. This isn’t just a simple port; it’s a strategic decision to create a distinct, managed platform. The new entity will operate under a different name, managed directly by the Ink Foundation, with a portion of the generated revenue flowing back to the Aave DAO . This arrangement signals a willingness to explore hybrid models that bridge the gap between the wild west of DeFi and the regulated world of traditional finance. Several factors could be motivating this bold strategic shift: Regulatory Clarity: The DeFi space has long grappled with regulatory uncertainty. By operating on a centralized, licensed platform like Kraken Ink, Aave could potentially achieve greater regulatory compliance, making its services more palatable to institutional investors and traditional financial entities. Institutional Adoption: Traditional finance (TradFi) institutions often shy away from the perceived risks and lack of oversight in pure DeFi. A centralized version, backed by a reputable exchange like Kraken, could open doors to a vast pool of institutional capital, bringing new liquidity and users to the Aave ecosystem. User Experience: While DeFi offers unparalleled freedom, it often comes with a steep learning curve and complex user interfaces. A centralized platform on Kraken Ink could offer a more streamlined, user-friendly experience, potentially attracting a broader, less crypto-native audience. Revenue Diversification: The proposed revenue share arrangement provides a new, potentially stable income stream for the Aave DAO, diversifying its financial base beyond just protocol fees from the decentralized Aave. Navigating the Centralized Aave Frontier: Benefits and Potential Pitfalls The concept of a centralized Aave is inherently paradoxical for many in the DeFi community. However, understanding both the upsides and the potential downsides is crucial for appreciating the full scope of this proposal. The Strategic Benefits: This move could unlock significant growth avenues: Expanded Market Reach: By operating within a regulated framework on a reputable platform like Kraken, Aave could tap into a much larger user base, including institutional players and retail users who prefer regulated environments. Enhanced Security & Compliance: Centralized platforms typically offer more robust security measures and adhere to stringent KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) regulations, which can build trust and reduce certain types of financial risk. Innovation & Experimentation: The Ink network could serve as a testing ground for new features and products that might be difficult to implement on the main decentralized Aave protocol due to governance complexities or regulatory hurdles. The Inherent Challenges and Concerns: Despite the potential benefits, the proposal faces significant scrutiny: Erosion of Decentralization Ethos: The most prominent concern is the perceived compromise of DeFi’s core principle – decentralization. Aave was built on the promise of censorship resistance and permissionless access, which a centralized version inherently contradicts. Community Backlash: Many within the Aave community are staunch proponents of decentralization. This move could lead to internal dissent and potentially alienate a segment of its loyal user base. Single Points of Failure: Centralized systems are typically more vulnerable to single points of failure, whether due to technical glitches, regulatory pressure, or malicious attacks, compared to distributed decentralized networks. Brand Dilution: There’s a risk that launching a centralized version could dilute the Aave brand, blurring the lines between its core decentralized offering and this new, distinct entity. How Does This Impact the Future of DeFi Lending? The Aave DAO’s proposal could be a bellwether for the broader DeFi lending sector. It suggests a potential shift in strategy for established DeFi protocols, where a hybrid model might become increasingly common. Instead of a strict dichotomy between decentralized and centralized finance, we might see more protocols exploring avenues to bridge the two worlds. This move could: Accelerate Mainstream Adoption: If successful, it could demonstrate a viable path for DeFi technologies to gain widespread acceptance in regulated financial markets, paving the way for other protocols. Redefine ‘DeFi’: The lines between DeFi and TradFi might become increasingly blurred, leading to a new category of ‘CeDeFi’ (Centralized Decentralized Finance) or ‘Hybrid Finance’ solutions that leverage blockchain technology while operating within existing regulatory frameworks. Increase Competition: As more regulated blockchain platforms emerge, the competition for institutional and retail users seeking compliant DeFi-like services will intensify. Exploring the Kraken Ink Blockchain Network: A Strategic Choice Kraken’s choice as the launchpad for this centralized Aave initiative is far from arbitrary. The blockchain network , Ink, developed by Kraken, is a Layer-2 solution designed to offer high throughput, low fees, and potentially enhanced regulatory compliance, making it an attractive environment for a centralized DeFi product. Key aspects of Kraken Ink: Layer-2 Scalability: Built to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently, addressing one of the common challenges faced by many Layer-1 blockchains. Kraken’s Reputation: As one of the oldest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken brings a significant level of trust, security expertise, and a large existing user base to the table. This reputation is invaluable for a centralized financial product. Focus on Compliance: While details are still emerging, Ink is likely designed with regulatory considerations in mind, which aligns perfectly with Aave’s apparent goal of attracting institutional players. This collaboration highlights a growing trend where established crypto exchanges are not just facilitating trading but are also building their own blockchain infrastructure to support a new generation of financial products. Actionable Insights for Aave Community and Crypto Investors For those invested in or following the Aave ecosystem and the broader crypto market, this proposal demands close attention. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor DAO Governance: Keep a close eye on the Aave DAO’s voting process. The outcome will significantly impact Aave’s future trajectory and its brand perception. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between the existing decentralized Aave protocol and the proposed centralized version on Ink. They are distinct entities, even if sharing a codebase. Assess Risk & Reward: Evaluate how this move might affect Aave’s tokenomics, user base, and overall market position. Consider the long-term implications for both decentralized and centralized crypto offerings. Diversify Your Portfolio: As the crypto landscape evolves with new hybrid models, it’s prudent to diversify investments across various protocols and platforms that align with your risk tolerance and philosophical stance on decentralization. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Aave and DeFi’s Evolution The Aave DAO proposal to launch a centralized version on Kraken’s Ink network marks a truly pivotal moment, not just for Aave, but for the entire DeFi ecosystem. It’s a bold experiment that challenges the conventional wisdom of decentralization while seeking to unlock new frontiers of growth and adoption. While it presents compelling opportunities for regulatory clarity, institutional engagement, and broader market reach, it also raises fundamental questions about the core tenets of DeFi and the potential for brand identity shifts. The success or failure of this venture will undoubtedly provide valuable lessons, shaping the future trajectory of how decentralized protocols interact with centralized entities and traditional finance.

While Bitcoin often steals the headlines, another digital asset is steadily gaining ground in the boardrooms of publicly traded companies: Ethereum . In a move that signals a significant shift in institutional investment strategies, Sharplink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed entity, has announced an extraordinary plan to bolster its Ethereum reserves, signaling a new era for corporate treasury management. Unveiling Sharplink Gaming’s Strategic Move into Ethereum Imagine a company, publicly traded on one of the world’s most prestigious stock exchanges, deciding to allocate billions of dollars not to traditional assets, but to a volatile, decentralized digital currency. That’s precisely what Sharplink Gaming is doing. The company, known for its strategic accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) as a core reserve asset, recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to an additional $5 billion in common stock. The sole purpose? To fund further ETH purchases for its corporate treasury. This isn’t a small, speculative play. This is a monumental commitment. According to reports, this prospectus supplement elevates the total stock sale limit under their existing sales agreement to a staggering $6 billion. This comprises $1 billion from a prior prospectus and the fresh $5 billion infusion. Such a substantial financial maneuver by Sharplink Gaming underscores a growing confidence among some corporate leaders in the long-term value and strategic importance of digital assets like Ethereum. But why Ethereum? While Bitcoin is often lauded as ‘digital gold’ due to its scarcity and store-of-value properties, Ethereum offers a different value proposition. It’s the foundational layer for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the broader Web3 movement. For a company like Sharplink Gaming, which operates in a dynamic, tech-forward industry, aligning with the leading smart contract platform could be seen as a strategic move to future-proof its operations and potentially participate in the burgeoning digital economy. Why the Colossal Stock Sale? Fueling Corporate Treasury with ETH The decision to raise capital through a significant stock sale to acquire digital assets is not taken lightly by any publicly traded company. It involves careful consideration of shareholder value, market perception, and risk management. For Sharplink Gaming, this move suggests a profound belief in Ethereum’s potential, not just as an investment, but as a strategic component of its corporate treasury . Historically, corporate treasuries primarily focused on managing cash, short-term investments, and liquidity, often in low-yield traditional assets. However, in an era of persistent inflation concerns and a search for alternative alpha, companies are increasingly exploring non-traditional assets. Here’s why some companies are looking at crypto: Inflation Hedge: Digital assets, particularly those with capped supplies or strong utility, are seen by some as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding crypto provides diversification away from traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing new types of risk). Potential for High Returns: While volatile, the crypto market has historically offered significant returns, attracting companies willing to take on calculated risks for potentially higher yields. Innovation & Future-Proofing: For tech-centric companies, holding crypto can signal an embrace of innovation and a readiness to engage with the future of finance and technology. Balance Sheet Strength: If crypto holdings appreciate significantly, they can bolster a company’s balance sheet, enhancing its financial standing and investor confidence. Sharplink Gaming’s strategy is reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s pioneering Bitcoin acquisition, which set a precedent for corporate crypto adoption. However, Sharplink’s focus on Ethereum highlights a growing appreciation for ETH’s unique utility and its role in the decentralized internet. By using a stock sale, Sharplink is effectively inviting investors to participate in its crypto strategy, demonstrating transparency and a clear intent. The Broader Implications of Institutional Crypto Adoption Sharplink Gaming’s bold step is not an isolated incident; rather, it’s a powerful indicator of the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . When a Nasdaq-listed company commits such a substantial sum to a digital asset, it sends ripples throughout the financial world. What does this mean for the broader market? Increased Legitimacy and Acceptance: Each time a major institution or publicly traded company invests in crypto, it adds a layer of legitimacy to the asset class. This can help chip away at the skepticism that still surrounds cryptocurrencies in some traditional financial circles, paving the way for wider acceptance. Market Impact: Large-scale purchases by institutions can have a significant impact on market dynamics. While the $5 billion will likely be deployed over time to avoid excessive price disruption, such sustained buying pressure for Ethereum could contribute to its price stability and growth over the long term. It also signals strong demand from a new class of buyers. Regulatory Scrutiny and Clarity: As more institutions enter the crypto space, regulators are compelled to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks. This increased institutional participation could accelerate the development of comprehensive regulatory clarity, which is crucial for the crypto market’s maturation and continued growth. Shifting Investment Paradigms: The move by Sharplink Gaming encourages other companies to re-evaluate their own treasury strategies. It sparks conversations in boardrooms about the potential benefits and risks of incorporating digital assets into corporate balance sheets. This could lead to a broader paradigm shift in how companies manage their capital and reserves. Sharplink Gaming’s substantial investment in Ethereum signals a growing trend of corporate interest in digital assets. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto Investment While the allure of digital assets like Ethereum is undeniable, especially for those seeking innovative investment avenues, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. For a company like Sharplink Gaming, venturing into significant crypto investment brings both immense opportunities and considerable risks that must be carefully managed. Key Challenges: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Price swings of 10-20% or more in a single day are not uncommon, which can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet and reported earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in laws or interpretations can have profound effects on the market and the legality of holding certain assets. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss. This necessitates sophisticated cold storage solutions and multi-signature wallets. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for cryptocurrencies are complex and can vary by jurisdiction, making it challenging for companies to accurately report their holdings and valuations. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, some traditional investors may view significant crypto holdings as overly risky or speculative, potentially impacting stock performance. Compelling Opportunities: Long-Term Growth Potential: Proponents believe that Ethereum, as the backbone of Web3, has substantial long-term growth potential as the digital economy expands. Technological Alignment: For tech companies, holding ETH can facilitate direct participation in decentralized ecosystems, enabling future innovation or service offerings built on blockchain. Signaling Innovation: A bold move into crypto can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative, attracting a new generation of investors and talent. Liquidity: Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are highly liquid, allowing for relatively easy entry and exit from positions, though large-scale sales can still impact prices. Sharplink Gaming’s move is a testament to their calculated assessment of these factors, indicating a belief that the long-term opportunities outweigh the short-term challenges. Their strategy will undoubtedly be watched closely by other corporate entities contemplating similar ventures. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Corporate Finance Sharplink Gaming’s decision to add a monumental $5 billion to its stock sale plan for Ethereum purchases marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This isn’t just another investment; it’s a clear declaration from a Nasdaq-listed company that Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are becoming integral components of modern corporate treasury strategies. It reflects a growing conviction among forward-thinking businesses that digital assets are not merely speculative tools but strategic reserves capable of enhancing financial resilience and unlocking new avenues for growth in an increasingly digital economy. This bold move by Sharplink Gaming serves as a powerful testament to the increasing institutional confidence in the crypto space. It reinforces the narrative that digital assets are maturing and gaining mainstream acceptance, paving the way for more companies to follow suit. As the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, Sharplink Gaming is positioning itself at the forefront of this transformative shift, potentially inspiring a new wave of corporate engagement with the crypto frontier.

The digital asset landscape is constantly shifting, driven by a myriad of factors, not least of which is the collective psyche of its participants. At the heart of understanding this ebb and flow lies a crucial indicator: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping investors gauge whether euphoria or panic reigns supreme. As of July 19, the index has climbed to a notable 74, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto journey? Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index distills complex market data into a single, digestible score: 0-24 (Extreme Fear): This indicates that investors are highly worried. Such periods often present buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the crowd. 25-49 (Fear): While not as intense as extreme fear, this still suggests a cautious or bearish outlook among market participants. 50-74 (Greed): This is where the market currently sits at 74. It signifies growing optimism and a strong buying interest. However, it can also be a precursor to market corrections if euphoria becomes excessive. 75-100 (Extreme Greed): At this level, investors are often overly confident and may be making impulsive decisions. This phase can signal that the market is overheated and due for a pullback. The index aims to prevent investors from making irrational decisions driven by emotional responses. When the market is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it could be a sign of a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Conversely, when the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might be a signal to take profits. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: The Six Pillars of the Index How does the index arrive at its score? It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six key market factors, each weighted differently to reflect its influence on overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding these components is essential to truly grasp the index’s insights: Factor Weighting Explanation Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market. High buying volumes in a positive market suggest greedy behavior. Social Media 15% Scans social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency, assessing the sentiment of discussions. Surveys 15% Polls thousands of crypto investors each week to gather their direct perceptions of the market. (Note: This factor is currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. A rising dominance can indicate a shift of funds from altcoins to Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven in uncertain times. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search data for crypto-related terms. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while “buy Bitcoin” suggests greed. Each factor contributes to the final score, providing a holistic view of the market’s emotional state. The current reading of 74 suggests a strong collective belief in upward price movement, but it’s vital to look beyond just the number. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Implications for Investor Sentiment The index’s climb to 74 and its consistent presence in the ‘Greed’ zone reflects a significant shift in investor sentiment . After periods of fear or uncertainty, a move into greed suggests renewed confidence and a willingness to take on more risk. This can be driven by positive news, a sustained price rally, or a general feeling of optimism spreading through the community. However, the ‘Greed’ zone, especially as it approaches ‘Extreme Greed’, comes with a caveat. Historically, periods of extreme euphoria have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is buying, and prices are soaring, the market can become overextended. This is when the fear of missing out (FOMO) kicks in, pushing even cautious investors to enter the market at potentially unsustainable levels. Smart investors often view extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution, rather than to jump in headfirst. The Crucial Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics One of the intriguing components of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Bitcoin dominance . This metric measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Why is it important? Flight to Safety: When Bitcoin dominance rises, it often indicates that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into Bitcoin. This can happen during periods of uncertainty, as Bitcoin is generally perceived as a more stable and established asset compared to smaller, more volatile altcoins. Altcoin Season Indicator: Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance often signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where altcoins gain significant value relative to Bitcoin. This typically occurs during periods of high market confidence, as investors become more willing to take on higher risks for potentially higher rewards in the altcoin market. Impact on Index: A high Bitcoin dominance might contribute to a ‘Fear’ reading if it suggests a flight from riskier assets, while a lower dominance might contribute to ‘Greed’ if it indicates broad market confidence in altcoins. The current 10% weighting reflects its importance in gauging where capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the overall index provides a deeper understanding of underlying market movements and investor sentiment . Understanding Market Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword Market volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional markets, crypto prices can swing wildly in short periods, offering both immense opportunities and significant risks. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index allocates a substantial 25% weighting to volatility, underscoring its importance. Fear vs. Greed through Volatility: Typically, very high volatility coupled with price drops often indicates fear, as investors panic sell. However, high volatility during an uptrend can also be a sign of greed, as rapid price increases attract speculative buying. Risk Assessment: For investors, understanding volatility is crucial for risk management. Periods of extreme volatility, whether up or down, require careful consideration of position sizing and stop-loss orders. Opportunities: While intimidating, volatility also creates opportunities for traders who can capitalize on rapid price movements. However, this requires a disciplined approach and a clear strategy. The index uses volatility as a key indicator because sharp movements, regardless of direction, tend to trigger strong emotional responses from investors, directly influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Actionable Insights: How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Wisely While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it should not be your sole guide for investment decisions. Think of it as a compass, not a map. Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Many seasoned investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it might be a good time to consider buying, as prices are likely depressed due to panic. Conversely, when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be a prudent time to consider taking some profits or reducing exposure, as the market could be overheated. Combine with Other Analysis: Always combine the index’s insights with fundamental analysis (understanding the project’s technology, team, and use case) and technical analysis (studying price charts and patterns). The index provides context for investor sentiment , but not the full picture of a crypto asset’s value. Risk Management: Use the index to gauge the overall market mood and adjust your risk exposure accordingly. In periods of high greed, consider tightening stop-losses or diversifying your portfolio to mitigate potential downturns. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, the index can help identify periods of irrational exuberance or undue panic, allowing for more strategic entry or exit points rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. The current reading of 74 in the ‘Greed’ zone suggests a buoyant market. While this is positive, it also calls for a degree of caution and strategic planning to avoid getting swept up in potential euphoria. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For? The continued high reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in the ‘Greed’ zone points to a prevailing optimism in the market. However, market dynamics are constantly evolving. Investors should keep an eye on several factors that could influence future readings: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic indicators, inflation rates, and interest rate decisions by central banks can significantly impact risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions in major jurisdictions can quickly shift crypto market sentiment , potentially moving the index towards fear. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology or major upgrades to existing networks (like Ethereum’s continued development) can fuel positive sentiment. Whale Activity: Large transactions by institutional investors or ‘whales’ can signal significant shifts in market direction, influencing smaller investors. By staying informed about these broader influences, you can better anticipate shifts in the index and adjust your strategies accordingly. The index is a living, breathing reflection of the market’s collective mind, and understanding its nuances is key to navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of crypto. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to understand the underlying psychology of the digital asset market. Its current position at 74, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals a period of robust optimism and buying interest. However, as we’ve explored, high greed levels can also be a signal for caution, urging investors to evaluate their positions and avoid succumbing to FOMO. By dissecting its components—from market volatility to Bitcoin dominance —and applying its insights with a balanced, informed approach, you can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the crypto world and make more strategic decisions. Remember, emotional intelligence is as crucial as financial intelligence in this dynamic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps investors understand if the market is driven by panic or euphoria. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six key factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15% – currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends (10%). Each factor contributes to the final score. What does a ‘Greed’ reading (like 74) mean for investors? A ‘Greed’ reading, such as 74, indicates high optimism and strong buying interest in the crypto market. While positive, it can also signal that the market might be getting overheated, potentially leading to a correction. Savvy investors often use high greed as a prompt for caution or to consider profit-taking. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market tops or bottoms? While the index is a powerful indicator of prevailing investor sentiment , it is not a perfect predictive tool. Historically, extreme fear often coincides with market bottoms, and extreme greed with market tops. However, it should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools and strategies, not as a standalone predictor. Is Bitcoin dominance the only factor that matters in the index? No, Bitcoin dominance is one of six factors, contributing 10% to the index’s score.

A significant development is unfolding as Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, signals its readiness to navigate the complex landscape of U.S. financial regulations. This commitment, articulated by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, marks a pivotal moment for USDT’s presence in the United States and sets a precedent for other stablecoin issuers globally. Understanding the GENIUS Act: A Game Changer for USDT Regulation ? The recent signing of the GENIUS Act by U.S. President Donald Trump has introduced a new chapter for foreign stablecoin operations within the U.S. market. But what exactly is the GENIUS Act, and why is it so crucial for entities like Tether? The GENIUS Act, an acronym for the ‘Global Exchange for Non-U.S. Issuers of Unregistered Stablecoins Act’, aims to provide a structured regulatory pathway. Previously, foreign stablecoin issuers faced an ambiguous environment, often operating without clear guidelines or direct oversight from U.S. authorities. This new legislation seeks to: Establish Clear Guidelines: Offer a defined framework for foreign stablecoin issuers to register and operate legally within the U.S. Enhance Consumer Protection: Introduce measures to safeguard U.S. consumers engaging with foreign-issued stablecoins. Promote Financial Stability: Integrate these digital assets into the broader financial system in a way that minimizes systemic risks. For Tether, which currently issues USDT primarily from El Salvador, the GENIUS Act represents an opportunity to solidify its standing in one of the world’s largest financial markets. It’s a move that could transition USDT from a de facto presence to a formally recognized and regulated entity within the U.S. Tether’s Commitment to Tether Compliance : What Does It Mean? Paolo Ardoino’s recent interview with Decrypt highlighted Tether’s proactive approach to meeting the GENIUS Act’s requirements. This isn’t just a casual statement; it reflects a strategic decision to embrace regulation rather than resist it. Tether’s commitment to Tether compliance with this new law has several profound implications: Increased Legitimacy and Trust: Operating under a clear U.S. regulatory framework could significantly boost confidence among institutional investors, traditional financial entities, and retail users who may have previously been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties. This could unlock new avenues for adoption and integration into mainstream financial services. Broader Market Access: Compliance means USDT could be more readily integrated into U.S.-based exchanges, payment processors, and financial applications. This expanded accessibility is vital for a stablecoin whose primary utility is to facilitate transactions and provide a stable store of value in the volatile crypto market. Setting a Precedent: As the dominant stablecoin, Tether’s move towards U.S. regulatory compliance could encourage other foreign stablecoin issuers to follow suit. This could lead to a more harmonized global regulatory environment for digital assets, benefiting the entire crypto ecosystem. Ardoino’s emphasis on commitment underscores a recognition that long-term success in the global financial landscape necessitates adherence to established legal frameworks. It’s a pragmatic approach to ensuring USDT’s continued relevance and growth. Why is US Crypto Regulation Becoming More Critical? The push for clearer US crypto regulation , exemplified by the GENIUS Act, is not happening in a vacuum. The U.S. government and financial regulators have increasingly focused on digital assets, particularly stablecoins, due to their growing market capitalization and potential impact on financial stability and monetary policy. Here are some reasons why regulation is paramount: Consumer Protection: Protecting investors from fraud, market manipulation, and the risks associated with unregulated financial products. Financial Stability: Ensuring that large stablecoin operations do not pose systemic risks to the traditional financial system, especially concerning reserves and liquidity. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities. Taxation: Establishing clear guidelines for reporting and taxing crypto transactions. Global Competitiveness: The U.S. aims to remain a leader in financial innovation while maintaining regulatory oversight. The GENIUS Act specifically addresses the unique challenges posed by foreign stablecoin issuers, acknowledging their significant role in the global crypto economy while ensuring they meet U.S. standards. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Stablecoin Issuers ? While the GENIUS Act offers a clear path, the journey to full compliance for stablecoin issuers like Tether will not be without its challenges. These may include: Operational Adjustments: Implementing new internal controls, reporting mechanisms, and audit procedures to meet U.S. standards. Reserve Management: Potentially adjusting reserve compositions and transparency levels to align with regulatory expectations. Legal and Compliance Costs: Significant investments in legal counsel, compliance officers, and technology to navigate the regulatory landscape. Jurisdictional Nuances: Reconciling regulations from their primary operating jurisdiction (e.g., El Salvador for Tether) with U.S. requirements. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges: Enhanced Credibility: Regulatory approval can significantly boost a stablecoin’s credibility, making it more attractive to a wider range of users and institutions. Innovation and Integration: With regulatory certainty, stablecoin issuers can focus on innovating new products and services, integrating more deeply into traditional finance and emerging Web3 applications. Competitive Advantage: Early movers who successfully achieve compliance may gain a significant competitive edge over those who delay or fail to adapt. Tether’s willingness to engage with the GENIUS Act is a testament to its long-term vision and belief in the future of regulated digital assets. The Future Landscape: USDT Regulation and Beyond The commitment to USDT regulation under the GENIUS Act signifies a maturing cryptocurrency market where regulatory frameworks are increasingly shaping operational strategies. This move by Tether could accelerate the broader acceptance of stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments, not just within the crypto ecosystem but also in traditional finance. We might see a future where: More Stablecoins Seek U.S. Compliance: Other foreign stablecoin issuers may follow Tether’s lead, leading to a more regulated and secure stablecoin market in the U.S. Increased Institutional Adoption: With regulatory clarity, more financial institutions may feel comfortable integrating stablecoins into their offerings, from cross-border payments to decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Innovation in Compliance Technology: The demand for regulatory technology (RegTech) solutions tailored for crypto assets will likely surge. Tether’s decision is not merely about gaining access; it’s about shaping the future of digital finance, demonstrating that even decentralized technologies can thrive within established regulatory boundaries. Conclusion: A New Era for Stablecoins in the U.S. Paolo Ardoino’s declaration of Tether’s intent to comply with the GENIUS Act marks a landmark moment for the stablecoin industry. It signals a strategic shift towards greater regulatory engagement and transparency, particularly within the crucial U.S. market. This move has the potential to enhance USDT’s legitimacy, expand its market reach, and set a powerful precedent for other stablecoin issuers navigating the evolving landscape of US crypto regulation . As the digital asset space continues to mature, such proactive steps towards Tether compliance and clarity will be instrumental in fostering trust, driving innovation, and unlocking the full potential of stablecoins as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized future.

As of the time of writing, ETH trades at $3,617, marking a 5.4% increase within the past 24 hours. This rally has been drawing attention from analysts who are examining whether the price movement is being driven by sustainable investor demand or short-term speculative activity. Related Reading: Ethereum Shorts Are Getting Crushed: Could ETH Be Eyeing a New All-Time High? Ethereum Futures Market Leads, But Spot Demand Lags Behind Data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests the recent uptrend in Ethereum’s price is primarily fueled by the derivatives market. Contributor Avocado Onchain noted that while ETH continues to move higher, the underlying source of momentum appears to be leverage-heavy futures positions rather than sustained buying in the spot market. This distinction raises questions about the durability of the current rally and whether follow-through demand from spot buyers will emerge. Avocado further highlighted in his QuickTake analysis titled “Ethereum’s Rally Driven by Futures Market — Will Spot Demand Follow?” that the Ethereum Futures Volume Bubble Map is signaling an overheated state in specific zones, indicated by surging volumes. This increase in futures volume, marked by yellow circles on the map, has coincided with ETH’s price gains, implying leveraged positions are largely responsible for the rise. In contrast, the spot market data shows relative stability, with no equivalent spike in volume, suggesting that buying pressure from traditional investors has yet to catch up. The analyst also pointed out that Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) in futures has reached new all-time highs, which strengthens the idea that the current movement is speculative in nature. The question moving forward, according to Avocado, is whether momentum from the derivatives market will eventually be matched by genuine spot market demand. If such demand materializes, it could contribute to broader altcoin market activity, he added. Institutional Interest and ETF Inflows In a separate insight, another CryptoQuant analyst, Crypto Dan, noted increasing signs of institutional participation in Ethereum accumulation. According to his analysis, ETH is trading at a premium on Coinbase, a platform frequently used by US-based institutions and large investors, indicating heightened buying interest from whales. The premium, described as rare in recent times, aligns with a broader trend of capital inflows into Ethereum-focused spot ETFs, which have recently reached record daily highs. Dan stated that while current metrics do not indicate overheating, investors should remain aware of potential risks should the strong upward activity repeat in the second half of 2025.

Then you know that innovation never sleeps. A groundbreaking development is on the horizon that promises to redefine how we think about staking and yield generation. Leading liquid restaking protocol, Ether.fi , is making a significant leap into the high-speed world of the HyperLiquid ecosystem, a move set to introduce a powerful new asset: the beHYPE token . This isn’t just another partnership; it’s a strategic alliance poised to unlock fresh opportunities and deepen the synergy between distinct blockchain environments. Let’s dive into what this collaboration means for the future of DeFi and how it could impact your crypto portfolio. Understanding the Core Players: Ether.fi and HyperLiquid To truly appreciate the significance of this collaboration, it’s essential to understand the unique strengths of the entities involved. Both Ether.fi and HyperLiquid represent cutting-edge advancements in their respective domains, and their coming together creates a formidable force. What is Ether.fi? Powering Liquid Restaking Ether.fi stands out as a pioneering liquid restaking protocol built on Ethereum. But what exactly is liquid restaking, and why is it such a hot topic in the crypto space? In simple terms, restaking allows users to re-stake their already staked ETH (or liquid staking tokens like stETH) on other protocols to earn additional rewards. This creates a layered security model and enhances capital efficiency. Capital Efficiency: Users can earn multiple layers of yield from their staked ETH, rather than just one. Decentralized Security: By restaking, users contribute to the security of multiple protocols simultaneously. Liquid Tokens: Protocols like Ether.fi issue liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) that represent your restaked assets. This means your capital remains liquid and can be used in other DeFi applications while still earning staking rewards. Ether.fi has quickly gained traction for its user-friendly approach and robust infrastructure, making it a go-to platform for those looking to maximize their ETH’s utility. What is HyperLiquid? The High-Performance DeFi Powerhouse On the other side of this exciting partnership is HyperLiquid , a decentralized layer-1 blockchain that has been making waves with its ultra-fast execution and innovative approach to perpetuals trading. Unlike many other blockchains, HyperLiquid is built from the ground up for performance, offering: High Throughput: Capable of processing a massive volume of transactions per second, making it ideal for demanding applications like decentralized exchanges. Low Latency: Trades execute almost instantly, providing a seamless experience comparable to centralized exchanges. Native Perpetual DEX: HyperLiquid’s core focus is on perpetual futures trading, offering deep liquidity and a wide range of assets. The network’s architecture is designed to handle the rigorous demands of high-frequency trading, positioning it as a strong contender in the competitive DeFi landscape. HyperBeat, a native project within the HyperLiquid ecosystem, plays a crucial role in facilitating this integration by providing the necessary infrastructure and yield strategies. The Vision Behind beHYPE: A New Liquid Staking Token The core of this collaboration is the introduction of the beHYPE token . This new liquid staking token is designed to bridge the gap between Ether.fi’s liquid restaking capabilities and HyperLiquid’s high-performance ecosystem. But what exactly is beHYPE, and what benefits does it bring to users? Unpacking the Utility of beHYPE Token The beHYPE token will serve as a representation of Ether.fi’s liquid restaked ETH within the HyperLiquid network. This means that users will be able to: Access HyperLiquid’s DeFi Ecosystem: With beHYPE, users can participate in various DeFi protocols and strategies native to HyperLiquid, such as providing liquidity, collateralizing loans, or engaging in yield farming. Earn Dual Rewards: Holders of beHYPE could potentially earn rewards from both Ether.fi’s underlying restaking activities and additional yield opportunities within HyperLiquid. This ‘double-dipping’ potential is a significant draw for yield-hungry investors. Enhanced Liquidity: By creating a liquid representation of restaked assets on HyperLiquid, beHYPE enhances the overall liquidity of these assets, making them more versatile and accessible. The strategic design of beHYPE aims to create a symbiotic relationship, where Ether.fi users gain access to HyperLiquid’s speed and liquidity, and HyperLiquid benefits from the influx of restaked capital and user base. Why This Collaboration Matters: Unlocking New DeFi Opportunities The partnership between Ether.fi and HyperLiquid is more than just a technical integration; it represents a significant step forward for the broader DeFi landscape. It addresses key challenges and opens up exciting new avenues for users and protocols alike. Bridging Ecosystems for Enhanced Capital Efficiency One of the persistent challenges in DeFi has been the fragmentation of liquidity and utility across different blockchain ecosystems. This collaboration directly tackles this by creating a seamless bridge for restaked assets to flow into a high-performance Layer 1. This means: Increased Capital Flow: Restaked ETH, which might otherwise be confined to the Ethereum ecosystem, can now find new utility and yield opportunities on HyperLiquid. Diversified Yield Strategies: Users are no longer limited to yield strategies available on a single chain.

Telegram bots and new presale coins are everywhere, but not every option brings the same value. Two names are making the rounds this week: Snorter bot and BlockDAG (BDAG) . While Snorter’s presale price continues to rise, catching eyes from degen circles, BlockDAG with $342M presale, is pulling serious attention for a much bigger reason, full coin unlocks at launch. Most new projects hold back buyer coins in phases, but BlockDAG’s ‘NO VESTING PASS’ skips that completely for the next 8 days. It gives total access from day one. For anyone looking for quick liquidity, BlockDAG might be the clearest opportunity in today’s crowded presale space. Snorter Rises Fast While Vesting Holds Back Snorter token’s presale value is increasing fast as its next stage approaches. The rise has brought in crypto fans hoping to catch gains early. Snorter is built around a Telegram-based trading bot that makes buying and selling simple. This tool is made for meme coin fans and Telegram users who want quick trades without leaving chat. It uses smart contracts to make instant swaps possible right from the Telegram app. This ease of use is what’s driving the excitement. But there’s a catch: vesting. Like many presale offerings, Snorter sends coins in steps, not all at once. Buyers won’t get full access to their coins right away. That works for some, but others see it as a drawback, especially in fast markets where timing matters. Waiting for coins to unlock can lead to missed chances. And in a fast world like crypto, those delays can cost. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Offers Full Coin Access Day One While Snorter token grabs some attention, BlockDAG is moving at a much faster pace, and with bigger results. It has already raised $342 million over 29 batches and sold 24 billion coins so far. But what really makes BlockDAG different right now is its ‘NO VESTING PASS’, available for the next 8 days. Any coins bought directly by users with this pass will be 100% unlocked at launch. That means buyers can trade or hold their BDAG coins right from day one, no waiting, no slow unlocks. However, BlockDAG makes things clear. Only coins bought directly during this time come unlocked. Referral bonuses and extra promotions still follow standard unlock rules. This isn’t just a limited-time push, it’s part of BlockDAG’s plan to give users full control during the final stage of its presale. And with Bitcoin climbing, timing couldn’t be better. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, and the launch price is set at $0.05. But as part of BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the coin is now available at just $0.0016 until August 11. Those who got in at Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return. Buyers at today’s special GLOBAL LAUNCH release price could see gains of 3,025% based on the launch. Snorter Brings Bot Speed But BlockDAG Brings Liquidity Both Snorter bot and BlockDAG offer different kinds of value to the crypto world. Snorter is focused on meme coin trading through Telegram. Its bot is quick, simple, and built for mobile-first users. The rising price in its presale brings urgency and buzz. But there’s still that delay. Buyers don’t get all their coins at once. That limits their control while the market keeps moving. BlockDAG changes the game. Its NO VESTING PASS means you get full liquidity from day one. You don’t need to wait, you can act the moment it launches. In presales, that kind of instant access is rare. And with BlockDAG’s massive raise, its solid Layer 1 foundation, and global activity, it’s clear why people are switching their focus. Snorter might work for quick trades and hype. But BlockDAG mixes smart timing, real fundamentals, and full access. Final Thoughts Snorter token is gaining ground, and its bot is helping users get into the market with ease. The idea fits today’s meme coin trend. But with coins being locked up over time, buyers can’t use their full purchase right away. That limits fast action. BlockDAG stands out by doing the opposite. With its NO VESTING PASS, buyers get every coin unlocked on launch day. No delays. Just full access. With $342 million raised, 24 billion coins sold, and a 3,025% potential return from the current $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price to the official $0.05, BlockDAG is clearly setting itself up as a leader. For those who want control, timing, and liquidity, BlockDAG is offering something rare, and that offer only lasts 8 more days.

Trump’s departure from long-standing US positions on free trade and defense has rattled confidence in the dollar—the world’s dominant reserve and trade currency—sending shockwaves through global markets. The uncertainty has also reached lawmakers, who debate whether continued reliance on dollar distribution is sustainable amid rising economic risks. Uncertainties surround the US dollar as nations rethink their reliance on the country The US Federal Reserve has asserted that the central bank will continue using dollars in its operations. However, following Trump’s policy shift , the US’s European trading partners are rethinking their reliance on the country. The European regulators have gone to the extent of triggering the Bank of England, the central bank responsible for maintaining monetary and economic stability for the country, to emphasize to lenders the urgency of assessing their dollar funding approach in their operations. Moreover, according to sources familiar with the situation, it has also requested them to examine their reliance on the currency for short-term needs. Considering the intense nature of the situation, a Britain-based global bank was recently requested to conduct an internal stress test on the possibility of a shutdown for the US dollar swap market. Richard Portes, an economics professor at London Business School and a former Chair of the Advisory Scientific Committee for the European Systemic Risk Board, mentioned that in a worldwide dollar funding crisis, the Fed may be reluctant to provide swaps due to concerns about a strong reaction from Trump. Portes explained that the Fed mainly focuses on keeping monetary policy independent. He further urged the supervisors of foreign banks to encourage their banks to reduce their dollar exposures drastically. In response to Portes’s statement, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the supervisory part of the Bank of England, requested separate information from several banks concerning the situation, people with knowledge of the matter who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation said. When asked to comment, neither the Bank of England’s representative nor the global UK banks ‘ spokespersons that operate in banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Barclays respond to a request for comments. Contrastingly, a spokesperson from the White House responded to a request for comment. In a statement, the spokesperson mentioned that during President Trump’s administration, several markets and investors demonstrated strong confidence in the US dollar. The spokesperson based the argument on the increase in bonds, stocks, and historic investments that have increased to trillions of dollars since Trump’s election day. Analysts express concerns about the US Fed’s financial stance Earlier assessment of internal stress test on the US dollar revealed that euro zone banks required approximately one-fifth of the currency in their operations. The assessment also revealed that they highly rely on financial borrowing from short-term markets, which are unreliable in an economic crisis. For example, European central banks have significantly borrowed funds from the US Federal Reserve. This is where the US dollar comes from, highlighting their reliance on the currency to fill their financial gaps. Interestingly, the US Fed has several loan programs that apply to the ECB, among other US partners. This aims to address the global US dollar shortage and prevent the effects of financial hardship from hitting the country. Two reliable sources have highlighted that the US Fed never stopped indicating support for these safety precautions. Despite this, some sources suggest the possibility of the Fed shifting this stance. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This move, reported by @EmberCN on X, prompts important questions about strategic asset management within non-profit organizations dedicated to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem. For anyone deeply invested in the future of decentralized technology and the stability of the crypto market , understanding the implications of such transactions is crucial. Understanding Argot Collective’s Role in Blockchain Development Who exactly is Argot Collective, and why does their activity matter to the broader Ethereum community? Argot Collective is known as a non-profit research and development organization focused on fostering free and independent software solutions directly related to Ethereum . In essence, they are foundational builders, contributing to the underlying infrastructure and tools that make the decentralized web possible. Their work is vital because: Innovation Driver: They push the boundaries of what’s possible on Ethereum , often exploring cutting-edge technologies that might not immediately attract commercial funding. Ecosystem Health: By developing open-source tools and protocols, they strengthen the entire Ethereum network, benefiting countless DApps, users, and developers. Decentralization Ethos: Their focus on “free and independent software” aligns perfectly with the core principles of decentralization, ensuring that critical infrastructure remains open and accessible. Their contributions are a testament to the collaborative spirit driving blockchain development , where non-profit entities play a significant role in research and public goods funding. Why Did Argot Collective Offload 600 ETH? Unpacking the ETH Price Implications The sale of 600 ETH, while a notable sum, is relatively small in the grand scheme of Ethereum ‘s daily trading volume. However, any treasury movement from a respected entity like Argot Collective invites scrutiny. Why would a non-profit dedicated to Ethereum sell a portion of its holdings? Several strategic reasons could be at play: Operational Funding: Like any organization, non-profits have ongoing operational costs, including salaries, infrastructure, and research expenses. Converting crypto assets into fiat or stablecoins is often necessary to cover these expenditures. Portfolio Diversification: Maintaining a diversified treasury can be a prudent financial strategy, especially given the inherent volatility of crypto assets. Selling some ETH might be part of a broader rebalancing effort to mitigate risk. Funding Specific Initiatives: The funds might be earmarked for specific research projects, grants to other developers, or significant upgrades that require immediate capital injection. Market Timing: While speculative, organizations may choose to liquidate assets during periods of perceived strength in the ETH price to maximize the value of their holdings for future use. Regarding the immediate impact on ETH price , a 600 ETH sale is unlikely to cause significant market fluctuations. Ethereum processes billions in transactions daily. The significance lies more in the signal it sends about the organization’s financial management and its ongoing commitment to its mission rather than a direct price movement. It highlights the practical realities of managing crypto treasuries in the context of ongoing blockchain development . The Broader Crypto Market Context: What Does This Mean for Ethereum ? Argot Collective’s decision occurs within a dynamic and often unpredictable crypto market . Ethereum , as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is a bellwether for the wider ecosystem. Its performance and development trajectory influence countless projects built upon its blockchain. Recent developments in the Ethereum network, such as the Dencun upgrade, have focused on improving scalability and reducing transaction costs, making the network more appealing for widespread adoption. Such upgrades are the direct result of continuous blockchain development efforts, often supported by entities like Argot Collective. When an organization sells ETH, it can be viewed in various ways: A Sign of Health: If the sale is for funding active development or expansion, it can be a positive sign of progress and investment in the ecosystem’s future. A Strategic Adjustment: It could reflect a rational treasury management decision, adapting to current market conditions or anticipating future needs. A Neutral Event: Given the size, it might simply be a routine operational transaction with no deeper implications for the broader crypto market or Ethereum ‘s long-term prospects. Understanding these nuances is essential for investors and enthusiasts alike, preventing overreactions to routine treasury movements and focusing instead on the fundamental health and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. Navigating Non-Profit Funding in the Decentralized World: Challenges for Blockchain Development Funding blockchain development , especially for non-profit entities, presents unique challenges and opportunities. Unlike traditional businesses that can raise capital through equity or debt, non-profits in the crypto space often rely on a mix of donations, grants, and treasury management of their native tokens or cryptocurrencies. Key challenges include: Volatility Risk: Holding highly volatile assets like ETH means that the value of their treasury can fluctuate dramatically, making long-term financial planning difficult. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies can impact how non-profits manage and spend their digital assets. Transparency Expectations: The decentralized ethos often comes with high expectations for financial transparency from the community, requiring careful disclosure of treasury movements. Despite these challenges, organizations like Argot Collective demonstrate how effective treasury management can sustain critical blockchain development . Their ability to convert assets when needed allows them to continue their vital work, ensuring the Ethereum network remains at the forefront of innovation. This model of self-funding through token holdings is a relatively new paradigm, distinct from traditional non-profit fundraising, and it highlights the innovative financial structures emerging within the crypto market . What Can We Learn from Argot Collective’s Move? Actionable Insights For individuals and organizations involved in the Ethereum ecosystem or the broader crypto market , Argot Collective’s transaction offers several insights: Monitor Treasury Movements: Keep an eye on the public addresses of key projects and non-profits. While not every transaction is a “red flag,” understanding patterns can provide insight into operational health and strategic shifts. Understand the “Why”: Don’t just react to a sale; try to understand the underlying reasons. Is it for funding, diversification, or something else? Context is everything. Appreciate Non-Profit Contributions: Recognize the critical role non-profits play in foundational blockchain development . Their sustainability is key to the ecosystem’s long-term health. Long-Term Perspective on ETH Price : Short-term sales by individual entities rarely dictate the long-term trajectory of a major asset like Ethereum . Focus on fundamental developments, network upgrades, and adoption trends. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Strategic Treasury Management in the Crypto Market Argot Collective’s recent offload of 600 ETH, while a specific transaction, serves as a valuable case study in the evolving landscape of non-profit funding within the decentralized world. It underscores the practicalities of managing crypto treasuries to sustain vital blockchain development and research. Rather than signaling distress, such moves often reflect strategic financial planning aimed at ensuring the long-term viability and impact of organizations dedicated to advancing the Ethereum ecosystem. The incident reminds us that the crypto market is not just about speculative trading; it’s also about building, innovating, and sustaining the infrastructure for a decentralized future. As Ethereum continues its journey of evolution, the contributions and prudent financial management of entities like Argot Collective will remain indispensable.

Experts Tip Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the Better Crypto to Buy",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-likely-is-eth-to-hit-10000-this-year-experts-tip-mutuum-finance-mutm-as-the-better-crypto-to-buy/,"As Ethereum (ETH) hovers around key resistance levels, speculation is mounting over whether the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could finally reach the $10,000 mark in 2025. While analysts debate ETH’s trajectory amidst shifting market sentiment and Ethereum ETF buzz, a new player is rapidly gaining traction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, well over 80% sold out. Investors in this stage will enjoy a 100% return on investment when the token is listed. Well over $12.6 million has been raised and more than 13,600 early-stage investors. The token will rise in presale Phase 6 to $0.035, and that is 16.67% return on investments done in Phase 5. Mutuum Finance is capturing the attention of investors who are seeking more than just price speculation. Ethereum Price Outlook: Can ETH Clear Its Next Milestone? Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,461, bolstered by strong institutional flows, most notably from spot ETFs like those backed by BlackRock, which recently saw nearly $717 million in inflows in a single day. Analysts anticipate ETH could push toward the $3,600–$3,700 range in the short term, with potential upside to the $4,000–$5,000 zone by year’s end if ETF-driven demand and network fundamentals hold steady. That said, $3,200–$3,300 remains a critical support area, and a dip below could lead to consolidation around $3,000. Meanwhile, emerging alternatives, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are starting to attract attention as complementary plays in the crypto market. Investor Demand Propels Mutuum Presale to $12.6M Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13600 investors and is more than $12.6 million in funds. Investors have put over 80% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence by the investors in the project’s near-term success as well as its better future. Mutuum Finance Launches Major Token Giveaway Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , distributed among 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded based on its new leaderboard system. The bonus tokens will be given to the users when they level up. Mutuum Finance’s Model for Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is innovating the DeFi lending with the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole proprietor of their own assets. It is a functional double-lending multifunctional platform, combining the synergy of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, smart contracts are used to access lending pools. The platform responds to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes lenders’ returns less volatile and the borrower financially stable. With the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is very convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. More than 13,600 investors have already poured over $12.6 million into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a clear signal that this DeFi gem is quickly becoming a top alternative to legacy tokens like Ethereum. Phase 5 i s over 80% sold out, and the token is still just $0.03, guaranteeing 100% returns at the $0.06 launch price. A 16.67% increase is already locked in for Phase 6, making this the last chance to get in before the next price hike. As ETH eyes $10,000, investors are shifting focus to where real growth potential lies, and right now, that’s Mutuum Finance. Don’t wait until it’s trending. Secure your MUTM tokens now before Phase 5 closes.

The latest readings from the Altcoin Season Index might explain why. This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a sobering 37 at 01:14 UTC on July 19, down three points from the previous day’s figure. This decline signals a definitive shift into what the crypto world refers to as Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this means a period where Bitcoin’s price movements dictate the overall crypto market, often leaving altcoins struggling to keep pace. Understanding this dynamic is key to navigating the ever-volatile digital asset landscape. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index, and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a snapshot of market sentiment and capital flow within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Developed and tracked by CoinMarketCap, it provides a clear indication of whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. How it Works: The index compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during the 90-day period. The index score typically ranges from 75 to 100. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index score for Bitcoin Season usually falls between 1 and 25. With the index currently at 37, it clearly indicates that we are firmly outside Altcoin Season territory and deep within a period where Bitcoin is asserting its dominance. This makes the index a vital tool for cryptocurrency analysis , helping investors gauge market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Why Has the Market Shifted into Bitcoin Season? Unpacking Current Crypto Market Trends The transition into a pronounced Bitcoin Season isn’t random; it’s often driven by a confluence of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and specific industry developments. Several key reasons contribute to Bitcoin’s current dominance: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability, high inflation, or rising interest rates, investors tend to de-risk. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often perceived as the ‘safer’ asset or ‘digital gold,’ leading to a flight of capital from more speculative altcoins into BTC. Institutional Adoption & Liquidity: The increasing institutional interest, particularly with the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, funnels significant capital directly into Bitcoin. Its unparalleled liquidity and deeper market depth make it the preferred choice for large institutional players, reinforcing its dominance. Bitcoin Halving Cycles: While not the sole factor, the anticipation or aftermath of Bitcoin halvings can create unique market dynamics. Often, pre-halving rallies see Bitcoin gain strength, and post-halving consolidations might also see capital concentrate in BTC as the market absorbs the supply shock. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): Compared to the vast and diverse altcoin landscape, Bitcoin often has a relatively clearer regulatory pathway in many jurisdictions. This reduces perceived risk for both retail and institutional investors, making it a more attractive holding during uncertain regulatory periods. These prevailing crypto market trends collectively contribute to Bitcoin’s current stronghold, making it challenging for most altcoins to generate significant independent gains. Navigating Altcoin Performance: What Does Bitcoin Dominance Mean for Your Portfolio? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , the implications for altcoin performance can be significant and often challenging for investors heavily invested in smaller cap digital assets. Here’s what typically happens: Underperformance: The vast majority of altcoins will underperform Bitcoin, meaning their prices might either decline in USD value or rise much less significantly than BTC. They also tend to lose value against Bitcoin (their BTC pair value drops). Increased Volatility: Smaller, less liquid altcoins can experience heightened volatility, with sharper drops during market corrections and slower recoveries. Capital Rotation: Money often flows out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, exacerbating the altcoin underperformance. Investors might sell altcoins to buy more BTC, or simply hold cash waiting for a shift. The ‘Bleed Out’: Many altcoins may experience a gradual decline, often referred to as ‘bleeding out,’ where their value erodes over time, especially against Bitcoin. While some strong altcoins with unique narratives or significant developments might still manage to post gains, they are typically outliers. The prevailing environment demands a cautious approach to altcoin investments. Actionable Insights: How to Strategize During a Dominant Bitcoin Season Understanding the current market phase is crucial, but knowing how to act on it is even more important. Here are some actionable strategies for investors navigating a dominant Bitcoin Season : Focus on Bitcoin as a Core Holding: Given its current strength, increasing your allocation to Bitcoin can be a prudent move. It often acts as a more stable store of value within the crypto space during these times. Re-evaluate Altcoin Exposure: Consider reducing exposure to highly speculative, unproven, or less liquid altcoins. Rebalance your portfolio towards stronger, more established projects or increase your stablecoin holdings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently invest a fixed amount into Bitcoin or select strong altcoins at regular intervals. This strategy helps average out your entry price and mitigates the risk of buying at a peak. Deep Dive into Fundamentals: Use this period for thorough cryptocurrency analysis . Research projects with strong use cases, active development, robust communities, and clear roadmaps. These are the altcoins most likely to survive and thrive when the market eventually shifts. Patience and Long-Term Perspective: Crypto markets are cyclical. Avoid panic selling based on short-term fluctuations. A long-term perspective, combined with a well-researched strategy, is key to weathering market downturns. Monitor Dominance Charts: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A rising dominance suggests Bitcoin Season, while a consolidating or falling dominance could signal a potential shift back to altcoins. What Triggers the Shift? When Could Altcoin Season Return? While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin’s reign, the crypto market is dynamic, and cycles are an inherent part of its nature. The index will not remain at 37 forever. Several factors could trigger a shift back towards Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant Bitcoin rally, if BTC enters a period of consolidation or trades sideways, capital often begins to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns and risk appetite increases. Emergence of New Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: Significant advancements or the emergence of compelling new narratives within specific altcoin sectors (e.g., breakthroughs in Layer 2 scaling, a new DeFi boom, widespread adoption of GameFi or AI tokens) can ignite excitement and draw substantial capital away from Bitcoin. Ethereum’s Performance: As the largest altcoin and a major ecosystem, a strong and sustained rally in Ethereum, often driven by successful network upgrades (like the upcoming Dencun or future developments), can signal broader altcoin strength and kickstart an Altcoin Season. Increased Risk Appetite: A general improvement in global economic conditions, a more favorable regulatory environment, or a surge in institutional confidence beyond just Bitcoin could fuel a broader risk-on sentiment, benefiting altcoins. Keeping a close watch on these evolving crypto market trends and the movement of the Altcoin Season Index itself will be crucial for identifying early signs of the next Altcoin Season. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index at 37 is a clear indicator: we are firmly in a period of Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin is currently outperforming the majority of altcoins, influencing overall crypto market trends . While this phase presents challenges for altcoin performance , it also offers an opportunity for astute investors to refine their portfolios and engage in thorough cryptocurrency analysis . Understanding these market cycles, adapting your strategy, and focusing on strong fundamentals will be key to navigating the current landscape. As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying informed and patient will ultimately position you for success, regardless of whether it’s Bitcoin’s time to shine or altcoins are ready to take the lead.

The complaint , filed in US District Court for the Northern District of California, accuses Ramacciotti of using unauthorized access to an Apple employee’s phone to leak sensitive details of iOS 26. He reportedly sent it to Prosser, who ran with it on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech. The leaked information included details on as-yet-unreleased features and designs for iOS 26, which Apple intends to release publicly in the fall of 2025, according to the court documents. The company claims the leak caused “irreparable harm” by disclosing unfinished and secret product plans before they were ready. It is also seeking damages, but did not specify an amount. Apple has emphasized that it places a high priority on confidentiality and protecting its trade secrets. The company typically did not comment publicly beyond what is stated in its official legal filings. YouTuber denies wrongdoing In a statement to Reuters, Jon Prosser, an online personality who has gained prominence by disseminating news and scoops related to tech, said the lawsuit is another attempt by a large organization to silence those who speak the Truth. “I certainly did not plot to steal information, nor did I even know how it was originally obtained,” he said. Prosser said he believed the information he received was accurate and that publishing it fell within the legal boundaries of journalism. He added that he was eager to have the opportunity to present his side of the case in court. This far, neither Ramacciotti nor a representative from Front Page Tech has returned requests for comment. The video, uploaded to Prosser’s channel for the first time in January 2025, is called iOS 26. Inside, he detailed features and settings that Apple had not yet released. The video had people talking in the tech community and ranting online about Apple’s internal monitors and how they keep a tighter lid on leaks. Whistleblower exposes iPhone software breach Apple said that it became aware of the leak in April 2025, after it was alerted by an anonymous whistleblower. According to court documents, the whistleblower told Apple that Ramacciotti had accessed the data by hiding behind a close friend’s work phone. That friend happened to be an Apple employee at the time. The suit claims Prosser drove Ramacciotti, whom the vice principal supposedly “owed money,” to secure and relay the information. According to Apple, Ramacciotti is accused of numerous crimes and breaking company regulations. Falsehoods can lead to consequences; for Mike Prosser, that means a net gain. Prosser deliberately profited from the law-breaking, sharing secret information on his platforms to build an online audience and personal brand. Apple claims that protecting its IP is essential to its innovation and market position. It said both defendants had acted “maliciously and unlawfully.” The company also argued in the lawsuit that its trade secrets would harm its competitiveness and confidence between employees and business partners if revealed to the public. In 2021, Apple accused one of its former employees, Simon Lancaster, of leaking confidential company information to a reporter. In court documents, the company said Lancaster had abused his position and the trust in him to share sensitive trade secrets for his gain. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

BlockDAG (BDAG), SEI, Cardano (ADA), and Hedera (HBAR) each bring something different, from viral momentum to deep network traction. They’re not just trending, they’re building real buzz, and this month might be the last calm before they explode. Whether they’re surging already or lining up for a run, these four names are the ones people are watching closely right now. 1. BlockDAG: PoW Power + Fast Speed Make It Hard to Ignore BlockDAG takes Bitcoin’s secure PoW model and gives it speed and scalability for the modern crypto space. Its upgraded design handles way more transactions per second without dropping security, putting it ahead of most Layer 1s. So far, over $342 million has poured in, and 24 billion BDAG coins are gone. The price has jumped 2,660% since the start and still holds steady. But here’s where the real FOMO kicks in: BDAG is frozen at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, while the launch price is locked at $0.05. That’s a 3,025% gain sitting in plain sight. The kicker? The NO VESTING PASS. For the next 7 days, anyone buying BDAG gets full access at launch. No lock-ins. No delays. Just everything unlocked the moment it goes live. For those chasing the top altcoin to buy now before the crowd catches on, BlockDAG’s setup is hard to beat. 2. SEI (SEI): Speed, Backing, and DeFi Power-Up SEI (SEI) is turning heads as one of the top altcoins to buy now, thanks to its lightning-fast chain, major institutional links, and rising DeFi presence. Named for Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot and supported by Circle reserves, SEI is scaling fast. The upcoming ‘Giga’ upgrade might take it to 250,000 TPS, locking in a big lead. At $0.41, analysts are now calling for a rise toward $5–$7 if growth keeps up. With over $626 million in total value locked and strong traction in DeFi and gaming, SEI is lining up for a serious run in niche blockchain spaces. 3. Cardano (ADA): Whales Are Back and Watching Cardano (ADA) is stepping into the spotlight again as one of the top altcoins to buy now. Massive wallets have scooped up 1.4 billion ADA since late 2023, pointing to rising confidence after a long cooldown. The price holds around $0.60, but many see echoes of the 2020–2021 rally that sent ADA up 1,400%. Analysts now eye $3–$5 in the mid-term and up to $10–$12 if ETF talks and big money flows take shape. With both whales and retail stacking up, ADA’s breakout may come faster than expected. 4. Hedera (HBAR): ETF Buzz and On-Chain Growth Hedera (HBAR) makes the cut for top altcoins to buy now, with momentum building behind its unique tech and potential ETF approval. After an 8% climb to $0.17, HBAR is being tracked for a breakout. Its stablecoin cap jumped $12 million in just a week, and network activity is on the rise. If the SEC signs off on the ETF, with some analysts calling it a 90% bet, quick targets of $0.20 and possibly $1 are on the table. Add in Hedera’s hashgraph speed and expanding DeFi play, and the setup looks too good to ignore. Final Call: Which Coin’s Setup Is Too Strong to Miss? Each project brings serious heat. SEI’s power comes from real deals and blazing speed. Cardano (ADA) shows big players are already positioning. Hedera (HBAR) has the tech and ETF buzz fueling speculation. But BlockDAG brings a rare mix of scale, global reach, and a locked-in price of $0.0016 before its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. For anyone chasing the top altcoin to buy now before the market wakes up, BlockDAG could be the biggest move waiting to happen.

Whale Alert shared the news first on X (formerly Twitter), and the transaction happened around 14 hours ago when ETH was trading at $3,611.56. 💸 A fee of 31 #ETH (112,745 USD) has just been paid for a single transaction! https://t.co/kmsSPDfdy9 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 18, 2025 The trader attempts to get a refund The unlucky trader reached out to the Ethereum validator named TitanBuilder through on-chain messages. These blockchain messages are viewable on the Ethereum network. In the message , the trader wrote to the gas fees recipient, “Help! Some buggy wallet sent this transaction on Ethereum instead of Pulsechain, can you please send me back the super-high fee 31.22ETH this mistake has caused? please it is a huge amount of money to me.” The trader stated that his wallet is buggy, causing the transaction to be processed on the Ethereum network instead of the PulseChain network. Since PulseChain utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the transaction is valid on both PulseChain and Ethereum . Such a human error happens because the trader has to choose between paying the fees in ETH or the network’s native coin. In this case, it’s PulseChain’s native coin, PLS, which is trading at $0.00003014, based on data from CoinGecko. Ether, on the other hand, is trading at $3,525.88. Conor Grogan, a Director at Coinbase, took to X and urged the Ethereum validator TitanBuilder to return the funds to the trader. He wrote, “Do this poor guy a solid and farm some good karma.” Grogan also stated that the 31 Ether coins were transferred to a crypto exchange wallet, which seems to be an automated transaction. Grogan stated on X that he spends his free time helping users find their lost funds or unclaimed airdrops. Last month, Grogan said that over the past few years, he has helped more than 50 people recover over $10 million in lost Ether or unclaimed airdrops. He also managed to recover more than $3 million belonging to the crypto exchange Gate. Four hours ago, Ethereum validator TitanBuilder refunded the trader and sent him 29.5295 ETH, equivalent to $103,511.61. The validator wrote on X “We have refunded 100% of the block profit back to the user.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ethereum NUPL Fell Into Capitulation Zone Earlier In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about an Ethereum indicator from its joint report with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The metric in question is the “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss,” which measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of profit or loss that the investors of the asset as a whole are holding right now. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin on the network to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous transfer value was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token is assumed be in a state of net unrealized loss. Similarly, a coin with a cost basis below the latest price is considered in profit. The NUPL sums up the degree of profit/loss involved in both cases and calculates the difference between them. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means the investors as a whole are sitting in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the zero mark implies the dominance of loss in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL over the past few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum NUPL observed a significant decline earlier in the year when the asset’s price plummeted. In this plunge, the indicator went down to around -0.2, which suggests investors dipped into a net state of loss. Not just that, the level of relative unrealized loss present on the network was notable enough for the sentiment to be flagged as “capitulation” under Glassnode’s methodology. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Influx Of New Capital: First-Time Buyers Add 140,000 BTC Often, cryptocurrency markets move in the direction that the crowd least expects, so the presence of a high amount of loss can lead to a bottom. From the chart, this seems to be what occurred when the NUPL dropped into the capitulation zone. With the price surge that has followed since this low, sentiment among Ethereum investors has naturally marked an improvement. The NUPL may be to keep an eye on, however, as once the balance shifts overwhelmingly towards profit, another shift in the market could become probable: this one to a downtrend. ETH Price Ethereum has broken away from Bitcoin as its price has jumped by more than 20% over the past week, reaching the $3,600 level.

If you’ve been following the journey of digital assets into mainstream finance, you know that the approval of a Crypto ETFs has been a long-awaited milestone. Now, we’re seeing significant strides towards that future, potentially opening new avenues for investors seeking exposure to this dynamic asset class. What’s Behind 21Shares’ Latest SEC Filing? On July 18, 21Shares US, a prominent player in the digital asset ETP space, announced a significant move that could reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency investment . They filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two innovative new funds: the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF. The first, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF , aims to track a market cap-weighted index comprising the world’s ten largest crypto assets. This means it offers broad exposure to the top performers in the digital asset space, providing a diversified entry point for investors. The second, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF , follows an FTSE Russell index specifically designed to exclude Bitcoin. This provides an alternative for investors seeking diversification beyond the largest cryptocurrency, focusing on the broader altcoin market. This latest SEC filing highlights 21Shares’ continued commitment to bringing regulated, accessible investment products to the U.S. market, building on their existing presence and experience in the European digital asset space. Why are FTSE Indexes Significant for These Crypto ETFs? The choice to track FTSE indexes is a critical aspect of these new filings. FTSE Russell is a globally recognized provider of indexes, known for its rigorous methodology and independent governance. Their involvement adds a layer of credibility and familiarity for traditional investors who might be hesitant about direct crypto exposure. For a Crypto ETFs to track an index from a reputable provider like FTSE Russell means: Standardization: It provides a clear, transparent, and rules-based methodology for asset selection and weighting, ensuring consistency and reliability. Credibility: Lends institutional legitimacy to the underlying crypto assets, potentially attracting a broader range of investors who trust established financial benchmarks. Accessibility: Makes it easier for financial advisors and institutional investors to integrate crypto exposure into diversified portfolios, as they are already familiar with FTSE Russell’s benchmarks. This collaboration underscores a growing trend where established financial infrastructure is adapting to accommodate digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. What Benefits Do These New Crypto ETFs Offer Investors? These proposed Crypto ETFs could unlock several compelling benefits for investors looking to participate in the burgeoning digital asset market: Simplified Access: Instead of navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, or understanding complex blockchain technology, investors can gain exposure through a traditional brokerage account, just like any other stock or ETF. Diversification: The FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF offers diversified exposure to a basket of top cryptocurrencies, mitigating risk associated with investing in a single asset. The ‘ex-BTC’ version provides an avenue for diversification within the altcoin market, catering to different investment strategies. Regulatory Oversight: Being registered with the U.S. SEC means these funds would operate under a robust regulatory framework, offering a layer of investor protection not always present in direct crypto investments. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices, offering flexibility and ease of trading. This development is particularly exciting for institutional investors and wealth managers who have been seeking regulated and familiar vehicles for cryptocurrency investment . Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for SEC Filing and Crypto ETFs While the filing by 21Shares is a positive step, the path to approval for Crypto ETFs in the U.S. has historically been challenging. The SEC filing process is rigorous, and the SEC has maintained a cautious stance on spot crypto ETFs, primarily citing concerns around market manipulation and investor protection. Key considerations and potential hurdles include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will thoroughly examine custody arrangements, valuation methodologies, and the underlying market’s surveillance capabilities to ensure investor safety. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market remains a concern for regulators, who prioritize stability and predictability in regulated financial products. Precedent: While Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, a spot Bitcoin ETF (or broader crypto ETF) approval has remained elusive, setting a high bar for new filings and requiring significant reassurances regarding market integrity. Despite these challenges, the sheer volume of applications and the increasing institutional interest suggest that the approval of more diverse Crypto ETFs could eventually become a reality. Each SEC filing contributes to building a stronger case for broader acceptance and understanding within regulatory bodies. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment? The continuous efforts by firms like 21Shares to launch regulated Crypto ETFs signify a broader trend: the mainstreaming of digital assets. Even if these specific filings face delays, they contribute to the ongoing dialogue and education of regulators, pushing the industry forward. For the future of cryptocurrency investment , this means: Increased Institutional Flow: Easier access for large financial institutions to allocate capital to crypto, potentially bringing significant new liquidity into the market. Enhanced Market Maturity: The demand for regulated products encourages greater transparency, robust infrastructure, and improved market practices in the crypto space. Broader Investor Base: Opens up crypto exposure to a wider audience of retail investors through familiar investment vehicles, reducing barriers to entry and fostering wider adoption. The journey towards comprehensive crypto integration into traditional finance is complex, but filings like these by 21Shares are crucial milestones, signaling a persistent push for innovation and accessibility in the digital asset landscape. The recent SEC filing by 21Shares for two new Crypto ETFs tracking FTSE indexes marks another significant stride in the evolution of cryptocurrency investment . While the regulatory landscape remains complex, these initiatives underscore the growing demand for regulated, accessible, and diversified digital asset products. As the industry continues to mature, such filings pave the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into global financial portfolios. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see how these developments unfold and shape the future of digital asset investing.

If so, you’ve likely noticed some intriguing movements recently. A significant player, a wallet strongly associated with the prominent crypto market maker Cumberland, has been making waves with substantial purchases of Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t just a small retail buy; we’re talking about millions of dollars flowing into ETH, signaling potential shifts and confidence in the asset’s future. Let’s dive into what this massive accumulation means for the broader market and your investment strategy. Cumberland Wallet’s Astounding ETH Holdings Surge The crypto world is abuzz with news of a particular Cumberland wallet making strategic moves. According to sharp-eyed on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, this address recently acquired an additional 3,263 ETH, valued at a staggering $11.75 million, all within a mere eight-hour window. This latest acquisition isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger, ongoing accumulation strategy that began in earnest on June 18. Since that date, the wallet has amassed a grand total of 23,463.3 ETH. At an average purchase price of $3,261 per ETH, this translates to a colossal investment of $76.52 million. What’s even more impressive is the current state of these ETH holdings : the wallet is sitting on an unrealized gain of $6.63 million. This substantial profit highlights the market maker’s successful timing and strategic foresight in navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Here’s a quick snapshot of the Cumberland wallet’s recent accumulation: Latest Purchase: 3,263 ETH ($11.75 million) Total Accumulated Since June 18: 23,463.3 ETH ($76.52 million) Average Purchase Price: $3,261 per ETH Current Unrealized Gain: $6.63 million Who is Cumberland and Why Does This Crypto Market Maker Matter? For those new to the intricacies of the crypto ecosystem, understanding the role of a crypto market maker like Cumberland is crucial. Market makers are essential entities that provide liquidity to the markets. They simultaneously offer to buy and sell assets, bridging the gap between buyers and sellers and ensuring that transactions can occur smoothly and efficiently, even for large volumes. Cumberland, a subsidiary of DRW, is one of the most significant and respected players in the institutional crypto trading space. Their operations involve sophisticated algorithms and deep market insights, allowing them to execute large trades without causing significant price dislocations. When a market maker of Cumberland’s caliber makes such substantial moves, it often signals a calculated long-term strategy or a strong conviction about the asset’s future trajectory. Their actions are closely watched because they represent ‘smart money’ – institutional capital with a deep understanding of market dynamics and often access to proprietary research. Decoding the Ethereum Price Implications of Massive Accumulation The significant accumulation of ETH by a prominent institutional player naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the Ethereum price . Large-scale purchases by entities like Cumberland can have several implications: Demand Signal: Consistent buying pressure from a major market maker indicates strong institutional demand for Ethereum. This can be a bullish signal for other investors, suggesting that ETH is seen as a valuable asset for the foreseeable future. Price Support: By absorbing large quantities of ETH from the market, Cumberland’s actions can create a floor or support level for the price. This reduces the available supply on exchanges, which can prevent sharp declines and even contribute to upward price momentum. Market Confidence: When sophisticated institutional investors commit tens of millions of dollars, it instills confidence in the market. It suggests that despite recent volatility, Ethereum’s fundamentals and long-term prospects remain attractive to major players. Liquidity Management: While market makers provide liquidity, their own large positions also reflect their view on an asset’s value. Building up such a large reserve of ETH suggests they anticipate continued trading activity and potentially a need to facilitate large buy orders from their clients in the future. Ethereum itself is undergoing continuous development, with significant upgrades aimed at improving scalability, security, and sustainability. These technological advancements, coupled with its robust ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and dApps, make ETH a compelling asset for long-term holders and institutional investors alike. Leveraging On-Chain Analysis for Market Insights How do we even know about these large wallet movements? This is where on-chain analysis comes into play. On-chain analysis involves examining the publicly available data on a blockchain to gain insights into market sentiment, supply and demand dynamics, and the activities of large holders or ‘whales’. Every transaction on a public blockchain like Ethereum is recorded and transparent, allowing skilled analysts to track the flow of funds. Analysts like @ai_9684xtpa specialize in identifying patterns, linking addresses to known entities (like market makers or exchanges), and interpreting the implications of large transfers or accumulations. This transparency is a unique feature of the crypto market, providing a level of insight into institutional activity that is often opaque in traditional financial markets. For retail investors, following reputable on-chain analysts can offer an early glimpse into potential market trends and the conviction of major players, helping them make more informed decisions. What Does This ETH Holdings Strategy Signal for Investors? So, what can you, as an investor, take away from Cumberland’s aggressive accumulation of ETH holdings ? Long-Term Conviction: Such significant investments from an institutional player often indicate a strong long-term conviction in Ethereum’s value proposition. They are likely betting on its continued growth and adoption. Potential Price Action: While not a guarantee, sustained accumulation by whales can contribute to upward price pressure over time by reducing available supply. Market Maturity: The involvement of sophisticated market makers like Cumberland signifies the increasing maturity and institutionalization of the crypto market. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While it’s insightful to observe smart money, it’s crucial to remember that institutional strategies are complex and often involve hedging or other risk management techniques not visible on-chain. Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. Consider your own risk tolerance and financial goals. This event serves as a powerful reminder that despite market fluctuations, major players continue to see immense value and potential in Ethereum. Their strategic moves can often be a leading indicator of broader market sentiment and future price movements. In conclusion, the substantial increase in Cumberland wallet ‘s ETH holdings , amounting to an impressive $76.52 million investment and an unrealized gain of over $6 million, is a significant development in the crypto space. This strategic move by a major crypto market maker underscores strong institutional confidence in Ethereum. By leveraging precise on-chain analysis , we gain invaluable insights into how these large players are positioning themselves, potentially influencing the future Ethereum price and signaling a bullish outlook for one of the leading cryptocurrencies. It’s a compelling demonstration of smart money at work, offering a glimpse into the evolving dynamics of the digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto market maker? A crypto market maker is an entity, often an institutional firm, that facilitates trading by simultaneously placing both buy and sell orders for a specific cryptocurrency. Their primary role is to provide liquidity, ensuring that there’s always a market for traders to execute their orders quickly and efficiently. They profit from the bid-ask spread and managing their inventory. Q2: Why are Cumberland’s ETH holdings significant? Cumberland is a prominent institutional crypto market maker. Their substantial ETH holdings are significant because they represent a large capital allocation by a sophisticated player. Such large-scale accumulation often signals strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value and can influence market sentiment and price dynamics by indicating institutional demand. Q3: How does on-chain analysis reveal such large transactions? On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on a blockchain. Every transaction, including the sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp, is recorded on the distributed ledger. Analysts use specialized tools and techniques to track large movements, identify patterns, and sometimes link specific wallet addresses to known entities or categorize them as ‘whale’ activity, providing transparency into market behavior. Q4: What impact could Cumberland’s ETH accumulation have on Ethereum price? While not a direct guarantee, sustained accumulation by a major entity like Cumberland can contribute to positive price pressure on Ethereum. It signals strong demand, reduces the available supply on exchanges, and can boost overall market confidence, potentially leading to upward price movements or stronger price support levels. Q5: Should retail investors follow the lead of large market makers? While observing the actions of large market makers can provide valuable insights into institutional sentiment, retail investors should always conduct their own thorough research (DYOR). Institutional strategies are complex and involve risk management techniques not visible to the public. It’s crucial to align investment decisions with your own financial goals, risk tolerance, and understanding of the market, rather than blindly following others.

But a few projects are clearly built to last. They’ve got strong tech, real-world use, and the kind of backing that shows staying power. Now that the market is moving again, many are watching these names closely before prices push higher. This article highlights 4 top trending cryptos worth keeping an eye on: BlockDAG, Solana, Ethereum, and Binance Coin. Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes each one a strong player for the long term. 1. BlockDAG Prepares for Launch With Speed, Reach, and Access BlockDAG’s presale has passed $342 million, with more than 24 billion coins already sold. It’s now one of the biggest early-stage crypto projects. Behind this growth is the project’s real focus on tech and rollout. Its DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) setup allows it to handle up to 15,000 transactions per second, supporting both fast payments and smart contracts on the same chain. This isn’t just an idea on paper. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already launched a live testnet and developer tools, so users can test the platform before its mainnet goes live. Security checks have also been completed, with audits from CertiK and Halborn adding extra trust. The current offer prices BDAG at $0.0016 in Batch 29, with this deal open until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The confirmed listing price is $0.05, meaning those who buy now lock in a 3,025% jump once it lists. BlockDAG also plans to launch on 20 centralized exchanges, including MEXC, CoinStore, XT.com, LBANK, and BitMart. With solid development, growing reach, and early market traction, many see it as a top trending crypto that could reach $20 by 2027. 2. Solana’s Speed and Utility Make It a Standout in the Space Solana (SOL), trading at $160.58, has become one of the top trending cryptos because of its fast performance, strong scaling, and low fees. It can process thousands of transactions each second, making it a reliable option for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 apps that need fast and cheap execution. The network has bounced back after earlier technical issues, and it’s now attracting more builders and new projects. With a larger ecosystem and practical uses, Solana is proving to be more than just talk. As demand for efficient blockchain networks grows, Solana’s technology keeps it in a solid spot moving forward. 3. Ethereum Keeps Building as Web3 Expands Ethereum (ETH), priced at $2,967.11, continues to be one of the top trending cryptos. It powers most of the Web3 tools used today, from DeFi and NFT platforms to blockchain-based games and smart contracts. What makes Ethereum unique is the size of its developer network and how often the protocol improves. Ongoing updates focus on better speed and lower gas fees, aiming to make the network smoother for both users and developers. Ethereum has become the base layer for many decentralized services, and with more real-world applications moving to blockchain, its role is expected to grow even more in the coming years. 4. Binance Coin’s Real-World Use Holds Its Value Binance Coin (BNB), now valued at $681.33, is another name among today’s top trending cryptos. It plays a major role within Binance, the world’s busiest crypto exchange. BNB is used to lower trading fees, take part in new project launches, and support activity on the Binance Smart Chain, where people build dApps and DeFi platforms. Its ongoing demand from both developers and everyday users gives BNB steady value. As Binance continues to grow and release new features, BNB stays linked to one of crypto’s most powerful platforms. That connection makes it a strong candidate for the long haul. Why BlockDAG Might Be Leading the Pack All four projects bring something important. Solana offers fast, affordable tools. Ethereum is still the center of most decentralized services. Binance Coin connects to one of the strongest platforms in the market. But BlockDAG is taking a different approach. It’s already rolled out working features ahead of launch and is focused on real utility, not hype. Right now, the price is just $0.0016 in Batch 29, ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That gives traders a chance to buy in early before the price moves closer to its confirmed $0.05 listing. For anyone searching for a top trending crypto , this may be the right time to take notice before the offer ends.

Recently, a notable event captured the attention of the crypto community: a substantial Bitcoin withdrawal from one of the industry’s largest exchanges, Binance. This isn’t just any transaction; it involves a staggering 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $118 million at the time of the move, originating from fresh addresses. Such a large BTC transfer immediately sparks curiosity and speculation among traders and analysts alike. What does it mean when a significant amount of Bitcoin moves off an exchange? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this intriguing development. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Withdrawal from Binance On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, leveraging data from Arkham Intelligence, recently brought to light a significant movement of Bitcoin. Two newly created addresses initiated a withdrawal of 1,000 BTC from Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange. This event, while seemingly straightforward, carries considerable weight within the crypto ecosystem. When a substantial amount of an asset like Bitcoin is removed from an exchange, it often signals a shift in strategy or intent from the holders. Here’s a breakdown of the core details: Asset Involved: 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Origin: Binance exchange Destination: Two newly created, previously inactive addresses Reported By: Lookonchain, citing Arkham data Approximate Value: $118 million (at the time of the transfer) This kind of movement is meticulously tracked by on-chain analysts because it provides valuable insights into market dynamics and potential future price action. The fact that the addresses are ‘fresh’ or ‘new’ adds another layer of intrigue, suggesting that these might not be routine internal transfers or rebalancing acts by the exchange itself. Why Does a Large BTC Transfer Matter? In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, every major move can be a signal. A large BTC transfer , especially one of this magnitude, is often interpreted as a significant event for several reasons: Potential Accumulation: When Bitcoin moves off an exchange, it’s often a sign that the holder intends to keep it for the long term, moving it into cold storage or private wallets. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges and can be seen as a bullish signal, indicating accumulation. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large sums of Bitcoin are frequently traded directly between parties in OTC deals, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact. Such withdrawals could be precursors to these private transactions. Institutional Activity: Increasingly, institutions are entering the crypto space. These large withdrawals could represent movements by institutional investors, hedge funds, or even sovereign wealth funds looking to secure their assets off-exchange. Security Concerns: Some large holders prefer to store their assets in self-custodied wallets to mitigate risks associated with exchange hacks or regulatory uncertainties. Market Sentiment Indicator: While not always a direct predictor, a consistent trend of large withdrawals can suggest a bullish sentiment, implying holders are confident in Bitcoin’s future value. Conversely, large deposits to exchanges often precede selling pressure. Understanding these potential motivations is crucial for anyone trying to decipher the market’s pulse. It’s rarely just a simple transfer; there’s often a strategic reason behind such substantial moves. Unmasking the Crypto Whale : Who Could Be Behind Such a Move? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. When 1,000 BTC moves, it’s undeniably a whale-sized transaction. But who are these whales, and what are their typical characteristics? A visualization of a significant Bitcoin transfer from an exchange. Whales can be diverse: Early Bitcoin Adopters: Individuals who mined or bought Bitcoin in its nascent stages and now hold vast quantities. High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs): Traditional investors diversifying their portfolios with digital assets. Investment Funds & Institutions: Entities like Grayscale, MicroStrategy, or other large investment vehicles accumulating Bitcoin. Centralized Exchanges: Though less likely for ‘new addresses,’ exchanges themselves hold significant reserves for liquidity and operational purposes. The ‘new addresses’ aspect of this particular withdrawal suggests it’s unlikely to be an exchange’s internal rebalancing. Instead, it points towards an external entity or individual acquiring a substantial amount of Bitcoin and moving it to private custody. This behavior often signifies strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value, as these whales are opting to hold rather than trade immediately. The Power of On-Chain Data : How We Know These Things One of the most revolutionary aspects of blockchain technology is its transparency. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, making it possible for anyone with the right tools to track movements. This is where on-chain data analysis comes into play. Platforms like Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence specialize in sifting through this vast amount of data to identify significant trends, whale movements, and potential market shifts. How do they do it? Transaction Tracking: They monitor all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, identifying sender and receiver addresses, amounts, and timestamps. Address Labeling: Through sophisticated algorithms and manual research, they label addresses belonging to exchanges, known institutions, funds, or even specific individuals, where possible. This allows them to differentiate between an exchange’s cold wallet and a new, unknown address. Pattern Recognition: Analysts look for patterns in withdrawals and deposits, identifying large-scale movements that deviate from the norm. Data Aggregation: They aggregate vast datasets to provide a holistic view of the market, including exchange balances, mining activity, and whale holdings. The transparency offered by on-chain data is invaluable. It empowers investors with insights that were previously unavailable in traditional financial markets, allowing for more informed decisions and a deeper understanding of market participants’ behavior. This particular incident is a prime example of how on-chain data provides immediate, verifiable information about significant market events. What Does This Mean for Binance BTC Holdings and Security? Binance, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, holds substantial amounts of Binance BTC and other digital assets. When a large withdrawal occurs, it naturally raises questions about the exchange’s reserves and security protocols. However, it’s important to differentiate between a user withdrawal and an issue with the exchange itself. Normal Operations: Large withdrawals are a routine part of a major exchange’s operations. Users frequently deposit and withdraw assets for various reasons, including trading, moving to cold storage, or participating in DeFi protocols. Proof of Reserves: Many exchanges, including Binance, have implemented Proof of Reserves mechanisms to demonstrate that they hold sufficient assets to cover user deposits. While a large withdrawal reduces the total assets held by the exchange, it doesn’t necessarily indicate a solvency issue, especially if it’s a single, isolated event by a user. Security: The fact that the funds were successfully withdrawn to new addresses indicates that Binance’s withdrawal mechanisms are functioning as intended. Exchanges employ robust security measures, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and advanced encryption, to protect user funds. In this instance, the withdrawal appears to be a user-initiated move rather than an internal transfer or a sign of distress for Binance. It underscores the active nature of the crypto market and the continuous flow of assets across different platforms and wallets. Potential Implications and Future Outlook While a single 1,000 BTC withdrawal might not dramatically alter the entire market, it’s a piece of the larger puzzle. Such moves, especially from new addresses, contribute to the ongoing narrative of institutional adoption and long-term holding. Market Psychology: Large withdrawals can foster a sense of scarcity on exchanges, potentially leading to positive price sentiment if a trend of accumulation emerges. Decentralization Trend: It highlights a growing trend among significant holders to move assets off centralized exchanges towards self-custody solutions, reinforcing the decentralized ethos of crypto. Increased Scrutiny: Such visible movements will likely prompt more on-chain analysis, providing deeper insights into the identities and motivations of these new addresses over time. The crypto market is a complex interplay of technology, economics, and human behavior. Each significant transaction, like this large BTC transfer , serves as a data point for analysts to refine their models and for investors to gauge market sentiment. It reinforces the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics for a holistic view of the crypto landscape. The recent Bitcoin withdrawal of 1,000 BTC from Binance by new addresses is more than just a transaction; it’s a signal. It highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market, the growing influence of crypto whale activity, and the invaluable transparency provided by on-chain data . While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price may be subtle, such moves contribute to the broader narrative of accumulation and institutional interest. For those invested in understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory, paying attention to these significant transfers and the platforms that track them, like Lookonchain and Arkham, is crucial. It underscores the ongoing evolution of how digital assets are managed and secured by their most significant holders, impacting the overall supply and demand dynamics for Binance BTC and the wider market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when Bitcoin is withdrawn from an exchange? When Bitcoin is withdrawn from an exchange, it typically means the owner is moving it to a private wallet (often for cold storage) or preparing it for an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. It generally reduces the immediate selling pressure on the exchange and can be seen as a bullish sign of accumulation if it’s a recurring trend. Q2: How significant is a 1,000 BTC withdrawal? A 1,000 BTC withdrawal is considered a very significant or ‘whale’ move. At current market prices, this amount represents tens of millions of dollars, indicating that a major investor or institution is behind the transfer. Such large transfers can influence market sentiment and are closely watched by analysts. Q3: What are ‘new addresses’ in the context of Bitcoin withdrawals? ‘New addresses’ refer to Bitcoin wallet addresses that have not previously been associated with significant activity or have just been created. When large sums are moved to new addresses, it suggests that the funds are going into fresh custody, potentially for long-term holding or new strategic ventures, rather than being part of an exchange’s internal rebalancing or a known entity’s existing large holdings. Q4: How do on-chain data platforms like Lookonchain and Arkham track these movements? On-chain data platforms analyze the public blockchain ledger, which records every Bitcoin transaction. They use sophisticated tools and algorithms to track funds moving between addresses, identify known entities (like exchanges or large funds), and detect significant patterns, such as large withdrawals to new or dormant addresses. This provides transparency into market activities that are not visible through traditional financial reporting. Q5: Does a large withdrawal from Binance indicate a problem with the exchange? Not necessarily. While large withdrawals are monitored, they are a normal part of a major exchange’s operations as users manage their assets. Unless there are multiple, sudden, and unexplained large withdrawals in a short period, a single event like this typically does not indicate a solvency issue or security breach for the exchange. Binance, like other major exchanges, processes vast numbers of withdrawals daily. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

But does it have the fundamentals to sustain the hype? In this guide, we’ll explore what XYZVerse is, how its ecosystem creates real utility, and whether it stands out in a crowded meme coin market. Is XYZVerse.io the next breakout token? Let’s dive in and find out. What Is XYZVerse? Coin XYZVerse ($XYZ) Contract Address 0xD75Ab4b69F2eDfb072fDFD7e2D15a875f95Ae5ae Current Presale Raise $14M+ Type Meme token Launch Date Q4 2025 (Listing target: $0.10) Price Increase (At Time of Writing) >3200% (from $0.0001 to current stage price of $0.003333) Community 21K+ X followers, 11K+ Telegram followers Contract Safety Pessimistic Audit, SolidProof Audit – No critical vulnerabilities; secure, optimized code XYZVerse is a community-driven meme coin that merges sports culture, gamified staking, and crypto . At its core, the project aims to do more than ride the meme wave—it integrates with bookmaker.XYZ , giving token holders exclusive betting perks, rewards, and access to crypto-based play-to-earn experiences. Unlike many meme coins that live and die by social media trends, XYZVerse is building a complete ecosystem featuring: Telegram-based crypto games Airdrop programs Upcoming dApps for staking and rewards Real-world sportsbook integration How XYZVerse Reached $15M+ and Why Its Presale Strategy Works XYZVerse launched its presale with a clear, methodical structure designed to reward early adopters and build long-term momentum. XYZVerse introduced a 15-stage pricing model where the token price gradually increases as each round sells out. This tiered structure serves two key purposes: It incentivizes early participation by offering substantial discounts at the earliest stages It helps the project build sustainable traction, with each stage reflecting real demand and community growth Starting at just $0.0001 in Stage 1 , the price has climbed steadily with strong participation across every round. As of today, the presale has already raised over $14 million , reflecting confidence in both the token’s mechanics and its broader vision of merging sports, meme culture, and crypto rewards. Join early while $XYZ Presale is still live Is XYZVerse Legit? While XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, several signals suggest it is a legitimate and carefully structured project . However, as with any presale token, true validation will come post-launch —when real market performance and ecosystem utility are put to the test. Security Audits & Smart Contract Review To reinforce trust and transparency, XYZVerse underwent a full smart contract audit conducted by Pessimistic , a well-respected blockchain security firm known for its thorough code assessments. The audit results were highly positive, confirming that XYZVerse’s smart contract is secure, well-structured, and gas-efficient . No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were found. This level of scrutiny and openness reflects a commitment to best practices in an industry where unaudited and hastily deployed meme coins are common. The audit report is publicly available and serves as a key foundation for investor confidence. Liquidity & Token Control XYZVerse operates with a fixed total supply of 100 billion tokens , introducing scarcity as a foundational principle . To further support long-term value, the project employs a deflationary burn mechanism —where a portion of tokens is systematically removed from circulation through buybacks and burns. This structure not only discourages inflation but also rewards long-term holders by reducing overall supply over time.

XYZVerse adopts a clear and balanced tokenomics model , with a fixed total supply of 100 billion tokens —ensuring the project is non-inflationary and scarcity-driven by design. The structure reflects a well-thought-out strategy focused on liquidity, growth, and community engagement . Key allocations include: Marketing (15%) and Liquidity (15%) , which ensure both visibility and exchange readiness A generous 17.13% burn allocation , making XYZVerse one of the few meme coins with a built-in, large-scale deflationary mechanism 10% set aside for development and ecosystem growth , providing fuel for product innovation and long-term expansion 10% for incentives, airdrops, and bonuses , fostering early engagement and decentralized community participation Unlike many meme tokens that overallocate to teams or rely on hype alone, XYZVerse limits team allocation to a responsible 10% , aligning with industry best practices. Meanwhile, community-focused distributions—presale, airdrops, and KOLs—make up over 40% of total supply , reinforcing the project’s grassroots-first approach. If executed with discipline, this allocation model supports both market momentum and ecosystem utility , setting a foundation not just for hype, but for sustained relevance through 2025 and beyond. Community: What’s the Sentiment? Community sentiment around XYZVerse is strongly bullish , reflecting both growing excitement and trust in the project’s direction. On CoinMarketCap , over 96% of user votes indicate a positive outlook for XYZ, placing it among the most favorably viewed tokens in its category. This optimism is echoed across the project’s social channels: 21K+ followers on X (formerly Twitter) 12K+ active Telegram members High engagement across airdrop announcements, presale updates, and interactive campaigns Influential voices in the crypto space are already buzzing about XYZVerse , with several prominent analysts and content creators calling it a “moonshot opportunity” for the 2025 cycle.

The future for XYZVerse looks increasingly promising as it positions itself at the intersection of community-driven meme culture , gamified crypto engagement , and real-world sports integration . With a clear post-launch roadmap and strong early traction, the project is preparing for a high-profile debut on both centralized and decentralized exchanges . This move is expected to significantly boost visibility and liquidity, allowing XYZ to reach a broader investor base beyond presale participants. Several key developments lie ahead: Launch of staking and reward-based dApps , allowing holders to earn passively while engaging with the ecosystem Expansion of its play-to-earn games on Telegram and other platforms, turning casual engagement into real crypto value Influencer and athlete partnerships , bridging Web3 and global sports audiences Aggressive marketing and sports sponsorships , giving the project exposure beyond the crypto-native crowd Token burns and liquidity programs , reinforcing price sustainability over time Importantly, the combination of a fixed supply , burning mechanics , and a loyal, growing community gives XYZVerse the ingredients needed for long-term relevance—not just a short-term meme cycle. XYZVerse is gearing up for launch.

For many involved in advanced crypto trading , the concept of crypto perpetual futures is a familiar one, offering opportunities for amplified gains but also significant risks. One of the most stark indicators of market sentiment and sudden price movements is the phenomenon of liquidation. When the market takes an unexpected turn, leveraged positions can be wiped out in an instant, leading to massive financial shifts. What Are Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Liquidate? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what we’re discussing. Crypto perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures have no expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. Traders can open both ‘long’ positions (betting on a price increase) and ‘short’ positions (betting on a price decrease). The key to understanding liquidations lies in leverage. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential returns by borrowing funds to open larger positions than their initial capital would allow. While this can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases risk. If the market moves against a leveraged position, and the trader’s margin (the collateral held by the exchange) falls below a certain threshold, the exchange will automatically close the position to prevent further losses – this is called futures liquidation . Essentially, liquidation serves as a safety mechanism for exchanges to ensure traders can cover their losses. For the individual trader, however, it means losing their entire margin and sometimes even more, depending on the exchange’s policies and market conditions. These events often trigger cascading effects, as large liquidations can put further downward (or upward) pressure on prices, leading to more liquidations. The Alarming 24-Hour Futures Liquidation Breakdown The last 24 hours have painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant futures liquidation volumes across major cryptocurrencies. This breakdown reveals the extent to which leveraged positions were impacted, providing crucial insights for anyone involved in crypto trading . Here’s a snapshot of the total crypto perpetual futures liquidation over the last 24 hours: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated Volume Long Liquidations Percentage Ethereum (ETH) $214.42 million 67.76% Bitcoin (BTC) $139.30 million 87.42% XRP $55.91 million 68.59% As you can see, the total liquidation volume across these three assets alone reached an astounding figure, with ETH leading the pack. What’s particularly striking is the overwhelming dominance of ‘long’ liquidations across the board. This indicates that a majority of traders were betting on price increases, only to be caught off guard by a downward price movement, leading to their positions being forcibly closed. Bitcoin Liquidation: Analyzing the Market’s Bellwether Bitcoin, often considered the bellwether of the crypto market, experienced substantial Bitcoin liquidation amounting to $139.30 million. What stands out even more is that a staggering 87.42% of these liquidations were from long positions. This high percentage suggests that many traders were highly confident in BTC’s upward trajectory, perhaps fueled by recent positive news or technical analysis indicators, only for the price to drop unexpectedly, triggering widespread margin calls. Large Bitcoin liquidations can have a ripple effect across the entire crypto ecosystem. As BTC is often the primary trading pair for many altcoins, a significant move in Bitcoin’s price can drag down the broader market, leading to further liquidations in other assets. The high concentration of long liquidations in BTC points to a market that was perhaps over-leveraged on the bullish side, making it particularly vulnerable to a correction. Ethereum Liquidation: The Smart Contract Giant’s Vulnerability Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, saw the largest individual liquidation volume at $214.42 million. Similar to Bitcoin, a significant portion (67.76%) of these were long liquidations. Ethereum’s price movements are often influenced by its ecosystem developments, but also by the broader market sentiment, especially Bitcoin’s performance. The high volume of Ethereum liquidation suggests that many traders were also optimistic about ETH’s short-term prospects. Given Ethereum’s integral role in the DeFi space, large liquidations can sometimes reflect broader stress in the decentralized lending and borrowing protocols, where ETH is often used as collateral. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective crypto trading strategies. XRP Liquidation: A Glimpse into Altcoin Volatility While smaller in absolute terms compared to BTC and ETH, XRP’s $55.91 million in futures liquidation is notable, with 68.59% coming from long positions. XRP, known for its unique position in the cross-border payments sector, often exhibits different price dynamics than other major cryptocurrencies, sometimes influenced by specific legal or partnership news. The significant long liquidations for XRP underscore the inherent volatility of altcoins. Even assets with specific use cases or ongoing developments are not immune to market-wide corrections or sudden price swings that can wipe out leveraged positions. This highlights the importance of prudent risk management, especially when engaging in crypto trading with more volatile assets. Decoding Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Does It Mean for Your Crypto Trading? The distinction between long and short liquidations is critical for understanding market sentiment. When long positions are liquidated, it means the price of the asset dropped significantly, forcing those who bet on an increase to close their positions. Conversely, short liquidations occur when the price rises sharply, catching traders who bet on a decline off guard. The data from the last 24 hours clearly shows a market that was predominantly positioned for upward movement. The high percentage of long liquidations across ETH, BTC, and XRP indicates a swift downturn that caught a large segment of the leveraged trading community off guard. This often leads to a ‘long squeeze,’ where forced selling from liquidations further exacerbates the price decline, creating a feedback loop. For savvy crypto trading , observing these liquidation trends can offer valuable insights. A high volume of long liquidations might signal that the market was over-extended on the bullish side and could be due for a correction. Conversely, a high volume of short liquidations might indicate an impending upward reversal after a period of bearish sentiment. Navigating the Storm: Essential Crypto Trading Strategies to Avoid Liquidation Understanding liquidation is one thing; avoiding it is another. For anyone engaged in crypto perpetual futures trading, especially with leverage, implementing robust risk management strategies is paramount. The challenges of high volatility and 24/7 markets demand constant vigilance and discipline. Understand and Manage Leverage: The most common cause of liquidation is excessive leverage. While it can amplify gains, it also drastically reduces your margin for error. Start with lower leverage and only increase it as you gain experience and confidence in your risk management. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order is an instruction to your exchange to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain predefined level. This limits your potential losses and can prevent full liquidation, especially during rapid market movements. Maintain Adequate Margin: Always ensure you have sufficient collateral in your futures account. Monitor your margin level closely and be prepared to add more funds (top up your margin) if your position is nearing liquidation. Don’t Over-Position: Avoid putting too much of your capital into a single trade, especially with high leverage. Diversify your portfolio and manage your position sizes relative to your total trading capital. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technical analysis, and sentiment. Unexpected news or shifts in market dynamics can trigger sudden price swings. Practice Emotional Discipline: The fear of missing out (FOMO) and the urge to chase pumps can lead to reckless decisions. Stick to your trading plan and avoid impulsive actions, especially after seeing significant futures liquidation events. While the allure of high returns from crypto perpetual futures is strong, the risks are equally significant. These liquidation events serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of cautious and informed trading practices. They are not just numbers; they represent real financial losses for many traders caught on the wrong side of the market. Conclusion: Learning from the Liquidation Storm The 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation breakdown offers a stark reminder of the inherent risks and rapid shifts within the cryptocurrency market. With hundreds of millions of dollars in positions wiped out, predominantly from long bets, it underscores the need for extreme caution when engaging in leveraged crypto trading . Whether it’s Bitcoin liquidation , Ethereum liquidation , or other altcoins, the message is clear: volatility can be a double-edged sword. By understanding the mechanics of perpetual futures and liquidations, and by diligently applying robust risk management strategies, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters and protect their capital. Always remember that the market rewards patience, discipline, and a deep understanding of its unpredictable nature. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the forced closing of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a required level due to adverse price movements. This happens to prevent the trader from incurring further losses beyond their available margin. Q2: Why were long positions liquidated more often than short positions in this breakdown? The high percentage of long liquidations (e.g., 87.42% for BTC) indicates that the market experienced a significant downward price movement during the 24-hour period. Traders who had opened ‘long’ positions (betting on price increases) were caught off guard by the decline, leading to their positions being forcibly closed. Q3: How can traders avoid futures liquidation? Traders can minimize the risk of futures liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, diversifying their portfolio, and staying informed about market conditions. Emotional discipline is also key to avoiding impulsive decisions. Q4: Does large-scale liquidation always mean a market crash? Not necessarily a full-blown crash, but large-scale liquidations often indicate significant market volatility and can exacerbate price movements. A ‘long squeeze’ (where long liquidations drive prices down further) or a ‘short squeeze’ (where short liquidations drive prices up) can occur, leading to rapid price swings. It signals market stress rather than a guaranteed long-term crash. Q5: What role does leverage play in crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Leverage significantly amplifies both potential gains and losses. The higher the leverage used, the smaller the price movement required to trigger a liquidation. Even a small adverse price swing can wipe out a highly leveraged position, making leverage the primary catalyst for liquidations. Q6: Is it possible to recover funds after a liquidation? Once a position is liquidated, the margin used for that position is lost. Some exchanges might have an ‘insurance fund’ to cover negative balances, but typically, the liquidated funds are gone. It’s crucial to understand that liquidation means the loss of your collateral for that specific trade. Did you find this breakdown of crypto perpetual futures liquidation insightful?

The move suggests persistent bullish momentum following a period of sharp decline earlier this week. As the price inches closer to its all-time high, on-chain data is starting to paint a picture of solid transactional support behind the price movement. In particular, analysts have begun highlighting a divergence between Bitcoin’s market value and its underlying network activity. One such observation comes from CryptoQuant analyst Sunflowr Quant, who shared insights in a recent QuickTake post examining the unusual behavior of the NVT Golden Cross indicator. This metric, typically expected to rise in tandem with price due to its function as a ratio between market cap and transaction volume, is currently declining, which Sunflowr attributes to a significant uptick in on-chain activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside Bitcoin On-Chain Growth Suggests Underlying Network Strength According to Sunflowr, this inverse correlation between the rising BTC price and falling NVT Golden Cross may indicate that the current rally is driven more by actual usage and real transactions on the Bitcoin network rather than speculative trading. “A decline in the NVT ratio during a price increase implies that the transaction volume is rising at a faster pace than the market cap,” he wrote. “This can be interpreted as a sign that the rally is supported by real economic activity.” This observation aligns with the broader sentiment that healthy on-chain growth can serve as a foundation for more sustainable price increases. If transaction volumes are growing organically and not solely from derivatives speculation, it suggests that user adoption and financial utility are contributing to the price strength. Investors closely watching these indicators may find this a favorable environment, though caution remains as other metrics hint at evolving market dynamics. Holder Rotation Signals Potential Shift in Market Participation A separate analysis from CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech sheds light on another dimension of Bitcoin’s current market structure: holder behavior. In a post titled “Holder Rotation,” IT Tech notes that long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 155 days, have recently begun net distribution, meaning they’re selling more than accumulating. Conversely, short-term holders are showing net accumulation behavior once again, a dynamic often seen in late-stage rallies. This shift between long-term and short-term holders has historically served as a warning signal. Similar handoffs were observed in April 2021 and November 2023, both of which preceded local tops or cooling phases. While this doesn’t necessarily confirm a reversal, it highlights the need to monitor supporting metrics such as exchange inflows and funding rates.

That gut-punch of missing the wave is all too familiar. It’s not about luck. It’s about catching the move before it happens. As 2025 approaches, BlockDAG, XRP, Cardano, and Litecoin are sending out signals that are hard to ignore. From upcoming exchange listings to rising market patterns and growing real-world use, these four names are buzzing. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now might be your moment to act before the crowd rushes in. 1. BlockDAG’s No Vesting Offer and Big Exchange Listings Turn Heads BlockDAG (BDAG) is heating up as it approaches its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With 20 exchange listings already confirmed, including names like MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank, the visibility is locked in early. What’s catching even more attention is its limited-time NO VESTING PASS, giving buyers full access to their coins at launch with no lockup. This isn’t just talk. BlockDAG has teamed up with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, blending blockchain with fan experiences like digital tickets, collectibles, and game-day rewards. With over 200,000 holders and $342 million raised in presale, the momentum is real. At $0.0016 now and a fixed listing price of $0.05, the setup hints at a possible 3,000% gain. Some market watchers are calling for $1 in 2025, with longer-term views going as high as $10. For those searching for the top crypto coins to buy now, BlockDAG’s window might be open, but not for long. 2. XRP Eyes Breakout as Whale Activity and Price Targets Rise XRP is back in the spotlight and quickly being mentioned among the top crypto coins to buy now. After Bitcoin’s recent pump, XRP jumped more than 6%, crossing the $2.90 mark. Behind the surge is growing interest from large holders, with whale wallets now holding over 47 billion XRP, a signal that serious activity is heating up. Grayscale has also added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund, and Ripple is working toward a U.S. national bank charter, boosting credibility. With daily trading volume now over 9 billion, analysts are watching closely. Price targets of $3.40 are in sight, with $4.35 and even $8 by 2025 now part of the conversation. 3. Cardano Sees Momentum as DeFi Grows and Signals Flash Green Cardano (ADA) is starting to show real momentum again. After four straight green candles, its price is sitting around $0.73. A major bullish signal came when ADA broke above its 200-day moving average, a key technical point for many traders. At the same time, Cardano’s DeFi presence is growing fast. The total value locked has surged to $326 million, up 21% since the end of June. Whale wallets have been active too, collecting over 1.28 billion ADA. The chart even flashed a golden cross, another signal often tied to price runs. With rising activity and renewed strength, ADA is gaining attention once more, with some targets reaching up to $3.50 by 2026. 4. Litecoin Moves with Bitcoin, Eyes Break Above $100 Litecoin (LTC) is starting to wake up. The price has bounced to around $94 after recovering from support near $77.50. Momentum is turning positive again, backed by technical signs like a fair value gap between $88 and $90 that many see as bullish. What’s also worth noting is LTC’s strong connection with Bitcoin; it moves with BTC 88% of the time. That link gives traders confidence when the larger market turns bullish. If Litecoin breaks past $98.36, the path could open toward $102.93, $107.11, or even a possible 4x surge over time. Wrap Up! Markets are moving fast, and XRP, Cardano, and Litecoin are all flashing signs of growth. XRP is backed by whales and institutions, Cardano is gaining fast in DeFi, and Litecoin is riding strong Bitcoin momentum with bullish signals. BlockDAG is standing out too, with 20 exchange listings confirmed, over $342 million raised, and real-world partnerships in place. The price remains locked at $0.0016, and the no vesting pass gives full access at launch. With interest rising, all four are shaping up to be serious picks among the top crypto coins to buy now .

Imagine nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, 7,743 BTC to be exact, suddenly shifting from a major exchange like Coinbase to an unknown digital vault. This isn’t just a routine transfer; it’s a significant event that captures the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about its potential implications for the broader crypto market impact . What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive Coinbase Transaction On a recent report, the prominent blockchain tracking service Whale Alert flagged an enormous Coinbase transaction . Specifically, 7,743 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $916 million at the time of transfer, was moved from a Coinbase wallet to a newly created, previously unknown address. This kind of large BTC movement is always noteworthy, but its sheer size makes it particularly compelling. For context, such a transfer represents a significant portion of the daily trading volume on many exchanges, highlighting the immense capital controlled by these so-called ‘whales’. Transaction Details: 7,743 BTC Estimated Value: Approximately $916,000,000 Origin: Coinbase exchange wallet Destination: An unknown, new Bitcoin address Reported by: Whale Alert This single transaction underscores the power and influence of individual or institutional holders in the volatile cryptocurrency space. When such a substantial amount of Bitcoin changes hands, especially moving off an exchange, it often signals a strategic maneuver rather than a casual transfer. Why Does a Large BTC Movement Matter to the Crypto Market? The immediate question on everyone’s mind when a large BTC movement occurs is: what does it mean for the crypto market impact ? These massive transfers can be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment. Understanding these potential scenarios is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space. Potential Interpretations: Accumulation for Long-Term Holding: When large amounts of Bitcoin move from an exchange (where they are typically held for trading) to an unknown wallet, it often suggests the owner intends to hold them for the long term, away from immediate trading impulses. This is generally considered a bullish sign, as it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. OTC (Over-The-Counter) Deal: The transfer could be part of an over-the-counter deal, where a large block of Bitcoin is sold directly to an institutional buyer or another large investor, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact. While the sale itself happens off-exchange, the movement of funds to a new wallet might be the settlement of such a deal. Exchange Internal Restructuring: Less likely for an “unknown new wallet,” but exchanges sometimes move funds between their own cold storage or hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, the “unknown new wallet” descriptor usually points away from this. Preparation for Sale: Conversely, the transfer could be a precursor to a large sell-off. If the funds are moved to a different exchange or a wallet linked to an OTC desk, it could signal an impending liquidation. However, moving to an entirely new, unknown wallet typically points to holding. The ambiguity of the “unknown new wallet” adds to the intrigue. Is it a new institutional player entering the market, a seasoned investor rebalancing their portfolio, or something else entirely? The market watches these events closely, as they can sometimes precede significant price swings. Unmasking the Influence of the Bitcoin Whale Who exactly is a Bitcoin whale , and why do their actions command so much attention? In the cryptocurrency lexicon, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding an extremely large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. In Bitcoin’s case, a whale typically holds thousands of BTC. Their sheer capital allows them to make moves that can either absorb significant sell pressure or create it, depending on their intentions. The presence of whales is a double-edged sword for the crypto market: Market Stability vs. Volatility: Whales can provide liquidity and stability by accumulating during downturns. However, a sudden large sell-off by a whale can trigger cascading price drops, leading to increased volatility. Price Discovery: Their large trades can sometimes dictate short-term price movements, making it challenging for smaller investors to predict market direction. Influence on Sentiment: When a whale makes a significant move, it often sparks speculation and analysis among the community, influencing overall market sentiment. This particular Coinbase transaction highlights the power concentration within the Bitcoin ecosystem, where a relatively small number of addresses control a disproportionately large share of the supply. Understanding their behavior is a key aspect of advanced crypto analysis. Leveraging Blockchain Analytics to Track Crypto Transfers How do we even know about such a massive transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet? This is where blockchain analytics comes into play. The transparency of public blockchains like Bitcoin’s allows anyone with the right tools to monitor transactions in real-time. Services like Whale Alert parse this vast amount of data, identifying and reporting significant movements of digital assets. Key Aspects of Blockchain Analytics: On-Chain Data: This refers to all information recorded on the blockchain itself, including transaction amounts, sender and receiver addresses, and timestamps. Wallet Clustering: Analysts use sophisticated algorithms to group addresses that are likely controlled by the same entity (e.g., an exchange, a large investor). This helps identify the source and destination of funds more accurately. Flow Analysis: By tracking the flow of funds over time, analysts can gain insights into market trends, potential illicit activities, or the strategic moves of large holders. Exchange Monitoring: Specific attention is paid to known exchange wallets, as large movements from or to these wallets often signal significant market activity. While the destination wallet in this case is “unknown,” blockchain analytics will continue to monitor it. Any subsequent movements from this wallet could provide further clues about the whale’s intentions and shed more light on the potential crypto market impact of this colossal transfer. Navigating the Potential Crypto Market Impact and Future Outlook The immediate crypto market impact of such a large BTC movement is often one of speculation and heightened awareness. While the market didn’t experience an immediate dramatic price swing following this particular transfer, the underlying sentiment and long-term implications are what analysts are focused on. If this transfer signifies accumulation, it could be a quiet vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future, potentially contributing to a supply squeeze over time. Conversely, if it’s a prelude to an OTC sale, the direct market impact might be minimal, but the change in ownership structure is still significant. What to Watch For: Further Movements from the Unknown Wallet: Will the funds remain dormant, or will they be moved to another exchange, an institutional custodian, or a DeFi protocol? Future activity will be key to understanding the whale’s strategy. Market Reactions: While not immediate, sustained accumulation by whales can contribute to bullish trends, while distribution could signal a period of consolidation or correction. On-Chain Metrics: Keep an eye on other on-chain indicators, such as exchange reserves, miner outflows, and overall network activity, to piece together a more complete picture of market health. The actions of a Bitcoin whale , particularly involving a major platform like Coinbase, serve as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. For investors, staying informed about these significant crypto transfers and understanding the tools of blockchain analytics can provide a valuable edge in making informed decisions. In conclusion, the recent transfer of 7,743 BTC, valued at an astounding $916 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of the cryptocurrency market. This large BTC movement , tracked meticulously through blockchain analytics , underscores the profound influence wielded by a single Bitcoin whale . While the immediate intentions behind this massive Coinbase transaction remain shrouded in mystery, its potential crypto market impact is undeniable. Whether it signals long-term accumulation, an an OTC deal, or a strategic repositioning, such events reinforce the importance of vigilance and informed analysis in the fast-paced world of digital assets. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the actions of these significant players will continue to shape trends and influence the trajectory of Bitcoin and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin whale? A1: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to influence market prices with their trades. Their actions are closely watched due to the potential impact on market dynamics. Q2: Why is a transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet significant? A2: Transfers from major exchanges like Coinbase to unknown wallets are significant because they often indicate a strategic move by a large holder. It can signal long-term accumulation (moving funds off-exchange for safekeeping), an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, or a re-positioning of assets, all of which can have a ripple effect on market sentiment and supply dynamics. Q3: How are these large crypto transfers tracked? A3: These transfers are tracked using blockchain analytics tools and services like Whale Alert. Since Bitcoin’s blockchain is public, all transactions are recorded and visible. Analytics firms use sophisticated techniques to monitor large movements, identify known wallets (like exchanges), and cluster addresses to gain insights into fund flows. Q4: What is the potential crypto market impact of such a large BTC movement? A4: The potential impact can vary. If the whale is accumulating for long-term holding, it’s generally seen as bullish, reducing circulating supply. If it’s part of an OTC sale, the direct market impact might be minimal but signifies a change in ownership. In some cases, such movements could precede a large sell-off, leading to price volatility. The “unknown” destination often suggests a holding strategy. Q5: Should I be concerned about Bitcoin whale movements? A5: While whale movements can cause short-term volatility, they are a natural part of any market with significant capital concentration. For most retail investors, it’s more important to focus on long-term investment strategies and risk management rather than reacting to every large transfer. However, understanding whale behavior can provide valuable context for market trends. Did this deep dive into the world of Bitcoin whales and massive crypto transfers pique your interest?

New meme acronym: PARC– Palantir, Applovin, Robinhood and Coinbase (PARC)v Coinbase, Applovin, Robinhood, Palantir (CARP) which should it be?? @SquawkStreet . — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) July 14, 2025 Cramer was the one who coined the FAANG acronym back during the pandemic era for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. That helped him and the financial news media to easily get a handle on some of the high tech sector’s most capitalized and best performing stocks. In other words, a 2025 era pivot to cross stitching Coinbase, Robinhood, Palantir, and Apploving into one word could mean Cramer is feeling bullish about the crypto industry. But one replier on the comment thread wrote, “Coinbase, Robinhood, Applovin, Palantir (CRAP) what do we think?” New PARC Tag From the Man Who Coined FAANG Coinbase is the leading US crypto exchange with shares up over +50% from Jan. 1 so far in 2025 (at the time of this writing). Robinhood is a US commission free stock trading app and that offers low-fee cryptocurrency trading and staking for ETH and SOL. Meanwhile, Coinbase is doing very well raking in fees from the ongoing Bitcoin bull run. Even the Czech central bank recently disclosed it added $18 million worth of the stock to its balance sheet. Palantir is a US signals intelligence company that develops Internet-based applications for the US intelligence community, police forces, and military as well as private clients. It is leading the charge to use blockchain and AI together to solve complex problems. So, has Cramer suddenly seen the light and now he’s floating a trial ballon to X followers to promote crypto stocks? He’s gone in some recent months from trashing Bitcoin to recommending it on the air. Also noteworthy in this context, on Monday Cramer used an interesting metaphor for deal-making on Wall Street on his program, one that rhymes with one of the top 3 cryptocurrencies by market value, XRP: “You don’t get a wave of deals out of nowhere. You get a ripple, and then ever bigger waves. Right now, we’re in the ripple stage. That’s when it’s best to do some buying.” That’s very bullish for Bitcoin unless Cramer is trying to use the power of “Inverse Cramer” to give cryptocurrencies the hug of death. Weird New Inverse Cramer Form Emerges Incidentally, at least two crypto news media outlets scrambled a message from the Mad Money host into a different sort of Inverse Kramer. Some outlets misreported on X on Monday that Cramer predicted Jamie Dimon will “go all in on crypto,” in another segment on CNBC. TODAY: Jim Cramer predicts JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, will “go all in on crypto”. pic.twitter.com/Geco7OhfgY — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) July 14, 2025 What Cramer actually said was: “I’d like to be the bookie on when he goes all in on crypto.” In other words, Cramer will take your money all day if you want to bet him to have to pay you back with a fee for odds if Jamie Dimon will go all in on crypto. That’s a reasonable position to take in light of that JP Morgan already has a nice moat-protected competitive advantage in finance that doesn’t require going all in on crypto. Though, of course, by the power of Inverse Cramer, this does make it more likely that Jamie Dimon will start selling Pudgy Penguins later this year.

Cardano is pushing toward the $1.62 mark after a breakout, while Bittensor is rebounding with force, nearly doubling from its June lows. Both are showing strong technical setups and surging trading volume. While ADA and TAO are making headlines, BlockDAG is building momentum on a different level. Its growth is powered by high-impact sports partnerships and a limited-time GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer that is drawing serious attention. With support from UFC’s Alex Pereira, Inter Milan, and the Seattle Orcas, BlockDAG (BDAG) is expanding beyond the crypto crowd. Curious where it fits into this rally? Let’s break it down. Cardano Eyes $1.62 as Breakout Momentum Accelerates Cardano is on fire this week, jumping nearly 30% and dominating the charts as a crypto top gainer. With ADA trading around $0.74 and a $26 billion market cap, it is closing in on Tron’s position and capturing serious attention. The breakout follows a strong technical setup, including a cup-and-handle formation and a bullish triangle pattern. Volume is surging, up over 16% in the past 24 hours, as analysts begin to chart ambitious targets. Price calls are now circling $0.86, $1.62, and even $2.65. If momentum holds, Cardano could be setting up for one of its biggest runs of the year. Bittensor Breaks $400 Wall, Targets $500 and Beyond Bittensor is making a bold move as it rockets past the $400 mark, now trading between $420 and $435. TAO has nearly doubled from its June lows and just posted a 6% daily jump alongside an 80% volume explosion. The breakout has flipped old resistance into support, and momentum is building fast. With bullish signals flashing, the next price levels on the radar are $500 to $520, followed by a stretch goal of $620 to $650. Long-shot calls even put TAO at $1,000 if this surge continues. As long as it stays above $415, the rally looks alive and well. BlockDAG Scores Global Wins With Major Seattle Sports Partnerships BlockDAG is racing ahead as a crypto top gainer, thanks to headline-making partnerships and a powerful GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer. UFC champion Alex Pereira has joined as brand ambassador, bringing worldwide recognition and serious star power. His backing adds credibility to BlockDAG’s bold mission to reshape blockchain and digital finance. The excitement continues in Europe, where BlockDAG is now the official blockchain partner of Inter Milan. This legendary football club offers huge exposure through stadium banners, LED boards, and online campaigns. With access to exclusive events and media integration, BlockDAG is embedding itself deep into the world of elite football. In the United States, the project is partnering with two breakout sports franchises, the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. These deals go beyond branding and introduce NFTs, fan tokens, and digital experiences that give sports fans new ways to connect with their teams both online and at games. Financial momentum matches the brand firepower. BlockDAG has raised $342 million and sold 24 billion coins. While the Batch 29 price sits at $0.0276, the limited-time GLOBAL LAUNCH release offers the same BDAG for just $0.0016 until August 11. That sets up a potential 3,025% return, putting BlockDAG firmly in the spotlight as one of the most watched projects in crypto. Quick Breakdown While ADA and TAO continue their impressive climbs, BlockDAG is building momentum through a different kind of breakthrough. With backing from global icons like Alex Pereira, Inter Milan, and the 2 Seattle teams, it is not only growing fast but embedding itself into real culture and sports. At the heart of this rise is the limited-time GLOBAL LAUNCH release, locking BDAG at just $0.0016. With a $0.05 listing price ahead, that opens the door to a 3,025% return. Combined with $342 million raised and 24 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the biggest crypto top gainer of the moment.

However, a recent HTX transfer has caught the eye of many in the digital asset space, sparking discussions and analysis across the community. Six hours ago, HTX, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, moved a substantial 50,600 ETH, valued at an impressive $181 million, directly to Binance. This isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a significant event that warrants a closer look, especially for anyone navigating the dynamic waters of the crypto market. What Happened with the Recent HTX Transfer? The details of this particular HTX transfer are crucial for understanding its potential impact. According to on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, this large movement of Ethereum followed a familiar pattern, suggesting a calculated action rather than a random occurrence. Let’s break down the sequence of events: Initial Withdrawal: The journey of these 50,600 ETH began with a withdrawal from Aave, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. This withdrawal was initiated by what’s identified as the ‘HTX Recovery Wallet’. This detail alone raises questions about the nature of these funds and their prior state. Internal Movement: Following the withdrawal, the ETH was then moved to HTX’s hot wallet. Hot wallets are typically used for more immediate and frequent transactions due to their online accessibility, contrasting with cold wallets used for long-term storage. Final Destination: The ultimate step saw the entire sum of 50,600 ETH transferred from HTX’s hot wallet directly to Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This systematic flow, from a recovery wallet to a hot wallet and then to another major exchange, indicates a deliberate strategy. The sheer volume of the ETH transfer makes it a notable event, compelling market watchers to consider its implications. Why Does an ETH Transfer to Binance Matter? When a significant amount of cryptocurrency, particularly Ethereum, moves between major exchanges like HTX and Binance , it often signals more than just a routine transaction. Such large-scale movements can have several ripple effects across the broader crypto ecosystem: Market Liquidity: Transfers to exchanges typically increase the supply of that asset available for trading. While 50,600 ETH is a large sum, its impact on overall ETH liquidity depends on the market’s depth. However, it can influence short-term trading dynamics. Potential Selling Pressure: One common interpretation of large transfers to exchanges is that the funds are being prepared for sale. If this ETH is intended for liquidation, it could contribute to selling pressure, potentially affecting Ethereum’s price. Conversely, it could be for arbitrage, or internal rebalancing. Exchange Health and Strategy: For HTX, this transfer could be part of a broader strategy, perhaps related to internal rebalancing, managing liabilities, or preparing for new initiatives. For Binance, receiving such a large sum could indicate its continued role as a primary liquidity hub. Investor Sentiment: Large, unexplained movements can sometimes cause uncertainty among investors, leading to speculation and shifts in sentiment. Transparency around such transfers is often sought after to prevent misinterpretation. Understanding these potential implications is key to deciphering the larger narrative within the crypto space. It’s not just about the value, but the context and potential consequences. Decoding Large Crypto Transfers: Insights from On-Chain Analysis The ability to track and interpret movements on the blockchain, known as on-chain analysis , has become an indispensable tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and professionals alike. This recent HTX to Binance transfer is a prime example of why on-chain data is so valuable. On-chain analysts like @EmberCN provide crucial transparency in a market that can often feel opaque. By observing wallet addresses, transaction volumes, and flow patterns, they can: Identify Trends: Spot recurring patterns in how exchanges, whales, or institutions move funds, as was noted with HTX’s ‘same pattern as before.’ Gauge Market Sentiment: Large inflows to exchanges might suggest impending sell-offs, while large outflows could indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage. Verify Claims: On-chain data can corroborate or refute claims made by exchanges or projects regarding their reserves, transactions, or financial health. Detect Anomalies: Unusual or unexpected transfers can be red flags, prompting further investigation into potential security breaches, market manipulation, or other significant events. In a decentralized ecosystem, on-chain analysis empowers individuals with information that was once exclusive to financial institutions, leveling the playing field for understanding the real-time dynamics of the crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for You? For the average investor or crypto enthusiast, a large ETH transfer like this can feel daunting. However, understanding these events can empower you to make more informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and crypto news sources. Understanding the ‘why’ behind major transfers is more important than just knowing they occurred. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on one asset can expose you to greater risk during periods of market volatility triggered by large transfers or other news. Practice Risk Management: Set clear entry and exit points for your investments. Don’t let large market movements, whether real or speculative, dictate impulsive decisions. Understand Exchange Behavior: Recognize that exchanges regularly move funds for various operational reasons. Not every large transfer signifies an impending crash or surge. However, consistent patterns, as seen with HTX, warrant attention. While a single large transfer might not drastically alter the long-term trajectory of Ethereum or the entire crypto market, it serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness and constant flux within this innovative financial landscape. Conclusion The recent HTX transfer of 50,600 ETH to Binance is more than just a number; it’s a critical data point for anyone watching the pulse of the crypto world. From the meticulous on-chain analysis revealing its patterned movement to the broader implications for market liquidity and sentiment, such large transactions underscore the importance of vigilance and informed understanding. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, the ability to interpret these fundamental blockchain movements will remain a key skill for navigating its opportunities and challenges. Keeping an eye on these significant shifts, powered by tools like on-chain analysis, empowers us all to better understand the forces shaping the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an HTX transfer? An HTX transfer refers to any movement of cryptocurrency assets initiated from or to the HTX cryptocurrency exchange, which is a global digital asset trading platform. Q2: Why did HTX transfer $181M in ETH to Binance? While the exact reason is not publicly disclosed, large transfers like this can occur for various reasons, including internal rebalancing of exchange hot and cold wallets, preparing for large client withdrawals, facilitating institutional trades, or strategic asset management between exchanges. On-chain analysis suggests it followed a ‘same pattern as before’, indicating a recurring operational procedure. Q3: What is on-chain analysis and why is it important for crypto transfers? On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and token movements. It’s crucial because it provides transparency into asset flows, helps identify trends, gauge market sentiment, verify claims, and detect unusual activities, offering insights that traditional financial markets often lack. Q4: How does a large ETH transfer to Binance impact the crypto market? A large ETH transfer to Binance can potentially increase the ETH supply available for trading on the exchange, which might lead to increased selling pressure if the funds are intended for liquidation. It can also affect market liquidity, influence short-term price movements, and impact overall investor sentiment by sparking speculation about the reasons behind the transfer. Q5: Is this HTX transfer a sign of market manipulation? Not necessarily. While large transfers can sometimes be associated with market manipulation, they are also a routine part of exchange operations. Without further context or evidence, it’s difficult to conclude manipulation. On-chain analysts often look for consistent patterns, which in this case, suggests a recurring operational move by HTX. Q6: How can I track similar large crypto transfers myself? You can track large crypto transfers by using various blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms (e.g., Etherscan, Nansen, Arkham Intelligence, etc.). Many crypto news outlets and on-chain analysts on social media platforms like X also highlight and interpret such significant movements.

February 17, 2025 – Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (STJ) Subjects Crypto to Seizure in Enforcement Proceedings The Superior Court of Justice in Brazil affirmed that Brazil’s lower courts subpoena crypto exchanges to trace and seize cryptocurrencies held by the debtor. This law was enacted after failing to identify a debtor’s traditional financial assets. It allows the courts to seize crypto assets potentially held by debtors. Unfolding Crypto Regulation in Brazil 2025 Brazil has enacted foundational legislation and is moving toward detailed operational rules and licensing requirements for cryptocurrency in 2025. The procedure is to develop recent implementations and finalize them after thorough examinations. Some key developments in crypto regulations are: The BVAL (Law no. 14,478/22 ) is the first crypto asset law in Brazil, which was implemented in June 2023. It redefines the crypto space in Brazil by defining ‘virtual asset service providers’ (VASPs) as a legal entity under the permitted conditions. BVAL had accompanying laws to enhance the framework for cryptocurrency, which were set to be published in 2025 after public consultations to gather feedback, which ended in February 2025. The Central Bank is leading this development, offering detailed guidelines for consumers in crypto trading. Brazil has enacted the licensing of crypto business, which requires registering as Digital Asset Service Providers (DASP) operating with the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) authorization. The future regulations in this category are anticipated to be finalized in 2025. After finalizing the new regulations in DASP, it will enhance consumer rights and mandate strong cybersecurity standards. In addition, it will require clear risk disclosures to prevent consumers from any tricks laid by the fraudsters. After gaining a boost in stablecoin utility, further regulations involve ensuring transparency, anti-money laundering, and curbing tax evasion. It aims to bring a long-term stable market for crypto with KYC and AML requirements for users. Binance kicks off the ""Blockchain on the Road"" tour in Brazil, partnering with Blockchain Rio to educate 2,300 students across 18 universities in 12 cities. From São Paulo to Iguazu Falls, we're spreading blockchain knowledge and driving adoption. Dive into the action … pic.twitter.com/uqEr9OcIOS — Binance (@binance) April 14, 2025 Binance has launched the ‘Blockchain on the road’ event, in which Brazil is likely to see a significant growth in blockchain education. The event will be held from 5 to 7 August 2025, focusing on education and networking leaders and entrepreneurs emerging in the technological and tokenization arena. These are the major developments Brazil has made in cryptocurrency, compiled with global standards set by legal bodies. Who Guides Crypto in Brazil? Brazil’s crypto regulations are guided by international standards, particularly the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. The FATF standards include the travel rule, which allows obtaining and transmitting information on both the originator and beneficiary in digital trading. It also sets rules for combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) handles the provision of Virtual Digital Assets in Brazil. It oversees the financial aspect, including licensing related to cryptocurrency. But it has not yet published specific rules for provision or compliance rules for crypto trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) plays a crucial role in regulating crypto, which is classified as a security. For example, if a digital token is classified as security, it must comply with CVM rules for issuance and distribution after registration. These agencies applied taxation to crypto in Brazil, offering an enhanced and safer space for consumers and sellers. Crypto License in Brazil in 2025 Brazil does not have a specific ‘crypto license’ as of 2025; however, entities providing crypto-related services must register with the Central Bank and comply with the framework established by Law No. 14.478/2022. The law came into effect on June 20, 2023. Crypto Tax in Brazil The Federal Revenue Services (RFB) has stated that blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are required to be publicly visible. A Brazilian individual is required to report cryptocurrency profits and capital gains by the last working day of April. Selling crypto or trading it for another crypto is subject to capital gains tax, while receiving cryptocurrency as payment is subject to income tax. RFB has not yet disclosed a guideline on stolen or lost crypto. The previous progressive/tiered regime is replaced by this flat rate of 17.5% and the previous exemption for monthly gains under 35,000 reais has also been abolished. A table is given below to assist calculation of crypto tax. Category Tax Rate Details All Capital Gains on Crypto 17.5% Applies to all crypto-related capital gains, no matter the volume or origin. Tax Exemption None All gains (big or small) are subject to tax Tax Reporting Must be repotted quarterly Capital gains must be reported four times per year. All disposals must be declared for each quarter. Summary of crypto tax in 2025: Category Threshold per month Tax rate Capital gains (domestic) R$35,000 15%-22.5% Capital gains (foreign exchange) R$6000 0%022.5% Income from crypto Any amount 7.5%27.5% Crypto Adoption Rate in Brazil 2025 Brazil’s crypto adoption rate is constantly growing in 2025, and presently it is projected to reach 31.9 million users. The user penetration rate is also expected to reach around 14.58% with a significant growing interest in cryptocurrency among Brazilians. Brazil was one of the top 10 countries in the world with leading crypto adoption. It is believed that Brazil will skyrocket the crypto adoption rate with revenue of US$353.5 million by 2030. In addition, the compound annual growth will rise up to 16.5% in the cryptocurrency market from 2025-2030. With new regulations and an enhanced framework, Brazil is the fastest-growing regional market in Latin America, with growing development in crypto assets. Presently, around 17.5% of the population has adopted crypto, and it is anticipated to rise further in the upcoming days. Brazil Government Stance on Crypto As of 2025, the Brazilian government has not disclosed a significant amount of crypto holdings. However, with growing user penetration in crypto among Brazilians, the estimated number seems to be sizable. The Brazilian government has been highly active in developing crypto regulations, showing a positive attitude towards blockchain and other technological and digital assets. The country is likely to launch a “Real Digital”, Brazil’s central bank digital currency (CBDC). In March 2025, the government representative and the executive branch held a discussion that involved the strategic value of Bitcoin. However, it does not confirm any actual holdings or reserve policy of cryptocurrency in the Brazilian government’s hands. Conclusion Brazil is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in Latin America. The government plans to improve regulations and expand its crypto holdings. Although exact figures are unknown, recent developments suggest significant accumulation of digital assets. Brazil is expected to set new records and reach new highs in the crypto market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Some analysts suggest that if bullish momentum continues, the altcoin will run to new highs once this level is recovered. Related Reading: 2025 Crypto Thefts Spike: Stolen Funds Hit $2.7 Billion In H1– Report Solana Attempts $180 Reclaim As the crypto market capitalization nears the $4 trillion mark and Bitcoin (BTC) makes new all-time highs (ATHs), Solana, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, is retesting crucial levels after climbing nearly 10% over the past week. The cryptocurrency has been compressing between two key levels since the Q2 recovery, trading between the $140-$180 mark for over two months. However, last month’s geopolitical tensions saw SOL briefly lose its local range and retest the $120-$130 area. Amid the July rally, Solana has reclaimed its local range, climbing to the upper boundary and attempting to break above key $180 resistance. Analyst Crypto Jelle noted that, just like Ethereum’s (ETH) $4,000 barrier, this area is the “final major level for bears to defend.” This has been a key level during this cycle, serving as a major bounce area during the Q4 2024 and early 2025 rally. Additionally, it became the most crucial resistance after losing this area in late February, with multiple failed attempts to reclaim it over the past months. Reclaiming this level could propel the token to the $200 mark and set the stage for a continuation to higher levels, the analyst affirmed. Meanwhile, market watcher Froggy highlighted that Solana retested this key zone on Friday, “signaling strong bullish intent.” Nonetheless, the altcoin fell below this level after hitting its two-month high of $184, trading within the $177-179 price range for the past several hours. To the analyst, “as long as $168 holds, a move toward $186–$188 remains likely.” SOL Preparing For Price Discovery? According to Daan Crypto Trades, if SOL breaks above and holds the crucial level, the next area of interest would be around the $220 mark, followed by the $260 barrier. The trader explained that SOL reclaimed the Daily 200 Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) earlier this week, which led to the ongoing retest of the $180 area. He also noted that memecoins are “running well” as SOL-based tokens in the sector have seen a 13.3% weekly increase, according to CoinGecko data. “That generally puts some bid behind SOL,” Daan said, adding that, “As long as memes run, I think SOL does too.” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Alex Clay highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been in a bullish megaphone formation for over a year, and “Once Large Caps catch the Real Bull Run,” Solana will lead the market.

Crypto trading became legal in 2018 when New Zealand recognized it as property for tax purposes. The nation opts for clever crypto approaches, as the interest in digital asset investments is growing rapidly. As of 2025, New Zealand is tightening its hold on security to enhance transparency and combat tax evasion in the region. While the country has not regulated specific crypto laws this year, it has indirectly impacted crypto with fintech laws. Table of contents Crypto regulations in New Zealand 2025 What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Crypto Adoption in New Zealand 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto regulations in New Zealand 2025 July 9, 2025 – Ban of Crypto ATMs and Cap International Transfers At NZ$5,000 The New Zealand government took a bold step to ban crypto ATMs and cap international cash transfers at $5,000. After the officials of New Zealand noted that crypto kiosks mainly attract users seeking anonymity to covert illegal funds, the government took an immediate decision to ban Bitcoin banks. April 1, 2026– Introduction of OECD in Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) CARF, through the Taxation Act 2025, will come into effect in 2025. It aims at enhancing transparency and combating tax evasion in the crypto space while establishing rules for crypto asset services providers (CASPs). Crypto transaction reporting obligations for CASPs will be mandatory under this law . March 31, 2025- Conduct of Financial Institutions (CoFI) Under this legislation, fair conduct principles for financial institutions, including crypto, are compulsory. While this legislation does not directly regulate crypto as a financial product, it does impact how financial institutions dealing with crypto assets conduct themselves. March 2025- Financial Markets Authority (FMA) Regulatory Sandbox FMA announced a regulatory sandbox for 2025, where fintech companies, including developing blockchain corporations, can test innovative products under supervision. It also fosters collaboration between the government and the crypto industry, promoting consumer protection and market integrity. March 29, 2025- Consumer and Product Data Act This law introduces a legislated consumer data right (CDR) in the financial sector. While this law does not directly regulate crypto, it can indirectly impact data rights and data sharing in the digital industry and blockchain developments. What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? The Financial Market Authority (FMA) is the key regulator of cryptocurrency and digital assets in New Zealand. Currently, the agency is focusing on licensing and tax regimes while releasing warnings against crypto scams in the region. The agency released a set of crypto scams in New Zealand while suggesting some tips for investments to avoid such situations. One of the biggest crypto risks in New Zealand, according to the FMA, is the inability to find out the entity offering services. FMA said that due to big overseas crypto exchanges, it is hard to find out who is offering, buying, selling, or exchanging crypto, putting the assets at risk of theft. It stated– “Because it is decentralised by nature, there’s no control by a single entity such as a government, bank, or financial institution – there are no restrictions on who can issue them.” Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Licensing: While there are no specific crypto licenses in New Zealand , crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and wallet service providers must register with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) as financial service providers (FSPs) to obtain a crypto license to continue operations. Compliance: CASPs, wallet service providers, and businesses involved with crypto must comply with anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CFT), and the know-your-customer (KYC) obligations. Reporting: Entities providing digital asset services may be required to report their transaction and other information to FMC, especially if any suspicious activity is discovered. Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Capital Gains Tax (CGT): CGT does not apply to crypto in New Zealand, as it considers crypto as property. Income Tax: Earning and disposing of crypto is subject to general income tax in New Zealand. The key advisor on government tax policies in New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), said in a statement – “If you acquire crypto assets to dispose of them, you need to pay income tax on any profit you make. For example, if you buy or mine crypto assets to sell or exchange them. If you make a loss when you sell your crypto asset, you may be able to claim this loss.” Income tax bracket Annual Income Rate (2024-2025) Tax Rate Annual Income Rate (2025-2026) Up to $14,000 10.5% Up to $15,600 Up to $14,001 – $15,600 12.82% – $15,601–$48,000 17.5% $15,601 – $53,500 $48,001 – $53,500 21.64% – $53,501–$70,000 30% $53,501 – $78,100 $70,001 – $78,100 30.99% – $78,101–$180,000 33% $78,101 – $180,000 Over $180,000 39% $180,001+ Crypto Adoption in New Zealand 2025 User Penetration Rate: Currently, the user penetration rate is projected to be 33.59% and is forecasted to increase to 34.78% by 2026. The number of crypto users is expected to reach 1.84 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: In 2025, the crypto revenue is projected to reach US$174.1 million, which is anticipated to show an annual growth of 15.37%, resulting in a projected total amount of US$200.8 million by 2026. Crypto Holdings: No public information on the government’s crypto holdings in New Zealand is available; no indication or evidence that the government is investing or holding any digital assets. Conclusion Despite legal uncertainties, the crypto market in New Zealand is growing as the popularity of digital assets has spread worldwide. The government of New Zealand is currently taking a “wait and see” approach to cryptocurrency, not providing much clarity in the regulations. If the country provides legal transparency on digital assets, it may boost the adoption rate and expand the national economy.

On July 18, these groundbreaking investment vehicles recorded a staggering $363.57 million in net inflows, extending their winning streak to twelve consecutive trading days. This consistent influx of capital into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is not just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. For those closely watching the cryptocurrency space, these sustained Bitcoin ETF Inflows represent a pivotal moment. They signify a maturing market where traditional finance is not just observing, but actively participating, channeling significant capital into the digital realm. This article will delve into the details of these recent flows, explore the driving forces behind this phenomenon, and discuss what it means for the future of Cryptocurrency Investment . What’s Driving the Phenomenal Rise in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The journey of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs began with much anticipation and, initially, some volatility following their launch in January. However, after an initial period of adjustments, these ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience and an undeniable appeal to a wide range of investors. The recent twelve-day streak of net inflows highlights a fundamental shift in market sentiment and investment behavior. One of the primary drivers behind this sustained interest is the accessibility and regulatory clarity that ETFs offer. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, which can be daunting for traditional investors due to concerns about security, custody, and regulatory uncertainty, spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a familiar, regulated wrapper. Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through their existing brokerage accounts, simplifying the process immensely. Leading the charge in these inflows is BlackRock’s IBIT, which on July 18 alone saw an astounding $496.88 million in inflows. BlackRock, a titan in the asset management industry, brings unparalleled brand trust and distribution networks. Their aggressive marketing and robust infrastructure have clearly resonated with both retail and institutional clients, making IBIT a dominant force in the nascent spot Bitcoin ETF market. This strong performance by major players like BlackRock is a clear indicator of the burgeoning interest in institutional crypto adoption . Diving Deep into the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows Data Let’s break down the figures from July 18 to understand the nuances of these significant Bitcoin ETF Inflows . While the overall picture is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals interesting dynamics among the various funds. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows (July 18): Total Net Inflows: $363.57 million Consecutive Positive Flow Days: 12 Individual ETF Performance: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (July 18) IBIT BlackRock +$496.88 million BTCW WisdomTree +$3.11 million GBTC Grayscale -$81.29 million ARKB Ark Invest -$33.61 million FBTC Fidelity -$17.94 million BITB Bitwise -$1.92 million HODL VanEck -$1.66 million (Data shared by Trader T on X) As the table clearly illustrates, BlackRock’s IBIT is the undeniable leader, capturing the lion’s share of new money. This indicates strong confidence in BlackRock’s offering and its ability to attract substantial capital. WisdomTree’s BTCW also recorded a modest positive inflow, contributing to the overall net positive figure. On the flip side, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to experience net outflows. This trend is not new and is largely attributed to its conversion from a trust to an ETF. Many investors who held GBTC at a discount before its conversion are now taking profits or rotating into other, often lower-fee, spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT or FBTC. Similarly, other prominent ETFs like Ark Invest’s ARKB, Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL also saw modest outflows on this particular day. Despite these individual outflows, the overwhelming positive inflows into IBIT ensure the overall market remains in a strong accumulation phase for Bitcoin. The Broader Impact: Reshaping Cryptocurrency Investment Landscape The consistent positive flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just financial metrics; they are reshaping the entire landscape of Cryptocurrency Investment . For years, Bitcoin was largely considered a niche asset, primarily traded by tech-savvy individuals or early adopters. The advent of regulated ETFs has changed this perception dramatically, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. How ETFs are transforming the investment landscape: Democratization of Access: ETFs make it easier for retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as setting up digital wallets or managing private keys. Institutional Gateways: They provide a compliant and familiar vehicle for large institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, and wealth management firms, to allocate capital to Bitcoin. This influx of institutional money adds significant liquidity and stability to the market. Increased Legitimacy: The approval and subsequent success of these ETFs by regulatory bodies like the SEC lend significant legitimacy to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, signaling its maturation as a recognized asset class. Price Discovery and Stability: As more capital flows into regulated products, it can contribute to more efficient price discovery and potentially reduce the extreme volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. This institutional embrace is akin to what happened with gold ETFs decades ago, which played a crucial role in making gold a widely accepted and easily tradable asset. Bitcoin ETFs are poised to do the same for digital assets, integrating them further into global financial portfolios. Institutional Crypto Adoption: A Game Changer? The relentless inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a clear testament to the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption . This is arguably the most significant development in the cryptocurrency space since Bitcoin’s inception. When financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest commit substantial resources and actively compete for market share, it sends a powerful message to the entire financial world. Why is institutional adoption so crucial? Massive Capital Infusion: Institutions manage trillions of dollars in assets. Even a small allocation from these funds can represent billions flowing into the crypto market, providing immense liquidity and upward price pressure. Validation and Trust: The involvement of regulated, reputable institutions helps build trust among more conservative investors and traditional financial advisors who might have previously viewed crypto as too risky or speculative. Market Maturation: Institutional participation often brings with it increased demand for robust infrastructure, better custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks, and more sophisticated financial products, all of which contribute to the overall maturation of the digital asset ecosystem. Influence on Policy: As institutions gain a vested interest in the crypto market, they are likely to advocate for more favorable and clear regulatory policies, which can further accelerate growth and innovation. This shift indicates that Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset but is increasingly being viewed as a strategic component in diversified portfolios, potentially acting as a hedge against inflation or a store of value alongside traditional assets. The implications for the broader digital assets market are profound, paving the way for similar products and increased interest in other cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Management As US Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract significant capital, the landscape of Digital Asset Management is rapidly evolving. This new era presents both exciting opportunities and notable challenges for investors and financial professionals alike. Challenges Ahead: Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented globally. Future regulations could impact market dynamics. Market Volatility: Despite increasing institutionalization, Bitcoin and other digital assets can still experience significant price swings. Investors need to be prepared for this inherent volatility. Education Gap: Many traditional investors and advisors still lack a deep understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, necessitating ongoing education. Security Concerns: While ETFs mitigate some direct security risks, the underlying digital asset ecosystem still faces threats from hacks and scams, which can indirectly impact market sentiment. Opportunities for Investors: Diversification: Bitcoin can offer diversification benefits to a traditional portfolio, given its low correlation with traditional asset classes during certain periods. Growth Potential: As the digital economy expands, Bitcoin and other digital assets are poised for continued growth, driven by technological innovation and increasing adoption. Innovation: The influx of institutional capital can spur further innovation in the digital asset space, leading to new products, services, and use cases. Actionable Insights for Investors: For those considering or already invested in Bitcoin ETFs, here are some key actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the specific ETF you are investing in, its fees, and its underlying methodology. Understand the Risks: While ETFs offer convenience, they still carry the market risks associated with Bitcoin. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations, can help mitigate the impact of volatility. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors that could influence digital asset prices. Consult a Financial Advisor: For complex financial planning, seeking advice from a professional who understands digital assets can be invaluable. Conclusion: A Bullish Horizon for Bitcoin and Digital Assets The consistent and substantial inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , particularly the impressive performance of BlackRock’s IBIT, underscore a powerful narrative: Bitcoin is firmly establishing its place in the mainstream financial world. The $363.57 million net inflow on July 18, extending a twelve-day positive streak, is more than just a fleeting trend; it’s a clear indicator of growing institutional crypto adoption and a burgeoning confidence in Cryptocurrency Investment . While challenges remain, the ease of access provided by these ETFs, combined with the increasing legitimacy conferred by major financial institutions, paints a bullish picture for the future of Digital Asset Management . As more traditional capital flows into this space, we can expect greater market maturity, stability, and innovation. This isn’t just about Bitcoin; it’s about the broader evolution of finance, where digital assets are becoming an undeniable and integral part of investment portfolios worldwide. The journey is far from over, but the current trajectory suggests an exciting and transformative era ahead for the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without having to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Shares of the ETF can be bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges. Q2: Why are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs seeing such significant inflows? The significant inflows are driven by several factors: increased investor confidence, the convenience and regulatory clarity offered by ETFs, the participation of major financial institutions like BlackRock, and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for diversification within traditional investment portfolios. Q3: Which Bitcoin ETF is currently performing best in terms of inflows? As of recent data, BlackRock’s IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust) has consistently led the market in terms of net inflows, attracting the largest share of new capital compared to other US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Q4: What is the significance of Grayscale’s GBTC experiencing outflows? Grayscale’s GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) experiencing outflows is primarily due to its conversion from a trust to an ETF. Many investors who held GBTC at a discount before the conversion are now taking profits, or rotating their investments into other newly launched, often lower-fee, spot Bitcoin ETFs. Q5: How do Bitcoin ETFs affect the price of Bitcoin? Bitcoin ETFs can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price by increasing demand. As more investors buy ETF shares, the ETF issuers must purchase underlying Bitcoin to back those shares, creating consistent buying pressure on the spot market. This increased demand can lead to price appreciation and potentially reduced volatility due to greater liquidity. Q6: Is investing in Bitcoin ETFs safe? While Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and more secure way to gain exposure to Bitcoin compared to direct ownership, they are still subject to market risks. The value of your investment will fluctuate with the price of Bitcoin, which can be highly volatile. It’s crucial to understand these risks and only invest what you can afford to lose.

U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs are making headlines, demonstrating a remarkable surge in investor confidence. On July 18, these groundbreaking investment vehicles recorded a staggering combined net inflow of $404.54 million, marking an incredible eleventh consecutive trading day of positive flows, according to data shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X. This sustained momentum isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful signal about the growing mainstream acceptance and institutional appetite for digital assets, particularly Ethereum. If you’ve been watching the crypto market, you know this kind of consistent positive movement is a major development, and it’s time to dive into what these significant Ethereum inflows truly mean for the future of digital finance. What’s Fueling the Ethereum Inflows Frenzy? The recent data paints a clear picture of robust interest in regulated digital asset products. The $404.54 million net inflow on July 18 continues a powerful streak, highlighting a sustained demand for exposure to Ethereum through regulated investment products. This isn’t just about big numbers; it’s about the consistent flow of capital into these newly approved funds, reflecting a strategic shift in how investors are approaching digital asset exposure. Let’s break down the key players contributing to this impressive performance and the specifics of these latest Ethereum inflows . Here’s a snapshot of the top performers and their contributions on July 18: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (July 18) ETHA BlackRock $396.96 million Mini ETH Grayscale $65.25 million ETHW Bitwise $13.03 million ETHV VanEck $2.61 million While most funds enjoyed positive flows, it’s worth noting that some experienced outflows. Fidelity’s FETH saw a net outflow of $45.39 million, and Grayscale’s flagship ETHE recorded an outflow of $27.92 million. This is often part of the natural rebalancing as investors diversify or shift holdings between different fund providers, especially as new, more efficient options like BlackRock’s ETHA enter the scene. The remaining ETH ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating a relatively stable base and reinforcing the overall positive sentiment for the asset class. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Gaining Such Traction? The enthusiasm surrounding Spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t accidental. Several powerful factors are converging to make these investment vehicles incredibly attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Understanding these drivers is crucial to grasping the broader implications for the evolving crypto market trends and why this particular asset class is drawing so much capital. Regulatory Clarity and Trust: The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides a significant stamp of legitimacy. This regulatory green light offers a level of trust and security that was previously absent for many traditional investors hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. It signals that the U.S. is becoming more accommodating to digital assets within its established financial framework, reducing perceived risks for a wider investor base. Ease of Access: For many investors, purchasing and securing actual Ethereum can be complex, involving navigating crypto exchanges, understanding wallet security, and managing private keys. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a familiar, regulated, and straightforward way to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without these complexities. They can be bought and sold just like traditional stocks through existing brokerage accounts, democratizing access to Ethereum for millions. Institutional Appetite: A major driver behind these significant Ethereum inflows is the growing interest from large institutions – including hedge funds, asset managers, and even pension funds. These entities often operate under strict mandates that prevent them from investing directly in volatile, unregulated assets. ETFs provide the perfect wrapper, allowing them to allocate capital to Ethereum within their existing compliance frameworks. This marks a significant step towards widespread institutional adoption of digital assets. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond being a digital currency, Ethereum is a robust, programmable blockchain platform powering decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing development, including scalability upgrades and its transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), enhances its long-term investment appeal, making it a prime candidate for investors seeking exposure to the broader Web3 economy and its transformative potential. Diversification Benefits: For portfolios already exposed to Bitcoin or traditional assets, Ethereum offers valuable diversification. While both are cryptocurrencies, they serve different purposes and have distinct market dynamics, providing a way for investors to broaden their digital asset holdings and potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. What Do These Ethereum Inflows Mean for Crypto Market Trends? The sustained positive Ethereum inflows are more than just daily statistics; they are indicative of deeper, structural shifts within the financial landscape. Their impact resonates across several facets of the crypto ecosystem, influencing investor perception and future developments. Understanding these implications is key to anticipating future crypto market trends . Increased Market Legitimacy: Each dollar flowing into these ETFs reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, are maturing as a legitimate asset class. This growing legitimacy can attract even more conservative investors and significant institutional capital, moving crypto further into the mainstream financial system. It shifts the narrative from speculative novelty to a recognized investment category. Potential Price Impact for ETH: While ETF inflows don’t directly purchase ETH on the open market in the same way direct retail buying does, they do create substantial demand. The funds underlying these ETFs must acquire and hold actual ETH to back their shares. This sustained demand, especially from large institutional players, can contribute to upward price pressure for Ethereum in the long term. It signals a fundamental shift from purely speculative retail trading to more stable, institutionally-driven demand, which can absorb selling pressure more effectively. Paving the Way for Other Altcoin ETFs: The success of both Bitcoin and now Ethereum spot ETFs sets a powerful precedent. It suggests that regulators are becoming more comfortable with crypto-backed investment products, potentially opening the door for spot ETFs based on other major altcoins in the future. This could usher in a new era of diversified crypto investment products, expanding the investable universe for traditional finance. Enhanced Liquidity: As more capital flows into these ETFs, the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market may increase. This makes it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without causing significant price dislocations, contributing to a more stable and efficient market environment for ETH. Higher liquidity generally leads to tighter spreads and better price discovery. Shifting Investor Demographics: The ease of access provided by ETH ETFs means that a new demographic of investors – those who prefer traditional brokerage accounts and regulated products – can now easily gain exposure to Ethereum. This broadens the investor base beyond crypto-native participants, accelerating institutional adoption and diversifying the profile of typical crypto holders. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Institutional Adoption While the recent Ethereum inflows are overwhelmingly positive and signal a promising future, it’s important to consider the broader context and potential challenges as we move towards greater institutional adoption of digital assets. The path forward is filled with both immense opportunities and certain hurdles that market participants should be aware of. Opportunities for Growth: Mainstream Integration: ETFs are a powerful bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Their success could lead to more innovative financial products built around digital assets, further integrating crypto into mainstream portfolios and investment strategies. This could include structured products, derivatives, and even crypto-backed lending. Innovation in Fund Structures: As the market matures, we might see more complex and diversified ETF offerings. This could include those that track specific sectors of the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g., DeFi, NFTs) or even actively managed crypto funds that aim to outperform the market through strategic asset allocation and trading. Global Impact: The U.S. market often sets a precedent for global financial trends. The success of these ETFs could encourage other major financial hubs around the world to accelerate their own regulatory frameworks for similar products, leading to a global surge in crypto investment opportunities and cross-border capital flows. Challenges to Consider: Market Volatility: Despite institutional interest, cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile assets. Investors in Spot Ethereum ETFs are still exposed to these price fluctuations, and significant downturns could impact investor confidence and future inflows. While ETFs offer convenience, they do not eliminate market risk. Regulatory Evolution: While the SEC has approved these ETFs, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Future policy changes, new interpretations, or unforeseen legal challenges could impact the operation or appeal of these funds. Constant vigilance regarding regulatory shifts is crucial. Competition: The ETF market is highly competitive, especially for popular asset classes. As more players enter, the battle for assets under management (AUM) will intensify, potentially leading to fee compression and requiring providers to differentiate their offerings through liquidity, efficiency, or unique features. Education Gap: Despite the simplified access, many traditional investors still lack a deep understanding of blockchain technology, the nuances of Ethereum, and the broader crypto ecosystem. Bridging this education gap remains crucial for sustained growth and informed, responsible investment decisions, ensuring investors understand what they are buying. The journey of digital assets into mainstream finance is ongoing, and the performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs will be a critical indicator of this progress. The sustained Ethereum inflows are a testament to growing conviction, but prudence and a long-term perspective remain essential for all participants in this dynamic market. In summary, the recent surge in U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs , culminating in $404.54 million in net inflows on July 18 and marking an impressive eleven consecutive days of positive flows, underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. Led by significant contributions from BlackRock and other major players, these sustained Ethereum inflows highlight a growing appetite for regulated digital asset exposure. This trend is driven by increased regulatory clarity, ease of access for traditional investors, burgeoning institutional adoption , and the inherent strength of Ethereum’s ecosystem. As these investment vehicles continue to gain traction, they are not only legitimizing the asset class but also reshaping crypto market trends , potentially leading to enhanced liquidity, price stability, and a broader investor base. While challenges like volatility and evolving regulations persist, the overwhelming positive momentum suggests a bright future for Ethereum within traditional finance. This truly is an exciting time to observe the convergence of blockchain innovation and established financial markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Spot Ethereum ETF? A Spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of ETH without having to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. These ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts and regulated like other securities. Why are U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs seeing significant inflows? The significant inflows are primarily driven by increased regulatory clarity following SEC approval, which provides legitimacy and trust for traditional investors. Additionally, they offer unparalleled ease of access for institutions and retail investors who prefer regulated products over direct crypto ownership. Growing institutional adoption and Ethereum’s robust, developing ecosystem also contribute significantly to their appeal and sustained demand. How do these Ethereum inflows impact the price of ETH? While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs create significant demand for the underlying asset. The ETF providers must purchase and hold actual ETH to back the shares they issue, which can contribute to upward price pressure for Ethereum in the long term by reducing the available supply on the open market and signaling strong, consistent institutional interest. This institutional buying can provide a more stable demand floor compared to retail speculation. Is investing in Spot Ethereum ETFs safe? Investing in Spot Ethereum ETFs carries inherent risks, primarily due to the volatility of the underlying asset, Ethereum. While the ETF structure provides regulatory oversight, professional custody, and ease of access compared to direct crypto ownership, the value of your investment will fluctuate directly with ETH’s market price. It’s crucial to understand these market risks and consider your own financial situation and risk tolerance before investing. No investment is entirely without risk. What does “institutional adoption” mean in the context of crypto? “Institutional adoption” refers to the increasing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology by large financial institutions, corporations, and traditional investment firms. This includes actions like offering crypto-related services to clients, investing in digital assets for their own portfolios, or incorporating blockchain into their operational infrastructure. Spot Ethereum ETFs are a prime example of a product designed to facilitate this adoption by bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space.

But the hype didn’t last long. Now, the token is trading 20% below its ICO price, with nearly 60% of early buyers already selling. This sharp decline comes despite listings on major exchanges like OKX, BitMEX, Kraken, and KuCoin. Traders are losing confidence as the Pump.fun token still lacks utility, rewards, or an airdrop, leading many to call it all hype with no real value. PUMP Token Price Crash Below ICO Floor PUMP is now trading at approximately $0.00406, down 21% in just 24 hours, and officially below its initial ICO price. The steep drop comes even after the token raised a staggering $448.5 million from over 10,000 participants during its public sale. Despite boasting more than $1.1 billion in 24-hour trading volume, the market remains bearish as bulls failed to defend key support zones. It's been almost 1 week since the @pumpdotfun ICO From 10,145 participants who contributed $448.5M: 59.6% sold or transferred 37.4% continue to HODL 3% increased their holdings Our quant reveals traders are still BULLISH on $PUMP .

A failed $2.3 million buyback by Pump.fun further intensified bearish momentum. With previous resistance now forming around the $0.0052 mark, selling pressure continues to dominate the token’s price action. Adding to concerns, open interest in PUMP perpetual contracts has dropped by over 16%, now standing at $629 million, according to Coinalyze. This suggests a waning of speculative interest and a fading of market enthusiasm, just days after its initial public offering. Meanwhile, competing platforms like LetsBONK.fun are drawing capital away, with Pump.fun’s on-chain revenue and launch volumes declining. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Season Ignites: XRP, Ethereum & Dogecoin Surge as Bitcoin Dominance Drops , PUMP’s Collapse Predictable?

As newer platforms and community-focused projects take the stage, many are reassessing where real momentum may be forming among the best altcoins to buy. BONK, SEI, and PENGU each offer different approaches. BONK builds on Solana’s ecosystem and growing DeFi interest. SEI stands out with efficient trading tools and rising value locked. PENGU blends NFTs with retail features, bringing a fresh layer of user appeal. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is introducing new mechanics to the presale process with its Buyer Battles format and reaching standout numbers in funding. Here’s a breakdown of why each project makes the list, starting with BlockDAG’s growing presence. 1. BlockDAG Uses Buyer Battles and Presale Structure to Drive Activity BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles introduce a new method to engage its community. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are available. If any remain unsold, they are awarded to the top buyer that day. This approach motivates participants to compete for added rewards while keeping demand consistent across presale stages. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release is also bringing attention. The current entry price of $0.0016 holds until August 11. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, this suggests a possible 3,025% return. For those evaluating the best altcoins to buy, BlockDAG (BDAG) presents an example of structured growth and pricing clarity. To date, more than $342 million has been raised, and over 24 billion coins sold across 29 batches. Instead of relying heavily on marketing, BlockDAG focuses on engagement and community activity, reinforcing a model built on user participation and steady progress. 2. BONK Gains Strength with Solana Ties and Expanding Use Cases BONK has emerged as a key meme coin on Solana, drawing steady attention from both traders and developers. July marked a strong period for the project, as BONK posted sharp gains while Solana’s ecosystem gained momentum. Currently priced near $0.0000334 with a market cap close to $2.6 billion, BONK’s daily trading volumes have crossed $1.9 billion, pointing to consistent market activity. Its role is also expanding. Developers are integrating BONK into DeFi platforms and NFT ecosystems within Solana, moving the project beyond its meme origins. Fast transactions, low fees, and new use cases suggest that BONK may play a deeper role in Solana’s next wave of growth, blending speculative interest with ongoing development. 3. SEI Builds on Trading Tech with Layer-One Efficiency SEI is positioning itself as a trading-focused Layer One platform with strong recent momentum. Its total value locked has reached $682 million, and its price has climbed to $0.37. This progress helps place SEI among the best altcoins to buy for those watching infrastructure projects with practical applications. Technical signals remain positive, as SEI has moved above key chart levels and broken earlier trends. Projections suggest it could hit $0.52 soon, with some forecasts stretching to $1.14 by year-end. Its broader ecosystem includes support for USDC, cross-chain tools, and a growing presence in gaming, with around 10 million users. These developments give SEI a foundation for continued relevance and expansion. 4. PENGU Blends Meme Energy with Retail Integration PENGU, built on the Pudgy Penguins brand, has become one of the more notable meme coins this cycle. Priced near $0.0335 and with a market cap over $2.13 billion, it recently surged 127% in one week. This growth has been driven by cultural attention, market buzz, and rising interest in coins tied to NFT identities. The project has moved into retail through recent partnerships with firms like Supply Inc. in China. Its ties to Pudgy World and other Web3 platforms offer a crossover between entertainment and blockchain features. With its mix of pop culture and expanding utility, PENGU continues to attract attention in both crypto and consumer spaces. Key Takeaways BONK, SEI, and PENGU reflect different areas of momentum within crypto right now. BONK leverages Solana’s ecosystem, SEI focuses on technical improvements in trading, and PENGU brings meme branding into retail and Web3. But BlockDAG continues to build a strong case. With daily Buyer Battles distributing unsold coins to the top participant, a fixed $0.0016 entry price ahead of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, and $342 million already raised, it brings structure and energy to its presale phase. The projected 3,025% return keeps it firmly positioned as one of the best altcoins to buy in the current cycle.

The crypto world is buzzing with anticipation, and for good reason. Recent insights from industry leaders suggest that while Bitcoin (BTC) might be gearing up for a brief period of Bitcoin consolidation , the dream of a new all-time high before the end of July is very much alive. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a sentiment backed by strong market indicators and expert analysis, promising an exciting phase for the premier cryptocurrency. For anyone invested in or observing the digital asset space, understanding these dynamics is absolutely crucial. The Current State of Bitcoin Consolidation: What Does it Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin consolidation , we’re referring to a period where the price movement becomes relatively flat, often trading within a defined range. It’s a phase where the market takes a breather after a significant price move, allowing for accumulation or distribution without a clear directional trend. Michael Harvey, head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, highlighted this potential brief consolidation phase for Bitcoin. But why is consolidation considered a healthy sign in a volatile market like crypto? Building a Strong Base: Consolidation allows the market to digest previous gains, attracting new buyers at current price levels and shaking out weak hands or short-term traders. Gathering Momentum: Think of it like a coiled spring. The longer Bitcoin consolidates, the more energy it builds for its next significant move. Market Re-evaluation: It provides an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their positions and for the market to establish new support and resistance levels. This period of sideways movement, though seemingly uneventful, is a vital part of a sustainable bull run. It prevents the market from overheating and sets the stage for future appreciation. While some might view it as stagnation, experienced traders often see consolidation as a precursor to significant upward momentum. A 5-10% pullback, as warned by Harvey, would fit perfectly into this consolidation narrative, offering fresh entry points for those who missed previous rallies. Is a BTC All-Time High by July Really Possible? The prospect of a new BTC all-time high by the end of July is an electrifying thought for many, especially after the impressive rallies Bitcoin has already seen. Michael Harvey’s optimistic outlook is not without foundational support. Several powerful forces are converging that could propel Bitcoin past its previous peak and into uncharted territory. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s an analysis rooted in observable market behavior and fundamental shifts within the crypto ecosystem. The factors underpinning this optimistic Bitcoin price prediction are multi-faceted and reflect a maturing market: Strong Inflows into U.S. Spot BTC ETFs: The approval and subsequent launch of these exchange-traded funds have revolutionized institutional access to Bitcoin. These ETFs act as a direct pipeline for traditional finance capital to flow into Bitcoin, absorbing significant amounts of supply from the market. Unlike individual investors, institutions often deploy large sums, and their consistent buying pressure can dramatically impact price discovery. Continued Accumulation by Treasury-Focused Firms: Beyond ETFs, various corporations and public companies are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. This signifies a long-term, conviction-based holding strategy, reducing the circulating supply and indicating growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition as a hedge against inflation or a store of value. These are not short-term traders; they are strategic holders. Growing Retail Interest: While institutional adoption lays the groundwork, it’s often renewed retail interest that provides the explosive fuel for a parabolic rally. As Bitcoin gains mainstream media attention and its price continues to climb, fear of missing out (FOMO) draws in new individual investors, increasing demand across various platforms and exchanges. This broad-based participation creates powerful buying pressure that can rapidly accelerate price movements. These three pillars—institutional investment, corporate adoption, and renewed retail enthusiasm—create a powerful demand-side dynamic that, if sustained, could very realistically push Bitcoin to a new all-time high within the predicted timeframe. The confluence of these factors paints a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s near-term future. Driving Forces: The Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Retail Interest The introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market has been a game-changer, fundamentally altering the landscape for Bitcoin investment. Prior to their approval, institutional investors faced significant hurdles in gaining direct exposure to Bitcoin, often relying on more complex or less regulated avenues. Now, they can access Bitcoin through regulated financial products, integrating it seamlessly into traditional portfolios. This ease of access has led to unprecedented inflows, making these ETFs a primary driver of Bitcoin’s recent price performance. Consider the transformative impact: Bridging the Gap: Spot Bitcoin ETFs bridge the gap between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning crypto market. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership, such as setting up wallets, managing private keys, or dealing with crypto exchanges. Unlocking New Capital: Billions of dollars from pension funds, endowments, and wealth management firms, previously unable or unwilling to invest directly in crypto, are now finding their way into Bitcoin via these regulated vehicles. This influx of ‘smart money’ adds significant liquidity and stability to the market. Validation and Legitimacy: The regulatory approval of these ETFs by the SEC has conferred a new level of legitimacy on Bitcoin, reassuring cautious investors and potentially paving the way for even broader adoption. Simultaneously, the resurgence of retail interest is equally vital. While institutions provide the foundational demand, it’s the widespread engagement from individual investors that often creates the viral momentum characteristic of crypto bull markets. As Bitcoin’s price rises, it captures headlines, sparks conversations on social media, and prompts everyday individuals to consider investing. This organic growth in participation, fueled by easy-to-use trading apps and growing awareness, contributes significantly to market liquidity and overall buying pressure. The synergy between robust institutional demand and burgeoning retail enthusiasm creates a powerful feedback loop, driving prices higher. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis: Potential Pullbacks and Opportunities While the outlook for a BTC all-time high is strong, a thorough crypto market analysis must always account for potential headwinds. Michael Harvey’s warning of a short-term pullback of 5–10% is a prudent reminder that even in a bull market, corrections are a natural and often necessary part of the cycle. Understanding the reasons behind these potential dips can help investors prepare and even capitalize on them. Key factors that could trigger a short-term pullback include: Profit-Taking: After significant rallies, it’s common for early investors or short-term traders to take profits, selling a portion of their holdings to lock in gains. This increased selling pressure can temporarily push prices down. Weakness in Equity Markets: Bitcoin, while often seen as a hedge, can sometimes correlate with traditional equity markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq. If broader stock markets experience a downturn due to macroeconomic concerns (e.g., inflation fears, interest rate hikes, geopolitical tensions), this sentiment can spill over into the crypto market, leading to a risk-off environment where investors reduce exposure to volatile assets. Unexpected Regulatory Developments: While the trend is towards greater clarity, unforeseen regulatory actions in major jurisdictions could create uncertainty and trigger sell-offs. Macroeconomic Shocks: Global events, economic data releases, or central bank policy shifts can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. However, it’s crucial to view these potential pullbacks not just as risks, but as opportunities. For long-term investors, a 5-10% dip can represent a chance to accumulate more Bitcoin at a discount, strengthening their position before the next leg up. Successful navigation of these market phases requires a disciplined approach, focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term fluctuations. This balanced perspective is vital for sustainable success in the volatile crypto space. Actionable Insights: Your Bitcoin Price Prediction Strategy Given the nuanced outlook – a potential consolidation followed by an explosive move towards a new BTC all-time high – what are the actionable insights for investors? Crafting a robust Bitcoin price prediction strategy involves more than just hoping for the best; it requires informed decision-making and risk management. Here are some practical steps you can consider: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, which is notoriously difficult, consider investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility and reduces the risk of buying at a peak, especially during a consolidation phase. Monitor On-Chain Metrics and ETF Flows: Keep an eye on data points like Bitcoin exchange balances (indicating supply availability), stablecoin inflows (potential buying power), and most importantly, the daily net flows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Sustained positive ETF flows are a strong indicator of institutional demand. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Before making any investment decisions, honestly assess your risk tolerance and invest only what you can afford to lose. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket; diversification across different asset classes is always a prudent strategy. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts, but avoid getting caught up in the daily noise or extreme FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) or FOMO. Focus on the fundamental drivers and long-term trends. Prepare for Volatility: Acknowledge that a 5-10% pullback is a real possibility. Have a plan for how you’ll react. Will you buy the dip? Hold steadfast? Or trim your position? Having a plan prevents emotional decision-making during stressful market periods. By adopting a disciplined and informed approach, investors can position themselves to potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s anticipated movements towards a new all-time high, even amidst periods of consolidation and short-term volatility. The key is to remain patient, strategic, and focused on the long-term vision for Bitcoin. Summary: Bitcoin’s Bright Horizon, With a Dash of Caution The journey of Bitcoin is rarely a straight line, but the current confluence of factors paints an undeniably optimistic picture for its near future. With insights from industry leaders like Michael Harvey, we can anticipate a period of Bitcoin consolidation , a healthy and necessary phase that allows the market to gather strength. This brief pause, however, is not expected to derail the potential for an exhilarating surge towards a new BTC all-time high before the close of July. The primary catalysts driving this bullish sentiment are robust: the continuous, substantial inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , demonstrating unwavering institutional demand; the strategic accumulation by treasury-focused firms, signaling long-term conviction; and the ever-growing interest from the retail sector, providing the essential momentum for widespread adoption. While a prudent crypto market analysis acknowledges the possibility of short-term pullbacks due to profit-taking or broader equity market weakness, these dips should be viewed as natural market corrections, potentially offering strategic entry points rather than reasons for alarm. Ultimately, Bitcoin stands at a pivotal juncture. Its resilience, coupled with unprecedented institutional embrace and persistent retail enthusiasm, suggests that the path to a new all-time high is not just a dream, but a tangible possibility. As always, informed decision-making, a clear understanding of market dynamics, and a balanced perspective will be your most valuable assets in navigating this exciting phase of Bitcoin’s evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitcoin consolidation, and why is it important? Bitcoin consolidation refers to a period where Bitcoin’s price trades within a relatively narrow range after a significant move. It’s important because it allows the market to stabilize, digest previous gains, and build a strong base for the next directional move. It’s a healthy sign that prevents rapid overheating and sets the stage for sustainable growth. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs considered a major catalyst for a new BTC all-time high? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are crucial because they provide an easy, regulated pathway for institutional investors and traditional financial firms to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Their approval has unlocked significant capital inflows from large funds and corporations, creating sustained buying pressure that directly impacts Bitcoin’s price by absorbing market supply. What factors could cause a short-term Bitcoin pullback? Potential short-term pullbacks (e.g., 5-10%) could be triggered by profit-taking from short-term traders or early investors, or by weakness in broader equity markets. If traditional financial markets experience downturns due to macroeconomic concerns, this can lead to a risk-off sentiment that affects cryptocurrencies as well. Is July a realistic target for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high? According to experts like Michael Harvey, a new all-time high by the end of July is possible, supported by strong ETF inflows, corporate accumulation, and growing retail interest. While market conditions can change, the confluence of these positive factors makes it a realistic, albeit ambitious, target. How can investors prepare for potential market volatility during this period? Investors can prepare by employing strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves investing fixed amounts regularly to average out purchase prices. It’s also important to monitor key market indicators, understand your personal risk tolerance, and have a clear plan for how you’ll react to potential dips or surges, avoiding emotional decisions.

As a result of this partnership, decentralized storage which is open to enterprises is now more accessible, censorship resistant, and cheaper than the cloud solutions offered by Acronis. Their backup systems can now be seamlessly integrated with Acronis’ cloud storage to offer a decentralized solution, enabling the backup and recovery processes to be secured with advanced data storage and disaster recovery techniques. For individuals and companies, data breaches, ransomware attacks and centrally based storage systems have become critical pain points in the digital-first economy. The current cloud-based storage solution does not offer users value for their money in terms of data sovereignty, security, and maintaining cost efficiency. The challenges posed by Acronis and StorX are addressed directly by these challenges in offering a Web3-enabled backup solution that encompasses all the features offered by enterprise solutions alongside cyber-secured features. Secure & Encrypted – End-to-end encryption protects sensitive and important data from unauthorized access. Censorship-Resistant – Distributed across hundreds of independent StorX nodes, eliminating single points of failure. Enterprise-Grade Reliable – Built on Acronis’ proven backup infrastructure, trusted by global enterprises. Cost-Efficient & Scalable – Built for businesses looking to reduce centralized storage overheads while maintaining regulatory compliance. A Strategic milestone for StorX and DePIN Ecosystem This integration represents more than just a technical enhancement. It is the progress that needs to be made for DePIN to be used by larger businesses. With StorX facilitating decentralized edge storage and Acronis providing seamless backup orchestration, businesses comprise a hybrid storage architecture that integrates the strengths of Web3 infrastructure and enterprise cybersecurity. “This integration marks a significant milestone for StorX as we continue bridging decentralized storage with enterprise-grade requirements,” said Prashant Acharya, Senior Communications Manager, StorX Network. “The future of data storage is decentralized, and by combining our DePIN-powered infrastructure with Acronis’ trusted backup technology, we are delivering a solution that enterprises can rely on without compromise.” The outcome is anticipated to increase the rate at which enterprises start using decentralized cloud storage while simultaneously strengthening the position of StorX in Web3 data infrastructure. In the meantime, the StorX Network plans to expand the integration and add sophisticated automated disaster recovery, smart contract-based access controls, and API-mandated transfers for direct movement by enterprises from centralized to decentralized storage providers. The shift also points to an overarching change within the industry—DePIN networks such as StorX are transitioning from Web3-native storage solutions to enterprise-ready infrastructure, advancing a blend between legacy IT ecosystems and future decentralized frameworks. What’s StorX Network StorX Network is a decentralized cloud storage platform using the DePIN architecture model, allowing users to securely, privately, and economically store data within global distributed storage nodes. Through the removal of centralized intermediaries, data privacy, resilience, and censorship resistance for individuals, developers, and enterprises is greatly enhanced with StorX. pr@storx.io Visit: https://storx.tech This press release is informational in nature and does not constitute a legal partnership, joint venture, or agency announcement of the relationship between StorX Network and Acronis.

The token carved out a volatile $0.2267–$0.2560 range, bouncing off the $0.2267 session floor after heavy selling pressure and surging to tag $0.2561 in the final stretch. Bit Origin’s $500 million treasury move and mounting DOGE ETF chatter helped restore confidence as volume surged above key thresholds throughout the recovery. What to Know DOGE bounces 8% in volatile trading, closing at $0.2533 after dipping as low as $0.2267 Volume spikes to 1.66 billion in final hour as bulls reclaim control and retake $0.25 resistance Bit Origin commits $500 million to DOGE treasury strategy; ETF speculation adds fuel with 80% approval odds by Sept. News Background Bit Origin announced a $500 million institutional allocation plan to build DOGE-denominated treasury reserves, marking the largest known corporate move into the meme coin to date. The announcement coincided with a broader resurgence in the memecoin market, which has gained $17 billion this month. Meanwhile, traders are pricing in an 80% chance of a DOGE ETF approval by September, according to prediction platform Polymarket. These developments come as DOGE breaks out from a 10-month consolidation phase. Price Action Summary The 24-hour session opened at $0.2437, before sellers dragged DOGE to $0.2267 around 20:00. Volume surged to 1.102 billion—well above the 873.9 million average—as whales defended key support levels. A sharp post-midnight reversal pushed DOGE to $0.2533, delivering a 7.7% rebound off session lows. In the final hour, DOGE traded within a tight 1.85% band between $0.2514 and $0.2561. Price hit session highs at 04:34 before retreating slightly on profit-taking. Notably, volume exploded to 1.66 billion during the rally and exceeded 45 million during the peak formation, signaling institutional participation. Technical Analysis Trading range: $0.2267–$0.2561 (12.94% intraday spread) Support: Established at $0.2267 on 1.1 billion volume surge during drawdown Resistance: Clean break of $0.2500; local top at $0.2561 before final pullback Volume Trends: Final-hour surge to 1.66 billion validates strength of recovery Short-term Momentum: Strong bounce suggests $0.2500 may flip to support Next Resistance: Analysts eye $0.2670 and $0.2825 zones if rally holds What Traders Are Watching DOGE’s ability to hold above $0.25 will be key for any continuation higher. Traders are monitoring ETF headlines and broader memecoin sentiment, while breakout targets of $0.36 to $1.00 are now in play if institutional flows continue. The current volume profile supports short-term consolidation before a possible next leg up.

With market caps in the billions and prices already heavily inflated compared to their initial levels, the upside potential from here looks far more limited. New contenders are emerging, building momentum, and gearing up for parabolic moves toward the coveted $1 milestone. For savvy investors willing to place strategic bets, just $500 split among the correct picks could realistically balloon into $20,000 as the next wave of crypto hype hits. Here are three coins poised to reach $1 before DOGE and SHIB make another serious move: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SEI, and Cronos (CRO). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Ethereum Meme Coin With Real Utility Currently in Stage 5 of its presale and priced at just $0.0014, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is generating a storm of interest across the Ethereum ecosystem. But this isn’t just another meme coin riding on social media hype—LILPEPE is backed by something the vast majority of meme tokens lack: actual blockchain infrastructure. LILPEPE is building its own Ethereum Layer 2 chain, designed explicitly for meme coins. This upcoming Layer-2 will be sniper-bot resistant, extremely fast, and super cheap to use, creating the perfect environment for launching and trading meme tokens. Alongside this, the project will feature a Meme Launchpad, enabling users to create and list their tokens in minutes, thereby giving rise to the next generation of viral crypto communities. The project has already raised over $5.8 million, sold 4.7 billion tokens, and is now listed on CoinMarketCap, signaling strong credibility ahead of launch. Two major centralized exchange listings are expected once the presale concludes, providing LILPEPE with a direct path to substantial liquidity and trading volume. If LILPEPE reaches just $1, that’s a 70,000%+ gain from its current price—a $500 investment could balloon into $350,000. Even hitting a modest $0.10 would deliver 30x returns, or $15,000 from a $500 stake. With meme coin mania heating up again, this Ethereum-based gem is easily one of the best positioned to explode before DOGE or SHIB make their next move. SEI: A New Era of High-Speed Blockchain for Traders SEI is another altcoin that could surprise the market in the coming months. Designed as a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for trading, SEI combines fast execution, deep liquidity, and instant finality, making it an ideal choice for DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and high-frequency applications. Currently trading at $0.33, SEI has already shown its resilience and appeal in a crowded market. The token’s community is growing, developer interest is on the rise, and the infrastructure is in place for significant growth. If SEI captures even a fraction of the momentum enjoyed by Solana or Avalanche, hitting $1 in the next 6–12 months is well within reach. That would be more than 3x from current levels—and for those entering now, the upside is clear. Cronos (CRO): The Sleeping Giant Backed by Crypto.com Cronos (CRO) is one of those tokens that always seems to be on the edge of something big, and 2025 could finally be the year it delivers. CRO token was developed by Crypto.com, one of the world leading exchanges. CRO is the native token of Cronos Chain which is a blockchain based on De-Fi, NFTs, Ethereum and Cosmos interoperability. Trading around $0.1, a move back to $1 would represent a 10x return. The project’s fundamentals, including a massive user base and a trusted brand, provide a strong foundation for such a move. As market sentiment flips fully bullish, CRO is one of the few tokens with both mass exposure and deep liquidity. Final Thoughts: Don’t Chase Yesterday’s Winners Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have already delivered their 100x moments. The chances of them repeating that performance anytime soon are slim, especially given their already multi-billion-dollar market caps. If you’re looking to turn $500 into $20,000 or more, it’s time to focus on emerging tokens with low entry prices and high breakout potential. LILPEPE is bringing true innovation to the meme coin space with infrastructure and token utility. SEI is targeting high-performance blockchain use cases with a focus on trading. And CRO combines a massive brand with untapped price potential. With the market heating up again, these three coins could hit $1 far sooner than the old guard—and early believers stand to reap the biggest rewards.

It achieved a brand new all-time high and it appears that it’s riding on the momentum of becoming the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by means of total market cap, at least at the time of this writing. But while these conditions might be excellent for those who have built up their positions, users looking to get into it might struggle to identify appropriate entry points. Now, this article is in no way a financial advice, but we thought it might be interesting to explore how we can leverage ChatGPT’s analytics capabilities to identify a potentially good entry for XRP in current price conditions. Below are three ways you can use it to, at the very least, get some supplemental information that might help you form your investment thesis. Of course, this should only be used in addition to your own research – make sure to do it and never trust an AI in its entirety. Assistance with Technical Analysis Whether you believe technical analysis works or not, many traders use it to gauge the effectiveness of an entry and to also identify potential exits. In general, it remains one of the most common practices for crafting strategies. You can upload a chart to ChatGPT and use it to interpret technical indicators such as: Moving averages Relative strengh index Support and resistance levels, and much more. Let’s check out an example. We have uploaded the following chart: Source: TradingView We also inserted the following prompt. Note how we start with a prompt to identify the current price – we want to make sure that ChatGPT reads the chart properly: Source: ChatGPT The AI then returned the following answer to our first two questions: Source: ChatGPT As you can see, it provided a correct answer to the first question and then provided the main support and resistance levels with certain argumentation for it. The previous all-time high is not flagged as a support because the price is hovering above it and it’s still uncertain as to whether it has been flipped as support or not – the bot needs further confirmation, perhaps in the form of a few consecutive daily candle closes above it. In terms of resistance, because XRP is in price discovery, ChatGPT correctly assumed that there is “no clear historical resistance beyond this on the provided chart.” The more interesting part is to see what types of entries it has provided. This is what it returned as an answer to the third question: Source: ChatGPT Now, whether or not this fits your trading style is an entirely different question, but you can modify the prompts to be more precise and tailored to your particular strategy. In addition, you can also feed it with more information so that it also takes some fundamentals into consideration, which brings us to point number two. Sentiment Aggregation from news and Social Media ChatGPT can easily summarize recent sentiment surrounding XRP by scanning news headlines, interpreting Reddit or Twitter posts, flagging major developments, and so forth. However, the caveat here is that if you’re not that tech-savvy and can’t build some sort of an automation, you will have to manually feed the bot with the headlines and materials you want it to summarize and interpret. Fortunately, there are plenty of aggregation resources out there that you can use to quickly compile headlines from the past 24 hours or from the past week, for instance, and then feed them into ChatGPT for it to work with. As a bonus tip here: consider giving ChatGPT a certain role. Instead of just prompting it with a simple task such as “summarize these articles,” you can go a lot more in-depth. A more professional-looking prompt could be something like: Respond as if you are a professional swing trader with a focus on cryptocurrencies. Analyze the contents of the following URLs in depth and provide answers to the following queries: What is the ongoing trading sentiment surrounding XRP. What is the broader market sentiment based off the URLs I’ve provided. How does question 2 reflect on the answers in question 1. Take into account the trading chart that I’ve uploaded and improve your answers with the fundamental context you gather from the URLs. Craft a new trading strategy with clear entry and exits for different time frames, to fit different risk profiles. Macro and On-Chain Data Interpretation Just as it can read trading charts, ChatGPT can also read on-chain graphs that provide contextual information for a certain coin based on its technical fundamentals. For instnace, the flow in and out of exchanges can be a critical parameter to gauge investor sentiment – increased exchange inflows could be a sign of an incoming selling pressure, while outflows typical signal stronger underlying spot market conditions. Therefore, make sure to also use this to your ChatGPT-provided analysis for a fuller breakdown and a more cohesive strategy. Having said all of the above, I would like to reiterate that none of it is financial advice. You should always conduct your own research. Tools such as ChatGPT (or other AI-based agents) can be used to your advantage but always approach them with a grain of salt and verify the information they provide.

Remittix (RTX) has emerged in 2025 as a DeFi token with real-world utility and rapid adoption. Thanks to its crypto-to-fiat capabilities and planned product rollout, Remittix is being called the next 100x crypto. Investors looking for the top crypto under $1 or the best DeFi altcoin are beginning to pay attention. PI Network (PI): Waiting on Delivery The PI Network has grown through mobile mining and promises huge upside once fully operational. However, despite big community backing, price action remains modest. Source: TradingView Analysts say if Pi reaches $500–$1,000 by 2030, early believers could triple their investments. But this depends on a successful open mainnet and exchange listings , both still pending. Currently, PI trades near $0.45. Although it’s being watched as a crypto with real utility, many remain cautious due to limited token accessibility and speculative timelines. Internet Computer (ICP): Building Slowly The Internet Computer (ICP) offers a unique Web3 backend but hasn’t yet won mass adoption. Still, its use case is strong in Decentralized exchange infrastructure and Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives. At about $5.32, ICP’s upside could be significant. Forecasts suggest it may climb to $220–$500 by 2035, though these are long-term bets and not guaranteed. Despite its status as a high growth crypto, it hasn’t delivered explosive returns in 2025, with modest outlooks from institutional analysts and retail investors alike. Why Remittix May Outperform Both Remittix: Best Crypto Presale Of 2025? A growing number of analysts seem to think so. RTX is gaining traction for its ability to bridge crypto and real-world payments. At a price of $0.0811, with over $16.4 million raised and 555 million tokens sold, Remittix is quietly dominating headlines. It’s already being compared to XRP for its payment infrastructure—but with a stronger DeFi slant. This Could Be the Presale That Changes Everything: Remittix.

These projects continue building through market cycles, expanding use cases, forging major partnerships, and strengthening developer ecosystems. As institutional players enter at scale and retail interest returns, these overlooked tokens could be primed for outperformance. In this article, we explore the most undervalued altcoins for 2025 and whether current market conditions present a strong accumulation opportunity for long-term investors. Arbitrum (ARB): Scaling the Ethereum Economy Arbitrum remains the dominant Layer 2 in total value locked, yet ARB’s price has lagged. With the upcoming Stylus upgrade unlocking parallel EVM execution and increased adoption of its Orbit chain framework, Arbitrum is gearing up for explosive growth in DeFi and gaming sectors. By mid-2025, broader Ethereum scaling demand could position ARB as a frontrunner. At current prices, ARB offers a compelling entry point for long-term positioning. Polygon (MATIC): The zkEVM Sleeper Giant Polygon’s pivot toward zero-knowledge rollups positions it well for institutional adoption. Despite its partnerships with global brands like Nike and Disney, MATIC remains significantly below its previous cycle highs. As zkEVM usage scales and Polygon 2.0 unrolls by late 2025, network activity is expected to surge. MATIC’s current valuation may not reflect its future dominance, making it a strategic hold. Chainlink (LINK): Cross-Chain Infrastructure Layer Chainlink’s CCIP protocol is becoming the backbone for cross-chain communication and real-world asset tokenization. As tokenized assets grow in importance across TradFi and DeFi, LINK’s utility will likely skyrocket. The upcoming Chainlink Economics 2.0 and staking expansion will add further demand pressure. Accumulating LINK under $20 could present significant upside as it reclaims its place as a DeFi core infrastructure asset. Render (RNDR): The AI Infrastructure Powerhouse Render Network’s decentralized GPU infrastructure is gaining serious traction amid the AI boom. With Apple integration and strong developer interest, RNDR sits at the convergence of AI, metaverse, and Web3 computing. Given the high demand for rendering and compute, RNDR is still underpriced relative to its disruptive potential. A rally toward new highs in 2025 is plausible as adoption scales. Aave (AAVE): The DeFi Lending Leader Aave remains a bedrock of DeFi lending, and its upcoming V4 upgrade, paired with the growing GHO stablecoin ecosystem, will likely reignite user activity. Despite high usage and fees, AAVE is trading at a fraction of its 2021 highs. As DeFi regains momentum, especially with RWA integration, AAVE price could be among the top rebound plays. Is Now the Right Time to Accumulate? Technically, many of these altcoins are consolidating near key support zones after prolonged downtrends, indicating a potential bottom formation. Volume profiles suggest reduced selling pressure, while higher time-frame charts show early signs of trend reversals. If Bitcoin maintains its current range or begins a breakout above resistance, these undervalued altcoins could be among the first to rally. With major upgrades and catalysts expected in Q3 and Q4 2025, this period may offer one of the best risk-reward setups for long-term accumulation.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ARB|LINK|MATIC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 06:55:07

This strong surge follows a key breakout above the $21.48 resistance level. And a renewed wave of optimism across the crypto market, sparked by the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, which has lifted investor sentiment. Backed by surging trading volume of $1.08 billion, which is up 230% in 24 hours, and a bullish technical structure, ETC could test the $26–$28 resistance zone, a level uncharted since early March. Curious about the Ethereum Classic price? Join me as I elaborate on the same. Rising Open Interest Signals Renewed Conviction? Data from Coinglass reveals a sharp increase in ETC Futures Open Interest, which now stands at around $250 million, its highest level since November. Historically, spikes in open interest that coincide with rising prices indicate an influx of capital and an increase in leveraged long positions. It is worth noting that similar surges in open interest in March and November 2024 preceded strong bullish moves, and current levels mirror that setup. This link between technical price action and on-chain futures data suggests that the current rally is driven by conviction rather than mere short-term speculation. ETC Price Analysis: The 4-hour chart shows a clear breakout above the long-standing $21.48 resistance, which has now turned into support. ETC touched a 24-hour high of $25.68, and the RSI is hovering around 77, signaling overbought conditions, but not yet diverging. Price remains above the middle Bollinger Band and 20-EMA, both of which are sloping upward. That being said, if bulls maintain momentum and volume sustain, ETC could challenge the next resistance zone between $26 and $28.16 . However, any dip toward the $22–$23 range could present a buying opportunity. FAQs Why is Ethereum Classic price up today? The breakout above $21.48, coupled with rising open interest and the GENIUS Act boost, drove momentum. Is ETC overbought right now? Yes, RSI is around 77, suggesting overbought conditions, but momentum remains strong for now. What is the next price target for ETC? For ETC price, support lies at $22. Resistance stands at $26–$28. A breakout above $28.16 could open up further upside.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 06:59:02

This resistance has now been turned into support as the price is now only 15% from its all-time highs of $3.84. Amid this, expectations have begun to rise that the XRP price will reach new all-time highs from here. It suggests that there is still another move coming for the digital asset that could send it higher, and one analyst has advised investors to get ready to sell. XRP’s Next Surge Is A Good Time To Sell In an X post, crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino has given XRP investors a heads up on when they should be getting ready to sell their coins. The post features a price chart that shows that XRP has already beaten $3 and is likely to head up to higher levels. Related Reading: Pundit Warns XRP Investors To Not Make This Grave Mistake This Cycle Severino explained that the XRP price has now entered into price discovery, something that is bullish for the digital asset. Price discovery is a period where market participants, ie buyers and sellers, determine what the value of an asset is through their activities. So far, the market looks to have decided that the XRP altcoin is worth more and has continued its uptrend. Interestingly, the crypto analyst had initially pointed to this possible move months ago in May 2025, showing that XRP had reached a critical level. This was the monthly RSI crash back down to the 67.18 level, and the last time that something similar had happened was back in 2017 before the price surge to all-time highs. In a similar vein, it had taken a few months back then for the trend to play out, but the resulting surge was almost as massive as the first one. As the XRP price seems to be playing out the second surge, the analyst expects that a final surge may be on the way for XRP. However, what is most important here is that investors get ready to take profit during this final surge. Open Interest Points To Possible Peak As the XRP price has risen, so has the open interest as crypto traders take their positions in the digital asset. This surge has seen the XRP open rise to levels never seen before to beat its previous all-time high of $8.33 billion that was set back in January 2025. The XRP open interest has now risen to over $9 billion, according to data from Coinglass. Related Reading: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout Using past performances, this could mean that the top is close for the XRP price.

The document emphasized XRP’s significant edge in transaction speed. It compares XRP’s throughput of 1,500 transactions per second to Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second. XRP is significantly more efficient than Bitcoin, and the document says it consistently outperformed Bitcoin in transaction volume per second over several years. It also made it clear that XRP’s efficiency positions it as a strong candidate for real-time payments, while Bitcoin’s slower pace reflects a focus on decentralization and security. The 20x Price Challenge Toward the end of the document, WisdomTree laid out a stark comparison: “To match bitcoin’s market capitalisation, XRP’s price would need to increase more than 20x from its current levels.” At the time the report was prepared, Bitcoin’s market cap was $1.9 trillion. SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher, brought renewed attention to this analysis in a recent post, pointing to WisdomTree’s statement as documentation of XRP’s potential. Remember, XRP only has to 20x from current price levels to surpass Bitcoin. Documented by WisdomTree. https://t.co/KttXOWzP13 pic.twitter.com/yoIKPQs02E — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 17, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is a 20x Surge Enough to Flip Bitcoin With XRP currently priced at $3.59 and its market cap sitting at $212.27 billion, a 20x increase would put its price at $71.80. Multiplying that by the current circulating supply (approximately 59.13 billion XRP), the projected market cap would reach roughly $4.24 trillion. By comparison, Bitcoin is now trading at $120,423, with a total market cap of $2.39 trillion. This means that if XRP were to 20x from current levels, its market cap would not only surpass Bitcoin’s, but it would do so by a significant margin of nearly $1.85 trillion. Experts have predicted for years that XRP could surpass Bitcoin , and this calculation reveals that, at least in theory, the 20x growth model referenced by WisdomTree now exceeds what is required to overtake Bitcoin. Outlook for XRP’s Trajectory The WisdomTree report made clear that for XRP to reach this level realistically, four major developments are essential. These include mass adoption, regulatory clarity, ecosystem expansion, and favorable market sentiment. These conditions remain as critical now as they were when the report was first issued. While the goal is daunting, especially considering Bitcoin’s deep-rooted dominance, current price levels suggest that a 20x rise in XRP would be more than sufficient to claim the top spot. XRP is already on its way to a new all-time high , and many market participants are confident that it will surpass Bitcoin in this cycle.

In their Q2 2025 earnings reports, the three major banks disclosed billions of dollars in losses from “net charge-offs” — loans written off as uncollectible after all efforts to recover payments proved unsuccessful. Among the trio, JPMorgan Chase reported the highest level of charge-offs at $2.4 billion, predominantly driven by bad credit card debt. Meanwhile, Citi wiped $2.234 billion in bad loans off its books, including $1.889 billion tied to its retail credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo recorded $977 million in net charge-offs, fueled by $818 million in sour loans from its consumer banking and lending segment. The figures come as fresh data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that US credit card balances reached $1.18 trillion by the end of March 2025. Despite the losses, Citi reported a $225 million decline in net credit losses quarter-over-quarter, and Wells Fargo saw a $12 million decrease in net charge-offs over the same period. However, JPMorgan witnessed an increase of at $179 million in net charge-offs over the three-month period. Additionally, the three banks reported strong earnings in Q2, with JPMorgan, Citi and Wells Fargo generating $15 billion, $4 billion and $5.5 billion in net income, respectively.

The company had aligned itself with a group of investors, including Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, KKR, Andreessen Horowitz, and Oracle, to invest in TikTok’s US operations, but has now exited the consortium. The firm’s withdrawal, however, comes at a time when the TikTok US deal has become a key issue in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Since discussions began, the deal, however, has been plagued by several delays. Trump signals progress on TikTok deal as Xi meeting likely Earlier this month, the US president, Donald Trump, stated that they “pretty much” had a deal to sell TikTok’s US operations. When asked how confident he was that China would accept the deal, he told reporters: “I’m not confident, but I think so. President Xi and I have a great relationship, and I think it’s good for them. I think the deal is good for China, and it’s good for us.” He even hinted that he and President Xi Jinping may meet soon. About a week ago, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the chances of the two leaders meeting are very high. However, he offered no specifics about the possible meeting, merely noting that there was a strong mutual desire to meet. Last month, President Trump pushed the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US assets to September 17. It marked his third executive order postponing the ban, granting ByteDance an additional 90 days to secure a buyer or face a ban in the US. That same month, he said he found a buyer that could ensure TikTok’s continued legal operation in the US. Later, Bloomberg News revealed that the buyers, including Blackstone, were in the same group. The group had become the leading contender to acquire TikTok’s US operations in a deal that would give American investors an 80% ownership stake, with ByteDance retaining a minority share. The US and China are still negotiating for a better trade deal Since Trump’s re-election, tensions between the US and China have resurfaced, with both countries engaging in a volatile tariff exchange rooted in the president’s global trade war and disputes over export control measures. As things stand, the two agreed to a 90-day tariff suspension , though the deadline is drawing close. Still, recent comments from US officials suggest the timeline remains flexible. The two countries are still negotiating for a better trade deal, with the TikTok US deal at the center of talks. Nevertheless, Chinese authorities have vowed to respond if US trade agreements with other countries come at the cost of Chinese interests. Rubio recently held a meeting with China’s Wang Yi in Kuala Lumpur, which both sides called positive and productive. He added that they were able to pinpoint potential areas for collaboration, but he did not specify what those areas were. The Chinese Foreign Ministry gave a similar statement, describing the talks as “positive, pragmatic, and constructive,” noting that both nations agreed to boost diplomatic communication and coordination across various sectors.

Built on the Azuro protocol and integrated with Polygon, Bookmaker.xyz is hosting an open on-chain tournament with up to $100,000 in rewards, aimed at experienced Web3 bettors looking for trustless infrastructure and high-stakes competition. The tournament is live until July 27, giving players just over a week to climb the leaderboard and compete for a share of the prize pool. Full details can be found here . A More Credible Betting Experience Bookmaker.xyz operates on a simple, uncompromising principle: users should be able to place bets without giving up custody of their funds, signing up with emails, or dealing with withdrawal friction. The platform removes the “house” altogether by routing all bets through Azuro’s smart contract infrastructure, with odds and outcomes resolved by decentralized data feeds. No custodial wallets. No hidden rules. No delays. What makes the user experience stand out further is a combination of key features that directly address the shortcomings of traditional sportsbooks: Gasless betting : users sign transactions, but gas fees are covered by the protocol Fully decentralized : no single point of control or failure Fast withdrawals : winnings are paid instantly on-chain, no manual processing Seamless UX : just connect your wallet and start betting with no KYC This isn’t gamified speculation or token farming dressed up as a sportsbook. It’s a platform built for people who already bet, and want to do it transparently and efficiently. Inside the Tournament: Format, Rules, and Rewards The ongoing tournament is open to all users placing bets on Bookmaker.xyz via Polygon. No registration or opt-in is needed: just connect your wallet and start betting, eligible bets are tracked automatically. Participants earn points based on winning bets using a simple formula: Points = odds – 1 Odds 3.00 → 2 points Odds 1.75 → 0.75 points Losing bets don’t subtract points To qualify, individual bets must be at least 10 USDT. Lower bets won’t count toward the leaderboard. A built-in performance boost helps active users: if your total betting volume exceeds the player average, your score gets a 2x multiplier: a strong incentive for consistency and size. To encourage thoughtful betting, only the first bet on a given outcome counts. This discourages repetition and levels the playing field. The prize pool up to $100,000 is split into: Weekly rewards for the top 10 bettors A final leaderboard payout on July 27 All prizes are distributed directly to winning wallets with no delays, no manual claims, and no withdrawal friction. The Broader Implication for Web3 Gambling Bookmaker.xyz ’s model reflects a broader movement in Web3 away from hype-driven launches toward actual infrastructure and usable products. The decision to integrate with Polygon is strategic: fast finality, low transaction costs, and a strong ecosystem make it ideal for real-time betting flows. Combined with Azuro’s decentralized protocol layer, the platform delivers a fully trustless experience with no centralized bookkeeper, ever. What’s equally important is how naturally it all fits the Web3 ethos: No KYC No registration No deposit requirements Smart contract-based payout logic Bookmaker.xyz demonstrates that decentralized betting can match or exceed the UX of traditional platforms, without compromising on transparency or ownership. What Comes Next? While the current tournament wraps up on July 27, it’s unlikely to be the last. Based on engagement, betting volume, and the pace of product development, Bookmaker.xyz is clearly building for the long term. Future updates could include new tournament formats, additional chain integrations, or even governance tools and liquidity incentives for power users. But even today, the message is clear: decentralized betting is no longer an experiment. It’s fast, reliable, and already delivering value to real users and this tournament proves it.",Information,EN,0,0,MATIC|BLOCKCHAIN|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 07:09:35

Dogecoin’s price rocketed to a two-month peak, while whales have started accumulating en masse, and large traders are opening sizeable longs. Whales bought 1.08 billion Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/vQapyIncRN — Ali (@ali_charts) July 18, 2025 Data shared by Ali Martinez shows that large DOGE holders have expanded their holdings by more than a billion coins within the span of just two days. To put this amount into a USD perspective, it’s valued at over $250 million at current prices. This accumulation comes at a time when the OG meme coin’s price has gone through the roof. Recall that it traded at $0.19 on Tuesday, which was a crucial support line. After it bounced off it on a couple of occasions, DOGE went on a roll, shipping beyond $0.25 and reaching its highest price tag since the second week of May. Moreover, Dogecoin’s price has soared by more than 80% since its bottom on June 23 during the Israel-Iran war. Aside from whales buying spot, large leverage players have also caught the move upward. Lookonchain reported that an anonymous whale closed a long DOGE position at the top yesterday, profiting more than $2 million. Later, they opened another one, worth over $21 million, going 10x long on the meme coin. Whale 0x6adb closed his $DOGE long at the top yesterday, locking in a $2.14M profit. 10 hours ago, he jumped back in — going 10x long on 84.08M $DOGE ($21.24M), with an unrealized profit of $1.64M. Smart moves! https://t.co/f3FekXx5yg pic.twitter.com/zc2tYXnLeP — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 19, 2025 From a technical standpoint, analysts believe Dogecoin is poised for a surge to $0.36 or even $0.54, as long as it remains above the critical support level at $0.2.

The cryptocurrency is now consolidating near $118,000, and according to Galaxy Digital’s Michael Harvey, this could be a “pause for air” before another potential leg up by the end of July. Will Bitcoin Price Hit a New All-Time High Before July Ends? Michael Harvey , head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, believes Bitcoin could still hit a new all-time high before the month ends, but only if several bullish conditions align. He describes the most optimistic path as a “slow melt-up,” powered by continuous inflows into U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , ongoing accumulation by Bitcoin treasury firms, and a noticeable increase in retail investor interest. ETF flows have been strong, and institutional accumulation remains consistent, supporting the bullish outlook. However, retail activity, typically a key driver of Bitcoin blow-off tops, is still uncertain. While Coinbase has climbed to #137 on the Apple App Store, indicating rising curiosity among retail users, Google Trends data shows that searches for “Bitcoin” remain relatively low. Could Bitcoin Price Drop to $110K Before the Next Rally? Harvey also outlined a cautious view. A pullback triggered by profit-taking or broader equity market weakness could drag Bitcoin down 5–10%, putting $110,000 at risk. Such a correction wouldn’t necessarily end the bull market, but it would signal temporary weakness and a break in momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: How High Can ETH Really Go by 2026? , Will the Bitcoin Bull Run Peak in October 2025? Adding to the broader outlook, crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggests this cycle might peak in October, roughly 550 days after the April 2024 halving , following the same timeline as the 2020 cycle. This implies we only have a few months of strong upward movement left before the cycle matures. This could be true because Bitcoin still holds a massive $2.33 trillion market cap with $81.67 billion in daily trading volume, reflecting strong institutional confidence. The 18.9% volume surge shows ongoing professional interest, even as prices pull back from recent highs. CryptoQuant notes that the Short-Term Holder MVRV ratio is currently below the profit-taking threshold (~1.35), suggesting Bitcoin still has room to climb 20–25%. With the recent consolidation resting on solid technical footing, a rally into the $140K+ range remains a viable target. For now, Bitcoin sits in a wait-and-see phase. Whether it’s gearing up for another July breakout or simply catching its breath, the next few weeks could determine how the rest of this bull run unfolds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Casa CTO Jameson Lopp and five developers have proposed a new defensive shield for the BTC network to counter this threat. The new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), presented in San Francisco, aims to create a post-quantum address security system. Its most notable proposal: freezing the approximately 1 million Bitcoins believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which have been dormant for years. Experts say that with the development of quantum computers, methods like Shor's algorithm could reverse-engineer private keys once sufficient processing power is available. According to Deloitte research, approximately a quarter of Bitcoins are vulnerable to quantum attacks. If this happens within the next 10 years, a massive market crash could occur, including the loss of millions of BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto. Related News: White House Cryptocurrency Executive Bo Hines Announced: “Trump Will Sign The Decision That Will Change The Fate Of Cryptocurrencies Today” The BIP proposal presented by Lopp and his team includes a three-phase security plan: Blocking new funds from entering addresses vulnerable to quantum. Automatic freezing of old coins that have not been moved for five years. The ability to selectively unlock these assets with quantum-resistant signatures. BTC holdings in Satoshi Nakamoto's known wallets. However, Lopp's proposal isn't the only solution. Anduro protocol engineer Hunter Beast has previously proposed a post-quantum address design with BIP 360, offering varying levels of security. Such solutions typically strike different balances between technical factors such as algorithm selection, key length, and transaction throughput. Like every BIP, this proposal must undergo intense debate and technical testing before implementation. Lopp argues that a successful quantum attack could cause massive economic disruption and that the Bitcoin community must unite and act quickly. However, post-quantum signatures come with much larger file sizes. This can increase transaction data and increase block space consumption. The entire infrastructure, from miners to wallets, needs to be aligned. *This is not investment advice.

For many traders, the allure of amplified gains draws them to derivatives like perpetual futures. However, this high-stakes environment also comes with significant risks, none more dramatic than crypto liquidation . Over the past 24 hours, the market witnessed a staggering amount of capital wiped out, highlighting the inherent volatility and the critical importance of risk management in perpetual futures trading. Let’s dive deep into the recent breakdown and understand what these massive liquidations mean for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Are Perpetual Futures in Crypto Trading? Before we dissect the recent numbers, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiration date, perpetual futures in crypto never expire. They are designed to mimic the spot market price of an asset while allowing traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This innovative instrument has become incredibly popular due to its flexibility and the potential for magnified profits. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Funding Rates: A mechanism unique to perpetual futures that ensures the contract price stays tethered to the spot price. Traders pay or receive small fees based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Understanding Crypto Liquidation: The Sudden Wipeout So, what happens when a trader’s leveraged position goes awry? That’s where crypto liquidation comes into play. In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. This typically happens when the market moves strongly against their leveraged position. To prevent further losses for the exchange and the trader, the position is automatically closed by the exchange. Margin Call: Before full liquidation, some exchanges might issue a “margin call,” prompting traders to add more funds to their account. Automatic Closure: If the trader fails to add more margin or the price continues to move unfavorably, the position is automatically closed at the market price. Loss of Collateral: The trader loses their initial margin and any additional collateral they might have put up. This can lead to significant, often total, loss of the invested capital for that specific trade. The Past 24 Hours: A Staggering Crypto Liquidation Breakdown The last 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto liquidation events across major assets. Here’s a breakdown of the reported figures: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (24h) Long Liquidations (%) Ethereum (ETH) $151.00 million 75.91% Bitcoin (BTC) $76.46 million 87.91% Ripple (XRP) $42.18 million 81.22% The total liquidations across these three assets alone exceeded $270 million , with a dominant majority being “long” positions. This indicates that a sharp downward price movement caught many traders off guard, forcing their bullish bets to be closed out. ETH: The Largest Hit in Crypto Liquidation Ethereum led the pack with an astonishing $151 million in liquidations. With nearly 76% of these being long positions, it suggests that many traders were highly leveraged, betting on ETH’s price to continue its upward trajectory. A sudden dip in ETH’s price likely triggered a cascade of liquidations, as positions were automatically closed, adding selling pressure to the market. BTC: Bitcoin’s Volatile Ride and its Impact on Crypto Liquidation Bitcoin, the market leader, saw $76.46 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of long positions at almost 88%. This underscores Bitcoin’s continued influence on the broader market; often, when BTC dips, altcoins follow. Traders anticipating a continued bull run for BTC found themselves in a precarious situation as prices corrected. XRP: A Ripple Effect of Crypto Liquidation XRP experienced $42.18 million in liquidations, with over 81% being long positions. While smaller in absolute terms compared to ETH and BTC, this still represents a significant amount for XRP traders. It highlights that even assets with specific legal or fundamental news can be susceptible to broader market movements and the perils of high leverage. Why Such Massive Crypto Liquidations? Unpacking the Triggers Several interconnected factors contribute to large-scale crypto liquidation events: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Sharp, unpredictable price movements, often triggered by macro-economic news, regulatory announcements, or large whale movements, can quickly push leveraged positions into liquidation territory. Excessive Leverage: While leverage offers amplified gains, it equally amplifies losses. Many traders use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x), meaning even a small percentage move against their position can lead to total loss of their margin. Cascading Effects: When initial liquidations occur, the forced selling of those positions adds further downward pressure on prices, which in turn triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect. This “liquidation cascade” can exacerbate market downturns rapidly. Lack of Risk Management: Many traders, especially new ones, often overlook robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders or managing position sizing. The Ripple Effect: What Do Large Liquidations Mean for the Market? Massive crypto liquidation events are more than just individual losses; they have broader implications for the market: Increased Volatility: The forced selling from liquidations adds to market sell pressure, potentially accelerating price declines. Shift in Sentiment: Large liquidation events can dampen overall market sentiment, leading to fear and uncertainty among traders. Opportunity for Savvy Traders: While devastating for those liquidated, these events can present buying opportunities for well-capitalized traders looking to enter positions at lower prices. Market Reset: In some cases, a significant liquidation flush can “reset” the market, clearing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for healthier, more sustainable growth. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Traders Understanding crypto liquidation is one thing; avoiding it is another. Here are actionable insights for traders: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: The most crucial step. Use lower leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading or during highly volatile periods. Consider 2x-5x leverage instead of 50x-100x. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. This automatically closes your position if the price hits a predefined level, preventing a full liquidation. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of both initial and maintenance margin requirements for your chosen exchange and asset. Don’t Over-Leverage Based on FOMO: Chasing pumps with high leverage is a common pitfall that often leads to liquidation. Stick to your trading plan. Keep an Eye on Funding Rates: High funding rates can indicate an overheated market, where many traders are long, making it more susceptible to a long squeeze and subsequent liquidations. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into highly leveraged futures positions. Balance with spot holdings and other less volatile assets. The Dark Side of Leverage: Challenges and Risks While the promise of amplified gains is enticing, the reality of high leverage in crypto futures trading often involves significant challenges and risks. The primary risk is the rapid and complete loss of capital. Unlike spot trading where your asset value might decrease but you still hold the asset, in leveraged futures, your entire collateral can be wiped out in moments. The psychological toll of watching a position get liquidated can also be immense, leading to emotional and irrational trading decisions. Furthermore, the complexity of perpetual futures, including funding rates and margin calls, can be overwhelming for inexperienced traders, increasing their vulnerability to sudden market shifts and crypto liquidation . Opportunities Amidst Volatility: Who Benefits from Crypto Liquidation? While mass liquidations are detrimental to those caught on the wrong side, they are not without beneficiaries. Market makers and exchanges often profit from the increased trading volume and fees generated during periods of high volatility and liquidation. Savvy short sellers who correctly anticipate a market downturn can also realize substantial gains as long positions are forcibly closed. Furthermore, long-term investors or “whales” with deep pockets may view these dips, exacerbated by liquidations, as prime opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. Ultimately, market resets due to excessive leverage being flushed out can create a healthier foundation for future growth. The recent 24-hour breakdown of crypto liquidation in perpetual futures serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged trading. While the potential for substantial gains exists, the market’s unforgiving nature can swiftly turn profits into significant losses. Understanding the mechanics of liquidation, managing leverage prudently, and employing robust risk management strategies are not merely suggestions but necessities for survival in the volatile world of crypto derivatives. Approach perpetual futures with caution, knowledge, and a disciplined mindset, and you stand a much better chance of navigating the storms and capitalizing on the opportunities that arise.

What is crypto liquidation in simple terms? Crypto liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a certain threshold due to unfavorable price movements. It’s designed to prevent traders from losing more money than they have in their account and to protect the exchange. 2. Why do most liquidations tend to be “long” positions? Most liquidations are often “long” positions because many retail traders are inherently bullish on crypto and tend to bet on price increases. When the market experiences a sudden downturn, these leveraged long positions are the first to be hit and liquidated. 3. How can I avoid crypto liquidation? To avoid liquidation, manage your leverage carefully (use lower leverage), always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, monitor your margin balance, and avoid over-leveraging based on emotional decisions like FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Consider diversifying your portfolio as well. 4. Do crypto exchanges benefit from liquidations? While exchanges don’t directly “profit” from a trader’s loss, they do benefit from the increased trading volume and transaction fees generated during periods of high volatility and liquidation. They also ensure market stability by closing risky positions. 5. Is perpetual futures trading safe? Perpetual futures trading is inherently high-risk due to the use of leverage. While it offers the potential for amplified gains, it also carries the risk of rapid and complete loss of capital. It is not recommended for beginners or those without a strong understanding of risk management and market dynamics. 6. What is a “liquidation cascade”? A liquidation cascade occurs when initial liquidations trigger further price movements (usually downwards), which in turn trigger more liquidations. This creates a chain reaction of forced selling, exacerbating market downturns and leading to massive amounts of capital being wiped out in a short period.

The move earned praise from Bitcoin maximalists worldwide and positioned the nation as a testbed for large-scale crypto adoption. But as of mid-2025, that bold vision appears to be fading—and fast. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy On November 16, 2022, Bukele announced El Salvador would begin buying 1 Bitcoin per day. Around the same time, the country set up a National Bitcoin Office to coordinate crypto initiatives. These developments, along with BTC’s legal status, signaled the government’s deep commitment to Bitcoin adoption. Bukele’s policies—pro-crypto and anti-establishment—resonated with many Salvadorans, helping him secure a historic re-election in February 2024. IMF Bailout Exposes BTC Slowdown Despite its revolutionary image, El Salvador’s economy struggled under mounting debt and inflation. To stabilize finances, the government turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which approved a $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility in February 2025 . However, the IMF made one thing clear: El Salvador must limit public-sector Bitcoin activity, including BTC purchases and transactions. The government publicly pushed back, stating it would continue buying Bitcoin—claims echoed across official social media. But a July 15, 2025 IMF report told a different story. El Salvador Hasn’t Bought Bitcoin Since December 2024 According to the IMF, El Salvador hasn’t purchased any new Bitcoin since December 2024—the same month IMF talks concluded. The report clarified that recent wallet activity was merely internal transfers, not fresh acquisitions. Even more telling, Bitcoin quietly lost its legal tender status in January 2025, signaling a strategic backpedal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Could Hit New Highs by July-End, Says Galaxy Digital , What’s Next? Privatization and Policy Reversal Chivo Wallet, the state-sponsored Bitcoin wallet, will reportedly be privatized by the end of July 2025. Rumors also suggest El Salvador may dissolve Fidebitcoin, the government-run Bitcoin trust. These moves signal a clear shift: compliance with IMF terms now takes priority over Bitcoin experimentation. While El Salvador’s leadership once stood firm on Bitcoin adoption , recent developments indicate a pivot toward economic pragmatism. The IMF bailout has reshaped national priorities—and Bitcoin is no longer center stage. Whether this marks the end or a pause in El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The chart shows a familiar setup that preceded XRP’s historical rally to its all-time high in early 2018. If history follows a similar trajectory, the projection points toward a potential rise to approximately $22.70 by August 1. Crypto Ninja emphasized this is not a prediction but an observation rooted in past data. “I’m not saying this will happen,” he noted, “I’m just saying it happened once before.” The post is based on a Fibonacci extension model that mirrors the breakout structure from the 2017 bull run. If #XRP hits the same fib as the 2017 cycle, we will hit ~$23 by August 1st. This is not hype, this is just data. I’m not saying this will happen, I’m just saying it happened once before. Same setup! Same result? $XRP pic.twitter.com/UEjqpkdlLs — Crypto Ninja (@Crypto_Ninja007) July 17, 2025 XRP Chart Structure Mirrors 2017 Setup The chart highlights two key consolidation phases. The first occurred between 2014 and 2017, forming a symmetrical triangle that preceded XRP’s breakout. Following the breakout, XRP entered a shorter consolidation phase before the final push to an all-time high. The current price action, spanning from 2021 to 2025, shows a nearly identical triangle forming over a similar timeframe. At the time of the analysis, XRP traded at $3.15 and was gearing up to break out of the second smaller consolidation phase. The asset has risen since then, currently sitting at $3.44, well above its January 2025 peak of $3.39. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Experts have predicted that a new all-time high is imminent , and Crypto Ninja takes it further, expecting continued momentum. He sees this consolidation structure as a launchpad, and now that XRP has broken above the symmetrical triangle, he has set a target of $22.70 by August 1. If the current breakout holds and mimics the historical setup, the proposed move to $22.70 would represent an increase of almost 530% from today’s price. XRP Price Context and Market Conditions While the pattern presents an interesting technical narrative, it is important to note that current market conditions differ significantly from those of 2017. Regulatory clarity, institutional involvement , and macroeconomic factors now play a greater role in shaping price action. With all these factors leaning bullish, XRP may experience a bigger surge . The asset’s movement over the past few days has caught the attention of many market participants. The bulls are pushing aggressively for new all-time highs and could sustain the momentum to hit Crypto Ninja’s $22.70 target.

While Dogecoin went up 13.9% and SHIB rose by 4.29%, analysts are speculating that whales are preparing for an even bigger rotation, perhaps into fresher altcoins that offer real value. a Meanwhile, in the background, newer DeFi tokens like Remittix are quietly building traction. Whale Activity Fuels Meme Coin Momentum Investors in meme coins now have more reasons to look forward. Dogecoin has just surged to $0.2438 with its market capitalization hitting $36.56B due to a 71.4% increase in daily trading volume. At the same time, SHIB is not far behind. Shiba Inu today is trading at $0.00001501 as daily volume rises by nearly 39%, sending market cap to over $8.8B. While the gains are remarkable, analysts warn the rally may be more the result of speculative enthusiasm rather than fundamental long-term focus. Remittix Heating Up: A Real-World Alternative While meme coins are hogging the headlines, Remittix is working quietly but intensively behind the scenes. With a present price of $0.0811, Remittix has collected over $16.4M of presale, sold over 555M+ tokens, and is targeting a $18M soft cap with an additional 50% bonus live for early buyers. Remittix is different from SHIB or Dogecoin because it solves real-world problems. Remittix is a low gas fee cryptocurrency that allows instant payments of crypto-to-fiat to bank accounts in 30+ countries. The Remittix Wallet is also launching this Q3, with live FX conversion, 40+ crypto and 30+ fiat support, and simple UX for both normal people and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Why Remittix Is Getting Whale Notice Send crypto directly to real bank accounts Wallet releases Q3 with live FX conversion $250,000 giveaway to onboard new users 50% token bonus until soft cap reached at $18M Audited by CertiK — built for long-term trust Backed by strong foundations and genuine utility, RTX is getting referred to as a top crypto under $1 and a best crypto presale 2025 contender. It’s also drawing whales who are tired of meme coins and want something better from underappreciated crypto projects with real power. Meme Mania or Altcoin Pivot? Dogecoin and SHIB may have more near-term upside, but serious investors are watching where the smart money is going. With whales lurking in the vicinity of Remittix, and the presale warming up fast, RTX might be the next big altcoin 2025. This could be your pre-mass market crypto investment opportunity prior to the masses finding out. With Remittix staking, referral rewards, and upcoming listings, this is one under-the-radar project that will surpass meme coins — not based on hype, but based on results.

Over the past year, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by an impressive 277% , climbing to a new all-time high of $3.66 before easing slightly to around $3.45. But according to popular crypto trader EGRAG CRYPTO , the real story isn’t just the price, it’s XRP’s growing dominance, which he says is pointing to a “mega bullish wave.” XRP Dominance Signals the “Kaboom Phase” According to EGRAG, XRP’s dominance chart has just broken out of a bullish pennant, a classic technical pattern that often precedes large upward moves. He predicts this breakout could trigger gains of 21% to 275%, which would be one of the biggest rallies XRP has ever seen. What’s adding to the excitement is that the key factor driving this prediction is the Visible Range Volume Profile (VRVP) indicator. EGRAG notes that there’s a “void” zone above 5.75% dominance. If XRP crosses and holds above this level, it could spark what he calls the Kaboom phase, a period of explosive growth in XRP’s dominance. Fibonacci Levels Hint at $1.5T XRP Market Cap EGRAG also shared his XRP Fab chart, which maps XRP’s potential market cap against global crypto capitalization using Fibonacci levels. For instance, at a $10 trillion crypto market cap, XRP’s market cap could soar beyond $2 trillion if it hits the 0.888 Fibonacci level. Even a conservative target could place XRP’s market cap between $800 billion and $1.5 trillion, levels never seen before for the token. XRP Price Prediction 2025 As of now, XRP price is trading near $3.44 after hitting a new high of $3.66, showing strong demand from both traders and big investors. Meanwhile, a Golden Cross (50‑day EMA moving above the 100‑day EMA) confirms bullish momentum, while the MACD buy signal that started on June 28 is still active, keeping risk appetite alive. If XRP stays above $3.50 and breaks $3.66, it could enter a price discovery phase. Therefore, Crypto EGRAG believes that with rising dominance and whale accumulation, a move toward $5 or more is possible.",News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 07:56:02

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.05 Market cap $1.04B Trading volume $651.56M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $1.13 24-hour low $0.9816 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 12.29% 50-day SMA $0.8820 14-Day RSI 56.06 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $1.1918 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF maintains uptrend from June lows with strong support at $0.95 trendline. Short-term indicators suggest consolidation with bearish divergence near $1.08-$1.10 resistance. A breach of support at $0.95 risks a correction to $0.85. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF’s uptrend meets overhead resistance The WIF daily price chart for July 19 shows the token has broken above multiple resistance levels and is riding along an ascending trendline that has provided consistent support since late June. The 20-period simple moving average at $0.768 continues to act as dynamic support, while the Bollinger Bands show expansion, indicating increased volatility and momentum. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview However, the most recent candles show rejection at the $1.127 level, suggesting sellers are defending this overhead resistance zone. The MACD indicator displays bullish momentum, though the signal line convergence suggests momentum may be waning. Volume patterns show healthy participation during the rally, with the spike confirming the uptrend, but the subsequent volume decline warns of potential consolidation ahead. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF sees short-term consolidation with bearish divergence emerging The 4-hour chart shows that the token has formed a series of higher lows above the trendline support around $0.95, but struggles to maintain momentum above $1.08-$1.10 resistance zone. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are stacked bullishly below the current price, confirming the medium-term uptrend remains intact. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview However, the RSI at 52.43 has retreated from overbought conditions and shows potential bearish divergence as price made marginal new highs while momentum indicators failed to confirm. The recent red candles indicate profit-taking pressure, and the failure to reclaim $1.08 resistance suggests bears are gaining control in the short term. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.8335 BUY SMA 5 $0.9331 BUY SMA 10 $0.9812 BUY SMA 21 $0.9182 BUY SMA 50 $0.8820 BUY SMA 100 $0.8405 BUY SMA 200 $1.1918 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9305 BUY EMA 5 $0.8953 BUY EMA 10 $0.8071 BUY EMA 21 $0.6872 BUY EMA 50 $0.6642 BUY EMA 100 $0.9175 BUY EMA 200 $1.3354 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is likely entering a sideways trading phase between $0.95 and $1.10 as the market decides its next move. While the bigger picture still looks positive, the recent struggle to push higher suggests buyers are taking a breather. If the token loses its footing below $0.95, we could see a pullback to around $0.85, but a strong push above $1.10 with solid volume would open the door to $1.20. For now, expect some choppiness as bulls and bears battle it out in this range. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The change was made public on Friday following a detailed report by ProPublica that revealed how Department of Defense cloud services were still being handled—at least partially—by engineers located inside China. The company admitted the change came in direct response to questions about why these foreign engineers were involved in U.S. defense work in the first place. Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief communications officer, said on X: “In response to concerns raised earlier this week about US-supervised foreign engineers, Microsoft has made changes to our support for US Government customers to assure that no China-based engineering teams are providing technical assistance for DoD Government cloud and related services.” ProPublica report exposes foreign oversight of U.S. military cloud The backlash started days earlier when ProPublica exposed how Microsoft’s Azure engineers in China were helping manage parts of the Pentagon’s cloud system, with American “digital escorts” overseeing the work. But the problem? These U.S.-based escorts often had less technical skill than the foreign engineers they were supposed to supervise. The report raised serious concerns about how this setup could open the door for cyberattacks from Beijing. Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense under Trump’s administration, said on Friday that the entire arrangement was unacceptable. “This is obviously unacceptable, especially in today’s digital threat environment,” Hegseth said in a video posted to X. He described the entire system as outdated, saying, “It’s a legacy system created over a decade ago, during the Obama administration.” Hegseth also confirmed that the Department of Defense would begin a full internal review to identify similar activity across other systems. Microsoft’s decision affects its Azure cloud division, which analysts estimate now brings in more than 25% of its total revenue. That puts it ahead of Google Cloud in market size, though still behind Amazon Web Services. Microsoft noted in its latest earnings that over half of its $70 billion first-quarter revenue came from U.S.-based clients, with government contracts playing a huge role. The company had previously won a $10 billion cloud defense contract from the Pentagon in 2019. But that contract was canceled in 2021 after a legal dispute. A year later, in 2022, Microsoft was awarded part of a $9 billion joint cloud deal alongside Amazon, Google, and Oracle. Before the ProPublica investigation, Microsoft had insisted that all of its staff and contractors followed the rules set by the U.S. government. But public scrutiny forced a quick policy reversal. Frank, speaking again on behalf of the company, said, “We remain committed to providing the most secure services possible to the US government, including working with our national security partners to evaluate and adjust our security protocols as needed.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-19 08:05:04
48523337,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74831,1752912342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Forecasts XRP Price If Bitcoin Hits $140,000",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-forecasts-xrp-price-if-bitcoin-hits-140000/,"As Bitcoin approaches new all-time highs, crypto market analysts are paying increased attention to how alternative coins might respond. One researcher, known online as “Ripple Van Winkle,” recently expressed confidence that XRP could rise significantly if Bitcoin climbs to the $140,000 level. Van Winkle proposed that under such circumstances, XRP would not merely reach moderate price targets. Instead, he believes the token could exceed the $10 threshold and potentially climb to $14. This prediction aligns with broader market expectations that a shift in investor capital from Bitcoin to altcoins could create upward pressure on high-profile tokens such as XRP. Veteran Traders Also Back XRP’s Upside Van Winkle’s projection echoes recent comments made by market veteran ProfitMana, who included XRP among his top investment picks for the ongoing bull cycle. According to Mana, XRP has the potential to deliver returns between five and seven times its current value. He also suggested that the token’s price could peak at around $21 during this market cycle. If BTC tags $140K, XRP doesn’t just go to $7. It blows through $10 — maybe even $14. The XRP/BTC pair is the ultimate alpha signal. Rotation is coming. Be early or be exit liquidity. $XRP — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) July 17, 2025 These forecasts come at a time when Bitcoin, which briefly touched $120,000 earlier in the day, is now trading slightly lower at $117,400 . Its market dominance has declined by approximately 4.6% over the past week, signaling a potential redistribution of capital toward altcoins. During the same period, XRP has gained traction, with its market dominance increasing by 26%, reflecting renewed interest from investors. At a hypothetical price of $14, XRP’s market capitalization would stand near $825 billion. This would place the token in close competition with Ethereum in terms of total market value, significantly raising its profile in the crypto sector. XRP/BTC Pair as a Key Indicator A central element in Van Winkle’s forecast is the XRP/BTC trading pair, which he referred to as an essential metric for evaluating XRP’s breakout potential. Although he did not offer an in-depth analysis, other experts have provided technical context for this pairing. Earlier this month, analyst CrediBULL observed that the pair had approached a critical resistance level of 0.00002162 BTC for the fifth time in one month, after being rejected four times previously. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This resistance zone is aligned with a key Fibonacci retracement level, making it a strong technical barrier. A breakout above this level, which did occur, paved the way for further gains. As of the latest data, the pair is trading at 0.00003051 BTC. If the breakout holds, it may serve as further confirmation of the altcoin rally narrative. Historically, such breakouts in the XRP/BTC pair have been followed by sustained upward movements in XRP’s value, particularly during periods of waning Bitcoin dominance. Market Timing and Strategic Positioning Van Winkle emphasized the importance of early positioning for investors looking to benefit from a potential XRP rally. He advised market participants not to delay entry, cautioning that waiting too long could lead to missed opportunities or disadvantageous entry points. His message was clear: those who wait for broader market consensus might find themselves entering at the top, with limited room for gains. This view was also shared by software developer Vincent Van Code, who stated that the opportunity to buy XRP at ideal levels may already be gone. With Bitcoin showing signs of maturity in its current cycle and altcoins gaining momentum, many analysts believe the conditions are in place for a major shift in market leadership. XRP, supported by strong technical indicators and renewed investor interest, may be among the primary beneficiaries of that transition.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction WLD Price Target July 2025 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $ 1.13932919 -3.09% Market Cap $ 1,985,864,918.1666 Circulating Supply 1,743,012,407.2276 Trading Volume $ 319,165,480.1332 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 WLD Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is poised for potential price action as it aims to retest the $1.60 level. If optimistic momentum builds, a further bullish movement could lead to $2.12 level. However, if WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory, it risks dropping back to as low as $0.57. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) Worldcoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.57 1.60 2.12 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 In the first half of 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) continued its downward trend, particularly in Q1, where it hit an all-time low of $0.57. However, a glimmer of hope emerged in Q2 as the price attempted to rise from April onwards. Unfortunately, momentum faltered after reaching $1.62, and from the third week of May to the third week of June, the price fell to $0.79. Yet, the last week of June brought a positive shift, with improved geopolitical conditions helping the price surge to the $1.15 mark by the third week of July. This optimism was due to broader crypto market optimism and their latest achievement that boosted its utility with its Orb device , which is available in 46 countries in July. As a result, an golden cross is witnessed in the WLD price, and it is aiming for the 200-day EMA. The past couple of months’ price action suggests a potential reawakening of bullish sentiment, as a slight upward trendline has given support to the WLD price, hinting at a possible short-term rise. At this juncture, many are curious: what could propel Worldcoin higher? History shows that social sentiment often plays a crucial role in the crypto space. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s value. If optimistic momentum builds in the coming sessions, WLD might retest the $1.60 level in July. A further bullish movement could lead to a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure, breaking above the $2.12 level. Clearing this threshold and confirming a ChoCh could signal a breakout from its bearish pattern, potentially allowing Worldcoin to retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, caution is warranted. If WLD fails to maintain its bullish trajectory this year, it could drop as low as $0.57, reminding investors of the volatility inherent in the crypto market.

However, limited transparency in cost structures and relatively higher entry points restrict wider accessibility. Pros: Low entry point Good flexibility in plan choices Cons: Newer platform with limited historical data Mixed transparency reviews BitFuFu suits beginners and budget-conscious miners but requires cautious approach due to limited platform history. 5. Hashing24 Overview: Founded: 2016 Minimum investment: ~$5 (low GH/s plans) Payout frequency: Daily Trustpilot rating: Unavailable (company flagged for displaying misleading content) Hashing24 is among the oldest cloud mining services, known for transparent and straightforward contracts. Yet, recent Trustpilot warnings and limited additional features may raise concerns for new investors. Pros: Low initial investment Established presence in market Cons: Trustpilot warning indicates transparency issues Limited detailed information publicly available Hashing24 could appeal to those looking for minimal investments, but transparency concerns make it risky.

48524196,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769141,1752913925,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48524196.jpeg,Hedge funds are shorting the yen with $1.1 billion in bearish contracts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hedge-funds-short-japan-yen/,"Hedge funds are betting against the yen hard this week, dumping more than $1.1 billion into short positions just days before Japan’s Upper House election on Sunday, according to Bloomberg. Around 12,606 futures and options contracts have been opened against the currency, marking the first net bearish positioning since March. The focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can avoid a collapse. The LDP already holds a minority in the lower house. Now, polls suggest they’re likely to underperform again in the Upper House. If the ruling coalition loses more seats, investors expect chaos on the fiscal front. Economic policy could become harder to manage, and traders are positioning for exactly that. Traders brace for deeper losses as bond yields rise Aroop Chatterjee, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo, said , “An LDP loss could open the door to more fiscal spending with the opposition pushing for consumption tax cuts, implying wider fiscal deficits and weighing on long-end” government bonds. His team thinks the yen could drop to 150 per dollar if the opposition takes control. As of Friday, the yen was trading at 148.80. MUFG strategists gave a similar warning, advising traders to short the yen ahead of the vote. That message has landed. Traders have watched the currency lose nearly 3% in July, after it had rallied 10% in the first half of the year. That rally was tied to weakness in the dollar at the height of Trump’s trade war, but the mood has now flipped. The situation is being made worse by bond market volatility. Ten-year Japanese government bond yields just touched 1.6%, the highest they’ve been since 2008. The 20- and 30-year bonds are also at levels last seen in 1999. Rising yields are a direct response to fiscal uncertainty, and they’re piling more pressure on the yen. Jayati Bharadwaj and Alex Loo, both at TD Securities, explained the breakdown like this: “Long yen positioning versus the dollar had been looking stretched and vulnerable. We expect the yen to remain under pressure in the near-term.” They’re not alone. Options traders flip bias as risk multiplies Traders in the options market are already preparing for a deeper drop. On July 11, call options on the dollar-yen pair, which profit when the yen weakens, were being bought more than twice as often as puts, based on data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s central limit order book. That ratio shows where the momentum is heading. Meanwhile, Shigeru’s party is trying to win support with cash handouts, while the opposition wants to cut the sales tax, both policies that could blow up the budget even more. If either of those plans go ahead, deficits will grow. Investors already seem convinced, given the surge in short-term bond yields. This week, the yen dropped to its lowest level since April, adding to the fear. Short-dated options contracts also turned net negative on the yen versus the dollar, the first time that’s happened in nearly a year. That kind of signal usually means investors are bracing for more pain. One of the more surprising changes is what’s happening with global reserves. In the first quarter of the year, foreign-exchange managers moved out of the yen and into the Swiss franc in large volumes. That’s unusual, and it shows just how much trust the yen has lost as a safe-haven currency. The switch was driven by Japan’s growing trade deficit and sluggish economic growth. Some analysts still think a good election outcome could give the yen a small break. Omori from Mizuho Securities said the yen could strengthen to around 144 per dollar if the LDP keeps its majority. But no one’s banking on that. All eyes are now on the August 1 deadline. If talks between Trump and Japanese officials over tariffs don’t go anywhere by then, it could make things worse. Trade negotiations have dragged on for months with almost no movement. Until something gives, the yen’s outlook is going to stay messy. Traders aren’t waiting to find out. They’ve already decided which way this is going.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-president-is-proud-of-ripple-and-xrp-ledger-heres-why/,"Ripple has taken a significant step toward expanding its institutional custody services in the Middle East by partnering with Ctrl Alt to support the Dubai Land Department’s (DLD) Real Estate Tokenization Project. The announcement is notable, as it highlights Ripple’s growing global custody footprint and shows the increasing institutional interest in XRP in the UAE. Monica Long, President of Ripple, underlined the gravity of Ripple Custody’s role in this initiative. In a post on X, she highlighted the critical importance of secure, institutional-grade custody, stating, “As trillions of dollars of assets… become tokenized around the world, you cannot overstate the importance of bank-grade custody and security underpinning these assets.” She emphasized that safeguarding the DLD’s tokenized title deeds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is “no elementary task,” reinforcing Ripple’s position as a trusted provider of institutional-grade infrastructure. As trillions of dollars of assets (bonds, stocks, real estate, the list goes on) become tokenized around the world, you cannot overstate the importance of bank-grade custody and security underpinning these assets. Proud to have Ripple Custody safeguarding the Dubai Land… https://t.co/jVkjT5N36K — Monica Long (@MonicaLongSF) July 17, 2025 Bank-Grade Security for Tokenized Assets The DLD launched this tokenization initiative in May. According to this announcement, Ripple’s custody solution will be responsible for the secure, scalable storage of these tokenized assets. According to Ripple, this effort will enable more transparent and efficient real estate transactions while opening the door to fractional ownership. The move aligns with Dubai’s broader push to modernize its asset markets through tokenization and digital transformation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s institutional-grade custody technology will serve as the foundation for securing tokenized property ownership records, which are now being issued on XRPL. This infrastructure will enable global investors to securely access Dubai’s real estate market, a development that could redefine asset accessibility and participation in the region. Ripple’s Strengthening Presence in the UAE This partnership complements Ripple’s expansion in the UAE’s digital asset space. Earlier this year, Ripple became the first blockchain-enabled payments firm to be licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), opening up a new market for XRP adoption. Ripple has also formed key relationships with regional financial institutions such as Zand Bank and Mamo . Both XRP and RLUSD are approved for use within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). With over a decade of experience and regulatory licenses across more than 60 jurisdictions, Ripple is positioning itself as a central infrastructure provider for tokenized asset markets. The UAE’s integration of Ripple Custody into the national real estate system demonstrates the growing institutional confidence in the firm’s role in powering the tokenized economy. As the tokenization expands, Ripple and XRP will play more prominent roles. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

He noted that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has crossed above the 200-day SMA on the daily chart. This golden cross pattern often signals strong bullish momentum in markets. Merlijn emphasized its historical impact, saying: “Every. Single. Time. This signal shows up $BTC goes vertical.” Past instances provide compelling context. Both the 2017 and 2020 golden crosses preceded surges exceeding 2,000 percent. The last golden cross emerged in October 2024 when Bitcoin hovered around $65,000. Within three months, BTC reached near $110,000. Merlijn argues that the current setup mirrors those high‑impact events. This newer cross was confirmed on May 22. Since then, Bitcoin has gained roughly 12 percent. Based on patterns from 2016’s more short-lived golden cross, some analysts say the run could continue to $155,000. The pattern shown on a weekly chart indicates more upside ahead. Cointelegraph previously observed Bitcoin’s first-ever weekly golden cross at the start of 2024. That event marked the onset of the current bull run. However, technical signals are only part of the story. For a stronger breakout, Bitcoin needs to break above the $120,000 resistance zone. According to trader and analyst Rekt Capital, a daily close above this range high could confirm the move. He told X: “Daily Close above ~$120k Range High resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would see Bitcoin confirm a breakout to new highs.” In addition, as BTC consolidates, capital appears to be rotating into altcoins. But renewed interest in altcoins often supports the broader crypto rally. For now, the golden cross continues to draw attention. If history is any guide, the BTC price may follow its steepest inclines yet.

Ripple (XRP) burst out of multi-month highs, and Bonk (BONK) is seeing resistance levels. Meanwhile, a new Ethereum Layer 2 token, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), is rapidly gaining ground during its presale phase. Each token presents a different narrative enterprise use, meme-fueled growth, and infrastructure evolution. Ripple (XRP) Breaks Past Key Resistance XRP recently surged above $2.75 and is now consolidating near $2.78 after reaching highs around $2.90. Analysts say the $2.35 level, previously a strong resistance zone, has now flipped into support. If XRP holds this range, it could initiate a broader push toward $3.00. The breakout follows increasing on-chain activity and continued speculation around institutional adoption. Market participants are monitoring closely, as XRP continues to build momentum after weeks of sideways action. Substantial price stability at a level above $2.60 may be an indicator of a bullish formation proceeding into late Q3. BONK Eyes Breakout After 16% Rally Bonk (BONK) is also flashing strength. As shown on the Binance daily chart, the meme token just rallied 16.52% and now trades around $0.00002619. It is testing a critical resistance band that rejected prior attempts in April and May. If bulls succeed in pushing beyond this red zone, the next target could be near $0.00003. After a period of accumulation, BONK is back in the spotlight and it looks like investors are getting interested in the meme coin again. Technicals say the breakout could be a longer term reversal if volume holds. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Built for Speed Unlike legacy meme coins, Little Pepe is a Layer 2 blockchain built for scalability, low fees and community governance. It has the $LILPEPE utility token at the heart of its operation, a token that drives the Little Pepe ecosystem. The project blends meme culture with real utility, aiming to be more than a short-lived trend. Currently in Stage 5 of its presale , $LILPEPE is priced at $0.0014, with the next stage set to increase to $0.0015. Over $5.68 million has been raised, and 87.96% of this phase allocation has been sold, equating to 4.61 billion tokens out of 5.25 billion. Buyers can participate using ETH, USDT (ERC-20), or debit/credit cards through connected wallets like MetaMask. USDT users must also hold ETH for gas fees. The token supply totals 100 billion, with 26.5% allocated to presale and the rest distributed across staking (13.5B), liquidity (10B), CEX reserves (10B), marketing (10B), and chain reserves (30B). A Meme Coin With a Roadmap and Structure Little Pepe doesn’t have transaction taxes or rug-pull mechanisms. It has themed development phases “Pregnancy,” “Birth,” and “Growth” that align with staking features, meme-focused launchpad plans and governance rollout. The project has subsequently become popular due to its transparency, anti-bot measures, and a clearly presented post-launch timeline, including possible centralized exchange (CEX) listing. However, no exchange names have been confirmed yet. Further, a $777,000 giveaway campaign is also active, rewarding 10 winners with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each. Little Pepe Joins the Elite Trio Ripple is testing historical highs, and BONK is trying to confirm its breakout. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) enters the scene as a new Layer 2 solution with meme and tech. Structured tokenomics, an ongoing presale and Ethereum compatibility make it a serious contender for high-growth portfolios in 2025.

Traders Are More Focused On This New Altcoins 5000% Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/set-for-30-spike-traders-are-more-focused-on-this-new-altcoins-5000-potential/,"The cryptocurrency market has officially entered a bullish phase, recording a $4 trillion valuation for the first time. This milestone, driven by explosive rallies in Ethereum and promising altcoins within its ecosystem, signals a potential rotation from Bitcoin dominance into higher-beta alts. One of the coins expected to benefit from the Ethereum euphoria is Shiba Inu (SHIB). Shiba Inu price has held steady above key support levels in the last few days, but that is likely to change, as bulls eye a 30% push before August. Another crypto asset with huge market upside is Remittix ; the market potential of the new crypto nears a 100x . Experts are super bullish on RTX, especially since its ongoing presale continues to gain momentum, and many of them believe it could mint millionaires in 2025. Let’s get into the details. Buyers Eye a 30% Near-Term Rally for Shiba Inu Price As Ethereum Continues to Soar The Shiba Inu price is showing strong signs of a near-term breakout, thanks to bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. An analyst recently highlighted the formation of a golden cross on SHIB’s chart, a bullish signal that tends to precede large upward moves. Data from CoinMarketCap shows there is a rise in SHIB trading volume and renewed interest in meme tokens. This development has fueled buyers’ push for new higher highs; now, they eye a possible 30% price rally for SHIB before the end of July. At press time, Shiba Inu price is trading near a key price range, but if broken, could trigger the next leg up. Moreover, SHIB’s connection to Ethereum via Shibarium and its broader ecosystem will give buyers an advantage in the final months of 2025. However, the growth trajectory of Shiba Inu price could still be limited by broader market rotation and competition from other crypto gems in the meme trenches. Smart Money Won’t Stop Moving To Remittix (RTX) Remittix (RTX) is a new PayFi protocol targeting one of the biggest inefficiencies in crypto: the lack of seamless, real-world payment solutions. Its infrastructure is solid, and its integrations are also impressive, allowing RTX to facilitate direct crypto-to-fiat payments instantaneously across borders. Smart money appears to be moving toward Remittix, and here’s why it wouldn’t stop: Remittix has a working infrastructure. It is a utility-first token with real volume use cases Retail investment will follow whale activity. Multiple listings inbound once after launch in Q3. Interestingly, Remittix recently began a giveaway where ten lucky winners will each walk away with $25,000 worth of $RTX tokens. All you have to do is enter the competition and boost your odds by sharing and completing bonus tasks. SHIB may give you 30%, but RTX has the potential to retire you early in 2025.

Using Elliott Wave Theory as the basis, the projection outlines a clear 5-wave impulse structure, with XRP currently positioned at the beginning of wave five. This analysis has gained traction among market participants, and the current price action aligns with the early stages of wave five. The chart shows this as the second most aggressive and expansive move in the cycle. Wave three is often the most aggressive, and it peaked when XRP hit $3.39 in January, setting the stage for Wave 5. The asset’s consolidation since early February formed Wave 4, with XRP falling to a low of $1.64, the lowest since early November 2024, when it still traded below $0.55. The recent climb has formed Wave 5, and Steph has lofty expectations. The final #XRP wave pic.twitter.com/BU01j0oPYn — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 18, 2025 Potential Targets for XRP At the time the chart was posted, XRP was trading above $3, having broken out from the consolidation phase that marked the wave four correction. The steep upward angle of the projected wave five suggests a sharp move toward higher valuations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph described this as “the final XRP wave,” indicating a belief that once this move is completed, a broader correction or cycle top could follow. Although there is no specific timeline, the projection means a parabolic phase is forming for the coming months. The visual structure adheres to the classic Elliott Wave model, and the chart suggests that XRP could be headed toward $12. XRP is currently trading at $3.45, and this target represents a notable 247.83% increase for the asset. Notably, other prominent analysts have set similar targets for XRP , adding credence to Steph’s analysis. What’s Next for XRP? If Wave five reaches its full potential, XRP would experience a near 4x move from the $3 range. Such a rally would likely shift market cap rankings and renew interest in XRP’s role in broader financial markets. While XRP had multiple rallies in past market cycles, this would be its most notable rally as it would send it to double digits for the first time. However, some analysts have even more bullish expectations, as one suggested XRP could hit $110 through an Elliott Wave pattern that mirrors its price movements from 2017.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Mericle says he expects the Fed to make three rate cuts this year, starting in two months, as he predicts tariff-driven inflation will be transitory. “I think the latest batch of data suggests that the stakes are not hugely high at the moment, that the economy, the labor market at least, doesn’t seem to be in need of great rate cuts. But the inflation data, from my perspective, suggests that we’re doing just fine, and that the underlying trend is moving back towards something closer to 2% – even if tariff effects are and are likely to continue to give us a little bit of a boost on top of that. We still have three cuts penciled in for later this year. I think they could start in September, because I’m relaxed about the inflation news. I think we are moving in the right direction for reasons many economists anticipated; supply and demand, especially in the labor market, are back in balance. We’re seeing the end of catch-up inflation, and I’m not worried about tariffs unanchoring inflation expectations, but I do think you are seeing those effects show up from month to month.” Mericle also says that one reason why tariff impacts will be short-lived is that the economic conditions, particularly in the labor market, are much different from what they were about three years ago when inflation soared. “The actual boost to inflation, especially against a backdrop where the economy is not nearly facing the same degree of labor market tightness as it did back when we all worried about this in 2022, probably means that the tariff effects are not going to spark a long, prolonged period of high inflation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Teng made important statements about the growth of the platform since its establishment, its regulatory compliance efforts, and the institutional acceptance process of cryptocurrencies. Founded in 2017, Binance has now reached approximately 300 million users and a total trading volume of $125 trillion. Its average daily trading volume is $91 billion. According to Richard Teng, interest in crypto has accelerated significantly, especially after 2024. In the past year alone, the number of Binance users has increased from 170 million to 280 million. Teng described this period as “the history of crypto's mainstreaming.” In an interview last year, Teng stated that Binance has no plans for an initial public offering (IPO) and that they are not considering returning to the US market, and after these statements, he evaluated the changing global environment as follows: The year 2024 marked a turning point. With the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, many institutional investors who had previously been skeptical of crypto are now showing interest in the space. The IPO trend has become a marker of cryptocurrency's integration into the mainstream financial system. Related News: Strong Rally Continues in Ethereum: Analyst Shares His Target Price Level -“It No Longer Seems Unrealistic” Teng said that government investment funds, family offices, and foundations are now accepting crypto as an asset class, making IPOs a natural progression for the sector. While he didn't provide a new date for Binance's direct IPO plan, he noted that the $2 billion investment from institutional investors like MGX in Binance is a strong sign that crypto is becoming institutionalized. In the interview, Teng also responded to the question of whether “regulations restrict innovation” due to the short-lived nature of applications such as purchasing flight tickets with crypto in some countries: “The development of new technologies always outpaces regulatory frameworks. This was true in the internet age, and it's true today with artificial intelligence and blockchain. Regulation and innovation don't have to be at odds. On the contrary, a technology-friendly regulatory framework protects consumers and fosters industry growth.” *This is not investment advice.

The analytics platform says that, based on the short-term holder (STH) cost basis model, the next major resistance level for the crypto king stands below $140,000. The STH cost basis model is an on-chain metric that estimates the average price at which short-term Bitcoin holders acquired their coins. The metric can be used to spot potential entry and exit points. “Assuming current momentum remains strong, the next key resistance lies at the +2 standard deviation band, which is currently trading around $136,000.” Source: Glassnode Glassnode, however, says that while there’s potential for another leg higher for Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset could form a near-term top as short-term holders are sitting on significant unrealized profits. “Bitcoin has broken to new [all-time highs] ATHs, and has cleared above two major accumulation zones. This represents a significant market move, which tends to be followed by strong positive momentum. However, short-term holders, being the more price-sensitive cohort, are now seeing their unrealized profit reaching marginally overheated levels, making the incentive for them to sell and take profit increasingly likely.” According to Glassnode, the percentage of short-term holder supply of Bitcoin in profit is currently at 95%, seven percentage points above the long-term mean of 88%. “If this metric begins to stabilize or decline below the 88% level, it could be an early signal of weakening demand or distribution taking hold.” Source: Glassnode Bitcoin is trading at $117,810 at time of writing.

Amidst Bitcoin's surge and XRP's impressive performance, a new contender emerges. The presale of XYZVerse is capturing attention with the potential to attain a $1 billion market cap. Enthusiasts and investors are eager to explore what this next-generation platform brings to the table. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Bitcoin Unveiled: How Digital Currency is Changing Finance Bitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency. It was created by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin allows people to send money directly to each other without using a bank. Instead of physical coins, it exists as a record on a shared system called the blockchain. This means everyone can see all the transactions, making it transparent. To make sure transactions are real, people called miners solve difficult puzzles to confirm them. When they do, they earn new bitcoins as a reward. This process helps keep the system safe from fraud. Bitcoin has a lot of potential to change how we use money. By removing the need for banks, it can make transactions faster and cheaper. The number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, which can make it valuable like gold. Every four years, the rewards for miners are cut in half, a process known as ""halving."" This can affect how profitable it is to mine bitcoins and can influence the market. Right now, many people are interested in Bitcoin because of its unique features and potential for growth. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin remains the leader and could be an attractive option in the current market. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency Shaping Global Payments XRP is making waves as a cryptocurrency designed for quick, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it's a digital currency that's open and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the company that received 80 billion XRP from the founders, uses the currency to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem. By placing 55 billion XRP in escrow, Ripple ensures a controlled release of the currency into the market, reflecting its commitment to stability and growth. In the current market, XRP's potential stands out due to its unique features. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, it doesn't require a bank account for settlements and operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. Its ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies aligns with global trends toward faster and more efficient transactions. Compared to coins like Bitcoin, which can have slower transaction times and higher fees, XRP offers a compelling alternative. As the demand for digital payment solutions grows, XRP's technology and vision position it as an attractive option to watch in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Conclusion Bitcoin and XRP are thriving, but XYZVerse's pioneering sports memecoin could achieve exceptional growth, uniting fans across sports in a unique, community-driven ecosystem.

This next-gen cryptocurrency is poised to make waves in the meme coin sector, potentially reaching a $1 billion market cap due to its innovative approach and strong community backing. Unpacking the Rise of XYZVerse in the Cryptocurrency Arena Introduced in a market already rich with viral tokens, XYZVerse's entry is timely. Meme coins have shown that with the right mix of marketing, community support, and utility, substantial market caps are achievable. The current climate, marked by an upcoming altcoin season, presents a fertile ground for XYZVerse's growth, especially if it continues to garner support through strategic partnerships and maintains its hype post-launch. Strategic Advantages and Market Potential of XYZVerse Strong partnerships with sports figures and influencers help expand its market presence. Introduction of deflationary tactics, such as a 17.13% token burn to enhance value. A 15% liquidity reserve to ensure price stability once trading commences. Community-driven incentives that encourage long-term holding and participation. Given its current presale price of $0.003333, XYZVerse's projections are ambitious yet attainable, targeting a post-launch price of $0.10, with potential spikes between $0.15 and $0.25 driven by strong demand and strategic exchange listings. Detailed Price Goals for XYZVerse's Near Future Initial Post-Presale Price Target: $0.10 First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch High: $0.15 to $0.25 Six to Twelve Month Outlook: $0.20 to $0.40, contingent on sustained marketing and strategic alignments Invest Early in XYZVerse for Potential High Returns The Groundbreaking Impact of Bitcoin: A Technology and Financial Phenomenon Bitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, revolutionized finance by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for traditional banking infrastructures. Its decentralized nature not only fosters transparency but also enhances security, governed by a technology called the blockchain. As Bitcoin continues to be a market leader, its potential to reshape financial landscapes remains substantial. XRP’s Role in Modernizing Global Payments XRP distinguishes itself by enabling fast, cost-effective, and expansive cross-border transactions. Developed by Ripple and vigorously supported by the underlying technology of the XRP Ledger, this cryptocurrency offers a significant advantage over traditional financial systems by facilitating seamless transactions across various currencies.

The Graph price is expected to go as high as $1.00 in 2025. GRT price with a potential surge could reach a maximum of $3.54 by 2030. AI may be taking center stage in today’s tech revolution, but behind every smart application lies the challenge of accessing and organizing reliable data. That’s where The Graph (GRT) steps in—an innovative indexing protocol transforming how blockchain data is queried. As interest in The Graph surges, especially after its major 2025 upgrades and the launch of substreams-powered subgraphs, the question on everyone’s mind is: Can GRT price reach $1? In this article, we break down its technical potential, rising developer adoption, and market sentiment in our detailed The Graph Price Prediction 2025–2030 . Table of contents Story Highlights Overview GRT Price Target July 2025 GRT Price Prediction 2025 GRT Coin Price Prediction 2026-2030 What Does The Market Say?

If it manages to flip the 200-day EMA, then the GRT token might retest the $0.20 resistance, which aligns with a declining trendline. If the altcoins sector booms, there are higher odds that with the broader crypto trend, GRT crypto will even break the $0.20 level in order to retest the $0.33 supply level in July. But, if the breakout does not occur, and repels back from trendline resistance, then $0.12 and $0.08 support will be revisited. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) The Graph Price Targets July 2025 0.08 0.22 0.33 GRT Price Prediction 2025 The Graph Network is mostly used by developers and data consumers who pay to query data. The network’s performance of The Graph can be assessed by its growth in the volume of queries and the accrual of query fees. Recently, a report from Messari showed that query volume shot upto 6.1 billion in Q1 2025, and the updated Q2 2025 query volume per its official website highlights that it has reached 11.5 billion, reflecting robust developer adoption. Also, the Graph protocol’s on Dune highlights that since their network has migrated to Arbitrum, their network is growing fast in 2025. The query fees generated by data consumers of The Graph have reached an all-time high on Arbitrum at 6.2 million. Meanwhile, the network holds 168,560 delegators who are contributing to securing the network and 6,921 active curators who signal useful subgraphs that should be indexed by the graph network. Overall, the Dune metrics show the growing ecosystem, which directly means strength increasing on fundamental levels. Even the Graph is progressing well with making integration with bigger brands like Tron. It seems its stars are slowly aligning for mass adoption to come in the future. On the price front, the GRT token has experienced a muted price journey, currently down over 80% from its 2024 peak and over 95% from its 2021 high. This divergence is notable, especially as its fundamentals remain strong. Analyzing the daily chart reveals a significant trend. Since the 2021 crash, GRT crypto has fluctuated between an ascending broadening wedge on the monthly chart. After each multi-month correction, the price has typically moved from the lower to the upper range. Historically, whenever the GRT price has reached $0.08, buyer demand has surged. In the current downtrend, the price has spent nearly 18 months in correction, coming from the pattern’s upper border to lower border, and now it is reacting to the $0.08 support level once again. Looking ahead to Q3, if GRT can break the $0.22 resistance, which aligns with a declining trendline of the current 18-month correction, a substantial surge could follow. This breakout could lead to a parabolic rise towards $1, but reaching a $0.55 high is essential for this to happen. If not, GRT may continue to consolidate.

The buying spree continued on July 18, with the firm acquiring an additional 158,875 ETH valued at $574 million. In total, BlackRock purchased 307,461 ETH, valued at $1.11 billion, across the two days, according to data obtained by Finbold from Lookonchain on July 19.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gradually beginning to move, and some have started to describe it as one of the best tokens that will be on the rise in the next few months. The presale of Mutuum Finance is already sold out by over 80%. More than 13700 investors have bought the presale. Already it has received in excess of $12.7million. As some are murmuring that a breakout might be imminent, crypto insiders are asking whether Mutuum Finance is the next 1000x moonshot that is right under their nose. And, should you have already missed the Solana, this could be your chance to ride the next wave before the rest of the audience is willing to get up. Investor Interest Builds Around Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is greatly impacting the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector because it is providing real-world applicable scalable monetary system. The popularity can even be quantified by the level of the interest of the investors since it has already crossed 13,700 token holders, coupled with over $12.7 million worth of investments that are evidences of the market’s willingness to be able to support itself in the long term. $50K Bug Bounty Program Now Live In addition to enhancing its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has further initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project will reward $50,000 USDT to the hunters that show potential areas of concerns through the program. The objective of the bounty program is to obtain adequate coverage in each of the types of vulnerability; it is broken down into the four severity levels; i.e., critical, major, minor and low. The project reflects the active will of the team towards the preservation of its ecosystem and investors’ confidence. $100K Giveaway Launched to Reward Mutuum Community Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway to win over the community as well. 10 of the individuals who will participate will each win $10,000 tokens of MUTM. This act does not only determine those who will be rewarded beforehand, but it also indicates that the project is willing to establish a solid and worthwhile base of users. Dual-Lending: Powering What’s Next in DeFi Mutuum Finance offers a distinct platform on which users control their assets in of decentralized borrowing. The platform employs a double-model structure to provide adaptability together with efficiency that encompass Peer-to-Contract as well as Peer-to-Peer of lending models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes self-executing smart contracts that execute the lending function autonomously with no intervention from humans. They are designed to run dynamically based on changing market prices, providing a variable rate of interest pegged to the present supply and demand of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and provides an opportunity to be in touch with lenders and borrowers directly. This is even superior towards utilization for volatile goods because it allows customized terms of loans and flexibility based on user choice and his or her risk-bearing capability. Over $12.7 million raised and 13,700+ investors onboard, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no longer a hidden gem. Phase 5 of the presale is already 80% sold out, and early investors are eyeing 100% gains at launch, with projections aiming far higher. The same kind of early momentum that turned $200 into $200,000 for Solana believers is building again, and this time the smart money is locking in early. Opportunities like this don’t wait, they reward those who move fast. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the presale closes and the next price surge begins.

The ETF is best suited for aggressive income seekers, not for growth or capital preservation, due to its declining price and speculative underlying asset. Distributions are inconsistent and not tax-efficient, making MARO more appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts and those who can handle payout variability. I rate MARO a hold, given the speculative nature of MARA, crypto volatility, and the risk of capital deterioration if sentiment shifts negatively. Overview YieldMax funds have earned a reputation for providing investors with a dividend yield that can be life changing under the right circumstances. I've covered a ton of these funds in the past, and I've always avoided a few specific ETFs due to the speculative nature of the underlying business. YieldMax MARA Option Income Strategy ETF ( MARO ) is one of the ETFs that I avoided because of the level of uncertainty around the business and the large levels of volatility. However, it's this level of volatility that allows MARO to reward shareholders with a distribution rate that currently sits around 125%! MARO implements an option strategy that aims to harness the volatility of MARA Holdings ( MARA ). If you aren't familiar, MARA is one of the leading Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and digital asset technology companies in the world. The core of their business is essentially operating Bitcoin mining machines as well as validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Additionally, the business holds a large Bitcoin treasury, which causes the share price of the stock to change rapidly. If we look at the price of Bitcoin and MARA below, we can see the clear correlation over the last few years. Data by YCharts As we all know, Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets on the planet, and this has always caused me to stay away from MARO. YieldMax funds have a poor reputation for deteriorating investor capital, and I feared that a decline in Bitcoin would cause MARO's price to collapse. While MARO is trading substantially below its inception price, the decline isn't nearly as bad as some YieldMax peers. MARO launched recently during December 2024, and the ETF has a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. Looking at the performance since inception, we can see how the price has declined by over 49%. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return still sits around a loss of 13%. So let's look at the fund strategy to determine whether or not MARO is worth the risk. Data by YCharts Fund Strategy MARO is a synthetic option ETF that is aimed at capturing the volatility of MARA. The term 'synthetic' means that MARO doesn't actually own any common shares of MARA, so it's essentially writing options on a stock it doesn't own. The synthetic nature of the fund means that there is an increased risk profile since MARO can experience price losses that are much larger than the actual declines that Mara Holdings. Over time, the price disconnect can increase substantially, especially if Bitcoin experiences a large run upward. So if you want exposure to Bitcoin or Mara Holdings, you'd be better off simply buying the underlying of each. For instance, MARO's holdings reveal that it doesn't actually hold any common shares or Bitcoin. MARO Holdings (YieldMax) MARO is best utilized by income investors that want to collect a high stream of cash flow. Investors should be aware that following the fund's price decline so far, the ETF is very unlikely to experience any sort of positive growth, price resilience, or stability in the future. The highly volatile nature of Bitcoin and MARA makes me certain that MARO isn't really useful for anything else except income generation. In order to generate the necessary income to fuel distributions, the fund chooses to simultaneously purchase ATM (at-the-money) call options and sell put options. The prospectus explains that in order to generate the option premiums, MARO sells OTM (out-of-the-money) call options that typically have a strike price somewhere between 0% and 15% above the current market price of MARA. The fund documents provided the helpful table below that can help explain the process. MARO Prospectus However, a significant drawback of option funds is the capped upside potential. Growth is essentially limited to whatever the selected strike price is. So if MARO writes an option and selects a strike price that is 5% above MARA's market price, but MARA increases by 15%, MARO's growth is capped at that 5% premium strike price. When this strategy is implemented over a prolonged bull market, MARO is aligned to underperform. The best-case scenario would be for MARA and Bitcoin to trade sideways or slowly rise for an extended period of time, so that MARO can capture both the growth while also rewarding shareholders with the premiums. Performance Scenarios And Risk Since MARO's inception is so recent, we are working with a limited performance history to reference. When including all distributions that were paid out, MARO's total return has closely tracked the overall performance of MARA Holdings. As we can see below, MARA has a total loss of about 12.4%, while MARO's total return sits at a loss slightly over 13%. There are a few scenarios that can play out here. Data by YCharts Scenarios MARA Holdings Rises In Value: In this scenario, MARO would likely underperform since the upside participation is capped by the option strategy. This is especially true if MARA's price appreciates rapidly over a short period of time. Additionally, as MARO's price increases, the distributions may also increase. This would be the most ideal scenario for the fund. Bitcoin stabilizes and MARA Trades Sideways: If prices were to remain flat for MARA, MARO would likely see lower payouts, but they would become more consistent in amount. Due to the generous payouts, there's a possibility that MARO's price would ultimately trend downward if the payouts were not reduced from their current levels. However, a sideways moving price would still provide an environment where the total return can be positive as the distributions are paid out every four weeks. MARA's Price Decline Continues: Bitcoin has crossed new highs recently, and if the price retracts from here, MARA is likely to also suffer from a downside move. In this scenario, I would expect higher levels of volatility and for MARO's distributions to remain in their elevated range. However, the total return of MARO is likely to remain negative, depending on how drastic the downside movement is. These are all theoretical possibilities for MARO, and I've used the performance of other YieldMax funds as a reference. MARO isn't the only fund that has some sort of indirect exposure to the crypto markets, so there are plenty of examples to choose from. Some of YieldMax's relevant funds with indirect crypto exposure are the following: Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ): Writes options on Strategy ( MSTR ), which also has a ton of Bitcoin exposure. YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ): Writes options on Coinbase ( COIN ). YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ): Aims to directly seek exposure to the price of Bitcoin. YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ): Tracks a portfolio of crypto industry and technology companies. Looking at the price history of these peers below, we can see a very similar story play out on a YTD basis. The history below is limited due to the fact that LFGY was recently launched in January of 2025. Despite Bitcoin being up YTD, all of the mentioned funds below have seen their price decline. These comparisons are just to demonstrate that this is the inherent risk involved with synthetic option ETFs. The price is very likely to see continued downside, even if the underlying assets they track appreciate in value over time. Data by YCharts This is why I want to put emphasis on the fact that MARO should only be utilized by investors that specifically seek income. A fund like MARO may not be a simple buy and hold position, especially due to MARA's speculative nature. Unlike businesses like Coinbase, MARA Holdings doesn't have the most reassuring earnings history . MARA has sporadic revenues and operating expenses that can be difficult to predict every quarter. While there may be short-term catalysts for the company, MARA isn't a stock that I personally feel confident in holding for an extended period. In comparison, a company like Coinbase has different revenue streams that help create a healthier looking balance sheet . Despite all of the optimism in the crypto markets this year, the Bitcoin cycle can shift. If there is a large retraction in the price of Bitcoin, I anticipate that MARO will experience a sizeable decline. As the price declines, so will the distributions, which makes it harder to turn a profit on this fund. So while I am fairly optimistic on the future of crypto, I would prefer to initiate a position in MARO when the cycle isn't at the height of its optimism. Dividend Utility As of the latest declared distribution of $2.3718 per share, the estimated annual yield currently sits around a whopping 125%. When we talk about a dividend yield this high, the ultimate end goal would be to reach 'house money' status. This is the cross point where you receive 100% of your initial investment back in the form of distributions. Since MARO offers a yield that is over 100%, an investor should technically be able to collect their initial investment back in less than twelve months, assuming that payouts remain the same. The only issue is that payouts tend to be wildly different every four weeks. A new payout is declared every four weeks and is determined by the underlying success of the option strategy, the price movement of MARA, and overall market volatility. As we can see below, the payouts have been varied since the fund's inception. Only four weeks ago, MARO experienced the lowest payout since the fund's inception, so conditions around the yield can change rapidly. MARO Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) If you haven't already, I would highly suggest going to the YieldMax site and reaching out to them to request being added to the distribution list. You will receive emails that detail the specific payouts each week. As we can see below, the latest distribution brings the estimated annual rate to slightly over 125% and was paid out on 7/18/2025. What stands out the most to me is that 0% of the distribution was funded using the return of capital. MARO Distribution Announcement (YieldMax) Usually, YieldMax funds put an emphasis on return of capital because they reduce the overall tax burden that investors have to deal with. For instance, I previously covered YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSFO ) and over 92% of the distribution was paid using return of capital. Distributions are likely classified as net investment income, which is considered to be ordinary dividend income. Therefore, we can assume that the majority of the distributions received from MARO will not be tax-efficient, and a position may be best utilized within a tax-advantaged account. Takeaway In conclusion, I rate MARO as a hold for now due to the speculative nature of the underlying focus on MARA Holdings. The fund will also be influenced by the movement of Bitcoin, and I am concerned about how MARO will perform if the crypto sentiment shifts. If Bitcoin and MARA experience a sizeable retraction, MARO will continue to deteriorate investor capital over time. Additionally, the distributions aren't tax-efficient, which means investors may need to consider the possibility of a larger tax burden at the end of the year.",MARA|BTC-USD|MSTY|MSTR|CONY|COIN|YBIT|LFGY|MARO,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-19 09:30:00

This unexpected forecast has stirred interest among investors, prompting curiosity about what sets XYZVerse apart in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.

It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high.

Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability.

Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.

As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Ondo (ONDO) Source: TradingView Ondo (ONDO) has experienced notable price gains recently. In the last week, the price surged by 15.68%, and over the past month, it climbed by 21.72%. This upward movement indicates growing market interest. However, over the past six months, ONDO's price declined by 26.46%, reflecting prior downward pressure. ONDO is currently trading between $0.80 and $0.97. The nearest resistance level is at $1.04. Breaking above this could lead to the second resistance at $1.21, approximately a 25% increase from current levels. The nearest support is at $0.70, and falling to the second support at $0.53 would mean a drop of about 35%. Technical indicators offer cautious optimism. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.95, slightly higher than the 100-day average of $0.93, hinting at short-term bullishness. The relative strength index stands at 56.86, below the overbought level, suggesting potential for further gains. The stochastic at 62.30 supports this moderate upward trend. The MACD level of 0.0043 indicates mild positive momentum. ONDO may continue to rise, but resistance levels could test this trend. Pi Network (PI) Source: TradingView Pi Network (PI) has faced significant price shifts recently. In the past week, its price fell by 6.38%. Over the last month, the decline was sharper at 23.91%. Looking back six months, the value has decreased by 37.14%. Currently trading between $0.44 and $0.51, PI is in a downward trend. These declines raise questions about PI's future direction. The RSI stands at 44.58, suggesting the market is neutral, neither overbought nor oversold. The immediate support level is at $0.41, with a lower support at $0.33. On the upside, resistance levels are at $0.56 and $0.63. Breaking through these could signal a potential rise. Technical indicators hint at possible stabilization. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $0.44 and $0.45 respectively, indicating price consolidation. A stochastic value of 18.26 points toward an oversold condition, potentially leading to a rebound. Investors are watching to see if PI can overcome resistance levels and reverse the downward trend. Conclusion While ONDO and PI Network have made their mark, XYZVerse unites sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem, positioning itself for significant growth in the current bull market.

Key Takeaways: Bullish filed for a U.S. IPO aiming to list on the NYSE under the ticker “BLSH.” The exchange reports over $2.5 billion in average daily trading volume in Q1 2025. Bullish’s IPO follows a wave of crypto companies going public amid growing institutional adoption. The firm, led by CEO Tom Farley, a former president of the New York Stock Exchange, plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BLSH.” Originally a spinout of blockchain company Block.one, Bullish gained early backing from Thiel’s Founders Fund and Thiel Capital, as well as investment from Nomura, crypto veteran Mike Novogratz, and others. Bullish Emerges as Top Crypto Exchange with $2.5 Billion Daily Volume According to the IPO filing, Bullish has quickly established itself among the top cryptocurrency exchanges, reporting average daily trading volumes exceeding $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025. The company claims it ranks in the top five for spot trading volumes of Bitcoin and Ether, competing with industry giants like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Since its launch, Bullish says total trading volume has surpassed $1.25 trillion. The company also made headlines last year when it acquired the crypto news outlet CoinDesk . This filing marks another significant milestone in the cryptocurrency sector’s ongoing push for mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. In addition, Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq earlier this year. JUST IN: crypto exchange Bullish files for IPO.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to attract investor attention, climbing above $117,000, up from around $94,000 at the start of the year. Adding to the evolving regulatory landscape, former President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday, introducing consumer protections for stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Crypto Leaders Welcome GENIUS Act Executives from Ondo Finance, Bitpanda, and Gluwa see the recent passage of the GENIUS Act as a pivotal shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Ian De Bode, Ondo Finance’s Chief Strategy Officer, called the bill “the beginning of a new regulatory era,” stressing that legal clarity has long been the biggest hurdle for full institutional involvement. He also noted the influential role of Patrick McHenry, who stood alongside President Trump during the bill’s signing, signaling the importance of this moment for the crypto industry. Bitpanda’s Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that regulatory progress in Washington has boosted investor confidence, fueling optimism not only in Bitcoin but also altcoins such as XRP and DOGE. He pointed out that broad market rallies require strong confidence, which clearer rules help provide. Tae Oh, CEO of Gluwa, emphasized the GENIUS Act’s role in establishing a federal framework for USD-pegged stablecoins. He believes this sets the stage for responsible innovation, consumer protection, and long-term growth across payments, decentralized finance, and financial infrastructure.

POL price predictions for 2025 suggest potential highs of $0.7655. Long-term forecasts indicate POL could reach $4.94 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framework of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction.

However, if conditions improve and POL successfully flips 200-day EMA bands, then in July, a retest of the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.30 could be on the horizon. On the contrary, if POL fails to break through the 20-day EMA, it could retreat to $0.15, with further bearish pressure potentially pushing it below $0.10. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Polygon Price Action July 2025 $0.10 $0.20 $0.30 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 The POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE reveals that since December 2024, the price has plummeted over 70%, with Q1 2025 significantly contributing to this decline. However, a shift occurred in April 2025 as bullish forces began to emerge, pushing the price towards the 0.236 level-based resistance by mid-May. Despite these efforts, the Polygon price remained low in Q2. However, it prepared a symmetrical triangle pattern in the past few months, and with the recent broader market rally and improved transaction volume in the Polygon network, its token is rising towards the Fibonacci 0.236 mark after breaking out from the symmetrical triangle’s upper border and inching towards the 200-day EMA band in order to flip it for a long-term uprise. This period of optimism manifested since last week in June onwards as bullish conviction of investors returned in the market from geopolitical easing, sparking a 45% boost by the third week of July. Nevertheless, if conditions keep on improving and POL retests and breaks the 0.236 Fibonacci level, then it will register a Change in Character (ChoCh) in its trend and could aim for the Fibonacci 0.5 level in Q3. In a more optimistic scenario, if before Q4 ends, POL sustains past the 0.50 Fibonacci level, then it might hit targets at the 0.786 and even the 1.0 Fibonacci levels by the end of 2025. However, if it fails to break through the Fibonacci 0.236 level, the price could retreat to $0.15, and further bearish pressure could push it below $0.10.

The gap between broader market performance and PI’s subdued valuation highlights deeper technical and structural issues. With the open mainnet anticipated in 2025, understanding Pi’s current position and its post-launch potential is critical for any price forecast. What’s the reason behind the sluggish Pi price rally? Will it rebound and rise in the coming months? Why Pi Price Isn’t Surging with the Crypto Market In the times when most of the altcoins are attempting to rise above the local resistance and slip the persisting bearish trend, Pi price remains calm. This divergence is rooted in technical limitations and market structure. Here are some reasons why the PI price is failing to gain strong bullish momentum. Enclosed Mainnet: It operates in its enclosed mainnet phase, where the PI tokens are non-transferable, not accessible on public block explorers and restricted to Pi’s internal apps No Official Exchange Listing: The crypto is listed on IOU representations but not on the actual tradable tokens. These cannot be withdrawn to a real Pi wallet, are unverified by the Pi core team and do not reflect real supply/demand dynamics. No On-Chain Volume: Unlike the other cryptos, PI does not have exchange access, high on-chain activity, DeFi, staking or NFT integration. It has zero footprint or smart contract-based utility, which makes it limited to organic and speculative growth What Could Change in the Rest of 2025? With the open mainnet launch expected sometime in 2025, Pi may finally unlock its on-chain functionality, shifting from speculative mining to tradable tokenomics. Besides, the Pi Core team has hinted at phased token unlocking mechanisms, including vesting periods, locking up for early miners and on-chain staking to delay circulation. On the other hand, to gain long-term value, Pi needs to evolve into a smart contract-enabled layer 1. This requires developer SDKs, dApp onboarding via Pi browser and gas fee utility for PI. The broader the use cases, the higher the transactional demand, which will support value accrual to native tokens in late 2025 and beyond. Pi Price Prediction 2025: Does PI have an Upside Potential to $5? PI has been experiencing massive selling pressure since its launch, which has shaken the confidence of the investors. As a result, the price has been maintaining a strong descending trend with fewer chances of a rebound. With the bears dominating the rally, is it possible for the PI price to rise to $5 in 2025? As seen in the above chart, the price is extending the falling wedge as the bears are nullifying the attempt for a breakout each time. The Bollinger bands have squeezed, which suggests a drop in the volume and volatility. This usually results in a massive breakout, but in the case of PI one cannot expect a larger price action. Mainly because the RSI is trading extremely lower, hinting towards a drop in the strength of the rally. With this, the possibility of a strong upswing could not be feasible in the near future. However, the market sentiments could change with the launch of the mainnet and with this, the Pi Network price is expected to rise beyond the current highs.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 09:33:24

According to reports, residents in Wisconsin have lost thousands to the growing crypto scam, showing the need for better regulations that aim to protect them from losing more. The sheriff’s office in central Wisconsin also discussed the rise in fraud related to Bitcoin in the region, noting that one person lost as much as $40,000 in a single case. “Having these restrictions is only going to provide financial safety for our Community, and we’re super excited that someone’s moving forward with that,” said Investigative Lt. Scott Goldberg. Wisconsin set to unveil new laws to tackle crypto scams According to a newly proposed law , Bitcoin Treasury Machines are expected to be restricted, which means that if someone loses funds through one of these machines, the cryptocurrency company will refund the victim. In addition, the newly proposed regulation will also require every cryptocurrency machine company to post signs warning users about fraudulent transactions. Under the bill, only $1,000 in BTC can be sent at in a day, and fees charged by crypto firms will be reduced per transaction. Cryptocurrency fraud has been on the rise in the past few years, and fraud prevention experts have pointed to crypto ATMs as one of the favorite tools that scammers are now using to facilitate their crime. This is because these machines do not undergo the same regulatory process as traditional ATMs, and victims are not covered under any type of insurance for losses. “There’s no recovery, so that’s what makes these really, really difficult,” Scott Reeder, a loss prevention manager at UW Credit Union, said. “You can do police reports, but it’s just a dead end. There’s so much of this going on that there’s no resources to even look into recovering these funds.” In the past year, victims lost about $247 million to scams involving crypto ATMs, according to the FBI. The report also showed that the number of complaints the FBI received in 2024 over scams on crypto ATMs doubled. “Five years ago, we hardly ever heard about these, and it’s been a constant incline since, and it’s getting more and more prevalent,” Reeder said. According to authorities, a West Allis native who did not want to reveal her name due to privacy concerns reportedly lost $850 to a scam via a cryptocurrency ATM. Authorities claimed that the woman received a call from a man claiming to be a police officer with a warrant for her arrest. The woman said that the man said she had failed to appear in court, noting that it could be as a result of her aged mother misplacing the summons. “My mom has Alzheimer’s, and when he said the signature — he couldn’t make out — I thought it was my mom’s signature. So, I believed it right then and there,” she said. She added that she tried to investigate the claim, but every time she questioned him, he always dropped a subtle threat about her going to prison. She added that the scammer provided fake court paperwork to back his claim, asking her to clear up the situation by paying the fees she owed. To avoid being arrested, the man said she should wire the money from a nearby crypto ATM. “I knew nothing about Bitcoins,” Amy said. “I put the money in, and when I got back to the car, he proceeded to say he forgot something and wanted more money. And that’s when I snapped, and then he hung up the phone. And that’s when I knew I got scammed.” State Rep. Ryan Spaude, who authored the bill alongside Senator Kelda Roys, said if all the things proposed in the bill are adhered to, the rate of being defrauded via a crypto ATM drops drastically. “Cryptocurrency is here and actively being used — and we need to take steps to stop Wisconsinites from getting screwed,” Roys said. The Wisconsin Legislature is largely controlled by the Republicans, and without their support, the proposal may not become law. The next best thing for the sponsors of the bill is to look for cosponsors and hope to see bipartisan support for regulations for crypto ATMs. Meanwhile, Reeder has issued a warning to Wisconsin residents, urging them to stop and think before sending money to someone they have never met before using a crypto ATM under any circumstances. “If something just doesn’t make sense, you know, slow down. Ask for advice. Ask your financial: ‘Hey, does this make sense?’” he said.

Traders who once hyped meme coins now seem laser-focused on practical tokens with real utility. One name keeps coming up: Remittix . Dubbed “XRP 2.0,” it’s turning heads with a simple mission—making crypto-to-cash transfers easier and faster for real people. And smart money is paying attention. Shiba Inu Struggles To Regain Market Confidence Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have pulled off a modest 5.11% gain in the last 24 hours, but traders aren’t convinced it’s enough. Even with a 21% rise over two weeks, SHIB remains 25% down from last year’s levels. Analysts noted a breakout from a long-term bear trendline and a reclaimed support at $0.0000147, once a major resistance. Yet the hype feels lukewarm. Despite forming a bullish chart structure and retesting key levels , momentum is slow. Rounded retests often suggest strength, but in this case, the excitement seems to be fading. While Shiba Inu price may still aim for $0.00002500 in the near term, market sentiment has shifted. Traders are pouring into newer projects like XRP-inspired Remittix, a cross-border payments token riding a wave of optimism and utility-driven hype. Trump Coin Fades As Traders Look For Real Utility Trump Coin made headlines again after TRON founder Justin Sun pledged a whopping $100 million investment ahead of its launch on the TRON blockchain. Despite the bold move, the hype hasn’t translated into lasting momentum. The token’s price has dipped since Sun’s initial holdings were valued at $19 million earlier this year—now closer to $12.6 million. The collaboration was pitched as a political-crypto crossover, aiming to boost both TRON and Trump Coin visibility. But even with a flashy rollout and Sun calling it “the currency of the MAGA movement,” mainstream traction has remained lukewarm. While Trump Coin leans on political fanfare and high-stakes backers, investors seem to prefer utility over spectacle, pivoting toward tokens built to solve actual problems. Remittix Builds Real Momentum With Simple Utility While Shiba Inu price and Trump Coin continue to find their feet, a new contender is emerging with far more substance. Remittix isn’t just another meme-fueled rocket—it’s a crypto with real utility, quietly building momentum in a $250 trillion payments arena. Unlike tokens chasing hype, Remittix is solving real pain points in cross-border finance, and investors are starting to take notice. This rising DeFi project eliminates the middlemen and lets users convert crypto to fiat instantly, without fees stacking up or delays holding things back. It’s especially powerful for unbanked populations, allowing smooth, wallet-to-wallet transfers globally. And for developers and businesses, its Pay API makes crypto settlement a breeze. Here’s why smart investors are betting on Remittix as XRP 2.0: Serves over 1.4 billion unbanked users worldwide Offers crypto-to-fiat in 30+ local currencies Enables microtransactions with near-zero fees Powers payment apps and platforms with smart contract support The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway is now live.

This article delves into the unique aspects and potential of these rising stars in the crypto world. Unveiling the Potential of XYZVerse As a newcomer in the meme coin arena, XYZVerse is carving out a niche with its unique blend of strong branding, deflationary mechanisms, and community-driven incentives. Its entry into the market is well-timed, capitalizing on the current altcoin season and the growing appeal of meme coins among investors. XYZVerse's deflationary model, highlighted by a significant 17.13% token burn, is designed to maintain a healthy price level by reducing the overall supply. Coupled with liquidity allocations and community incentives, these strategic moves are crucial for its post-launch stability and appeal. The future price predictions for XYZVerse are optimistic, with expectations of substantial short-term gains once it transitions from presale to active trading on major exchanges. The projected price range for the near term is between $0.15 and $0.25, assuming successful exchange listings and sustained community interest. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Exploring the Growth Trajectories of Solana and Cardano Solana continues to attract attention with its high-speed blockchain capabilities, which do not rely on complex sharding or layer-two solutions to scale. This straightforward approach to achieving high transaction capacities makes it a preferred platform for developers and users seeking efficient crypto operations. Meanwhile, Cardano is gaining traction through its innovative two-layer architecture and commitment to sustainable crypto solutions. The use of the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism not only enhances its environmental footprint but also positions it as a leading choice for developers and investors mindful of energy consumption. The Rise of Pi Network Moving beyond traditional cryptocurrencies, Pi Network is establishing itself with a unique user-centric model that allows mobile phone users to mine coins directly from their devices. This approach democratizes access to cryptocurrency mining, potentially increasing adoption and utility in everyday transactions. Comparative Analysis of Market Positions While Solana and Cardano have established their dominance through advanced technological foundations and broad adoption, the prognostications for XYZVerse and Pi Network suggest potential for explosive growth, making them attractive to investors looking for high returns in emerging cryptocurrencies. These forecasts propose a bullish scenario for these newer entrants, riding the wave of current market dynamics and investor sentiment which favor innovative and inclusive crypto solutions. Conclusion The shifting focus of crypto analysts from well-known entities like SOL and ADA to budding platforms such as XYZVerse and Pi Network reflects broader market trends towards diversification and the exploration of niche potentials. These emerging coins offer promising opportunities, potentially leading to significant market disruptions.

However, while it offers stability, its short-term growth has remained modest. For investors chasing aggressive upside and early-stage opportunities, one emerging DeFi project stands out: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.03 in its presale and already 85% sold out, this under-the-radar token is preparing for a major jump to $0.035, with expectations of a 30x price surge as it moves toward its exchange listing. The market is increasingly drawn to high-utility protocols that blend real yield, scalability, and sustainable tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings all of that together—and its strong presale performance is clear proof of growing investor conviction. Over 13,600 holders have already joined in, with $12.6 million raised during Phase 5, and only a small number of tokens remain before the next price hike. XRP (XRP) Price Update XRP has held steady at $3.57 as of July 18, 2025, following a 30.14% weekly surge, stabilizing after hitting a six-month high of $3.72 on July 17. The price resilience stems from strong ETF anticipation, with ProShares’ XRP Futures ETF launch on July 18 fueling bullish sentiment, per CoinDesk. X posts highlight whale accumulation, with over 2.2 billion XRP added by large holders, and a flipped $3.72 resistance eyeing $4.90. The XRP Ledger’s integration of RLUSD and Dubai’s tokenized real estate initiative bolster utility. Analysts forecast $4-$5.50 by Q4 2025, driven by the CLARITY Act’s regulatory support, but an overbought RSI at 70.65 and exchange reserve spikes signal profit-taking risks. A drop below $3.20 could test $2.98 support, reflecting XRP’s balance between breakout potential and short-term volatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Practical Use Cases and Real Passive Income At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a unique dual-lending structure. The platform will offer Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending, enabling users to deposit assets directly into smart contracts and earn consistent returns. For instance, a lender contributing $4,000 worth of MATIC at a projected 65% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could earn an estimated 10% annual yield—translating to $400 per year, all without active management. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model is being developed to serve crypto holders looking to unlock liquidity without selling their assets. Users will be able to post memecoins like DOGE as collateral—despite their volatility—and borrow stablecoins like USDC or USDT under a strict 230% collateralization ratio. The terms are self defining and are not fixed. This approach aims to let users leverage even speculative assets while staying fully invested. But lending and borrowing will only be part of the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to launch a Layer 2-integrated stablecoin, algorithmically pegged to $1 and minted exclusively during the borrowing process. Once the loan is repaid, the stablecoin will be burned—keeping supply in check and mitigating inflation risk. This mint-and-burn mechanism will be fully automated and verifiable on-chain. Presale Acceleration and What’s Coming Next The current presale stage is moving rapidly. With 85% of the tokens already sold and demand surging, the transition to the next pricing phase is right around the corner. At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already delivering solid paper gains for early buyers, and the incoming price increase to $0.035 will further validate its momentum. Once the token lists at $0.06, early investors from phases like Phase 1 (entry at $0.01) or Phase 2 ($0.015) are positioned to see exceptional returns. Take for example an investor who allocated $200,000 during Phase 1, acquiring 20,000,000 MUTM tokens at the lowest available price. At the confirmed listing price of $0.06, that portfolio would already be worth $1.2 million — a clean 6x return even before any exchange trading volume kicks in. But that’s just the beginning. With long-term projections aiming for a price between $1.50 and $3.00 by 2026 — based on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s expanding ecosystem, high-yield utility, and multi-chain integration — the same $200,000 position could eventually grow to as much as $6 million, representing a 30x return. These are the types of exponential gains that have historically defined breakout DeFi tokens, and why seasoned investors are now circling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before the listing window closes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has laid out a comprehensive roadmap that ensures a responsible and secure rollout. After presale completion, the team plans to move through public beta testing, smart contract finalization, and cross-chain deployment. Confidence in the protocol’s integrity is reinforced by a CertiK audit, with an impressive 95 Token Scan score and 77.5 Skynet score—a clear indication that the platform is technically sound and security-focused. In addition, the project has allocated a $50,000 bug bounty fund to safeguard user assets and a $100,000 community giveaway to boost engagement and awareness during these final presale stages. These initiatives reflect a community-first mindset and a commitment to building trust long before the token hits centralized exchanges. Investors who participated in earlier stages are already seeing promising results. One Phase 2 investor, who reallocated capital from AVAX and BTC into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the presale price of $0.015, has already achieved a 2x gain on paper, with the current Phase 5 price now at $0.03. With the exchange listing price set at $0.06, that same portfolio is projected to reach a 4x return at launch. Looking ahead, if long-term projections materialize and MUTM climbs to price targets between $0.60 and $0.90 by 2026, the original Phase 2 investment could deliver up to 40x–60x returns, especially for those holding larger positions. It’s this kind of potential that’s making early entries into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) some of the most talked-about moves in the DeFi space right now. With just days left before the price climbs to $0.035 and limited supply remaining, this is the final window to get in at the lowest possible valuation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just a presale—it’s an all-in-one DeFi ecosystem that blends passive income, smart borrowing, and scalable infrastructure. As XRP (XRP) continues its steady climb, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to explode—and early buyers are locking in their positions while they still can.

Dogecoin (DOGE), which is clinging to its spot as the 8th largest cryptocurrency by value, is up by 6% in the last 24 hours and is now trading around $0.25 , a jump from $0.20 just a week ago. But why is Dogecoin price surging today? Why Is Dogecoin Pumping? One key factor is the recent passage of the Genius Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The new crypto bill offers clearer rules for digital assets, boosting confidence in the industry. Instead of slowing growth, these clearer guidelines may encourage broader adoption of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. Another big reason is the growing hype around meme coins. July alone has seen $17 billion flow into meme tokens, with DOGE leading the pack. Its strong brand recognition and deep liquidity make it the first choice for traders looking to ride the meme coin wave. Tech Upgrades and Whale Activity In addition to this, the recent Dogecoin’s partnership with Solana through Wormhole’s ZK bridge is another major boost. This integration allows DOGE to be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and NFTs, expanding its use far beyond memes and tipping. At the same time, whales are loading up on DOGE. Data from Ali Martinez shows that large investors bought over 1 billion DOGE (worth about $250 million) in just 48 hours. Adding to the excitement, Bit Origin recently announced a $500 million fund to build its Dogecoin treasury. DOGE Price Prediction However, crypto analysts Ali Martinez believe DOGE could soon test resistance at $0.27. If it breaks and holds above this level, targets of $0.30–$0.36 become possible, with some even predicting $0.50+ if momentum continues. As Dogecoin $DOGE overcomes the $0.20 resistance barrier, the next key hurdle to watch is $0.36! pic.twitter.com/bs1oQER1Xt — Ali (@ali_charts) July 18, 2025 For now, Indicators like RSI and MACD remain bullish without showing extreme blow‑off conditions.

Right after the signing, Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, said the company will follow the new rules laid out for non-U.S. stablecoin firms, which means USDT, currently issued from El Salvador, will now be eligible to circulate within American borders. “We’ll be working very, very hard to make sure we comply with the foreign issuer pathway within the GENIUS Act,” Paolo said. “It’s crazy that sometimes people think Tether will not comply.” He added that the company has three years to fully meet all requirements, including anti-money laundering laws and audited reserves, something Tether has never completed but now intends to do. “We are going to be very precise and very dedicated to that,” he said. USDT approval won’t stop local stablecoin launch Even with plans to push USDT through the foreign issuer route, Paolo confirmed Tether still intends to roll out a second product, a U.S.-specific stablecoin designed to meet domestic compliance standards. The idea for the local stablecoin first came up in April, when Paolo hinted that Tether might need an entirely separate coin for American users in order to avoid legal issues once new legislation dropped. Now, both products will launch side-by-side under different paths. The two stablecoins are aimed at different types of users. Paolo explained that USDT will likely be used “mostly” by immigrants working in the U.S. who send remittances to their families abroad. “There are a lot of expats [who] work in the United States, and [their] families are at home,” he said. Meanwhile, the new U.S. coin is expected to serve businesses and institutions that need to stay fully aligned with American laws. Tether’s decision to pursue both avenues, getting USDT registered and building a local coin, comes after months of speculation that the company might be locked out of the U.S. market altogether. At $161 billion, USDT is the largest stablecoin in the world, and its future in America had been uncertain as Congress debated how to regulate foreign-issued crypto assets. But with the GENIUS Act now signed into law, Paolo said Tether is moving ahead on both fronts. Circle says GENIUS Act backs its own strategy Tether’s plans to go all-in on the U.S. market immediately raised questions about how Circle, the second largest stablecoin company, would respond. Circle is based in New York and has always pitched itself as the more transparent, regulation-first alternative to Tether. But when asked about Tether’s next steps, CEO Jeremy Allaire kept his cool. “I think the GENIUS Act enshrines in law Circle’s way of doing business,” Jeremy reportedly told Decrypt. Unlike Tether, Circle regularly releases public audits of its reserves and has long worked with global regulatory frameworks. Jeremy said those efforts have helped Circle form partnerships with major financial institutions, and that the new law will only accelerate those opportunities. “We think that this law obviously continues to accelerate that opportunity for us,” he said. Jeremy made it clear that Circle plans to continue operating exactly as it has, arguing that the GENIUS Act rewards companies that already follow the rules. Tether’s sudden push for compliance, on the other hand, marks a shift in tone from a company that has historically operated without full transparency. Despite being the top two stablecoin issuers globally, Paolo and Jeremy rarely end up in the same place. But Friday’s bill signing at the White House was an exception. Both men stood behind Trump during the signing ceremony, and later walked out to brief reporters on what came next. While they were only 20 feet apart, they didn’t speak, didn’t shake hands, and didn’t even exchange a glance. That quiet standoff said everything. Both Tether and Circle are now racing to control the stablecoin space inside the U.S.—one from El Salvador, the other from New York—and both believe they’re better suited to handle the pressure of America’s new crypto law. There won’t be room for both at the top. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

He described such statements as “ridiculous,” insisting that the token’s price remains “suppressed for years by manipulation.” His message pushes back against the popular view, encouraging people to rethink claims that XRP has reached its peak. Instead, he argues that the current price action reflects an ongoing price discovery process, not a true all-time high. A Contrarian Perspective on XRP Del Crxpto emphasised that XRP’s current trading level, though impressive, does not reflect its true potential. He argued that if not for prolonged price suppression , XRP “would be far past these levels.” In his view, recent chart formations illustrate price discovery, not a peak, and he believes XRP is still experiencing a dip, despite its recent aggressive upward momentum. You will not hear me participating in any… ‘ $XRP Has Hit A New ATH’ nonsense.’ It’s ridiculous, $XRP would be far past these levels if its price was not suppressed for years by manipulation. I’m gonna tell it how it is, this is price discovery & $XRP is actually on a dip.… — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) July 18, 2025 This position challenges mainstream commentary that celebrates recent gains. XRP is currently trading at $3.45 after declining from $3.65. This price represents its highest level since it reached its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, and the positive regulatory momentum in the U.S. contributed to this rapid growth. Even with that surge, Del Crxpto insists that gains have more room to grow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Can XRP Overcome Price Suppression? XRP has undeniably gained momentum in 2025. It rose from below $0.55 in late 2024 to a remarkable multi-year peak of $3.39 in January, closing the month above $3 for the first time in its history. However, U.S. tariff plans caused a dip in the entire market in February, pushing XRP below $3. Crypto analysts predict continued gains, with expectations of a new all-time high in no time. However, Del Crxpto is convinced that these prices are a dip, and suppression and manipulation over the years have held XRP down. While Del Crxpto rejected the hype surrounding a new all-time high, his tone remained optimistic. He positioned XRP’s current price as a launchpad rather than a peak. The token’s sustained strength above $3, combined with institutional inflows and regulatory developments, aligns with his view of price discovery unfolding in real time. If the asset can overcome manipulation and suppression, it could potentially target double and even triple-digit levels, finally showing the potential that analysts like Del Crxpto have seen for years.

Arctic Pablo’s 66% APY Stuns Analysts, Best New Meme Coins to Join Now",https://timestabloid.com/floki-price-prediction-will-it-reach-0-00049-arctic-pablos-66/,"What happens when a meme coin turns into a movement? That’s the question surrounding FLOKI right now as traders and analysts try to figure out whether it has legs or if the cat’s just chasing its tail. With Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, like Arctic Pablo Coin roaring through presale stages, FLOKI faces stiff competition from the new school of tokens. As of today, FLOKI is priced at $0.000132, with a daily trading volume of over $573 million and a market capitalization exceeding $1.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite a 1.32% daily dip, it’s logged a solid 32.34% gain in the last 7 days. While FLOKI has seen solid recent performance, investors are asking: Can it maintain this trajectory, or will newer players, such as Arctic Pablo, steal the spotlight? FLOKI’s Past Rallies: Wild Rides or Sustainable Momentum? To understand where FLOKI could go next, it’s worth unpacking its history. The token first gained momentum thanks to viral campaigns, meme marketing, and a dedicated community —the three factors that made Dogecoin and Shiba Inu household names. In early 2023, FLOKI stunned the market with a massive rally, surging over 300% in a single month. That move wasn’t random. It followed ecosystem upgrades, strategic partnerships, and buzz around FlokiFi, its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. Analysts on platforms like CoinGecko and CoinDesk noted that FLOKI gained traction due to its real-world use cases and a meme-friendly brand. But here’s the rub: meme coins are notorious for being feast or famine. Just as a penguin might waddle its way into a snowstorm, FLOKI’s surges often come with chilling drops. Some whales started offloading during quiet periods, creating turbulence for everyday traders. Still, it hasn’t vanished. In fact, it’s just warming up again. Recent Whale Activity: A Blessing or a Red Flag? Lately, crypto whales have been circling FLOKI like cats stalking prey. According to on-chain trackers like WhaleStats, large holders recently added millions of tokens during the latest surge. Such activity can be both thrilling and terrifying. On one hand, it signals confidence; big money doesn’t move unless there’s a scent of profit. On the flip side, when whales dump, retail holders get crushed under the weight. FLOKI whales have historically been trigger-happy. During its 2023 rally, a few sell-offs wiped 15–20% off the board in under 48 hours. So while whale interest might light a fire under FLOKI, it can also send things tumbling faster than a peanut off a shelf. For now, whale behavior suggests optimism, but crypto analysts caution against treating that as gospel. Unlike stablecoins or Bitcoin, meme coins react fast and furiously to sentiment swings. Social Buzz vs. Real Tech: FLOKI’s Identity Crisis? FLOKI walks a fine line between being a meme magnet and a tech innovator. While its community-driven campaigns remain strong, especially on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord, some critics argue that the project lacks depth. The FlokiFi Locker and Floki University initiatives aim to build tangible value. But will that be enough to silence doubters who still see it as a coin-riding dog-themed hype? Platforms like Messari have noted that FLOKI’s developers are actively building out the ecosystem. Yet in this space, even strong fundamentals can fall flat if narrative momentum slips. That’s where Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, like Arctic Pablo Coin, enter the conversation. With unique features like a staking APY of 66% and transparent tokenomics, Arctic Pablo is reshaping what meme coins can offer, and FLOKI may need to evolve faster or risk being left behind in the snow. Future or Flop? Why FLOKI’s Next Move Might Not Be the Smartest Play So, what’s next for FLOKI? On-chain sentiment is leaning bullish, particularly as whales remain steady and the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery. Forecasts for 2025 paint a mixed picture. CoinCodex charts project FLOKI trading anywhere from $0.000137 to $0.000489 by year-end, with a potential high of +268% on bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Insider offers a more grounded outlook, estimating a realistic floor between $0.00025 and $0.00053, with extreme scenarios pushing up to $0.004. However, analysis from CCN using wave count methods warns that the token may fluctuate between $0.000045 and $0.000360, suggesting high volatility and potential corrections. Adding more context, Changelly predicts a steadier monthly average of around $0.000181 in mid‑2025. So the short‑term reaction: if Bitcoin stays strong and whales hold, FLOKI could climb toward the $0.00025–$0.00049 zone. However, if sentiment shifts or whales cash out, a dip toward $0.00009–$0.00014 remains a possibility. For those on the hunt for the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, FLOKI may feel comfortable, but not necessarily the smartest or smoothest ride. That’s why newer projects, such as Arctic Pablo Coin, with its structured presale, 66% APY, and transparent tokenomics, are increasingly taking center stage. Ice-Cold Gains: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Turns Heads While FLOKI fights to maintain its momentum, Arctic Pablo Coin is freezing out the competition with one seriously attractive feature: a 66% APY during its meme coin presale phase. That means investors can stake their tokens before launch and start stacking rewards. Unlike traditional staking, where rewards only kick in post-launch, Arctic Pablo flips the model on its head. With this approach, early supporters feel like penguins sliding into a gold mine. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Now in its 32nd stage (Icebound Estates), Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.0005, with over $3 million raised to date. What’s fueling the buzz? A whopping 1500% ROI from this stage to the listing price of $0.008, and a jaw-dropping 19900% upside if the analysts’ price target of $0.1 holds true. Even Stage 1 investors are now staring down returns of 3,233.33%. Drop in $1,250 today, and those 2.5 million APC tokens could potentially turn into $20,000 by launch. With this kind of growth potential, it’s no wonder Arctic Pablo is quickly climbing the ranks of the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now . As crypto narratives evolve and investor priorities shift toward innovation and sustainability, Arctic Pablo isn’t just another meme; it’s becoming the next frontier of smart investing. Final Verdict: What’s the Smarter Move in Today’s Meme Coin Market? In the wild world of meme coins, FLOKI is still a heavy hitter, but it’s no longer the only cat in the alley. With its recent gains and whale activity, FLOKI holds strong short-term potential. But the question remains whether it can sustain momentum in a landscape where attention is the currency and innovation is king. On the other paw, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining traction as one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, combining humor with powerful tokenomics and real investor rewards. For those who missed FLOKI’s earlier boom, Arctic Pablo might be the fresh, frost-bitten opportunity that redefines meme coin investing. Both coins offer different value plays, but only one is offering a 66% APY in presale and up to 19900% projected gains. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What is the current FLOKI price? FLOKI is currently trading at $0.000132 with over $573 million in 24-hour volume. Is FLOKI a good investment at the moment? FLOKI exhibits short-term momentum, but long-term risks persist due to its high volatility. What caused FLOKI’s recent price increase? A 32.34% weekly surge was driven by whale activity, social buzz, and market-wide bullish sentiment. Are whales buying or selling FLOKI? Recent data shows whales are accumulating FLOKI, signaling potential confidence. How does FLOKI compare to Arctic Pablo Coin? FLOKI offers hype-based gains, while Arctic Pablo combines utility and higher ROI potential. Article Summary FLOKI has been heating up with a 32.34% gain this week, but questions remain about its long-term strength. Whales are back, social buzz is high, yet risks persist. In contrast, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining attention with a 66% APY during presale and a massive ROI potential of 19900%. While FLOKI remains a strong contender in the meme coin scene, newer tokens like Arctic Pablo are redefining the game with smarter tokenomics and real investor incentives. For those searching for the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, Arctic Pablo might just be the next big thing in crypto. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

At one point yesterday, it hit a peak of $3.65. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton and crypto veterans like Michael Arrington have praised the newly gained strength of the token crediting the bullish rally to reduced SEC pressure and growing adoption. Read on for more details. XRP’s Massive Bullish Rally At the beginning of this month, the price of XRP was at $2.17. In the first eight days of the month, the price majorly stayed within the range of $2.35 and $2.14. On July 9, with a single day growth of 3.94%, the XRP market closed above the range. Since then, it has jumped by approximately 48.54% to $3.43. Importantly, as mentioned above, at one point yesterday, the market even touched a peak of $3.65. In the last three months, XRP has reported a rise of 64.8%, and, in the last one month, a surge of 59.1%. This indicates strong bullish momentum. The Beginning of the XRP Era Attorney John Deaton stated that the rally was long overdue, highlighting that XRP was surpassed for nearly four years due to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple . The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020 , alleging XRP was an unregistered security. In July 2023, a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP were not securities, a partial win for Ripple, but institutional sales were. In March 2025, Ripple settled the lawsuit, agreeing to a $50 million fine. Both parties have dropped their appeals, with the case effectively winding down as of July 2025, awaiting final procedural approvals. Originally, it was the political shift in the US that helped Ripple to reach a settlement with the SEC . Shortly after the victory of Donald Trump against Kamala Harris in the US presidential election , the then SEC chair, Gary Gensler, who was known for his tough stance against Ripple, stepped down from his position . Since the inauguration of Trump, he has implemented several pro-crypto policies, including the appointment of pro-crypto official Paul S Atkins as the successor of Gensler. In the month of the US election (November, 2024) alone, XRP recorded an impressive monthly return of 281.7%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s XRP Breaks 2018 Record After Trump’s Historic Crypto Law , Legal Clarity Boosted XRP Until recently, there was no clarity on how Ripple would reach a settlement with the SEC. The SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit saw final confusion regarding the $125 million penalty and the permanent injunction against Ripple. A judge initially upheld these, rejecting a joint SEC-Ripple request to reduce the fine to $50 million and dissolve the injunction. However, in March 2025, Ripple announced a settlement, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine . Both parties then dropped their appeals, effectively resolving the prolonged legal battle by July 2025. In Q1, the XRP market recorded a quarterly return of +0.45%. In Q2, it increased to 7.12%. So far this quarter, it has surged by 54.6%. How XRP Investors React? John Deaton stated that the rally was a relief for long-term holders. A crypto analyst, identified as CrediBULL, claimed that an investment of $10,000 he made in 2019 in XRP has swelled to $196,000 due to the latest bull run. On the flip side, many, including Dave Portney, the founder of Barstool Sports, expressed their regret for selling XRP too early. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The main purpose of the ""landmark"" crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Crypto Bills Trigger Market Pullback Rather than rallying on the news, crypto prices dipped. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 2%, while top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) pulled back after recent gains. Schiff believes this proves the legislation is more about hype than substance. “The industry is using these bills to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices,” he said, warning that the bills are fueling short-term gains at the cost of long-term stability. Schiff: Stablecoins Won’t Save the Dollar The GENIUS Act supports dollar-pegged stablecoins, which is a move praised by industry leaders like Rum’s Chris Pavlovski and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , who claim it will strengthen the dollar’s global position. But Schiff strongly disagrees. “Stablecoins are only as strong as the U.S. dollar itself,” he argued, calling the idea “nonsense” and warning that this supposed stability will fade as the dollar continues to weaken. He remains firm in his belief that gold, not Bitcoin or stablecoins, is the real store of value. Trump’s Crypto Push: Bold or Risky? Alongside the new bills, Trump is also pushing for an executive order to allow 401(k) retirement investments in Bitcoin and crypto. Schiff sees this as a dangerous move that could speed up the dollar’s decline. “Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner – Bitcoin will crash too,” he said. How Will This Move Shape Up? Schiff’s warnings raise serious questions about where the U.S. is headed with its new pro-crypto stance. While many see these bills as a step forward, critics like Schiff argue they may backfire, risking more harm to the economy than help. As crypto regulation takes shape, the debate is far from over: are these bills laying the groundwork for a digital future or opening the door to financial trouble .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Over the past 30 days, the asset is up by about 13%, at the time of this writing. Meanwhile, the comparable 30-day window posted 4.73% gains for the most popular US stock index. In other words, Bitcoin gained what the S&P 500 Index averages in a typical year in under one week while the stock market stalled. Moreover, for the month’s trades, BTC delivered returns on investment at nearly 3x the pace of stocks. With both Bitcoin and US stocks trading at historic record highs, the 30D BTC Pearson correlation to the S&P 500 climbed from slightly inverse at the start of July to a 72% positive correlation by 7/11. But the cryptocurrency is climbing higher and faster. That’s because its total market capitalization is much lower than the S&P 500’s, so it’s easier for bullish markets to move the needle. It’s also because Bitcoin is still relatively new and not as far along the adoption curve for its total addressable market as US stock favorites like Apple and Google. Here are four signs of a trillion-dollar sea change in Bitcoin valuations. 1. Bitcoin Price Historical All-Time High After hitting its ATH, Bitcoin’s market cap floated at $2.34 trillion. One trillion dollars ago, the last time the BTC economy moved at a $1.34 trillion market cap, it was May 28th, 2024. That was a trillion dollars added by saver-investors and users in just 13-and-a-half months. As the currency gathers pace to the peak of this multi-year bull run, it could pull that trick again in even less time. Wall Street is stoking this rally, diverting billions of dollars a week away from stocks and to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Leveraged derivatives and futures traders are also pouring on the rocket fuel. On the current come up, BTC’s market cap just eclipsed Google’s and the global market valuation for all above-ground silver. That’s a major milestone for Bitcoin, a powerful and useful engine, and a payments and savings platform like silver markets. But unlike silver, BTC can move around the world nearly as fast as lightning. Unlike Google, it is secured by the blockchain. 2. US Govt Now Accepts BTC For Home Loans The US government now officially accepts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as financial collateral for home loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “Previously,” reported USA Today, “mortgage applicants had to convert any Bitcoin holdings into U.S. dollars if they wanted their crypto to count.” But now BTC holders can keep their crypto and list it as an asset on federal mortgage applications. Earlier, on 7/6, Benzinga and Yahoo Finance highlighted a question about Bitcoin’s use case that someone asked on Reddit: “If only 5% of the population owns BTC, what is the use case? So, if 19 million bitcoin are presently ‘minted’ and only 4% of the population are holders… What good is a ‘currency’ that only 5% of the population owns???” The article noted the stakes for Bitcoin’s market valuation, calling the answer to the Redditor’s question “a fundamental tension that’s been brewing in the crypto space for years.” At the end of June, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency has now taken one of the most compelling use cases for Bitcoin in its history and made it real. 3. Corporations, Whales, and VCs Bullish Murano Global, the techie real estate lending platform with a hot new stock on the Nasdaq, just signed an equity funding agreement in July to buy $500 million worth of Bitcoin. So the company is selling its own stock to buy as much as half a billion USD worth of BTC with the proceeds. Under this arrangement, investors give Murano a dollar in return for a dollar’s worth of their company’s stock. Murano turns around and uses that dollar to buy a dollar’s worth of Bitcoin. This supercharges the investor’s stake in the company with the promise of corporate finances hedged by Bitcoin from the risks of inflation and wasteful corporate spending. And that’s just an isolated example – you also have your Strategies, Metaplanets, and all other companies that are running this playbook to perfection during this cycle. 80,000 BTC From 2011 Make A Monster Splash The growing market of long-term corporate Bitcoin buyer-holders may have a willing seller in the mysterious “Sleeping Beauty” BTC addresses that have remained locked since 2011. In the first half of July, these 80,000 BTC moved for the first time in nearly a decade and a half. They may already be sold, or the owner may be getting them ready to scoop long-awaited profits in anticipation of a rally peak that this monster Bitcoin whale just can’t pass up at the moment. It’s not just Internet whales and corporate CFOs who are still outrageously bullish for the class-leading cryptocurrency. VCs are back to funding new blockchain startups in earnest. Bitcoin is back to raising venture capital at levels unseen since the last bull market peak in 2022.

Solana and Sui led the crypto market rally of the past few years. Another cryptocurrency could outperform the other and lead the upcoming bull run. As Bitcoin leads a fresh market rally, one crypto analyst has identified strong similarities between today’s market conditions and those that preceded Bitcoin’s historic 23x price surge in 2017. Maybe not 23x, but something sensational coming for Bitcoin In his latest podcast , the analyst noted that while he doesn’t expect a direct repeat for Bitcoin itself, he believes the stage is set for a “sensational” bull run and for a new altcoin to deliver life-changing gains. The crypto analyst’s observations align with the dominant sentiment across the crypto community. Although most crypto investors do not expect Bitcoin to rally another 23x in 2025, they believe the flagship cryptocurrency is gearing up for something significant under current market conditions.

Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale recently crossed 80% sold out at $0.03. This is as cheap as the token will ever be, with later phases guaranteeing a hike in price. Presale has garnered more than $12.7 million and attracted more than 13700 unique holders. As the crypto market starts heating up again this july, Mutuum Finance is showing early signs of a breakout, and some in the market are starting to draw bold comparisons. Mutuum’s Phase 5 Presale Approaches Sellout as Demand Surges Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in Phase 5 of its presale. The project stands out from other projects in that it has real use cases and does not rely on hype. Investor interest is growing with the project having already passed more than $12.7 million and having over 13700 token holders. Mutuum Finance to Introduce USD‑Collateralized Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully-collateralized USD-stabilized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was also audited by CertiK, the most secure blockchain security firm. Besides providing reassurance to the investors regarding the code base integrity and transparency, the audit conducted indicates that the project is confident to establish a secure DeFi protocol. For the promise to be made a reality, the project has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The four categories of vulnerabilities are specifically categorized as critical, major, minor and low. Building a Stronger Future Together: Community Growth and Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is awarding a $100,000 giveaway , as a token of appreciation to early supporters and in remembrance of presale frenzy. Ten winners will receive a $10,000 award in MUTM tokens as a token of appreciation for being among the early adopters of the project. As more and more community are growing at an accelerating rate, the early adopters are rewarded not only with the potential future benefits but also with instant rewards. With its unique leaderboard system the top 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Smart Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets like meme coins. Over $12.7 million raised and more than 13,700 unique holders prove that investors aren’t just watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM), they’re backing it heavily. Phase 5 is racing toward a complete sellout at just $0.03, offering early adopters a rare chance at 100% gains before launch. As crypto gears up for its next bull run, comparisons to Ripple’s legendary 2017 breakout aren’t far-fetched, they’re starting to feel inevitable. Real utility, audited security, and a fast-growing community are pushing MUTM to the top of investor watchlists. This is your moment, don’t sit on the sidelines. Secure your MUTM tokens before the price moves up.

The price structure remains firmly bullish, with buyers still in control, but growing signs suggest the potential for a short-term correction. Momentum has slowed, and the market is entering a consolidation phase as traders reassess risk. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Signals Aggressive Ethereum Accumulation: Institutional Demand Accelerates According to new data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miner selling has surged sharply. On July 15, the same day Bitcoin reached its latest peak, daily BTC inflows to exchanges jumped from 19,000 BTC to 81,000 BTC — a clear sign that major holders, including miners and whales, took advantage of high prices to offload assets. Notably, miner outflows spiked to 16,000 BTC, the highest daily level since April, and nearly all of it was sent directly to exchanges. These inflows suggest a shift in sentiment among large players, raising the probability of increased supply pressure in the short term. While the broader trend remains intact, and fundamentals like long-term holder activity are still strong, the spike in exchange deposits is a classic signal to watch. Whether this leads to a deeper pullback or simply a healthy reset will likely be decided in the coming days. Miners Take Profits As Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin miners have resumed aggressive selling behavior as BTC reached a new all-time high of ~$123,000. On July 15, miner outflows spiked to 16,000 BTC — the highest single-day total since April 7. This level of activity represents what analysts at CryptoQuant describe as an “extreme outflow,” indicating that miners seized the opportunity to take profits at elevated prices. The miners sent nearly all the BTC they withdrew from their wallets directly to centralized exchanges. This reinforces the interpretation that the move was not simply a strategic reallocation but an active decision to sell into market strength. Such behavior often signals growing caution among miners, who may expect either near-term price exhaustion or are simply capitalizing on favorable conditions after months of holding. Miner behavior has long been viewed as a leading indicator of potential market shifts. When outflows rise — particularly to exchanges — it tends to precede increased volatility or temporary tops. While the broader Bitcoin trend remains bullish and investor demand stays strong, this wave of miner selling injects a dose of uncertainty.

BTC Consolidates Below ATH After Explosive Rally The daily chart of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows price consolidating in a tight range between $115,730 and $123,230 after reaching a new all-time high. This zone is now acting as a short-term channel, with buyers defending the $115K area while facing resistance around $123K. The latest daily candle shows low volatility, suggesting indecision among traders as Bitcoin pauses after its recent breakout. Volume has tapered off following a massive spike that coincided with the all-time high breakout, a potential signal of exhaustion or reduced participation from large buyers. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $108,796 remains well below the current price, confirming the bullish momentum is still intact, but any breakdown below the $115K level could bring the 50-day SMA into focus as a potential support.

If BTC can reclaim $123,230 with volume, the next leg up could follow. Until then, this consolidation may serve as a healthy cooldown before the next major move.

Ethereum is trading at $3,557 and XRP at $3.43, both showing minimal movement in the day. In a major move, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, creating the first clear U.S. framework for stablecoin regulation. This is expected to unlock a wave of institutional capital and accelerate crypto adoption. Ethereum Hits 6-Month High with 50% Rally Ethereum is making headlines and has jumped to a six-month high of $3,677 on July 18, marking a 50% rally since it dipped near $2,400 earlier this month. One big reason for its recent surge is the passage of the GENIUS Act, which finally brings some clear rules for stablecoins and is crucial for Ethereum’s ecosystem. Rising institutional interest and record inflows into spot ETH ETFs and staking activity are also fueling the price run. ETH ETFs Overtake Bitcoin in Daily Inflows For the first time ever, Ethereum ETFs outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. On Thursday, US spot Ether ETFs pulled in $602 million, beating the $522.6 million that went into Bitcoin funds. The surge follows a record-setting $726 million inflow into ETH ETFs the day before. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in $550 million and outperforming its own Bitcoin product. James Seyffart noted the rise in demand for Ethereum ETFs and shared that they’ve pulled in over $5.5 billion since launch, with $3.3 billion of that coming in just since mid-April.

The company’s President, Brad Smith, commented, “I think it’s likely we will sign. We need to read the documents.” Meta Platforms, however, already dismissed the EU’s guidelines. Open AI and Mistral signed the EU AI code The European Commission released the General-Purpose AI (GPAI) Code of Practice on July 10. It claimed the code would offer legal clarity to signatories and encourage the industry to comply with the AI Act , which was first instituted in 2024. Signatories of the code are required to provide summaries of their AI training data and adopt measures to comply with EU copyright rules. Unlike its counterpart, Meta, Microsoft’s Smith stated that they want to be supportive of the process, adding that they particularly appreciate the AI Office’s direct engagement with the industry. He added that the firm would be open to signing the code of practice. Companies like OpenAI and Mistral have already signed the code. In contrast, Meta Platforms insisted it would not sign the code, calling it an excessive regulation that would hinder business growth. According to the company’s global affairs chief, Joel Kaplan, Europe is taking the wrong approach to AI, arguing that the code creates legal ambiguities for model developers and imposes requirements that extend well beyond the AI Act . On the other hand, ASML Holding and Airbus wrote to the EU asking for the code to be put on hold for two years. Microsoft is investing heavily in artificial intelligence Microsoft is planning to spend about $80 billion, about £68.6 billion, on data centers to train AI models. However, the company is set to reduce its workforce significantly. The firm will lay off 15,000 workers this year, over 4% of its workforce, most of them from its Xbox video game division. Several game projects have already stalled due to the job cuts, including the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild. Some have linked the layoffs to Microsoft’s AI investments and the productivity gains achieved through internal AI use. However, the company told reporters that AI-related efficiency is “not a predominant factor” in the recent job cuts. Nevertheless, the company asserted that its use of AI tools internally enhanced productivity across sales, customer support, and software development. Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff claimed the firm realized over $500 million in call center savings and improved employee and customer satisfaction. The firm also said it will utilize AI for interactions with smaller customers. Moreover, the company is using AI to get new codes for products. About 35% of the code for new products was produced by AI, significantly accelerating product releases. Last year, the firm appointed British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman to lead its AI operations. It also poured in a sizable investment in OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, though recent reports point to increasing tension between the two.

But the rally stirred up some confusion. Popular media figure Dave Portnoy sold his XRP, thinking that Circle, the company behind stablecoin USDC, was competing directly with Ripple. That assumption turned out to be wrong, and costly, as XRP surged another 38% in just two weeks after his sale. However, this came just after Ripple had officially applied for a national banking license with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), showing it’s serious about stepping into traditional finance, just like Circle is trying to do. Pro-XRP Lawyer Clears the Air It sounds like the guy who gave advice to @stoolpresidente might be a moron. Below, Dave said this guy told him that @circle would be competing with XRP and that’s why Dave should sell his XRP.

He emphasized that Ripple, the company behind XRP, is entering the stablecoin market with its new asset RLUSD, not XRP itself. Deaton reiterated that while Ripple and Circle operate on the same fintech infrastructure layer, XRP is a digital asset designed for liquidity and cross-border payments, not a stablecoin rival. Analyst Take a Deep Insight XRP controversy and rumors… Ripple vs Circle? WATCH for details… * XRP price action * Dave Portnoy * John Deaton * Genius Act * Institutional Update pic.twitter.com/u64AHXK4A7 — Zach Humphries (@Z_Humphries) July 19, 2025 Ripple has introduced RLUSD , its own stablecoin, aimed at carving out a share in the booming tokenized financial assets space. Ripple has already partnered with institutions like Anondo Finance, linked to JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Chase, positioning RLUSD for rapid traction. According to Crypto analyst Zach Humphries , confusing Ripple’s business ventures with XRP’s use case is a common mistake that can lead to misinformed trading decisions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction 2025- Analyst Sees $5+ As XRP Dominance Breaks Out , Humphries highlighted XRP’s breakout above the $2.32 resistance, a critical level aligned with the 200-day moving average . A “momentum up” buy signal was triggered by the XTLGO trading software around $2.40, and since then, XRP has gained over 43%. The token recently touched $3.65 before pulling back to $3.45, a healthy correction after its steep run. Conviction Pays Off Humphries shared that despite years of criticism, staying convicted to top-10 assets like XRP has paid off. He recalled XRP’s prolonged stagnation below $2.25 and how he saw the $2 level as the new accumulation zone. While volume typically dips during weekends, he’s eyeing Monday for a potential continuation of the rally as institutional volume returns. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a newly updated settlement portal , the sports streaming firm FuboTV will send cash payments to people who had an account on or before May 29th of this year while residing in the US or its territories. The class action lawsuit leading to the settlement was initially filed in August of 2023. It alleged FuboTV “collected, stored, used, distributed, or retained Personally Identifiable Information and/or other personal information or data, including through targeted advertising and the use of Trap and Trace Devices, the Meta Pixel, Google Analytics, Cookies, and related technology.” According to the class action lawsuit, FuboTV’s actions were in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act – a law originally created to prevent the wrongful disclosure of videotape rental or sale records, but now also applies to streaming and digital video platforms as well. According to the settlement portal, the amount that each class member will receive is currently unknown but will depend on the number of valid claims that will be submitted. Claims must be submitted by September 12th, while the final approval hearing will be held on October 6th. Individuals who wish to exclude themselves from the settlement must submit a ‘Request for Exclusion’ by email or in writing by August 28th.

Meanwhile, CEO Rick Wurster just confirmed Schwab will soon launch spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum, hoping to help clients keep all their money, stocks, bonds, and crypto in one trusted place. Schwab Launches Bitcoin & Ethereum Trading In a recent CNBC interview, Wurster noted that Schwab’s clients already hold significant exposure to crypto through exchange-traded products (ETPs), owning more than 20% of the entire ETP market. However, crypto still makes up a small slice of Schwab’s total assets, roughly $25 billion out of $10.8 trillion. Schwab thinks giving them simple spot BTC and ETH trading “sometime soon” will unlock new growth. JUST IN: $10 trillion Charles Schwab CEO says they will launch Bitcoin trading ""sometime soon"" and will be competing with Coinbase pic.twitter.com/VnpHfcFed0 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 18, 2025 The timing is perfect as rules for crypto are becoming clearer. The U.S. House recently passed the GENIUS Act , setting new rules for stablecoins. Along with relaxed restrictions from banking regulators, this has made it easier for companies like Schwab to move into crypto. Competing With Coinbase Schwab’s entry into spot crypto trading is aimed at challenging existing players like Coinbase. After listing Bitcoin and Ether ETFs and allowing related funds and options, adding direct coins is the next step. Wurster stated that many Schwab clients currently store 98% of their wealth with the brokerage but keep a small portion of crypto with other exchanges. They would rather view everything, stocks, ETFs, options, and now coins, in one secure dashboard. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase CLO Exposes 5 U.S. States for Defying CLARITY’s Crypto Staking Rules , Institutions Add More Crypto The push toward crypto isn’t limited to Schwab.

With analysts predicting potential 5000% returns, momentum is quickly shifting toward a project that offers real-world utility in a market flooded with hype. As FOMO builds across the PayFi space, smart investors are asking the same question: Is this the next big altcoin explosion? XRP Breaks Out but Can It Keep Up With Summer Stars XRP price is enjoying a hot streak this summer, jumping 32% in just seven days to hit $3.47 at the time of writing. Daily trading volume has exploded to $22.93 billion, up nearly 70%, as bullish sentiment sweeps in. Analyst Hov , known for his macro calls, pointed to XRP’s recent move as a clean Wave 4 retracement after hitting his $1.80 dip target back in January. Still, with the market now chasing faster horses, XRP price may struggle to keep pace with the new contenders flashing 5000% upside potential. Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery as Bulls Return Cardano (ADA) is starting to make noise again after a long stretch of market uncertainty. At $0.8698 with a 15.54% daily gain and $5.54 billion in trading volume, ADA is waking up to bullish sentiment. Investors are hoping this momentum signals a proper reversal, not another fake-out. Charles Hoskinson recently added fuel to the fire, telling the Angry Crypto Show that crypto is heading toward a $10 trillion future and Cardano will be a major player. Still, even with renewed optimism, some traders are eyeing faster-moving projects. Solana Retests Resistance While Volume Spikes Past $9 Billion Solana price continues to push forward, with bulls eyeing the $200 mark after SOL surged to $177, up 6.2% in 24 hours. Trading volume has jumped to $9.33 billion and price action hints at a breakout as the token tests resistance yet again. Some traders compare Solana’s recent formation to Bitcoin’s historic $108K-to-$123K run, sparking calls for a similar move. Still, despite SOL’s strength, new tokens with clearer real-world utility and bigger upside potential are drawing attention. If Solana price doesn’t break above soon, it risks being overshadowed. A sharp breakout could still come, but with early-stage crypto projects heating up, traders are asking a tough question: can SOL really compete with what’s next? Remittix Could Outpace XRP’s Rise Through Mass Adoption While XRP, ADA, and SOL fight for the spotlight, Remittix (RTX) is quietly becoming the one to watch.

The surging ETC futures OI amid positive funding rates suggests bullish sentiment. The Ethereum Classic network has struggled over the years to compete with other smart contract-based L1 chains. Ethereum Classic (ETC) has jumped over 33% in the last week, breaking out of a long-term trading range. This powerful rally is being fueled by more than just general market hype; it’s backed by a fundamental shift to a deflationary token model and soaring interest from traders. The altcoin was trading at about $24.56 on Saturday, with a 24-hour volume of around $2 billion. ETC Surge Backed by Rising Open Interest The ETC bullish sentiment follows a gradual increase in its Open Interest (OI) from around $116 million on April 10, 2025, to about $311 million on July 19. The rising ETC OI is an indication of renewed interest from speculative crypto traders. According to market data analysis from Coinglass, the ETC funding rate has turned positive in the last two weeks after a prolonged negative funding rate.

According to a recent company announcement, Google described the firm as the largest botnet targeting internet-connected televisions. In its blog post, Google mentioned that its researchers, in a collaborative effort with cybersecurity firm HUMAN Security and Trend Micro, uncovered the sophisticated network that has infected over 10 million Android devices worldwide. These devices include cheap IoT gadgets like streaming boxes, tablets, and projectors. The post mentioned that these devices are often sold under obscure brands and are hijacked by pre-installing malicious apps to perpetrate ad fraud and proxy services, like generating fake traffic that deceives advertising platforms. Google drags operators of BadBox 2.0 to court The lawsuit was filed in a United States federal court, invoking the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The company accused 25 Chinese individuals, whose identities remain unknown, of carrying out a global scheme that damages the reputation and finances of Google. By altering user interactions, the botnet increases ad impressions and clicks, stealing revenue from real advertisers and publishers. This is not Google’s first experience with this sort of issue, as the company had already disrupted the first BadBox operation. The BadBox 2.0 represents an evolved threat with new capabilities and evasion tactics, including the use of presidential proxies to mask fraudulent activities. BadBox 2.0 takes advantage of the vulnerabilities in uncertified Android devices, which lack the sophisticated security checks of Google’s ecosystem. Once a device is infected, it joins a host of other devices on the network, exhibiting human behaviors like viewing ads, clicking links, and even routing traffic for illegal purposes such as bypassing geoblocks or launching distributed denial-of-service attacks. A report from BleepingComputer revealed that the botnet operators have amassed wealth by selling access to this proxy network in underground markets, turning everyday consumer electronics into tools for cybercrime. The persistence of BadBox shows deeper challenges According to reports, the scale is big, with over 10 million devices from more than 200 countries, as detailed by Google in its announcement, making it one of the most pervasive botnets in recent history. This is quite bigger than the previous Glupteba threat that was targeted by Google in a 2021 lawsuit for infecting Windows machines through blockchain-protected malware. Industry analysts mentioned that BadBox 2.0’s focus on IoT shows a growing blind spot in cybersecurity, where low-cost items from unregulated manufacturers are vulnerable to exploits. Google, in its legal action, seeks to dismantle the botnet and also to recover damages and impose penalties that would deter similar operations. By naming specific application sideloading and firmware manipulation, the suit shows the need for stronger supply chain security in the Android ecosystem. According to reports, the company has already initiated technical measures to address this, such as removing 24 malicious apps from the Google Play Store and silencing command-and-control servers, which dropped the botnet activity by half earlier this year. Google’s move is also in line with broader industry trends. Microsoft ’s attempt to take down botnets like Trickbot shows a move towards proactive litigation as a weapon against cyber syndicates. For consumers, the revelation shows the implications of purchasing unverified gadgets, which could unknowingly contribute to fraud or expose personal data. Google’s announcement also shows its ongoing monitoring through its Threat Analysis Group. However, analysts at HUMAN Security have warned that threats like BadBox 2.0 require collaborative defenses across the tech sector. Also, the lawsuit could be a precedent to hold foreign actors accountable under United States law, influencing how companies combat global crimes.

Nexchain Shows Strength With Aidrop Campaign While WeWake Prepares for Crypto Presale In the ever-changing world of blockchain, new ideas often outperform legacy systems. While Cardano has established itself as a key player, the rise of crypto presale projects like Nexchain shows where innovation is heading. Nexchain is fast becoming the best crypto presale to buy right now, backed by transparent milestones and advanced AI technology. Its AI-powered infrastructure is already proving effective across different industries, offering real-time scalability and daily value to token holders. Investors are watching Nexchain closely as it continues to rise on the crypto presale list, far from just another trend. With the airdrop launched on July 14th and testnet launching August 8th, Nexchain is showing what fast development looks like. It’s not just about early access—this presale cryptocurrency delivers live updates and real features. As the crypto coins on the presale market mature, Nexchain is carving out a space built on delivery, not delays. Nexchain Blockchain Presale Powers Smarter Web3 Tools Nexchain is one of the most exciting token presales of 2025. It introduces a blockchain ecosystem that runs entirely on AI. From smart contract automation to network security, every part of the Nexchain system is built for intelligent performance. Its use cases go far beyond trading—they extend into industries like finance, logistics, healthcare, and more. The NEX token is currently available at $0.086 in Stage 22 of the crypto presale, with a planned listing price of $0.30. That brings a projected ROI of 349%, based on today’s valuation. Over $6.6 million has already been raised, showing strong demand from early adopters and developers alike. What makes Nexchain stand out is its technology. It uses a hybrid consensus that combines Proof-of-Stake with real-time AI logic, allowing the blockchain to make decisions, optimize resources, and maintain security without manual adjustments. This makes it adaptable and scalable for real-world tasks. The smart contracts on Nexchain learn from user behavior and adjust how they function. That level of responsiveness is rare among crypto presale tokens, making it a key reason why Nexchain is leading the list of top crypto presales in the current cycle. With its community-focused roadmap and constant delivery, Nexchain is a clear example of what a new crypto token presale should look like. It’s not just a platform—it’s a practical network that already works. Nexchain Airdrop Goes Live with Huge Prizes and Quests The Nexchain Airdrop is officially live with $5 million in NEX up for grabs. Every week, participants complete quests and referrals to earn leaderboard positions. Over 12,000 users are competing for weekly prizes of $10,000 and a grand prize of $300,000. To join, connect your wallet and complete tasks. This pre-sale cryptocurrency event is your chance to win while supporting a growing ecosystem. For those looking to buy presale crypto with confidence, Nexchain delivers both innovation and traction. WeWake Prepares for Upcoming Presale WeWake Finance has opened a whitelist round in advance of its next token presale. The platform is designed to improve usability in Web3 by supporting gasless Layer 2 transactions and smart wallets. This architecture allows users to enjoy seamless access to DeFi, NFTs, and commerce apps. At the same time, backend infrastructure can be monetized by partners. Developers benefit from a Paymaster API, low swap spreads, and SDKs for Web2 and Telegram. WeWake stands apart from other pre-sale cryptocurrency projects by combining technical flexibility with an easy onboarding experience. Cardano Shows Stability, But Momentum Slows Cardano’s ADA token has posted some short-term gains, but broader signals remain mixed. While ADA has shown weekly growth, it’s still down by nearly 5% over the past month and trades around 20% below its yearly high of $1 seen in March. Repeated attempts by bulls to regain momentum have met resistance. One of the main challenges is selling pressure from large holders, often referred to as whales. These entities tend to sell during minor price surges, stalling further growth. Currently, ADA faces key resistance at $0.95. If it fails to break that level, recovery may stay limited despite market-wide optimism. Compared to agile crypto ICO presale platforms like Nexchain, Cardano’s development pace appears slower. Nexchain Brings Speed and Transparency to Presale Crypto Nexchain isn’t just trending—it’s building. With over $6.6 million raised, a live presale at $0.086, and a major launch of the testnet on August 8th, it continues to prove its commitment to progress. As a standout among crypto coins on presale, Nexchain balances innovation with delivery. It ranks high on every serious crypto presale list, not because of speculation, but because of working tech and transparent goals. For those searching for the top AI crypto presale to buy right now, Nexchain sets a new benchmark in AI-led blockchain performance. This post Cardano or Nexchain?

Solana (SOL) Approaches Critical Breakout Amid Institutional Demand Solana (SOL) demonstrates significant technical strength. Its price action recently completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This decisive breakout above the $159 neckline signals potential bullish momentum. Buyers have firmly defended this level during retests, establishing it as solid support. Consequently, the path seems clearer for SOL to challenge the $185 resistance zone. Adding fuel to this potential move, institutional interest in Solana staking is accelerating. Liquid Collective has launched LsSOL, a multi-exchange liquid staking token built specifically for Solana. The increasing institutional need for safe, expandable staking solutions is directly met by this breakthrough. Additionally, talk about possible U.S. approval of Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is growing. An occasion like this may greatly increase institutional inflows into the Solana ecosystem, so bolstering its upward trend. Crypto charts show that SOL’s 20-day EMA is now sloping higher. Positive momentum is confirmed when its RSI gets closer to overbought zone. SOL may go toward $180–$185 if it continues to trade over $168. If $185 is successfully breached, $210—a level not seen since early 2022, may be the next objective. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds Meanwhile, investor attention pivots sharply towards a fresh opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dominates current crypto conversations. Its presale advances rapidly through Phase 5. This phase offers tokens at $0.03 each. Early participants witness substantial gains already. The starting price was just $0.01 in the first phase. That represents a significant 200% increase. Over $12,600,000 has been raised since the presale began. More than 620 million MUTM tokens have found buyers. Total MUTM holders now exceed 13,600 individuals. Phase 5 is currently over 80% filled. This indicates the chance to acquire tokens at $0.03 is dwindling fast. Immediately after, Phase 6 commences. It brings a 16.7% price hike to $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Buying at the current $0.03 price guarantees a precise 100% return on investment at launch. This straightforward doubling stems directly from the project’s transparent tokenomics. Looking beyond the launch, projections suggest substantial further upside. Some market observers foresee MUTM potentially reaching $0.50 within its first year post-listing. This represents considerable growth potential from the presale entry point. Project Foundations and Security Assurances Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes robust security and trust. Its development team recently finalized a comprehensive audit with CertiK. This leading blockchain security firm awarded Mutuum a 95.00 security score. To further bolster ecosystem safety, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program. Partnering again with CertiK, $50,000 USDT is allocated for rewards. Additionally, the team introduced a real-time dashboard. This includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 MUTM token holders. Maintaining a position within this elite group earns holders bonus token rewards. Moreover, engagement within the Mutuum Finance community receives strong encouragement. A major $100,000 MUTM giveaway is currently active. Ten fortunate winners will each secure $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance Stands Apart While Solana captures headlines with its technical potential and institutional flows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) captures investor imagination. Its structured presale offers clear, near-term value based on defined tokenomics. The project backs this with verified security and proactive community incentives. This combination positions Mutuum Finance as a notable new crypto coin attracting serious crypto investment consideration. Investors seeking projects with concrete foundations and growth pathways find MUTM increasingly compelling. The evolving crypto market consistently favors innovation backed by substance.

While this week’s sentiment is totally because of the “GENIUS and CLARITY” bills that are passed and the confidence spurred by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson , who mentioned the U.S. to lead the next wave of crypto giants, including ADA itself. This outlook, paired with improving DeFi metrics and on-chain activity, has reinforced the narrative that price of ADA could also be primed for another leg up, provided it maintains its current levels. Hoskinson’s Remarks Trigger Whale Action In a recent clip from the Angry Crypto Show posted on X has captured Hoskinson sharing his bullish stance on the sector’s trajectory. He predicted that the broader crypto market is on a path toward a $10 trillion valuation and emphasized that U.S.-based projects like Cardano would form the core of this growth. His statements appear to have resonated with large investors, as the day after this clip was posted, some metrics spiked. Whale activity on the Cardano $ADA network has surged this week. Over 137 transactions of over $1 million each were recorded in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/R5DJnIDp2I — Ali (@ali_charts) July 19, 2025 Aligning with this, analyst Ali Martinez has confirmed these spikes. He mentioned on X that ADA recorded more than 137 whale-sized transactions (each over $1 million) in just 24 hours. This activity, which he tracked by Santiment, indicates rising confidence among big players and may suggest strategic accumulation. ADA Price Breaks Out, Bulls Regain Control On the technical front, the Cardano price has broken out of its long-term descending channel this July, and the bull run is ongoing. The asset most recently spiked to $0.90, breaking past May’s high. Although it has slightly retraced, it is currently sustaining levels near $0.827, with a market capitalization of around $29.48 billion. If the ADA price can hold above $0.82 during the current consolidation phase, analysts suggest there’s potential for a 40% rally to the $1.18 level. However, a failure to maintain this support amid increasing bearish pressure could result in a 20% pullback toward $0.68. DeFi Strength and On-Chain Metrics Support Rally Supporting this bullish setup, DeFiLlama data shows that Cardano crypto’s TVL has climbed to $374.54 million, and it seems to be nearing the highs last seen in mid-May. Moreover, its 24-hour DEX volume has been on the rise throughout July, and the weekly stablecoin market cap has also rebounded slightly to $32.14 billion from a low of $31.09 billion. These trends clearly indicate growing liquidity and a gradual return of investor activity to the ADA ecosystem. Technical Indicators Point to Building Momentum Several indicators confirm that ADA may be entering a high-momentum phase. A golden cross between the 20-day and 50-day EMA signals trend reversal. The MACD line and signal line also reflect a golden cross with a rising histogram at 0.022. Meanwhile, the AO displays a widening histogram at 0.1582, and the CMF is at 0.10, which is above the neutral zone. These are hinting bullish momentum, and increasing capital inflows into ADA crypto. Despite these bullish signals, some caution is warranted in the short term. The RSI has entered overbought territory, indicating temporary exhaustion in the rally. This suggests a brief consolidation or slight correction could allow RSI to cool down near the 60–65 range, which is a level that could reignite upward movement in ADA price.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 12:04:05

The image, reportedly captured from CoinListings, showed XRP valued at $118,263 as of July 17 at 1:10 AM. In the tweet, Blondie wrote, “I just looked at ⁦@coinlistings⁩ and it showed $XRP at $118k!” The post rapidly gained traction, leading to various interpretations and responses from members of the crypto community. While the image clearly showed XRP ranked #3 with a trading volume of over $52 billion, the displayed price of $118,263 stood in stark contrast to its actual market value on any mainstream exchange.

Nonetheless, several users took the moment to express their views on the long-term potential of XRP and its position relative to Bitcoin. Speculations on XRP’s True Value and Role in Global Finance User Rachel reacted to the post by stating, “Because it’s the real Bitcoin. Somebody is fucking with the switch.” Her comment implies that XRP may represent a more authentic or capable digital asset than Bitcoin , suggesting the possibility of intentional interference with its market representation. Another X user responded with a longer-term outlook, stating , “I wouldn’t be surprised if one day XRP catches BTC in price in the next 5-9 years, XRP has more value than BTC in my opinion. XRP is being used by banks and financial institutions from all over the country. I don’t really hear BTC being used by all these big banks.” This viewpoint highlights a recurring argument within the XRP community regarding the asset’s potential utility as a bridge currency in institutional payment networks, in contrast to Bitcoin’s more limited adoption within regulated financial infrastructure.

CoinListings is a crypto price tracking platform that aggregates market data and rankings, similar to services like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko. Anomalies of this kind are not entirely unheard of in the crypto data space, where occasional bugs or incorrect feed integrations have caused temporary misrepresentations of token prices. Whether the display of $118,263 was a bug, a backend miscalculation, or other technical interference remains unknown. There is also no indication that the figure corresponded to any real market trade or reflected legitimate exchange pricing at the moment in question. XRP Community Continues to Express Optimism Despite the likelihood that the displayed price was a mistake, the post drew renewed commentary on XRP’s long-term potential . The notion that XRP could be on the same level or overtake Bitcoin in value someday remains a persistent belief among some supporters. These individuals often reference XRP’s integration with cross-border payment systems and institutional pilots as reasons for their outlook. While the broader market did not reflect any similar valuation at the time of the screenshot, the viral nature of the image and the reactions it generated show that speculation surrounding XRP’s future remains active. As of now, there has been no further clarification from CoinListings or any confirmation that the $118,263 price was anything other than a temporary glitch.

Recent artificial intelligence analysis reveals that certain tokens may be poised for significant growth. Among these, SOL, ADA, and XRP stand out. This article delves into the potential breakout of these cryptocurrencies, presenting a compelling story of market dynamics and future opportunities. This content is powered by Outset PR , a blockchain PR agency that leverages analytical precision and narrative expertise. Its goal is to help crypto projects secure media coverage, boost discoverability, and transform visibility into tangible growth. Solana on the Rise: Can It Cross New Milestones? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is showing strong price movement in recent days, hovering between $149 and $170. It's getting close to a resistance point at $179, with another challenge ahead at $199. Right now, SOL appears to be on a growth path, bouncing back from a rough six months with a price jump of over 12% in the last week and 17% over the past month. If this upward trend continues, SOL might soon test these resistance levels. Breaking past $179 could propel it to nearly $200, marking a rise of approximately 18% from its current range. Enthusiasm among investors is driving this momentum, keeping an optimistic view of SOL's potential. Cardano (ADA) Shows Strong Momentum Amidst Bullish Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) has been on a strong upward trend recently, with its price moving between $0.61 and $0.82. This represents impressive weekly and monthly gains, around 31% and 30%, respectively. Analysts point to ADA's high RSI at over 75, indicating it's in the overbought zone, which suggests buying pressure. With its nearest resistance not far away at $0.90, a surge past this level could lift ADA toward the second resistance of over a dollar. This would mean a potential rise of just over 30% from current levels. However, investors are keeping an eye on the support levels to make sure the push upward is steady. XRP Hovers Near $3 Amid Potential Breakout Source: tradingview XRP is trading in a range between $2.40 and $3.12, showing strong upward movement recently. In the last month, there's been a noticeable price increase of over 45%. The RSI indicates an overbought status, suggesting strong buying interest. The current price is slightly above the 100-day moving average, pointing to a positive trend. The closest resistance level stands at $3.41, while support is at $1.96. If XRP breaks the resistance, it could see a boost towards $4.14, marking a potential gain of over 40% from its lower range. The ongoing momentum hints at a promising future for XRP if it breaches these barriers.

Although Ripple announced on June 27 that it would drop its cross-appeal, the SEC has yet to officially withdraw its own appeal, keeping the case open and investors waiting. SEC Meeting Sparks Speculation, but No Action Many in the crypto community expected the SEC to vote on dropping its appeal during the recent closed-door meeting. They were curious as to why there was no press release from the SEC after its July 17 closed-door meeting, especially with “litigation” on the agenda. There was no announcement made, and on Friday, XRP dropped from $3.66 to under $3.50. Legal expert Mark Fagel explained that this was just a routine meeting. The SEC holds these closed meetings every Thursday, and the agendas don’t reveal what’s actually being discussed. So, no one outside the SEC knows if Ripple was even on the table. That’s not the cause for delay. The staff needs to draft its action memo. It needs to be reviewed by the divisions and calendared for a commissioner vote. But please, keep lecturing a former senior SEC official about SEC procedures. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 18, 2025 “There was no basis to believe that dismissing the Ripple appeal was on yesterday’s calendar. It can take 1-2 months to calendar an SEC enforcement vote, and anyone claiming to know exactly when this will happen is lying,” he said. Why Has the SEC Not Dropped Its Appeal Yet? Some XRP holders pointed out that the SEC doesn’t hold closed meetings every Thursday as claimed. They argue that past deals were made faster, but Fagel pushed back firmly, saying the delay isn’t about disagreement, it’s about procedure. In his words, “That’s not the cause for delay, but keep lecturing a former senior SEC official about SEC procedures.” Fagel Says It’s Just Procedure Even though Ripple has announced dropping its appeal, the SEC must go through its standard internal process. That includes drafting an action memo, reviewing it across multiple divisions, and scheduling a vote with the commissioners. That timeline can easily take 1–2 months, he says. Marc Fagel had previously clarified that neither side has officially dropped their appeal yet. The SEC is just following the process, and there is nothing special for Ripple. Once that’s done, both parties will file the dismissal paperwork, and it will happen soon. The next SEC closed meeting is on July 24, exactly four weeks since Judge Torres’ ruling. Experts widely expect the SEC to drop its appeal in the Ripple case. Once the appeal is officially dismissed, it could fast-track approval of XRP-spot ETFs.

While heavyweight assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum attract substantial institutional investment, smaller tokens spark fantasies of 100x returns that can transform personal fortunes in a matter of days. As of July 2025, investors are zeroing in on a short list: Little Pepe , Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Floki, that could turn a simple $100 stake into $1,000 in just fifteen weeks. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The OG Meme Coin Expansion Shiba Inus are some of the proudest owners of the term “classic meme coin.”SHIB’s price peaked at $0.000086 to $0.000090 in October 2021, an increase of surging over 3000% since its emergence as a joke in relation to Dogecoin back in 2020. Its price now sits at a modest $0.000012 in Q3 of 2025, still quite a distance from its all time highs, but with some positive recovery potential, which might get the attention of speculators looking to invest. Don’t look away from the Shiba team. The dog logo is slowly becoming the center of a larger ecosystem thanks to Shibarium Layer 2, ShibaSwap DEX, and rumors of AI-plus-metaverse integrations. Shiba Inus don’t have a lot of hype right now, but they make up for it with steady adoption and fans who spend a lot of money on them. For every altcoin bull run, SHIB tends to snap back first. Its large user base and high liquidity enable it to generate significant gains very quickly. If it goes back up to $0.00003 to $0.00005, a $100 bet today could easily grow ten times or more. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Ethereum Layer-2 Frog Frenzy. Little Pepe is not just another ribbit meme. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, the token combines meme fun with technology that can handle serious workloads. Now in Stage 5 of its presale, the project has already pulled in over $6.3 million and sold more than 5 billion coins. At roughly $0.0014, the presale price remains low enough for early buyers to dream of substantial returns. LILPEPE has garnered significant attention on Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram since its recent listing on CoinMarketCap. A huge giveaway worth $777,00 made a lot of noise, and thousands of people rushed into the project’s Telegram group. Talk of NFT drops, big agreements, and planned DEX listings only made things more exciting. Little Pepe wants to be the best joke coin by 2025. It has lightning-fast speed, very low petrol fees, token burns, and rock-solid economics. A small bet of $100 today could grow into a $1,000 bet or even much more if the hype and plan continue to come true. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin Juggernaut Emerging as the first truly viral meme coin on Solana, Bonk has quickly established itself as a serious contender. Bonk recently surpassed 1 million holders, and its developers are preparing a 1 trillion token burn, injecting deflationary pressure into an otherwise inflationary token model. This dynamic has energized traders and speculators alike. Bonk rides the Solana ecosystem wave, and that connection pays off. Its launchpad, LetsBonk.fun, has outpaced older sites like Pump. fun in users and volume, sending buyback-and-burn cash straight back to BONK holders. With real utility, a deflationary model, and a committed crew all lined up, the token might once again tap its November 2024 peak near $0.00005825. A repeat of that high would hand early buyers a clean tenfold lift from where it sits now. Floki (FLOKI): The Community-Driven Underdog Floki has popped up as a community-led dark horse, growing through word of mouth and shared memes. Priced just shy of $0.00010, it still welcomes small investors and meme fans who want a cheap entry. Bulky buy orders have triggered classic chart patterns, pushing MACD and BBP into bullish territory, which hints at good momentum over the next weeks and months. What gives Floki its flavor is a clutch of cross-sector deals, including a partnership with DWF Labs and projects in robotics and token-linked AI. Landing a spot on Webull Pay further broadens exposure for everyday traders. True, it lacks SHIB’s vast army and BONK’s clever on-chain gimmicks, but steady headlines, combined with a loyal fan base, continue to push its story forward. History shows that in crypto bull runs, tokens backed by engaged communities often take the steepest ride. Why These Meme Coins Might 10× in 15 Weeks Early Bird Advantage: All four coins are still either in presale or listed at a discount, and that classic early-entry edge is often what turns small stacks into big wins during meme cycles. Hybrid Dynamics: Each project wraps viral culture in real-world utility through smart contracts, DEX hooks, regular burns, and community rewards, broadening its appeal beyond simple jokes. Renewed Market Appetite: BTC flirting with fresh highs tends to open institutional wallets again, and that trickle then spills over into meme coins seeking high-beta action. Champions of Their Ecosystems: From ETH to Solana, these tokens ride larger chains and their growing user bases, so gains in these areas tend to lift each banner higher as well. Final Word: Strategy Over Hype Meme coins can indeed become toxic. Millions disappear when traders pile in on FOMO, only to watch the floor drop. Yet, entering with discipline, setting clear stops, and backing a strong story lets a $100 spread across these four trades turn into $ 1,000 or more. Little Pepe still races ahead, thanks to its crafty tokenomics and marketing, which make the price jump in sudden bursts. Shiba Inu offers the safety of a tested, expansive ecosystem for holders who seek both stability and upside, albeit at a slower pace of gains. Bonk leads Solana’s next meme wave by combining DeFi burns with genuine platform usage, demonstrating that memes can evolve from jokes to lasting tools. Floki sits on the sidelines, with much less noise than the big names, yet its devoted fans and real tech work make it hard to ignore. Volatility is part of every crypto journey; treat it seriously, and the extremes promise real pain and real gain. Put in $100 now, stand the storms, and in just fifteen weeks, it could sprout a much bigger number.

With $20 again on the table and ETF talk gaining momentum, XRP is making waves yet again – another contender, Remittix (RTX) , may be building the future of international crypto payments behind the scenes. Why XRP’s Long-Term Outlook Still Has Bulls Talking XRP is at $3.44 with a market cap of $204.29 billion. While the price has dropped 1.98% in the last 24 hours, overall sentiment remains bullish. The majority of traders see XRP’s recent drop and $18.11 billion as signs of consolidation prior to a bigger breakout. The argument for an XRP ETF continues to generate interest, especially now that regulators are starting to ease up on crypto-linked financial instruments. XRP’s strongest suit – low fees and speedy settlement – makes it one of the most promising altcoins for cross-border use. But hold on, here’s the catch: in a universe where real-world utility dictates all, XRP may soon find itself facing some stiff competition. XRP vs. RTX: Is There a New King of Cross-Border Crypto? While XRP’s price prediction relies largely on macro trends and ETF listing, a growing number of crypto analysts is tracking Remittix (RTX) – a breaking-out DeFi token that’s already solving problems XRP sought to resolve. Remittix is targeting the $19 trillion global payments market, with direct bank-to-crypto payments across over 30 countries. It’s making subtle inroads in the “crypto with real utility” storyline, and for those seeking the next 100x crypto, RTX is definitely one to take serious notice of. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction With over $16 million in capital and in excess of 549 million tokens sold, Remittix is already one of the quickest-growing crypto presales of 2025. Its scheduled wallet launch in Q3 will facilitate real-time FX conversions, with ease of global payments for freelancers, remote workers, and small enterprises. Remittix is at $0.0811 today, and there’s still a 50% bonus for first-time buyers. That’s a solid entry point for a project with continued infrastructure development in progress and real-world momentum. Here’s why RTX is gaining serious traction: Global Reach: Direct-to-bank crypto transfers in 30+ countries $250K Giveaway: Enter here for early supporters Built for Scale: Raised over $16M, only $2M left to soft cap Wallet Launch Q3: Real-time FX and fiat integrations 50% Bonus Live: Buy RTX token today prior to price rush One of the top crypto presales live, Remittix offers real crypto staking potential, low gas fees, and is already being predicted to be one of the top cryptos under $1 with much long-term potential. Final Thoughts: Two Titans, One Future In 2025, XRP remains a foundation for the majority of institutional portfolios, especially in light of ETF mania in full effect. But interested investors who are seeking out early-stage crypto trades and growth altcoins must watch RTX very closely. Remittix can be the next big 2025 altcoin – not because of hype, but because it’s actually being worked on. And with a good token model, true utility, and a stratospheric presale, RTX can easily become the genuine king of cross-border crypto.

The explosive rally coincided with the NYSE listing of ProShares Ultra XRP ETF on July 18, marking the first XRP-linked exchange-traded fund to trade on a major U.S. exchange. XRP is currently trading at $3.25, and sits just 15% below its all-time high of $3.84 set in January 2018. Notably, perpetual futures open interest hit a record $8.8 billion amid the rally, representing nearly 2.9 billion XRP in leveraged contracts. Similarly, California Governor Gavin Newsom launched the California Breakthrough Project at Ripple’s headquarters, adding governmental credibility to XRP’s utility narrative. Technical analysis indicates that XRP has completed a massive seven-year symmetrical triangle pattern, with Fibonacci targets suggesting a near-term range of $4.70-$6.48. Historical cycle analysis suggests potential moves toward the $22-23 levels. Channel Breakout Targets $4.70-$6.48 Extension XRP’s daily chart shows a transformation from a bearish, declining channel to a bullish, ascending structure, with the recent breakout representing a significant paradigm shift. The cryptocurrency has achieved a 126% rise since its April lows, breaking decisively above previous resistance levels around $2.50-$3.00. Source: TradingView Fibonacci extension analysis provides clear upside targets following the channel breakout. Immediate resistance sits at the 1.618 level around $3.64, which XRP is currently testing. The 2.618 extension at $4.70 represents the next major target, followed by the 3.618 level at $5.77 and the 4.236 extension, which reaches $6.48. Volume confirmation during the breakout also indicates massive institutional interest driving the move. Moreover, RSI readings above 80 signal overbought conditions, but parabolic moves often sustain elevated momentum for extended periods. Seven-Year Triangle Completion Points to $22 Target According to a technical analyst on X , XRP’s weekly chart positions the current breakout within a massive symmetrical triangle pattern that has been developing since the 2018 peak. Currently at $3.15, XRP appears to be completing this seven-year consolidation structure that encompasses multiple market cycles. If #XRP hits the same fib as the 2017 cycle, we will hit ~$23 by August 1st. This is not hype, this is just data. I’m not saying this will happen, I’m just saying it happened once before. Same setup! Same result? $XRP pic.twitter.com/UEjqpkdlLs — Crypto Ninja (@Crypto_Ninja007) July 17, 2025 The triangle’s convergence near the current timeframe makes this breakout particularly significant. Historical Fibonacci analysis suggests XRP could reach $22.70 by August 1st, based on similar mathematical relationships that characterized the 2017-2018 cycle. The previous major wave established Fibonacci ratios that could drive the current cycle toward the $22-23 range. Pattern completion, following seven years of consolidation, creates powerful technical momentum. The current support range of $2.50-$3.00 represents the triangle breakout zone that should hold for continued bullish advancement toward higher Fibonacci projections.

Curious minds will discover predictions that reveal which cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki, are poised for significant growth. Dive into the analysis to uncover which digital assets may lead the next wave of the crypto boom. The analysis is provided by Outset PR , a data-driven communications agency specializing in strategic crypto insights. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Edges Up Amid Optimistic Market Sentiment Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is oscillating between 0.00001187 and 0.00001429 dollars. It shows a 21.74% climb in the past month. SHIB is aiming to break the nearest hurdle at 0.00001529 dollars. If successful, it could push towards the second resistance at 0.00001771 dollars, marking a leap of about 25% from its current stance. The coin's trajectory stays hopeful as it hovers above a supportive line at 0.00001045 dollars. Despite a rough six months, reflecting a 40.31% dip, the short-term indicators hint at a potential rebound, suggesting that SHIB could attract interest from traders seeking upward movement. Dogecoin Price Holds Steady; Eyes 30% Jump to Resistance Source: tradingview Dogecoin is experiencing a stable phase, hovering between 17 and 22 cents. Its recent momentum indicates a 19% rise in the past week and a 26% increase over the past month. The coin's upcoming challenge is the resistance level at 24 cents. If buyers gain traction, Dogecoin might jump to this level, marking nearly a 30% increase from current prices. The Relative Strength Index at around 66 suggests room for more buying power. For those optimistic about Dogecoin, the 29-cent mark is the next target. However, any downturn could see a retreat to the support at 14 cents, so buyers need to watch these key levels. FLOKI Coin Shows Strong Weekly Rise Amidst Constant Volatility Source: tradingview FLOKI is on the rise, with a recent price jump seen over the past week. The coin is currently priced between an eighth and a tenth of a cent. It is pushing towards the nearest resistance at about twelve-thousandths of a cent. Its weekly increase is over forty percent, hinting at solid upward momentum, though it's still below the ten-day moving average. Should it break through resistance, FLOKI could see potential growth to nearly fourteen-thousandths of a cent, which is almost thirty-two percent above its range. While the month has been bullish with nearly seventy percent growth, price fluctuations remain a hallmark for this crypto.

According to recent reports, a couple excitedly traveled for hours for a chance to take a mountaintop cable car called the Kuak Skyride. The couple had seen the video online, with tourists smiling and a TV host narrating the experience. However, things were not the same when the couple arrived at the location. They met a small town and confused locals who were unaware of what they were talking about. Turns out the video was generated using AI, and the couple had believed that it was real. “Why do they do this to people?” the elderly Malaysian woman asked as she discovered that the dream location was fabricated using the generative artificial engine created by Google, Veo3 . AI is making people believe fake videos According to the hotel worker they asked, the elderly Malaysian woman had stumbled on the video on TikTok , alerting her husband to the location. Both of them had been impressed by the views and were going to try it out. The video was so convincing that the TV host rode in the tram and interviewed happy tourists. However, what they failed to catch was the Veo3 logo at the bottom right corner of the video, showing that the video was made with the tool. While the confusion remains laughable, it shows another harmful part of artificial intelligence . This incident did not require criminals or scammers trying to goad them into paying to visit a dream destination or sending them a false link to register to visit the destination, but it still shows how easy it is for malicious actors to carry out illicit activities with such videos. AI has made it hard to spot the difference between real events and fake ones. It has made even the slightest activity like planning a vacation something that people need to be watchful about. This Malaysian couple’s experience might look like an isolated incident, but it also shows that we need to start questioning our trust in things that we see, hear, or experience in a world where AI can manufacture anything with ease and terrifying precision. The artificial intelligence blackhole continues to grow The numbers also back the perspective of the collective descent into digital deception. For instance, deepfake attacks have risen from about 0.1% of all fraud attempts three years ago to about 6.5% today, a big 2,137% jump that represents one in every 15 fraud cases, as indicated by identity services company Signicat in its February 2025 report. The statistics are not just numbers, as they have real victims behind them. A typical example is Steve Beauchamp, an 82-year-old retiree who withdrew the entire $690,000 in his retirement fund after watching deepfake videos of Elon Musk promoting an investment scheme. “I mean, the picture of him—it was him,” Beauchamp told The New York Times. After the unfortunate incident, his life savings vanished into the digital void. The scope of AI-powered deception has also touched every aspect of the human experience. British engineering company Arup lost more than $25 million after one of its employees was tricked during a video conference call featuring a deepfake of the company’s CFO and other staff members. A school principal also received death threats after an AI-manipulated video showed him making racist and antisemitic remarks. It was later discovered that his athletics director made the video to discredit him. Tourism was already deep in manufactured reality before AI perfected the art of deception. Social media has changed travel into selfie tourism as most visitors go to holiday-worthy destinations just to take the best shots for Instagram. UNESCO also declared a three-alarm fire on this, warning that travelers are now visiting iconic landmarks to “primarily take and share photos of themselves, often with iconic landmarks in the background.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Google|OpenAI,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-19 12:20:27

Brokerage desks are reporting a noticeable uptick in client inquiries about spot crypto ETFs, with trading floors seeing fresh waves of interest across Bitcoin and Ethereum-related products. Institutional desks are fielding more allocation requests as asset managers begin to shift weight into digital asset exposure. The tone has changed, this isn’t just a speculative punt anymore. It’s a strategic play. With regulators signaling a willingness to establish clearer frameworks around digital asset investing, a new sense of legitimacy is settling into the space. For many retail investors watching from the sidelines, it’s the massive, steady buys from asset giants that are doing the talking. The writing is on the wall. BlackRock’s aggressive positioning in the crypto space isn’t just a headline grabber, it’s a market signal. Loud and clear.

These strategic developments have revived interest in ALGO, positioning it as a potential breakout contender among altcoins. In this article, we examine Algorand’s recent momentum and explore which other digital assets could follow its lead in this shifting market environment. Algorand (ALGO) Shows Signs of Recovery Amidst Fluctuating Market Source: tradingview Algorand's price currently sits between twenty and thirty cents, having seen a notable growth over the past month. This rise marks nearly seventy-two percent in gains, suggesting some recovery despite a six-month decline of about twenty-six percent. If ALGO can push above its closest resistance at thirty-three cents, there might be potential to target forty-three cents, reflecting a possible further growth of roughly forty-three percent. The coin is navigating through mixed signals, with momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD showing a tepid outlook. However, recent weekly price increases of over thirty-four percent have sparked cautious optimism for potential upward movement in the near term. Conclusion With strong weekly gains and a growing DeFi footprint, Algorand is showing signs of revival at a crucial moment. The Wormhole integration and staking initiatives could be the catalysts that push ALGO toward a larger breakout. As market sentiment warms, investors are keeping a close eye on ALGO and other rising altcoins that might capitalize on the current wave of momentum.

With over 9 million transactions recorded recently, TRON is signaling renewed investor interest and strong on-chain engagement. This uptick in momentum points to a potentially bullish phase for the entire TRON ecosystem. In this article, we analyze TRX's current technical setup and spotlight several TRON-based tokens that could ride the wave of growing adoption. TRON (TRX) Prices Hover as Market Eyes Breakout Source: tradingview TRON (TRX) is trading between 29 to 31 cents, showing a stable pattern. Currently, it edges close to the resistance at 32 cents. If it breaks this line, it could stretch up to 34 cents. This would be around a 10% lift from its current price. Support is firm at 28 cents, providing some safety for traders. Over the past month, TRON has risen nearly 20%, and in the last half-year, it has gained almost 43%. With market indicators like the RSI and stochastic near average levels, TRON could be poised for further growth or consolidation in the short term. Conclusion TRON’s expanding ecosystem and soaring transaction volume paint a bullish picture for the network’s near-term trajectory. The momentum behind the $TRUMP token highlights how niche assets can fuel broader interest in TRON-based projects. As adoption grows and TRX holds steady, traders and investors alike should keep a close watch on this resurgent ecosystem—and the tokens within it that may be next in line for breakout growth.

Is a Breakout Imminent?,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/will-xrp-price-hit-a-new-all-time-high-this-weekend-is-a-breakout-imminent/,"The post Will XRP Price Hit a New All-Time High This Weekend? Is a Breakout Imminent? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price is currently trading just below its recent peak, consolidating after an aggressive upward move. This phase of compression near a major resistance zone often precedes decisive breakouts or rejections. The recent surge has narrowed the gap between current price levels and the previous ATH, creating heightened interest among traders. Market structure shows that XRP has reclaimed key historical levels, suggesting buyer dominance. Despite some volatility, the price remains within a higher range, fueling speculation of another leg upward if momentum sustains. With volume holding steady and price discovery nearing, this weekend could be a defining moment for XRP. Whale Activity and On-Chain Signals Support Momentum A deeper look into XRP’s on-chain metrics reveals strong underlying support for continued bullish price action. According to data from leading analytics firms, both active wallet addresses and futures open interest have surged over the past week. This uptick reflects increased participation from traders and long-term holders alike. Whale wallets—those holding over 10 million XRP—have shown accumulation patterns despite recent sell-offs from dormant addresses. Notably, XRP’s network growth has been consistent, suggesting that this rally is not purely speculative. On-chain transaction volume has also increased in tandem with price, often a confirmation signal of sustainable upside. These metrics together point to a scenario where XRP may withstand short-term volatility and continue its upward trajectory. If whale accumulation persists and retail momentum stays intact, this weekend could mark the beginning of a longer-term bullish phase. Traders should watch exchange inflows and liquidity shifts for clues about whether the next move is upward or corrective. XRP Approaches Crucial Resistance: Will It Break Through? XRP is currently positioned just beneath its recent all-time high, following a strong multi-week bullish trend. After breaching long-standing historical resistances, the price has begun to consolidate in a narrow zone, reflecting a potential setup for a major move. The market is showing signs of controlled bullish momentum, characterized by higher lows and a tight coiling pattern—often a precursor to breakout behavior. As seen in the above chart, the XRP price has risen above the pivotal resistance, which can be assumed to be the final barrier ahead of forming a new ATH. Meanwhile, the weekly RSI has reached the upper threshold and is yet to enter the overbought zone. This suggests the bulls are self-assured of a consistent upswing, paving the way for a new ATH above $4 anytime from now. Ripple Price Prediction 2025: Will XRP Price Reach $10? XRP’s performance in 2025 will largely depend on external macro factors such as regulatory clarity, network utility, and institutional adoption. If Ripple secures a favorable resolution to its legal issues with the SEC, it could unlock a new wave of enterprise adoption, especially for cross-border transactions via RippleNet. Technically, if XRP maintains its current structure and avoids deep corrections, the path toward $5–$7 could be realistic before the end of 2025.",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 12:43:44

It’s still only about $25 billion out of the $10.8 trillion that our clients have, so it’s still relatively small, but our clients own a big part of the market. We also anticipate launching Bitcoin and Ether sometime soon so our clients have access to that, and we think that’ll be an acceleration of our growth, because what we hear from many of our clients are that they have 98% of their wealth here at Schwab, and they might hold a percent or 2% at some digital native firm to hold their crypto, and they really want to bring it back to Schwab because they trust us, they want it to sit alongside their other assets, and so we think we’ll see some real growth when we bring those to market.” When asked if they plan to compete directly with Coinbase, Wurster responded , “Absolutely.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Technical signals suggest continued upward potential for the established altcoin. Concurrently, Tron’s network hosts an enormous USDT supply exceeding $80 billion. This year alone witnessed over $22 billion minted, highlighting significant activity. Yet, a new DeFi contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , rapidly advances. Its ongoing presale attracts substantial capital and holders. This dual development sparks debate about lasting leadership within the altcoin sector. Can Tron maintain its position against this innovative emerging force? The crypto market constantly evolves, presenting fresh opportunities for discerning investors seeking the best crypto to buy now. TRON’s stablecoin supremacy TRON solidifies its role as a major stablecoin conduit. Network activity remains exceptionally high. More than $22 billion in USDT has been minted in 2025 so far. This figure surpasses previous full-year totals significantly. Three separate $2 billion USDT mints occurred this year. Such large issuances often indicate strong institutional participation. TRX price action reflects underlying network strength. It holds firmly above key moving averages like the SMA50 at $0.28. Momentum indicators like the RSI near 69 support further gains. Resistance sits at $0.31. A decisive break could propel TRX toward $0.35. Tron leverages its efficiency for stablecoin transactions effectively. Moreover, its low-cost structure attracts significant volume. However, crypto prices fluctuate based on broader market sentiment and innovation elsewhere. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale advances powerfully through phase 5. Investor participation is remarkably strong. Over $12,700,000 has been secured since the presale commenced. More than 620 million MUTM tokens have found buyers. Total holders now exceed 13,600 individuals. Phase 5 offers tokens at $0.03 each. This represents a 200% increase from the phase one price of $0.01. Further, phase 5 is currently underway and over 80% filled. Consequently, acquiring tokens at this price point is ending soon. Phase 6 will introduce a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. The planned launch price is $0.06. Buying now guarantees a 100% return on investment at launch. Post-launch, analysts project substantial potential growth. Some forecasts suggest MUTM could reach $3.50. This represents significant upside for early participants. Crypto investment requires evaluating such potential carefully. Mutuum’s robust foundation Security forms a cornerstone for Mutuum Finance. The team successfully finalized its CertiK audit. This rigorous examination yielded an impressive 95.00 security score. To further bolster security, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program. This initiative partners with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is available. Additionally, Mutuum Finance introduced a unique dashboard feature. It includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. These leading holders receive bonus token rewards. Mutuum Finance announces an exciting $100,000 MUTM giveaway . This substantial prize pool celebrates the ongoing presale success. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The DeFi horizon shifts Tron exhibits undeniable strength, particularly in stablecoin volume. Its technical posture remains bullish near-term. However, the crypto market relentlessly demands innovation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling alternative with tangible utility. Its dual lending model offers flexibility and user control. The successful CertiK audit and substantial presale traction underscore credibility. Moreover, the current $0.03 entry point in phase 5 offers clear value. Phase 6 brings a higher price. Listing at $0.06 provides immediate upside. Long-term projections suggest far greater potential. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance warrants serious attention. Its blend of security, utility, and growth prospects positions it uniquely.

According to Zeberg, the stock could soon present “the greatest shorting opportunity,” he said in an X post on July 18. #MSTR will be the greatest shorting opportunity of a life time! Not yet! But it is coming — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) July 18, 2025 Zeberg cautioned that Strategy’s deep exposure to Bitcoin may eventually crash its balance sheet, stating that every time a company adds Bitcoin to its treasury, it “plants a small bomb” in its financials. He argued that the risk isn’t if Bitcoin tumbles again, but when. According to Zeberg, such a scenario could damage not only Strategy’s market capitalization but also its cash flow, access to credit, and investor confidence. “Every time a company adds Bitcoin to its treasury, it plants a small bomb in its balance sheet. Not if BTC tumbles again — but when — those bombs go off. And when they do, they don’t just dent the market cap. They hit cash flow, credit lines, and confidence,” he added. It’s worth noting that Strategy’s pivot toward Bitcoin has been led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, who doubled down on his conviction, claiming that “the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin.” Saylor’s bet has so far paid off, with the stock having surged approximately 3,500% over the past five years, outperforming Bitcoin’s 905% rise over the same period. MSTR short interest rising But while Strategy continues to outpace both Bitcoin and traditional market benchmarks, short sellers are taking notice. According to the latest data retrieved from Fintel by Finbold on July 19, short volume in MSTR has risen significantly. On July 18, 2025, short volume stood at 3.76 million shares out of a total trading volume of 6.74 million, resulting in a short volume ratio of 55.7%, the highest in the past ten trading days. Short interest has remained elevated throughout the period, with ratios consistently above 47% on most days, suggesting mounting bearish sentiment. MSTR short volume.

The U.S is making fast decisions, Ripple vs SEC is back to make headlines, and fresh momentum built around some of the industry’s biggest tokens. There’s policy, price action, and just enough controversy to keep things interesting. If you missed anything, don’t worry – I’ve put the key updates in one place. Let’s dive in. #1 Gamechanger for Crypto? GENIUS Act Is Now Official It’s official: the U.S. just passed its first real stablecoin law. The GENIUS Act, a long-awaited bill to regulate dollar-backed stablecoins, was signed into law by President Trump after clearing the House with bipartisan support (308-122). The new rules require stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, with monthly public reserve disclosures. Trump called it “a giant step to cement the American dominance of global finance and crypto technology.” It’s the clearest signal yet that stablecoins are going mainstream; now with rules to match. #2 Trump to Allow 401(k) Investments in Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity Donald Trump is preparing to open up America’s $9 trillion retirement savings market to crypto, gold, and private equity. A new executive order, expected this week, would push regulators to clear the way for 401(k) plans to include alternative investments, not just stocks and bonds. The White House says Trump is focused on “restoring prosperity for everyday Americans.” It’s also a major win for crypto, coming after Trump backed multiple digital asset bills and rolled back restrictions on crypto in retirement accounts. #3 SC Becomes First Global Bank to Offer Regulated BTC, ETH Trading Standard Chartered just became the first global bank to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The service, rolled out via its UK subsidiary, is aimed squarely at institutions. Clients can now trade BTC and ETH on the same system they already use for currencies. This is part of a much bigger strategy that’s been years in the making, from Zodia Custody to Libeara. As CEO Bill Winters put it: “Digital assets are a fundamental part of the evolution of financial services.” #4 No Surprise, But No Relief: CPI at 2.7% in June June’s inflation data came out this week. Consumer prices in the U.S. rose 0.3% from May, pushing the annual inflation rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) held steady at 2.9% year-over-year, in line with forecasts. That might sound mild, but it’s enough to keep the Fed cautious. Some categories, like household goods and electronics, saw sharp price jumps, likely reflecting new tariffs. The takeaway is that rate cuts are still likely, but probably not before September. Bitcoin reacted with a quick drop but steadied itself. #5 ₹1,500 Cr in XRP Moved Before WazirX Hack – Coinpedia Investigates A viral tweet from anonymous user @TOOFAANARMY is raising eyebrows: over ₹1,500 crore worth of XRP was moved from a WazirX-linked wallet just before the platform’s ₹2,000 crore hack. WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty tells Coinpedia it was routine user activity and cold wallet consolidation, not unusual. “We don’t have an account with Binance,” he added, pushing back on claims of direct transfers. The wallet was public on their Proof of Reserves page. For now, the claim remains unverified. #6 Grayscale Starts Process to Go Public The crypto investment firm has filed a confidential draft registration with the U.S. SEC, signaling plans for an IPO. For now, details like the number of shares and pricing are still undecided. The move won’t go forward until the SEC review is complete and market conditions are right. By choosing a confidential filing, Grayscale keeps its early plans private while testing investor interest behind the scenes. If the IPO goes ahead, it could help the company reach more investors and grow its role in traditional finance. #7 Crypto Market Cap Nears $4T, Chasing Nvidia Crypto had a massive day on Friday! The total market cap inched close to $4 trillion, driven by sharp gains in Ethereum and XRP after the U.S. House passed three major crypto bills. Bitcoin crossed $120,000 again, but ETH jumped 8% to hit $3,600, and XRP soared 20% to a new yearly high of $3.64. Binance’s CoinMarketCap puts total market cap at $3.8T, while TradingView shows $3.9T – higher than the last peak in December. As LVRG’s Nick Ruck put it, “We’re optimistic… as institutions race to advance integration with the crypto industry.” #8 Ripple vs. SEC Drags On Despite $125M Settlement Ripple has paid the full $125 million SEC penalty and it was all in cash, not XRP. That clears up recent rumours about a crypto payout. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel confirmed the court required a cash-only settlement. But the lawsuit isn’t over yet. Both Ripple and the SEC still need to withdraw their appeals before the case officially closes. Until then, the money stays locked in escrow. They already paid in cash. Sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 16, 2025 Meanwhile, XRP has jumped 29% this week and is trading above $3.15, showing strong momentum. #9 Bitcoin Beats Gold as 2025’s Top Asset Bitcoin finally stole the crown! With a $123,000 price peak this week and a 30% year-to-date surge, BTC overtook gold to become 2025’s best-performing asset. But behind the breakout is a far deeper signal. As Charlie Bilello put it, “We’ve never seen these two in the number one and number two spots.” When Bitcoin and gold lead together, it might seem optimistic but it’s warning signs. People are scared and running to shelter. Something to think about… #10 Cross-Chain Crime Tripled Since 2023, Says Elliptic Crypto crime is getting harder to stop and bigger in size. A new report from Elliptic shows criminals moved over $21.8 billion through DEXs, cross-chain bridges, and swap tools this year – three times more than in 2023. Around $2.5 billion is linked to North Korean hackers, with another $300 million tied to Iranian services under U.S. sanctions. One in three investigations now involve more than three blockchains. As scams and laundering move across networks, Elliptic says full-chain visibility is the only way to keep up. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! Citi Joins the Stablecoin Race: Jane Fraser confirms the bank is exploring its own digital token, with crypto custody and tokenized deposits also on the table amid new support from Trump’s Genius Act and relaxed Fed rules. PUMP Token Raises $600M in 12 Minutes: Solana-based platform Pump.fun launched its memecoin with explosive demand, triggering high-volume trading and speculation across spot and derivatives markets as traders scramble for exposure during the token’s distribution phase. Trump Denies Plan to Fire Fed Chair Powell: Despite reports of a draft termination letter, Trump says he’s “highly unlikely” to remove Jerome Powell , unless it’s over fraud, but criticism of rate policies continues to mount. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Holdings Top $760M: Despite past criticism, the country’s BTC stash has tripled in 2025, with over 6,200 coins now worth more than $760 million as Bitcoin pushes new all-time highs. DOJ Ends Polymarket Probe in Win for Crypto Bets: The betting platform is no longer under investigation by U.S. regulators, after months of scrutiny following the 2024 election and an FBI raid on CEO Shayne Coplan’s home. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Stablecoins may move further into the financial mainstream, now backed by real rules, real reserves and the biggest banks watching closely. Institutional crypto access could widen fast if Trump’s 401(k) order goes through, bringing billions in retirement capital into play. As inflation lingers and rate cuts stall, markets may stay jumpy but crypto’s momentum suggests traders are betting big on a September pivot. The GENIUS Act’s ripple effect is already visible, with Citi and Standard Chartered both pushing deeper into tokenized finance. Regulators face pressure to keep up with crypto crime and increasingly complex laundering tactics. That’s all for now but the next shake-up is never far in crypto.

On July 17, the bill was approved by the House of Representatives. That day, lawmakers passed three bills related to digital assets, including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Act. The GENIUS Act establishes requirements for fully backing stablecoins with liquid assets and mandates annual audits for issuers whose stablecoin market capitalization exceeds $50 billion. The Act also prohibits the payment of interest or other income to stablecoin holders and sets governing rules for foreign companies operating in this sector. “The GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework for creating and unlocking the enormous potential of dollar-backed stablecoins,” Trump said during the signing ceremony. The signing event was attended by several industry figures, including Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, Tether head Paolo Ardoino, and Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev. “You, the entire crypto community, have been ridiculed and written off for years [...] but this signing is a powerful affirmation [...] of your hard work and pioneering spirit,” the president said, addressing the audience. The GENIUS Act will take effect either six months, or 120 days after regulators issue the rules to implement it. (Clarify exact timeframe based on official text.) According to CoinGecko, Tether’s USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin sector, with a market capitalization approaching $161 billion, while Circle’s USDC has reached nearly $65 billion. Among the largest stablecoins is USD1, launched by the DeFi platform World Liberty Financial and the Trump family.

On-Chain Data Signals Market Uncertainty,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-impede-or-support-the-altcoin-rally-on-chain-data/,"According to an on-chain analyst on X, Bitcoin has decoupled from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the market over the next day. Why Traders Should Brace For Impact In a July 18 post on the social media platform X, Joao Wedson, founder of crypto analytics firm Alphractal, reported that the Bitcoin price might witness a significant drop over the next day. The crypto analyst based his conclusion on multiple results obtained from on-chain analysis using three major metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trades Above $117K as Whale Deposits Decline and Stablecoin Inflows Rise First, Wedson referenced an earlier post made on X by Alphractal, saying that the market is currently dominated by long positions. According to the analyst, the effect of these long positions wouldn’t necessarily last long in a market where the shorts have been liquidated — a phenomenon which also holds for the reverse case. The chart above is from the Correlation Heatmap – BTCUSDT versus ALTCOINS metric, which reads the trajectory of the two crypto categories and compares them. Using the chart as a foundation, Wedson mentioned that altcoins are decoupling from Bitcoin. When altcoins cease to follow the premier cryptocurrency’s lead, the development could be subject to a couple of interpretations, which affect market sentiment. As a result, it is normal to expect increased market volatility. Wedson also referenced the Altcoin Season Index Vs Bitcoin metric, which is used to measure if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin within a specific period. According to the analyst, this Altcoin Season Index is currently on the rise, which is typically a positive sign for the altcoins. However, if historical trends are anything to go by, a rising Altcoin Season Index might be a negative signal for Bitcoin. Wedson explained that the Bitcoin market might experience a dump, dragging along with it the currently rising Altcoins, to re-establish market balance. The crypto pundit also cited the Alpha Quant Signal as an influence in his conclusion. Wedson pointed out that the metric flashed a sell, which was expected, seeing as some significant whales recently added to the sell pressure on Bitcoin by selling a fraction of their holdings. Outlook For The Altcoins Even as the market flashes ominous signs, Joao Wedson expressed optimism in the viability of the beginning of an altcoin rally, saying he doesn’t believe this is the final leg down for the crypto market. “But it’s likely a sign that the market is about to form a new price base. So be cautious with the traps that might show up along the way,” the analyst added.

The AVAX price has been trading in a bear market since December 2023, although the current strength suggests an impressive change in the technical structure. Should those external conditions remain supportive, the move could provide a backdrop for a broader rally if momentum holds, the more so as analysts forecast higher AVAX price targets in the coming weeks. Breakout from Channel Ignites Bullish Sentiment In Avalanche The break above the descending channel is a key technical upside development for AVAX price action here in 2025. Analyst Ali Martinez echoed a similar sentiment, explaining that traders could use the current momentum as a launchpad for higher momentum, if it reclaim some key levels first. In particular, a prolonged gain above the $26 mark would likely advance the positive setup and encourage fresh capital in the market. Avalanche $AVAX is approaching a major resistance at $26. A breakout here could open the door for a significant move! pic.twitter.com/eiNxgYpbbw — Ali (@ali_charts) July 19, 2025 This assessment is further echoed by Ted Pillows , too. He shared a technical chart identifying a converging declining wedge pattern. The breakout from this pattern has been clean, signaling a structural shift away from lower highs and compressed price action. According to Ted, this breakout opens up the possibility of a price advance into the $32 to $35 zone over the next one to two weeks, assuming the current trend remains intact. BTC Pair Breakout Reinforces Technical Shift In a separate observation, CryptoKaleo pointed to the AVAX/BTC trading pair, which has now broken above a long-standing resistance trendline which was active since 2021. This move carries significant implications because the AVAX price has struggled to outperform Bitcoin over the past few years, but this breakout flips everything. The current multi-year structure break has flipped its narrative from bearish to bullish, and this act as a secondary confirmation of the AVAX/USD pairs ongoing trend reversal. $AVAX / $BTC broke out of a resistance dating back to its 2021 highs.

Though such targets remain conditional on sustained market strength, they do highlight the increasing confidence in AVAX crypto’s technical outlook across different analysts. On-Chain and Derivatives Metrics Signal Growing Confidence The broader market trends indicate that the bulls are coming back in full force. The funding rates and open interest data indicate traders are leaning toward bullish scenarios. An increase in the funding rate is usually associated with long traders while an increasing open interest also indicates increased participation.

U.S. President Donald Trump has officially signed the Genius Act into law, a move Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong calls the beginning of a financial revolution. Speaking from the White House lawn in an interview with CNBC , Armstrong said the new law could transform how the world handles payments and finally bring the financial system into the modern age. Stablecoins Get Legal Backing and Clear Rules The Genius Act legally recognizes stablecoins and provides a clear regulatory framework for how they can be used. These digital assets, typically tied to stable currencies like the U.S. dollar, are now set to play a much bigger role in payments. Armstrong explained that the law could help replace the outdated financial system with one that is faster, cheaper, and accessible from anywhere in the world. He also shared the interview on social media to reinforce his message. I hope people realize how important this moment is for crypto. GENIUS is the first federal crypto bill signed into law, with more on the way. The financial revolution starts here. https://t.co/PnzrInM6gc — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) July 18, 2025 Still, Armstrong made it clear that more work needs to be done. Next Goal: The Clarity Act The crypto industry is now turning its focus to the Clarity Act, a broader bill aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies more fully. President Trump has asked Congress to bring the bill to his desk by September 30 . Armstrong said Coinbase will work alongside other companies in the industry to help make that happen.

McWaters also pointed to the growing global momentum behind stablecoins. He highlighted the European Union’s MiCA regulations, along with frameworks in Hong Kong and the UAE, as signs of a coordinated shift toward innovation in digital payments. What This Means for the Future of Crypto Now that stablecoins have legal recognition in the U.S., the country is laying the foundation to lead the next wave of financial innovation. These assets can offer smoother, more affordable transactions for both individuals and businesses.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.649 (-4%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.7 24-hour low $0.6399 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.649 Price Prediction $ 0.378825 (-35.16%) Fear & Greed Index 63 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 6.94% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.577954 200-Day SMA $ 0.735607 14-Day RSI 53 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced strong rejection around $0.7 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced a rejection around $0.7. Resistance for dYdX is at $0.6470 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.4768 The dYdX price analysis for 19 July confirms that dYdX faced a surge as it attempted a move above $0.7. However, bears strongly dominated this level, creating a sharp decline. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price rejects $0.7 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced selling pressure after the price attempted to maintain momentum above $0.7. As a result, sellers are now holding dYdX price below $0.65, preparing for a significant downtrend after a strong upward rally recently. The 24-hour volume dropped to $8.3 million, showing a decline in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.649, declining by over 4% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades around the overbought level at 65, hinting that sellers are dominating. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are holding the price above the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.21, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.649719 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.61282 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.550453 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.529794 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.577954 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.615071 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.735607 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.523708 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.546259 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.573756 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.602241 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.670922 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.817551 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.038118 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.6470, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.7416. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.4768, beginning a bearish trend to $0.4096. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as sellers gained confidence in pushing the price below Fib levels. As a result, sellers are now approaching the $0.65 level to initiate a stronger bearish rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.65 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility.

As a result, dYdX recorded over 6% decline in June. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.9 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $1.2, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction July 2025 $0.45 $0.9 $1.2 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June.

(SCHW) is preparing to launch trading for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as it aims to become a dominant player in digital asset custody for U.S. retail investors, according to CEO Rick Wurster. Speaking Friday on CNBC’s ""Money Movers"", Wurster said Schwab clients already have significant crypto exposure through exchange-traded products — accounting for more than 20% of the industry's holdings in that segment — but many have expressed interest in keeping their actual tokens with Schwab, rather than at crypto-native platforms. Crypto still represents a small slice of Schwab’s business, Wurster said, with about $25 billion in digital assets held across $10.8 trillion in total client wealth. But he framed Schwab’s upcoming product launch as a potential inflection point. “Our clients want their crypto to sit alongside their stocks, bonds and cash — not off to the side on a different app,” he said. Schwab anticipates demand will accelerate once it introduces direct access to bitcoin and ether custody and trading. The comments came just hours before President Trump was scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act, legislation aimed at bolstering U.S. blockchain competitiveness. The policy backdrop could further incentivize large brokerages to expand their crypto offerings, especially as the regulatory environment shifts in favor of mainstream financial firms. When asked whether Schwab’s upcoming platform would compete with Coinbase, Wurster replied: “Absolutely.” He added that the company would welcome a scenario where clients migrate their crypto holdings away from other platforms and consolidate them under Schwab’s umbrella. While no timeline was provided, the announcement positions Schwab — already one of the largest brokerages in the U.S. — to become a major player in retail crypto access, particularly for older and higher-net-worth clients seeking integration with traditional portfolios. Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. closed at $95.80 on Friday, up 2.9% for the day. The stock opened at $95.70 and reached an intraday high of $97.50, matching its 52-week peak, before paring gains. Schwab’s market capitalization stood at $174.07 billion, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.47 and a dividend yield of 1.13%, according to Google Finance data.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ethereum|btc|ETH|Charles Schwab|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-19 13:14:01

In a brief but emphatic post , Stellar Expert stated, “#XLM will skyrocket to $1,000 faster than people anticipate.” The statement reflects growing sentiment among some market watchers who believe that certain utility-based cryptocurrencies could see rapid appreciation in value as institutional involvement in blockchain infrastructure increases. The tweet did not elaborate on specific timelines or mechanisms, but the confidence in XLM’s future trajectory was evident. The claim, however, met with some skepticism. One X user, Kenneth Van den Berghe, replied , “No ETF’s up coming. So … Don’t know. Moving slow,” signaling a more cautious outlook. The comment suggests that not everyone in the community shares the same sense of urgency or optimism, especially in the absence of traditional financial vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that boost market accessibility and liquidity. Media Support Emphasizes Institutional Readiness Supporting Stellar Expert’s bullish stance is a recent Times Tabloid article . The article summarizes comments made by Austin Hilton, a crypto influencer and market analyst, who recently addressed the XLM community in a video posted on his X profile. In his message, Hilton stressed XLM’s status as an ISO 20022-compliant digital asset , a key feature he believes could lead to significant institutional adoption. Hilton described XLM not merely as another cryptocurrency but as a structural component of the evolving financial system. According to his view, as banks and financial institutions increasingly explore blockchain solutions that align with regulatory standards, ISO 20022-compliant assets, such as XLM, are likely to gain preferential consideration. He suggested that early holders of such assets may be positioned to benefit as institutional players enter the space more decisively. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XLM as Part of Broader Regulatory-Focused Asset Class In addition to discussing XLM directly, Hilton also pointed to other ISO-compliant cryptocurrencies that may be relevant in a similar institutional context. Another major theme of Hilton’s commentary was the emergence of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) , a growing area of blockchain development where compliance, transparency, and operational interoperability are essential. Hilton argued that ISO-compliant assets are particularly well-positioned to serve this market segment due to their alignment with global messaging standards and potential to interface with existing financial infrastructure. Market Movement and Sentiment Remain Mixed While Stellar Expert’s forecast of a $1,000 valuation for XLM may appear bold in the context of the asset’s historical price trends and current market capitalization, the rationale presented by Austin Hilton offers a potential framework for understanding such a projection. Hilton’s emphasis on XLM’s ISO 20022 compliance, its suitability for institutional integration, and its role in the tokenization of real-world assets presents a forward-looking case that could support significant long-term appreciation. His view that XLM is not merely a cryptocurrency but a foundational component of future financial infrastructure aligns with the idea that assets meeting regulatory and interoperability standards may be positioned for outsized gains as institutional adoption accelerates.

Its price recently jumped 7%, reaching $0.21. This marks an 18% increase over the past week. Trading volume surged 81%, signaling rising interest. Analysts now suggest a major bullish breakout could occur soon. Breaking the $0.22 resistance level might propel DOGE towards $0.43. Such a move would deliver a 100% gain. Yet, despite this potential, attention is shifting. Many experts now champion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next big altcoin. Dogecoin’s technical indicators flash green Technical analysis supports Dogecoin’s potential rise. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 70.96. This points to strong buying pressure. It also indicates DOGE might be overbought presently. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows positive momentum. Derivatives data reinforces this view. Open interest increased by 10.47%. Trading volume climbed over 52%. These metrics suggest growing trader confidence. However, the crypto market remains unpredictable. Meme coins like Dogecoin are famously volatile. Consequently, some investors seek alternatives with stronger fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits this profile perfectly. Mutuum Finance presale gains unprecedented traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing significant investor interest. Its presale is currently in Phase 5. The token price here stands at $0.03. This represents a 200% increase from the opening phase price of $0.01. The project has already raised an impressive $12,700,000. Over 620 million MUTM tokens have been sold. Total holders since the presale began number 13,600. Phase 5 is over 80% filled already. This window to acquire tokens at $0.03 closes rapidly. Phase 6 will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. The official launch price is set firmly at $0.06. Buying now guarantees a 100% return on investment at launch. Beyond this, analysts project substantial post-launch growth. Conservative estimates place MUTM reaching $3.50 within the first year. This potential 11,567% gain dwarfs typical market returns. Advanced technology powers Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than just price potential. Its technology provides real financial solutions. The platform features a dual lending model. This combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. P2C lending uses smart contracts for automation. It dynamically adjusts interest rates based on market conditions. This ensures stability and predictability. P2P lending facilitates direct agreements between users. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance is developing its own stablecoin. This fully collateralized, USD-pegged asset will operate on Ethereum. It aims for greater stability than algorithmic competitors. This infrastructure delivers genuine utility in the crowded crypto market. Security and incentives build trust Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance. The project successfully completed a comprehensive CertiK audit. The audit found no vulnerabilities in the smart contracts. To bolster security further, Mutuum launched a Bug Bounty Program. Partnering with CertiK, it offers $50,000 USDT in rewards. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity. Additionally, Mutuum Finance is running a massive $100,000 MUTM giveaway . Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000. Participation requires completing simple quests. Mutuum Finance represents the next evolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) transcends typical presale projects. Its focus on real-world DeFi solutions resonates. The successful CertiK audit provides crucial trust. The substantial funds raised demonstrate strong market belief. Early investors benefit from immediate ROI potential at launch. The projected surge to $3.50 offers extraordinary long-term growth. This combination is rare in the current crypto market. Dogecoin might rally soon, offering short-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, presents a compelling long-term opportunity. Experts backing it as the next crypto to hit $1 see its robust foundation. Its innovative technology and strong security posture justify this confidence. Why MUTM stands out now The evidence for Mutuum Finance’s potential is clear. Phase 5 offers the last chance to buy near the current low price. The imminent price rise to $0.035 in Phase 6 makes acting now essential. Guaranteed doubling of investment upon launch provides a solid safety net. The project’s tangible utility in DeFi lending adds significant value. Security assurances from the CertiK audit mitigate risk. Potential returns reaching $3.50 create exceptional upside. Dogecoin’s possible comeback attracts attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the smarter, more sustainable opportunity. It is positioned as the next crypto truly capable of reaching $1.

Established players like Solana show promise, yet newer projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct advantages. Solana recently saw its price jump 5% to $173. Daily trading volume surged 48%. Its DePIN ecosystem generated $3 million year-to-date revenue. Analysts suggest SOL could reach $200 soon, possibly $270 later. Identifying the best crypto to buy requires looking beyond short-term pumps. Real utility and growth potential matter most. Here is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. Solana’s technical strength meets market realities Solana trades within a rising parallel channel. It flipped $150 and $160 resistance into support. The price now is $180. Technical indicators appear bullish. The RSI sits at 65.78, signaling buying pressure. MACD shows strong positive momentum. Open interest climbed 8.28% to $8.86 billion. Derivatives activity suggests trader confidence. Breaking $185 could fuel a run toward $270. Failure risks a drop to $162 support. Market conditions remain volatile. Solana must maintain developer interest and user growth. Its DePIN revenue growth is positive. Reaching long-term price targets depends heavily on broader crypto sentiment and execution. Investors must weigh these factors carefully. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds significantly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling long-term opportunity right now. Its presale entered Phase 5. Over $12,700,000 has been raised since presale began. More than 620 million tokens found buyers. Total MUTM holders reached 13,600. The current price is $0.03. This reflects a 200% increase from the first phase price of $0.01. Phase 5 is over 80% filled. Buying at $0.03 offers a clear path. The official launch price is set at $0.06. This guarantees a 100% return for Phase 5 participants. Phase 6 is set to begin soon, with a price increase to $0.035. Time is limited for this entry point. This structured presale creates urgency. Protocol utility anchors Mutuum Finance value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers tangible utility in decentralized finance. Its core is a dual-model lending protocol. Peer-to-Contract lending uses smart contracts for automated, dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-peer lending enables direct agreements between users. It offers flexibility for volatile assets. Both models are non-custodial. Users retain full asset ownership. The protocol is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. This avoids depegging risks common with algorithmic versions. Mutuum Finance also features mtTokens. These represent deposited assets and earn interest. Staking mtTokens earns rewards from protocol buybacks of MUTM tokens. This mechanism rewards long-term participation. Robust security underpins investor confidence Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance. The project completed a comprehensive Certik audit. Certik awarded a 95.00 security score. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance further strengthened security. It launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A $50,000 USDT reward pool is available. Rewards are divided into four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low severity issues. In addition, a new dashboard feature enhances transparency. It displays a leaderboard of the top 50 MUTM holders. These holders earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term holding. Long-term crypto investment requires strategic choice Choosing the best crypto to buy today demands analysis. Solana offers technical upside potential. Its recent performance is noteworthy. Yet Mutuum Finance presents a unique presale proposition. Buying MUTM at $0.03 guarantees a 100% return at launch. Post-launch, analysts see significant room for growth. Conservative projections place MUTM between $1 and $3 within the next year. This represents a potential 33x to 100x gain from the current presale price. Its practical DeFi utility, Certik-verified security, and rewarding tokenomics create a strong foundation. Mutuum Finance addresses real needs in lending and stable value. For investors prioritizing fundamentals and high-growth potential, Mutuum Finance stands out clearly as a strategic long-term crypto investment.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently flashed a bullish technical signal, suggesting significant potential gains. Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) advances through its presale, offering tangible utility and immediate profit potential. Both assets present distinct opportunities for those targeting high-multiple returns this year. Market participants are closely watching these developments. Shiba Inu charts bullish course Shiba Inu (SHIB) displays promising technical strength. Its price surged 15% last week. A crucial bullish crossover emerged on its daily chart. This technical pattern mirrors conditions preceding SHIB’s impressive 34% rally in May 2025. Exchange reserves for SHIB have plummeted dramatically. They now sit at a yearly low, valued near $1.14 billion. Reduced exchange supply often signals lower selling pressure. Consequently, this scarcity can propel prices upwards if demand persists. SHIB currently challenges minor resistance around $0.00001421. Overcoming this hurdle is critical. Key supply zones await near $0.00001468 and $0.00001577. Successfully breaching these barriers could ignite a powerful rally. Analysts project a potential 38% climb towards $0.00001867. Such a move aligns with historical performance after similar technical setups. This crypto investment hinges on breaking resistance swiftly. Downside protection exists near $0.00001320. A drop below $0.00001282 would threaten the bullish crypto predictions. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured significant investor interest. Its presale entered Phase 5 with strong momentum. This new cryptocurrency currently sells for $0.03 per token. Phase 5 is over 80% filled, indicating rapid progress. Investors have secured over 620 million tokens already. A total of $12,700,000 has been raised since the presale began. Moreover, holder numbers climbed steadily, reaching 13,600 participants. The price represents a 200% increase from the first phase cost of $0.01. Phase 6 will commence soon, featuring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. Buying now locks in a guaranteed 100% profit at the official $0.06 launch price. The project successfully passed a rigorous CertiK security audit. This audit achieved an outstanding 95.00 security score. CertiK identified no vulnerabilities within the smart contracts. Furthermore, no security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. To bolster security further, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program. This program, managed with CertiK, offers $50,000 USDT in rewards. The team also introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard. This tracks the top 50 token holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance utility drives value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers far more than speculative appeal. It provides a practical decentralized lending protocol. This protocol utilizes a dual-model framework. Peer-to-Contract lending employs dynamic interest rates via smart contracts. Peer-to-peer lending enables direct agreements between users. This flexibility accommodates diverse borrower and lender needs effectively. The platform also develops its own fully collateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin aims for greater resilience against depegging events common with algorithmic types. A major $100,000 MUTM giveaway excites the community. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Participation requires simple steps. This initiative fuels wider participation. Significant growth potential exists Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling case for substantial growth. Beyond the assured 2x return at launch, analysts see significant upside. Conservative post-launch predictions target prices between $1 and $5. Achieving $1 represents a potential 33x gain from the current Phase 5 price. This crypto investment leverages real utility within decentralized finance. Moreover, its unique lending models, security credentials, and stablecoin development build a robust foundation. The ongoing presale phase offers a timely entry point before the next price increase. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025 for transformative returns should evaluate Mutuum Finance closely.

48537018,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769256,1752932501,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48537018.jpeg,Japan’s chief negotiator to visit Washington to salvage trade talks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japans-akazawa-heads-to-washington/,"Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s chief negotiator on trade, confirmed on Saturday that he’s heading to Washington next week to meet U.S. officials for another ministerial-level negotiation. This trip is an urgent push by Tokyo to prevent President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on Japanese imports from kicking in by the August 1 deadline. Speaking in Osaka, where he hosted a U.S. delegation attending the World Expo 2025, Akazawa made it clear : “I intend to keep on seeking actively an agreement that is beneficial to both Japan and the United States, while safeguarding our national interest.” Despite Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent being present at the same event, Akazawa told reporters the two didn’t talk about tariffs. This round of talks will be his attempt to break the gridlock, as Trump publicly stated just days earlier that he doesn’t expect a deal to be reached with Japan, raising alarms back home about how much worse things could get if negotiations stall. Tokyo is desperate to avoid an economic hit that would come from broader tariffs, especially after seeing auto exports already slapped with a 25% levy—the very same industry that leads Japanese exports to the U.S. Japan’s inflation softens but risks stay high At the same time Akazawa is heading west, internal numbers are flashing red at home. Core inflation cooled down to 3.3% in June, dropping from 3.7%, which had been the highest rate in nearly two and a half years. That figure matched the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, though it still means inflation has run above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Headline inflation also dropped, from 3.5% in May to 3.3% in June. But it’s not all good news. The so-called core-core inflation rate, which strips out both fresh food and energy, exactly the metric BOJ uses to guide policy, ticked up to 3.4% from 3.3% in May. The increase puts even more pressure on Japan’s central bank as it weighs whether another interest rate hike is still on the table. The biggest pain point remains rice prices. In May, rice prices exploded with a 101.7% year-over-year increase, the fastest rise in over 50 years. In June, it came down slightly to 100.2%, thanks to the government releasing emergency stockpiles earlier this year. But prices are still way above normal. The spike traces back to poor harvests in 2023, which left Japan struggling through food inflation all the way from late 2024 into the first half of 2025. Tariffs, shrinking GDP, and election jitters collide Japan’s broader economy is already under stress. The country’s GDP contracted 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, the first time in a year Japan’s economy has shrunk. That drop was driven by a sharp fall in exports, and fears are growing that more tariffs from Trump could crush whatever recovery plan Japan has left. Krishna Bhimavarapu, APAC economist at State Street Investment Management, said the inflation slowdown gives some breathing room, but warned that the overall picture is fragile. He forecasted GDP growth at just 0.4% year-over-year in 2025. “Even though we expect another hike from the BOJ this year, our conviction is weakened,” Bhimavarapu said, adding, “resultingly, market anxiety about the elections could spill into higher volatility and that is a key risk ahead.” That election he’s talking about? It’s happening tomorrow, July 20. And it’s a big one. Japan heads to the polls for the Upper House election, and Nikkei reported that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition might lose its majority. That would throw Japan into political chaos at the worst possible time. Any shake-up in the ruling party during these trade negotiations with the U.S. could gut Japan’s ability to respond to the economic hit from Trump’s policies.

The chart shows a series of monthly candlesticks dating back to 2013, highlighting key breakout levels and projected targets for XRP. According to the chart, XRP previously respected the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci levels during its earlier cycle, which were hit at $0.13267 and $0.36911, respectively. ChartNerd labels this prior performance as a foundation to justify similar projections in the ongoing bullish cycle. The chart is framed within a rising trendline that has held since the 2017 breakout and continues to support the asset’s broader market structure. The phrase “BREAK FOR IMPULSE” is placed at horizontal resistance lines that XRP has now crossed, suggesting the analyst views this as a technical confirmation of an upward trajectory. $XRP to $8-$27 this cycle. pic.twitter.com/uNurjDWE0E — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) July 17, 2025 Breakout Confirmation and Long-Term Trend Support The chart indicates that XRP has broken above a key horizontal resistance level that served as the top on previous rallies. This breakout is considered crucial by ChartNerd, as it marks the transition from a consolidation phase into what the analyst identifies as an impulsive move. The current market price on the chart is marked at approximately $3.25, accompanied by a timestamp of “2M 14d,” implying this is a monthly chart with over two months of candle duration remaining in the current bar. The price history over the past decade shows a pronounced low in early years, a major rally during the 2017 cycle, and a prolonged period of sideways movement from 2018 through 2023. Throughout this entire timeline, XRP has maintained its position above a key trendline, adding support to ChartNerd’s suggestion of structural bullish continuity. XRP Cycle Top Projections: $8.41 and $27.34 In the chart’s upper right quadrant, two Fibonacci extension targets are presented. The 1.272 extension corresponds to a price level of $8.41485, while the 1.618 extension marks a high of $27.34345. These are labeled as “BR TARGETS,” reflecting potential targets based on the breakout pattern established by the asset’s historical behavior. ChartNerd has titled the image “$XRP CYCLE TOP ($8–$27),” reinforcing the suggested range for this cycle’s projected peak. These targets are not arbitrarily chosen but follow the precedent set by earlier movements, where XRP respected similar Fibonacci levels during its run from sub-penny prices to over $3 in previous years. By applying the same technical logic, ChartNerd extrapolates the $8–$27 range as feasible, should XRP replicate historical behavior post-breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst’s View Anchored in Technical Structure The visual data implies that the analyst’s perspective relies entirely on technical chart structures, without incorporating macroeconomic or regulatory developments. Emphasis is placed on the repeating nature of impulse waves and the role of Fibonacci extensions in forecasting cycle tops. The breakout line labeled “BREAK FOR IMPULSE” is a defining part of this model, as it historically precedes substantial upward movement. The projected targets align with common Fibonacci extension theory. The analyst did not provide specific dates for when these levels might be reached, instead allowing the market structure to dictate the timing. The use of a monthly chart also suggests that the outlook is based on long-term positioning rather than short-term volatility. ChartNerd’s tweet, accompanied by this image, stated , “$XRP to $8–$27 this cycle.” The assertion is grounded in a technical interpretation of historical performance and pattern repetition, focusing on Fibonacci metrics and breakout confirmations as the primary basis for forecasting XRP’s potential upside in the current market cycle.

This breakout comes as broader market sentiment shifts bullish, with Ethereum and Bitcoin also showing strong rallies. Volume and momentum are backing the move, but traders should stay alert for potential profit-taking or short-term pullbacks following such sharp advances. Ripple Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan XRP/USDT Analysis Against USDT, XRP has smashed through the long-standing $3.00 resistance zone, which had previously acted as a ceiling during several failed breakout attempts. The move was clean and impulsive, with the price now pushing toward the $4.00 psychological resistance level. This is the next major mark to watch, as it is likely a potential target for many buyers. The RSI is also sitting above 80, showing strong momentum, but also flashing caution for potential short-term overextension. Looking at the structure, XRP broke above the descending wedge that had capped price action for the past 6 months. This shift marks a clear change in market character. As long as the XRP price stays above the $3.00 region, buyers are in control. A deeper retracement into the breakout zone could offer a high-probability retest entry. Losing $3.00 again, however, would invalidate the breakout and suggest a return to the range. Source: TradingView XRP/BTC Analysis The XRP/BTC pair has surged impressively, breaking above the key 2,500 SAT high and the 200-day moving average located nearby. It is now testing the upper boundary of a major supply zone around 3,000 SAT. This level previously acted as a distribution zone several times during earlier rallies and has now become the battleground between buyers and profit-takers. The XRP price has also created a fair value gap just below the current price, which could act as a short-term support to help push the price through the 3,000 SAT zone. Moreover, the RSI is currently hovering around 88, suggesting overheated conditions that may lead to short-term cooling. If XRP holds above the 2,500 SAT region, the bullish structure remains intact, and continuation above the 3,000 SAT resistance band becomes likely. However, any rejection from 3,000 SAT could trigger a pullback to retest the 200-day moving average around 2500 SAT.

In his statement on social media, Wedson highlighted several technical signals and urged investors to be cautious about a possible bearish scenario. “After reviewing several charts today, the picture is still not completely clear. However, given the heavy open long positions in the market, the possibility of a significant decline in the coming hours is quite realistic,” Wedson said in a statement. The key points in Wedson's assessment are as follows: Correlation Warning: A heatmap showing a breakdown in correlation between BTC and altcoins could be a sign of increased market volatility. According to Wedson, this type of divergence often precedes a volatility storm. Altcoin Season Index: Although the rising Altcoin Season Index is generally interpreted as a positive signal for altcoins, according to Wedson, BTC “does not like” this situation and can often intervene suddenly in the market during these processes. Alpha Quant Sell Signal: Wedson noted that the Alpha Quant algorithm recently issued a “sell” signal. He explained that this signal was anticipated due to selling pressure from some whales and a technically emerging downtrend. Related News: Unexpected Statement from Swiss Investment Giant Official: “Yes, Ethereum is Up A Lot, But This Altcoin Will Do Even Better” Joao Wedson stated that he doesn't think the market is in its final stages, but that such movements could signal the formation of a new price base.

Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, speaking Friday near Durban, South Africa, said most of the country’s production is made to meet domestic demand, not to flood international markets. “When there’s demand from abroad, China exports accordingly,” Liao told Bloomberg, brushing off claims of aggressive market control. “This does not mean, however, that China is trying to dominate every market.” Liao was attending a G-20 finance meeting, where global economic uncertainty was front and center. He said China’s steady growth is offering some stability to the rest of the world at a time when markets are shaken by tariffs and weak forecasts. GDP rose 5.3% in the first half of the year, and he called that growth “in line with expectations.” Exports push surplus, but not strategy Even though exports helped drive recent quarterly growth, Liao insisted that’s not part of a grand plan to take over global trade. China logged a $586 billion trade surplus in the first half of the year, partly because exporters rushed to ship goods ahead of new tariffs. Liao said some of that momentum might cool, but economists still expect the annual surplus to pass $1 trillion. He pointed to long-term data showing that domestic consumption is doing the heavy lifting. In the last four years, household and local demand accounted for 86.4% of GDP growth, with consumption alone making up 56.2%. That’s up from the 2016–2020 average by over eight percentage points. Liao said, “We are steadily advancing toward an economic model driven by consumption, while at the same time maintaining a relatively balanced foreign trade.” Some officials in the U.S. aren’t buying that message. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Congress that China’s manufacturing-goods surplus is almost 2% of global GDP, about twice what Japan had at its 1990s peak. He claimed Beijing was “trying to export their way out” of its real estate crisis, and labeled China “the most imbalanced economy in the history of the world.” Beijing boosts local spending to shift model Liao didn’t respond directly to Bessent’s remarks. But he pushed back hard on the idea that high production means overcapacity. “Just because China holds a large market share in certain products doesn’t mean it should be accused of overcapacity,” he said. “Such claims are oversimplifications and fail to capture the full reality.” To support that shift toward consumption, the Chinese government has gone all in on stimulus. They doubled the issuance of ultra-long sovereign bonds, pumping 300 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) into the economy. Most of that was spent in the first half of the year, encouraging purchases of electronics, home goods, and cars. Liao said this move supported sales worth nearly ten times the subsidy amount. At the same time, Beijing plans to expand service industries and develop the green and digital sectors to push more people into better-paying jobs. That, they hope, will increase buying power across the country. Liao also said they’re boosting social safety nets like pensions to keep consumer spending stable over time. Critics still point to China’s current-account surplus, which stood at 2.2% last year. But Liao insisted that figure is reasonable by global standards and doesn’t signal overreach. “The share of its shipments worldwide is not excessively high,” he said. The timing of all this matters. Trump’s trade war continues to push uncertainty into the system, and China is scrambling to keep internal demand strong. The country’s efforts to lock in economic transformation are happening just as global forecasts are getting slashed. There’s also the politics. Liao has been a major player in trade negotiations with the U.S., helping broker two separate truces, one in Geneva and another in London, earlier this year. His comments came just before a fresh round of talks between both countries is expected. At the end of the G-20 meeting, the group released a joint statement calling for more global coordination. Liao supported it and said it shows countries can still find common ground. “It sends a strong message that countries are committed to better communication, closer coordination and working together in a spirit of unity,” he told Bloomberg. He added that China still supports multilateralism and wants the G-20 to play a stronger role during this shaky moment in the global economy. “At a time when the global economy is facing so much uncertainty and so many challenges, the G-20 should play an even greater role,” Liao said.

And right now, Cardano, AAVE, and BlockDAG are making that shortlist. Cardano (ADA) has bounced back hard from below $0.60, setting the stage for a breakout as charts point to a strong Cardano price prediction. Meanwhile, AAVE just saw a spike in total deposits to $50B, kicking off a sharp AAVE price surge that’s grabbing attention across DeFi. But the real buzz? It’s all about BlockDAG . Their daily Buyer Battles are handing out millions in BDAG rewards. Every 24 hours, 50M coins are up for grabs, and whatever doesn’t sell goes straight to the top buyer, completely free. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, that’s a massive 30x potential for those who get in now. With $343 million already raised, this isn’t a slow build, it’s a stampede. So which one earns the title of top crypto to buy now? Let’s find out. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Setting Sights on $0.75 Cardano (ADA) is heating up again, climbing from below $0.60 to just under $0.74. The charts support a bullish Cardano price prediction, with ADA sitting above its 9-day and 21-day EMAs. RSI is at 71.07, clear evidence of growing momentum. Short term? Things are mixed. On the hourly chart, ADA struggled to stay above $0.74 and has pulled back slightly. RSI now reads 45.34, and prices are sliding below key EMAs, hinting at a possible retest around $0.7203. But zoom out, and the outlook is solid. As long as ADA holds that support, another push could take it past $0.75 and maybe even challenge $0.80. Bulls are watching closely. AAVE Price Surge to $327.02 Sparks Fresh DeFi Excitement AAVE just rocketed to $327.02 after total deposits hit a jaw-dropping $50 billion, that’s around Rp815 trillion. This move marks a renewed wave of trust in DeFi platforms. More users are walking away from banks and moving toward decentralized lending. Aave offers quick, secure lending and borrowing with assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins such as USDC. Its flexibility and deep liquidity give users real earning power. The recent AAVE price surge reflects that momentum, showing that DeFi demand is ramping up fast in 2025. BlockDAG Presale Explodes Past $343M as Buyer Battles Drop Millions Daily The hype around BlockDAG is real. The presale has smashed through $343 million, making it the biggest ICO in the space this year. And the fuel behind it? Buyer Battles. Every day, 50 million BDAG coins are available. If they’re not all sold, the rest go directly to the day’s top buyer, no strings attached. The race resets at midnight UTC, so every day is a new shot at winning free BDAG. Right now, BDAG is priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29 , a limited-time rate that vanishes with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. At launch, BDAG hits $0.05, meaning a 3,025% gain for anyone buying in today. Analysts are calling for even more upside. With a working testnet, a built-out ecosystem, and massive community demand, BDAG could soar to $1 post-launch, and some forecasts even suggest $20 by 2027. The chance to win millions in daily rewards, combined with this pricing window, makes BlockDAG an opportunity that’s too big to ignore. Batch 29 is almost sold out, and once it’s gone, so is the chance for these gains. So, Which Is the Top Crypto to Buy Now? Cardano (ADA) is back in play, bouncing from key levels and targeting a bullish push toward $0.75. The technical setup supports the current Cardano (ADA) price prediction, and momentum could build fast. AAVE has shown how DeFi growth translates into price action. With $50B in deposits and a sharp AAVE price surge, it’s becoming a reliable pick for returns. Still, the biggest potential? It’s all with BlockDAG. With $343 million raised, a daily shot at 50M BDAG through Buyer Battles, and a limited $0.0016 price, this presale has set the stage for serious upside. Add in the 3,025% ROI from presale to launch, and it’s easy to see why BlockDAG tops the list of top cryptos to buy now . The market isn’t waiting, and neither should you.

Recently, India’s leading exchanges have reported a sharp rise in interest from Indian family offices, amidst the ongoing global bull run. Bitcoin’s Rise Fuels Confidence The wealthy Indian investors are quietly shifting their money into digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The trend has shifted, especially after Trump’s return to the White House, which has boosted global crypto confidence. With Bitcoin hitting above $120K and giving 90% returns in a year, crypto is now looking a lot more attractive than gold, stocks or bonds. HNI Activity Spikes Across Top Crypto Platforms A recent report from Moneycontrol reveals that platforms like Mudrex saw HNI trading volumes rise by 30% in just one week, hitting the $10 million mark. CoinDCX also saw a 25–30% increase in the average trade size by HNIs in July, up from ₹5 lakh in the previous month. In fact, from January to June, more than 3,500 HNIs, family offices, and institutional players contributed nearly half of CoinDCX’s total trading activity. Their average monthly spot trading volume now exceeds ₹50 lakh. A Clear Shift In Mindset Most wealthy investors are leaning toward blue-chip tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Tokens like Solana and XRP are also gaining traction. CoinSwitch co-founder Ashish Singhal notes that Indian HNIs are no longer just exploring crypto; they are diving in. The mindset has shifted from ‘Why crypto?’ to ‘How much and where to invest?’ Notably, Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in $70 billion in inflows and doubled in value to $150 billion in just 18 months, something gold has not achieved in decades. Retail Investors Driving The Momentum Although HNI trades are growing, retail investors are driving the real momentum. Daily trading volumes have jumped sharply across major platforms. CoinSwitch saw a 3x jump in daily trading while CoinDCX’s daily volume rose 40% in July to $12.82 million. Mudrex saw spot trading jump by 102% and futures trading rise 200% within just one week. Interestingly, over half of this came from meme coins like Doge, PEPE, and Shiba Inu, while the rest came from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple. ZebPay saw 60% of trades towards the buy side. Many retail investors are entering or returning to the market, expecting more gains, while some are cashing out profits. Major Obstacles But India’s high taxes and uncertain regulations are still major obstacles that are pushing retail investors away. Experts note that simpler rules and better tax policies could drive even more interest. Bitcoin’s explosive price rally sparked a lot of interest in India. Around $150–200 million was invested in just one week. Major activity took place between July 10–15, when Bitcoin crossed $116K. Experts predict that it could reach $140K–$185K by the end of the year.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 14:01:21

On July 18, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, a bill regulating stablecoins. Tether prepares for new compliance measures Complying with the new regulations means implementing a revised audit regime and making changes to USDT’s reserve structure. Ardoino stated that the $13 billion net income the company generated last year provides ample resources for these adjustments. He confirmed that CFO Simon McWilliams, appointed in March, is working to engage an auditor from one of the Big Four accounting firms. ”Tether will comply with the GENIUS Act,” Ardoino said. He estimated that it will take around three years for Tether to enter the U.S. market. The company also intends to launch a version of USDT specifically targeting the United States and institutional investors. ”Institutions are used to ultra-efficient markets, and they will take every basis point into account. So we need to create something suitable for that,” he explained. Therefore, the new product will be ”focused on payments and extremely high efficiency,” the executive clarified. In May, Ardoino said the company could issue a U.S. stablecoin as early as 2026. At that time, he reiterated that USDT’s main business interests remain outside of the United States. ”Our customer base is three billion people without accounts or access to the banking system,” Ardoino emphasized. According to a February estimate from JPMorgan analysts, only 66%–83% of USDT reserves currently meet GENIUS Act requirements. To achieve compliance, the issuer would need to replace bitcoins, corporate bonds, and secured loans with U.S. government bonds and other highly liquid assets, the experts concluded. Ardoino expressed confidence that adapting to the new rules would be “simple” for the company. Following the introduction of MiCA regulations in the EU, Tether has shifted focus to supporting third-party regulated stablecoin projects through its Hadron platform. Circle optimistic about new regulatory landscape Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle (issuer of USDC), told CoinDesk that passage of the GENIUS Act “legitimizes the company’s approach to doing business.” “We have always been trusted, transparent, and publicly audited for five years,” he said. According to Allaire, the U.S. stablecoin sector was already evolving rapidly before the new regulations were approved. A number of “large technology companies, trading firms, and financial institutions” have expressed interest in entering the market. “Once this federal law is in place, it will really be a green light for all of these types of institutions,” Allaire emphasized. The GENIUS Act will take effect six months after President Trump's signature, or 120 days after regulators publish implementing rules, whichever comes later.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,USDT|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-19 14:22:29

In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.6170, with an average price of $0.5357. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $1.51 and $1.87, with an average price of $1.57 HBAR price prediction – Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is a cryptocurrency that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021, alongside other altcoins. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing to a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we may see a bullish scenario unfold sooner, perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

The RSI reading above 75 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a short-term pullback to near the middle band or moving average around $0.20 may occur before buyers reenter. Price action shows a series of higher lows since mid-June, confirming an uptrend that could target the next resistance near $0.28 to $0.30 if momentum holds. A valid breakout requires sustained volume above this zone. Overall, expect consolidation around current levels before another leg higher in the medium term. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBARUSD chart by TradingView On the 4-hour chart, HBAR has entered a consolidation phase above its 20-period SMA following a strong rally from near 0.22 USDT. Its price is oscillating around the middle Bollinger Band at roughly 0.27 USDT, indicating a pause in momentum but preserving bullish bias. The MACD histogram is contracting while the MACD and signal lines remain above zero, suggesting momentum is cooling rather than reversing. A decisive break above the upper Bollinger Band near 0.29 USDT could propel HBAR toward 0.30–0.32 USDT, whereas a slip below the middle band would likely retest 0.25 USDT support.

On the daily chart, HBAR has broken out above its 20-day moving average and the upper Bollinger Band following a sustained uptrend from roughly 0.14 to 0.27 USDT, confirming bullish momentum. The RSI is in overbought territory near 76, signaling strength but warning of a potential pullback. On the 4-hour chart price has consolidated between 0.25 and 0.28 USDT above its 20-period SMA, with the MACD histogram flattening yet remaining positive. A clear daily candlestick close above 0.29 USDT would likely lead to a rally toward 0.32 USDT, while a drop below 0.25 USDT risks a retracement to 0.22 USDT support. Is HBAR a good investment? Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.2055. How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $1.30. Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $1.06 and $1.30, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes. Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good, long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.2055 by 2025 and $1.30 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Hedera ranks second in core developer activity with 126 active contributors, indicating strong community interest and potential for innovation and growth. While this supports ecosystem expansion through tools like CLI and AI Studio, true success also depends on user adoption, transaction volume, and addressing concerns like centralization and ecosystem maturity.

In a new note, Meera Chandan, co-head of Global FX Strategy at JPMorgan, says the share of USD has dropped to below 60% at central banks, a two-decade low. The real sign of de-dollarization, or a reduction of dependence on the USD for global trade, can be seen in the gold market, according to the bank. JPM notes a strong trend in gold purchases from competitor economies like China, Russia and Turkey. “The main de-dollarization trend in FX reserves, however, pertains to the growing demand for gold. Seen as an alternative to heavily indebted fiat currencies, the share of gold in FX reserves has increased, led by emerging market (EM) central banks — China, Russia and Türkiye have been the largest buyers in the last decade. Overall, while the share of gold in FX reserves in EM is still low at 9%, the figure is more than double the 4% seen a decade ago; the corresponding share for DM countries is much larger at 20%. This increased demand has in turn partly driven the current bull market in gold, with prices forecast to climb toward $4,000/oz by mid-2026.” JPM also noted a sign of de-dollarization in the bond markets, highlighting that the share of foreign ownership in the Treasury market has been declining continuously for 15 years. The current share of Treasuries owned by foreign entities has dropped to 30% as of early 2025, down from its peak of 50% during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), according to JPMorgan. Says Jay Barry, head of Global Rates Strategy at the bank, “Although foreign demand has not kept pace with the growth of the Treasury market for more than a decade, we must consider what more aggressive action could mean. Japan is the largest foreign creditor and alone holds more than $1.1 trillion in Treasuries, or nearly 4% of the market. Accordingly, any significant foreign selling would be impactful, driving yields higher.” The analyst notes that the dollar’s share in FX reserves was lower in the early 90s, meaning the the move toward other currencies like the euro or the yuan is significant but not yet unprecedented.

To many investors, this level marked a new all-time high (ATH) for the asset. However, not everyone agrees, as many market participants believe its ATH is $3.84. This price is listed as the ATH on CoinMarketCap, as opposed to Coingecko, which lists $3.65 as the new ATH. Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, weighed in on this discrepancy in a recent post on X. Origin of the $3.84 XRP Price ATH Schwartz explained that the frequently cited $3.84 price “comes from averaging in XRP/WON exchange rates at Korean exchanges by converting the Won to USD at an unrealistic exchange rate.” This brings renewed attention to a well-known phenomenon in crypto markets known as the Kimchi Premium. The term refers to the tendency for cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges to trade above global averages because the exchanges use the official Korean Won to USD exchange rates, which don’t reflect real-world prices. That makes crypto prices look higher in USD terms compared to other markets. This debate resurfaced when XRP hit $3.39 in January, and Schwartz explained that no one bought or sold XRP for $3.84 . Although many price-tracking websites still list $3.84 as XRP’s ATH, Schwartz’s comments suggest that this price is misleading. I don't think so. The 3.84 USD price comes from averaging in XRP/WON exchange rates at Korean exchanges by converting the Won to USD at an unrealistic exchange rate. https://t.co/voMP2Mehsz — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 18, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Accurate Benchmarks Going Forward Ripple CTO explained that anyone who bought XRP above $3.3 either paid too much or bought a few days after its price breached that level. He has also previously suggested that the asset’s ATH might be as low as $2.8 . However, most exchanges and other experts agree that it was around $3.36 . XRP’s recent climb to $3.65 now stands as a more credible ATH, backed by cleaner, more consistent pricing data. Unlike the inflated figures pulled from South Korean markets in 2018, this level reflects a broader market consensus and excludes the impact of unrealistic exchange rates. However, this debate may not last long, as experts believe XRP will break the $3.84 soon. In the lead-up to July, analysts predicted big things for XRP , and many still have high expectations for the asset, expecting double-digit prices. Many technical indicators and broader market factors have been building up to this moment, and XRP could smash through the $3.65 ATH and potentially cross $10 before the month ends.

One of the proposed measures will allow authorities to remotely disconnect crypto mining facilities from the grid during periods when demand for electricity is at its highest. Russian government readies tougher rules for miners The Ministry of Energy in Russia has been tasked to finalize regulations for those involved in the extraction of digital currencies, the Interfax news agency reported, following a recent meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers in Moscow. According to a report issued after the meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, the updated rules include introducing greater liability for illegal connection to distribution networks, electricity theft, and violation of imposed mining bans. Furthermore, crypto miners will be added to a new category of consumers of lesser importance, for which the reliability of power supply is far from guaranteed. The energy ministry is now expected to develop “a mechanism for redistributing the released capacity when limiting mining activities in a region in order to connect socially significant consumers to the power grid,” the document detailed. Russia wants to unplug mining farms remotely The Russian government explained that the establishment of the new “fourth” consumer category actually means having the option to “introduce remote restrictions on consumption during peak loads and under threat of energy and capacity shortages.” Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining in 2024 to exploit its competitive advantages, such as cheap and abundant energy. But Moscow was caught unprepared for how quickly miners managed to turn energy surpluses into shortages, prompting Putin to comment: “We were happy we had electricity surpluses in some regions. But they began mining there … We had to make certain decisions.” Speaking at an economic forum this month, the Russian President justified the mining restrictions introduced in certain parts of the country that have been facing increasing power deficits as a result of the rapid growth of the mining industry. In the past few months, mining has been partially or fully banned in a dozen energy-deficient regions, from Siberia to the North Caucasus, and even in occupied Ukraine. Initial temporary restrictions have been expanded to 6-year prohibitions, in some cases. Among other proposals discussed at the government meeting is the idea to introduce mandatory labeling and certification for foreign mining equipment imported into the Russian Federation, the crypto news outlet Bits.media noted in a post on Friday. It comes after Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko unveiled that his department has joined forces with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development to establish a special register for devices used for digital minting. In early July, the official stated: “The register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs.” The revised regulations must be submitted for government approval by the end of the current quarter. Then, federal and local authorities will begin their gradual implementation in regions with active restrictions on the mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Elsewhere, both companies and individual entrepreneurs are allowed to mine as long as they register with the tax authority, but less than a third of mining enterprises have done that. The registration is not mandatory for amateur miners burning less than 6,000 kWh monthly. Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other agencies have been busting illegal crypto farms across the country to limit financial losses for the state and utilities. In June, the Rosseti grid operator said it’s working with telecom companies to hunt down illegal miners by tracking their internet traffic. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Currently trading at $3,505 after recently adding more than $120 billion to its market capitalization, the majority of these capital inflows originated from U.S. spot Ether ETFs, which attracted over $2.18 billion in weekly inflows, pushing total inflows to a record-breaking $7.49 billion .

After that, the real parabolic move will start. pic.twitter.com/9HwU3fwq5p — Ted (@TedPillows) July 5, 2025 Technical Analysis: Ethereum 3+ Years Suppression Targets $4,000 Breakout From a technical perspective, the Ethereum (ETH/USD) daily chart indicates a decisive bullish breakout, with the price advancing above a critical resistance level within the $3,250–$3,500 range. The momentum appears aggressive, fueled by a decisive break of structure (BOS) and a clean bounce from the $2,500 support level, which previously served as a consolidation foundation. Source: TradingView The chart identifies $4,105 as the strong high objective, corresponding with a previous major resistance zone. Nevertheless, the RSI reading of 84.38 indicates deep overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback or consolidation before the trend continues. Should Ethereum maintain levels above the current resistance-turned-support, the upward movement will likely extend toward the $4,100 objective. Failure to sustain this breakout could prompt a retracement toward the $2,950–$3,250 area, where buy-side liquidity might reignite bullish momentum. Best Wallet Raises $14M As 250K Users Ride ETH’s DeFi Wave Ethereum’s success has historically served as a catalyst for rallies in DeFi tokens and altcoins generally.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Stable tokens The narrative On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a crypto bill into law. This is the first time a major cryptocurrency bill has become law, and it likely is not the last. Why it matters For the first time, a major cryptocurrency bill has become law in the U.S. The GENIUS Act, which sets out to create a regulatory framework governing stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset like the U.S. dollar, kickstarts a process that will see the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators become far more involved in the crypto sector. Breaking it down There was a bit of a false start. The House Rules Committee met Monday evening to debate the bills with key members of the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees ahead of a procedural vote, which the House held Tuesday. That procedural vote was expected to sail through, albeit on party-line votes. It did not. Members of the House Freedom Caucus voted against the procedural motion to open debate and threw a wrench into the House's ""Crypto Week."" Later that evening, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that 11 of the holdouts had agreed to vote for the motion and the House reconvened on Wednesday to first vote to hold a redo on the other vote (this one passed mostly along party lines) and then to actually redo the other vote. Many of the 11 holdouts continued to hold out. Trump, in remarks made before signing the GENIUS Act on Friday, joked about this: ""I am so tired of making phone calls at 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning."" Still, after a record-breaking 9+ hour vote, the lawmakers did finally vote in favor of the move to debate, clearing the way to a final vote for the three bills on Thursday. Despite these hiccups, Congressman Bryan Steil noted that Crypto Week largely played out as planned, with three bills getting passed and one heading to the president's desk. ""In the House, it feels like in the home stretch with the narrow majority, there's final negotiations, final discussions,"" he said on CoinDesk TV Thursday ahead of the vote. ""But the good news is the play call that was made at the start of the week is the play call we're executing today, which is passing GENIUS, putting that on the president's desk for his signature into law."" Moreover, while industry participants anticipated that maybe 30 or so Democrats would vote for the bills, the actual numbers dramatically surpassed this — 78 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in voting for Clarity and 102 Democrats/206 Republicans voted for GENIUS. For context, last year's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Clarity's predecessor, saw 78 Democrats and 208 Republicans vote in favor. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, speaking at a press conference after Thursday's votes, was positively giddy at successfully shepherding the bills through in just a matter of months: ""I knew that my target was to beat FIT21 and I made a bet with myself — and I won."" Neither Clarity nor GENIUS are done yet. The next steps for GENIUS belong to the federal regulators tasked with implementing its provisions. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and others will now have to launch the rulemaking process to develop the actual regulations asked for in the law. Clarity's next steps are murkier. The Senate is clearly working on its own bill, at least at the moment — senators have introduced principles and are holding hearings. These actions suggest the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees may do their own thing, rather than adopt Clarity as it is. Hill, in Thursday's press conference, made it clear he hoped the Senate would take Clarity up. And House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn GT Thompson said on CoinDesk TV on Thursday morning that he had been working with his Senate counterparts as it launched its process. Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott previously set a Sept. 30 deadline for moving the Senate's market structure bill, which will govern a far broader swath of the industry.

Tornado Cash Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's criminal trial kicked off this week, with jury selection taking a day and a half and the overall trial now expected to run approximately three weeks. Storm was arrested in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. So far prosecutors have only just begun making their case, beginning with a set of witnesses who say they were victims of Tornado Cash. Prosecutors will be making their case to a largely non-technical jury. Just one member works as an IT manager, while another works at Palantir. The rest have a range of jobs and educational backgrounds. There's also ongoing motions efforts separate from the trial itself, with defense attorneys moving to try and kick out some of the evidence prosecutors have suggested they'll introduce.

ChatGPT has just spotlighted a shortlist of high-potential tokens, and while names like PEPE return with cult-fueled momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly turning heads with explosive upside. Mutuum Finance has already sold more than 80% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. Investors are rushing in at the lowest price MUTM will ever be. The project has raised more than $12.7 million and has attracted more than 13,600 investors. If you’re still wondering what to buy in 2025, this might just be the signal you’ve been waiting for. PEPE Joins the Bull Run: Volume Surges, Traders Take Notice As the 2025 bull run gains steam, PEPE is once again capturing trader attention, not for its fundamentals, but for its role as a sentiment barometer in the meme coin market. Trading at approximately $0.00001332 with a daily volume exceeding $2 billion, PEPE is showing signs of renewed speculative momentum following Ethereum’s recent breakout. While not driven by utility, its historical correlation with market hype makes it a token to watch, especially as meme assets often run ahead of broader altcoin rotations. For those scanning the landscape for early summer movers, PEPE’s current activity may signal broader retail engagement returning to the market, just as more niche players like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly build traction in the background. Growing Momentum and Recognition for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is showing strong progresses, where its Phase 5 presale keeps getting incredible attention. The project is having a commanding presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector by facilitating an expandable financial system with actual use cases. Popularity is also depicted in the interest in investment as it has already paved the ground for on-boarding over 13,600 token holders and raising over $12.7 million worth of investments, which testifies to the willingness of the market to succeed in the long term. Secure the Future of DeFi, Mutuum’s CertiK-Backed Bug Bounty Is Live As a further push towards ensuring its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also announced an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project will reward an amount of $50,000 USDT for those who identify potential points of issue in the program. The role of the bounty program is to provide sufficient coverage across all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is distributed to the four severity classes; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project is the team’s effort towards the security of its ecosystem as well as investors’ confidence. Dual-Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance’s liquidity model allows users to put their assets to complete use, in a decentralized lending process. The double-model framework used on the platform ensures enhanced flexibility and efficiency including Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. More than $12.7 million raised and 13,600+ investors onboard proves that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another DeFi project, it’s becoming a cornerstone of the 2025 bull run. As over 80% of Stage 5 tokens at $0.03 have already been claimed, the window to buy in at the lowest price is rapidly closing. While meme coins like PEPE capture headlines, smart investors are quietly securing positions in projects built for real utility, security, and long-term upside. Momentum is building, this is the signal serious investors have been waiting for. Get in before the next price jump. Claim your MUTM tokens today.

BONK has seen a sharp price rally, gaining traction from large entities, thanks to its burn mechanics and strong user base. Meanwhile, SHIB is hovering near critical support, giving hints of a breakout move on the horizon. At the center of it all is BlockDAG (BDAG) , whose X1 mobile mining app has drawn in over 2 million users by enabling direct mining from smartphones. This hands-on feature, backed by a powerful network foundation, makes BlockDAG one to watch. Let’s explore why it might be the best crypto to buy this year. BONK Price Signal: Explosive Moves and Strong Fundamentals BONK is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about memecoins, and for good reason. Its recent 10% price jump has turned heads, especially with Grayscale adding it to their asset watchlist. The coin’s chart is flashing green too, with a bullish golden cross pattern suggesting further upside. BONK’s next deflationary burn event is fueling speculation of increased scarcity, and with a growing holder base, its long-term prospects are getting stronger. Even during recent market dips, BONK surged 22%, showcasing resilience. Combined with active trading volumes and massive community energy, BONK is proving to be one of the most promising plays for quick gains and sustained growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction: A Breakout Could Be Coming Shiba Inu (SHIB) is sitting at a key price point of $0.00001296, close to a strong support zone. It has been consolidating in a symmetrical triangle, which often signals that a major price movement is on the way. Analysts are watching this closely, as volatility continues to compress and selling pressure eases. SHIB’s circulating supply is mostly released, keeping inflation risk low and strengthening long-term valuation. While short-term sentiment remains mixed, important support near $0.00001200 and tight price action suggest a big move is brewing. The $0.00001200–$0.00001300 range will be crucial in predicting SHIB’s next rally. Over 2M Users Choose BlockDAG’s X1 App for Easy Mobile Mining BlockDAG is capturing serious attention with its X1 mobile app , a mining tool that’s already pulled in more than 2 million users on iOS and Android. Users can earn up to 20 BDAG coins daily with just their smartphone, no extra equipment needed. Weighing only 50MB, the app works on most devices and rewards users with its Proof-of-Engagement algorithm, which incentivizes daily participation. This makes mining fun, fast, and simple, even for beginners. For those aiming for bigger returns, BlockDAG also offers high-performance rigs like the X10, X30, and X100, capable of mining up to 2,000 BDAG per day. On the technical side, BlockDAG’s blockchain aims to handle over 100 blocks per second, combining scalability and decentralization. With $343 million raised and 24 billion coins already sold, BlockDAG has delivered a massive 2,660% ROI between Batch 1 and Batch 29. Buyers can still access the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016. With the projected listing at $0.05, this opens the door to potential returns of 3,025%. Whether it’s the seamless user experience or serious mining power, BlockDAG is shaking up the game and proving itself as more than just hype, it’s a real contender for the best crypto to buy right now. Final Thoughts This year, BONK, SHIB, and BlockDAG each bring something different to the table. BONK is generating buzz with its burn mechanism and upward momentum. SHIB is stabilizing and may be ready to break out soon. Still, BlockDAG is clearly separating from the pack. With over 2 million users already mining on its X1 app and a system built for speed and scalability, it’s positioned for massive adoption. Combined with a powerful ROI and GLOBAL LAUNCH release price, BlockDAG makes a strong case as the best crypto to buy in 2025.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack is funding private security patrols in Bedford to address rising crime. McCormack cites police inaction and growing issues like harassment and shoplifting harming local businesses. Legal experts warn that vigilantism is illegal in the UK. Frustrated by what he calls the police’s failure to protect the community, McCormack is personally funding a pilot initiative deploying ten security guards to patrol the town center every Saturday. In a post on X , McCormack said, “If the police won’t keep the town safe for our women and children, I will.” Rising Crime in Bedford Sparks Business Closures McCormack said his concerns center on a surge in crime, including aggressive begging, shoplifting, and harassment, which he says have driven shoppers away, forced stores to close, and left families feeling unsafe. The Bedford-based entrepreneur and football club owner claims he issued a warning to local police before launching his plan, criticizing them for not addressing these issues. Bedford, a town of around 185,800 residents located less than two hours from London, has seen McCormack become a vocal advocate for community safety. Alongside his business ventures, he runs Real Bedford FC, a football club famously dubbed the “Bitcoin soccer team,” backed by investments from Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. McCormack has engaged local residents by surveying them about crime and has called for community meetings to build support for his security project. Announcing my private security pilot for Bedford Town Centre – – – – – – – – – – – Starting this August, I’m personally funding a pilot project to provide private security in Bedford. Every Saturday, 10 guards will patrol the town centre and oversee safe parking at Lurke… — Peter McCormack (@PeterMcCormack) July 18, 2025 Despite the initiative’s ambition, legal questions remain around how these private security personnel will operate in public spaces. Vigilantism is illegal in the UK, and experts from JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors caution that such efforts must stay within legal boundaries. It is suggested that the guards may function more as informants, gathering video evidence to assist police investigations, similar to the growing trend of traffic vigilantes in the country. While the concept of privately funded security patrols might seem unconventional, it reflects a broader trend in areas facing police shortages. Lieutenant Eric J. Altorfer of the San Francisco Police Department noted earlier this year that private security increasingly fills gaps left by understaffed law enforcement agencies. However, Altorfer emphasized the importance of clear collaboration between private security firms and public police to ensure accountability and effectiveness. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnappings. The rise in inquiries came after a spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnapping attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

Instead of isolating China, it’s now giving Beijing and New Delhi a reason to cooperate. According to Bloomberg, tensions between the U.S. and the two biggest economies in Asia are forcing India and China to look past years of mistrust and start exploring economic options together. This week, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng used a very deliberate metaphor. He said it was time for a “dragon-elephant tango,” a pitch for closer ties between China and India. China and India, who fought deadly border battles in 2020 and have clashed for decades over issues like Kashmir and influence in the Global South, are being pushed into dialogue again. And Trump is the reason the music is playing. Modi and Xi open talks as rare earths and Russian oil complicate trade Since they became modern states in the late 1940s, India and China have taken turns being either uneasy neighbors or outright enemies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping still can’t agree on Beijing’s support for Pakistan, and both want to be seen as the voice of the Global South. But when it comes to making and exporting stuff, both sides are under pressure. Modi has watched China’s rise with a mix of caution and frustration. China built up its factories by combining cheap labor with imported technologies, then flooded global markets. India, still struggling to become a global manufacturing hub, is trying to figure out how to catch up. Modi’s top economic adviser argued in 2023 that India should bring in more Chinese investment to help build its factories and sell goods to the U.S. Indian economists have even said publicly that China might be India’s “natural partner.” Meanwhile, Xi knows India’s population and market size matter. Beijing wants to sell more cars, solar panels, and electronics, and India has the demand. But China also wants to make sure India doesn’t do to them what they did to the U.S.: dominate manufacturing and drive competitors out. There are clear frictions. On July 14, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing. Jaishankar urged Wang to avoid “restrictive trade measures and roadblocks,” a swipe at Beijing’s new controls on rare earth exports. Wang answered by calling for more “communication and coordination” to keep supply chains stable. The next day, Jaishankar met with Xi himself, a rare meeting that sent a very clear message about China’s priorities. Trump targets Russian oil deals, drags BRICS closer together At the same time, Trump is turning up the heat again. His latest threat? “Secondary tariffs” on any country that buys oil from Russia. India and China are at the top of that list. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, both have been buying discounted Russian crude and refusing to criticize President Vladimir Putin. They’re also still active BRICS members. Trump’s threat wasn’t specific, but trade experts are warning that it could blow up in Washington’s face. If enforced, it might push BRICS nations into even tighter economic cooperation, just to protect themselves from U.S. pressure. And if that happens, China and India — despite their differences — might find common ground simply to avoid getting boxed in by Trump’s policies. There’s already tension over what counts as “Made in India.” The U.S. wants at least 60% of a product’s value to be added locally before it gets that label. India says 35% should be enough. That percentage matters because the higher it goes, the more it cuts China out of India’s supply chains. And yet, India still needs China’s machines and parts to hit its export goals. China also needs India. It’s dealing with shrinking demand at home and needs new markets. India’s 1.4 billion people offer a chance to offload excess production, not just in electronics and vehicles, but in entire industrial sectors. The fact that both sides are talking now, despite a rocky past, shows just how much pressure they’re under. It’s not that they suddenly trust each other. They don’t. But there’s no deep hatred between them like there is between China and Japan. They have history, sure, but it’s not nuclear-level animosity. That makes economic talks possible, even if they’re awkward. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Block, founded by Jack Dorsey, will be included in the index, replacing energy giant Hess Corp. The change follows Chevron's $53 billion acquisition of Hess and will take effect before the market opens on July 23. Following the news, Block shares rose 14% in after-hours trading. Inclusion in a major U.S. stock market index like the S&P 500 increases a company's visibility and is becoming increasingly important with the growth of passive investment funds. Companies excluded from the index may face selling pressure as funds linked to the index reshuffle their portfolios. Related News: Advisor to the US Treasury Secretary Joe Lavorgna Makes Important Statements About the Future of Cryptocurrencies Changes to the S&P 500 typically occur during quarterly rebalancing. However, in special circumstances, such as large acquisitions, there can be changes outside the index. Last week, monitoring software company Datadog was added to the index, replacing Juniper Networks. Block's addition to the index further strengthens the S&P 500's tech bias. Known as Square and continuing its growth with payment terminals, the company has expanded into cryptocurrency, lending, and other financial services over the years, changing its name to Block. *This is not investment advice.

Tom Lee Says Corporate Treasuries Could Make It Happen,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ethereum-at-30k-tom-lee-says-corporate-treasuries-could-make-it-happen,"Tom Lee is making bold calls again—this time, putting Ethereum in the spotlight. He says if companies follow MicroStrategy’s game plan and use their balance sheets to buy ETH with stock and debt, a $30,000 Ethereum isn't just a dream—it’s a math equation. BitMine, SharpLink, and Bit Digital have already scooped up over 682,000 ETH , and they’re not done. BitMine alone wants to control 5% of Ethereum’s entire supply. In just a week, they reportedly bought more ETH than MicroStrategy did in its first Bitcoin round back in 2020. SharpLink, backed by ETH co-founder Joseph Lubin, boosted its SEC filing from $1B to $6B—clearly aiming to keep buying. Bit Digital sold stock and BTC to grab over 100,000 ETH. Lee’s point? MicroStrategy’s massive stock run—35x since 2020—wasn’t just about Bitcoin going up. Only about a third of it came from BTC’s rise. The rest? Their financial strategy. By issuing shares and taking on debt, they accelerated their BTC buys—and investors rewarded that with a skyrocketing stock price. Lee thinks Ethereum is even better suited for this playbook. Why? Because ETH’s volatility can actually help reduce borrowing costs. Plus, companies can use convertible notes and preferred shares to buy ETH without diluting shareholders too much. This creates what Lee calls a ""reflexive loop"": higher ETH buys push up the stock price, which lets companies raise more cash, to buy even more ETH , and so on. That speeds up price discovery—and compresses time. Unlike MicroStrategy, which took years, these ETH-heavy firms are moving billions in just weeks. ETH sits around $3,600 today. If Lee’s right, $30K might not be crazy—it might just be good math.",,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-19 15:25:26
48541769,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74872,1752939030,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Says XRP Will Retire Your Bloodline. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-will-retire-your-bloodline-heres-why/,"A pseudonymous crypto enthusiast, Subjective Views, recently made a bold statement on X, declaring that XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, will retire many bloodlines in the current bull run. The remark underscores their confidence in XRP’s long-term value and its potential to deliver significant generational wealth. To support this bold view, Subjective Views pointed to the credibility and insight of Sheila Warren, a recognized figure in blockchain policy and advocacy. Sheila Warren’s Background and Support for Ripple Subjective Views highlighted Warren’s career achievements to reinforce their perspective on XRP. Sheila Warren previously served as the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, an organization that advocates for responsible blockchain and cryptocurrency development. Notably, in 2022, during her tenure at the Crypto Council, the organization filed an amicus curiae brief in favor of Ripple. That filing opposed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) motion for summary judgment in its high-profile lawsuit against Ripple . The brief was interpreted by many in the digital asset community as an informed and credible stance supporting Ripple’s position that XRP should not be classified as a security. Warren also held a senior leadership role at the World Economic Forum (WEF) as the Head of Data, Blockchain, and Digital Assets. Her work at the WEF involved examining how blockchain and related technologies could be integrated into the global financial system and how these innovations might evolve responsibly under regulatory scrutiny. I'm known for going out on a limb, so I'll say this… $XRP will retire your bloodline. Sheila Warren was the previous CEO at Crypto Council for Innovation. In 2022, they filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Ripple and in opposition to the SEC’s motion for summary… pic.twitter.com/66Xzll0pD3 — Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews) July 19, 2025 Warren’s Perspective on Crypto Market Dynamics Alongside the tweet, Subjective Views shared a video clip of Sheila Warren offering her thoughts on the current and future state of the crypto markets. In the interview, Warren expressed a view that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is becoming increasingly embedded within traditional financial systems. She suggested that this integration will continue gradually over time, making digital assets a normalized component of global finance. When asked about volatility and the risks that investors face, Warren acknowledged the volatility in altcoins and emphasized that investment decisions depend heavily on individual risk appetite. She categorized Ethereum as the “granddaddy altcoin” and observed that, over time, another altcoin may emerge to lead its segment, potentially stabilizing much like Bitcoin has in its category. Importantly, she noted a trend of quiet accumulation in altcoins, where institutional and individual investors enter the market discreetly before eventually making their positions public, a pattern previously seen with Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP Investors Subjective Views’ statement that XRP “will retire your bloodline” reflects their belief that XRP could be among the altcoins Warren alluded to as potential long-term leaders. By citing Warren’s credentials and her comments on how investors are gradually positioning themselves in altcoins despite volatility, Subjective Views suggested that XRP holds the kind of promise that could yield transformative wealth over generations. The argument rests on both the legal support Ripple has garnered from credible organizations and the broader trend Warren described of blockchain integration into established financial frameworks. As the regulatory environment and institutional adoption continue to evolve, investors will likely watch closely for signs of whether XRP can fulfill the generational potential that Subjective Views envisions.

But investors clearly aren’t impressed. Despite blowout results in banking, tech, consumer goods, and travel, the stock market is barely reacting, and in many cases, it’s punishing anything short of perfection. This is all happening while the S&P 500 sits near record highs, closing Friday after logging seven new all-time highs in just fifteen trading days. According to Bloomberg, valuations are sky-high, and the market has already baked in most of the optimism. One of the loudest examples came from the financial sector. Goldman Sachs posted the biggest equity trading revenue in Wall Street history. Morgan Stanley beat net revenue forecasts. JPMorgan Chase had its best second quarter for stock trading ever, with fixed-income trading blowing past expectations. None of it mattered. Goldman’s shares barely moved. Morgan Stanley closed down 1.3%. JPMorgan fell 0.7%. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper said, “Financials have crushed 2Q earnings expectations with a 94.4% beat rate so far, yet stocks saw only muted reactions as investors largely anticipated the results.” Wall Street ignores beats and punishes misses The same cold shoulder showed up in other sectors. Netflix beat every major metric and still lost over 5% by the end of Friday. United Airlines was optimistic about travel demand picking up, but again, no boost. Investors aren’t looking for good. They want exceptional, unexpected, and forward-looking. “With stock valuations where they are, all the good news is priced into the market now,” said Greg Taylor, Chief Investment Officer at PenderFund Capital Management. And if a company stumbles? The market is showing no mercy. The gap between how investors treat misses versus beats is the biggest it’s been in nearly three years, based on Bloomberg Intelligence numbers. “The margin of error here is small,” said Michael Arone, Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Investment Management. “When the valuations are high and you miss, the punishment is more severe.” Source: Bloomberg Even companies that hit on both profit and revenue are getting lukewarm applause. The only real winners this quarter in terms of share price were PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines, both of which had been lagging the market before their reports. Their stronger-than-expected numbers finally pushed shares higher. Most others weren’t so lucky. There’s not much optimism about broad stock market movement either. “At an index level, good earnings are not likely the broad market catalyst investors are waiting for,” said Julian Emanuel, Chief Equity and Quantitative Strategist at Evercore ISI. Consumer spending keeps results alive but doesn’t excite traders Consumer strength is still holding up across sectors, which is probably the only reason earnings haven’t been worse. But it’s not lighting a fire under investors either. Mark Malek, Chief Investment Officer at Siebert, said : “Banks can only be healthy when the economy is strong. So their earnings along with their commentary serve as a broader benchmark on economic health.” That benchmark still looks solid. Companies from PepsiCo to Levi Strauss, Delta, and Netflix all showed that demand is there. Even with high inflation and sticky interest rates, people are still spending. Retail numbers released Thursday backed that up. The Commerce Department reported a 0.6% increase in retail purchases last month. That came after two straight months of declines and beat nearly every forecast polled by Bloomberg. But the calm doesn’t mean investors aren’t nervous. Next week’s earnings calendar is packed with heavyweight names including Alphabet, Tesla, Honeywell, Dow, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Motors. With expectations already sky-high, the risk of being punished for anything less than spectacular is rising. What’s making it worse is that analysts already slashed expectations before the quarter even started. Back in January, earnings growth for the S&P 500 was pegged at 9.5%. By Friday, that number had collapsed to 3.3%. So that’s the picture right now: great numbers, weak reactions, brutal punishment for slips, and high expectations moving forward. And with Trump’s trade rules still casting a shadow, everyone’s wondering who’s going to take the hit from tariffs next.

Svenson tells his 83,500 YouTube subscribers that the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to determine overbought or oversold conditions, is flashing a signal on the daily time frame that has previously preceded massive rallies such as in October of 2023, February of 2024 and November of 2024. “Bitcoin’s daily RSI is attempting to bounce off of the overbought zone. Which, in my book, when you break out and you enter overbought, that is oftentimes can be a very bullish signal. Contrary to what most people would assume, they think that overbought is always bad.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X The RSI indicator is calibrated from zero to 100, with readings of zero to 30 indicating oversold conditions and readings of above 70 indicating overbought conditions. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could go up by nearly 20% from the current level in a few months to hit the cycle peak. “Bitcoin right now breaking above this resistance ($112,000) into the overbought zone. It usually signals major momentum… I’m aiming for something around $142,000 for this run. You know, that’s a multi-month target. I’m not saying it’s going to happen necessarily in a month. I think that’ll happen anywhere from, you know, a couple months to around October of this year… The Bitcoin halving cycle profit shows that 80 weeks after the halving is the usual start of the bear market, which in this cycle is going to be landing us around end of October.” Bitcoin is trading at $118,994 at time of writing.

This surge has sparked interest in the crypto community, leading many to wonder which DeFi coins are poised to follow suit. Explore the potential winners in the next wave of growth and stay ahead in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance. Stellar (XLM): Recent Climbs and Steady Mid-Term Growth Over the past week, Stellar surged by nearly 30%. The coin experienced about 85.5% growth in the last month, reflecting strong short-term momentum. However, over a six-month span, the growth was a modest 8.2%, indicating a period of consolidation after rapid gains. Price movements have been lively, showing that short-term dynamics are stronger than the longer-term trend. Currently, Stellar trades between $0.21 and $0.28, with resistance at $0.31 and $0.38. Support levels are found at $0.18, with further backing near $0.11. The relative strength index of 74.44 indicates that bulls are in control, but caution is warranted due to overbought conditions. No clear long-term trend is evident, suggesting trading strategies should focus on these key levels. Buying opportunities may arise near support, aiming for gains at immediate resistance. Monitoring indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at 0.170 and the Momentum Indicator at 0.178 is crucial for refining trades. Hyperliquid Price Patterns and Key Trading Levels Hyperliquid showed a steady performance with gains around 13% over the past month and a striking increase of about 118% over six months. A one-week decline of nearly 4% indicates short-term corrections amid solid long-term strength. The price action reflects significant upward movement while also encountering moments of pullback. The extended surge over six months contrasts with recent volatility, setting the stage for potential future moves. Rising momentum over half a year and minor adjustments in a one-week window signal a coin steadily improving its market position through phases of repricing. The current trading scenario places Hyperliquid in a defined range with a base between approximately $31 and $47. Immediate resistance exists near $54 while support holds at roughly $24. A second level of resistance is noted near $69, and a lower support level is around $9. Bulls have pushed prices upward into a range supported by an RSI above 50 and positive momentum readings. However, the recent decline and slight negative oscillator hint at caution among sellers. Trading ideas suggest looking for buying opportunities near support levels, while a sustained move above the immediate resistance could bolster the bullish case. The market reflects a balance between buying pressure and corrective selling within established price bands. AAVE Price Action: Strong Monthly Surge with Steady Six-Month Trends Aave recorded a 22.35% rise over the past month, while its six-month increase settled at 2.82%. A weekly boost of 6.38% underscores a period marked by brisk buying activity that contrasts with a broader, more measured longer-term build. Price movements have been energetic in the short term, reflecting renewed buyer interest, yet a gradual longer-term advance hints at underlying market caution. This behavior provides traders with clear signals to keep an eye on rapid gains alongside challenges in sustaining long, sweeping trends. Current trading lies between $216.95 and $328.68, framed by immediate support at $159.46 and resistance at $382.91, with a second resistance level at $494.63. Bulls are pushing prices upward toward the resistance zone, yet any dip toward lower support could trigger a retreat. The RSI reading of 60.86 indicates that momentum is on the upswing without reaching overbought levels. Traders may consider buying on dips within these key levels, setting protective stops just beneath support, and taking profits near resistance levels to capitalize on the coin’s active price range. Conclusion The rise of Stellar (XLM) to $0.50 following PayPal integration marks a significant achievement. This momentum highlights potential for other DeFi coins to surge. HYPE and AAVE stand out with strong developmental progress and increasing user adoption. These factors suggest that these coins are well-positioned for the next upward movement in the market.

Currently priced at $0.0014 in Stage 5 of its presale, the project is up 40% from its initial stage. Already 2.14x below its confirmed listing price of $0.003, the upside is baked in. Over $5.9 million has been raised and 4.8 billion tokens sold out. Analysts watching this trend closely suggest post-listing moves toward even $0.20. Stage 4 sold out at speed, and Stage 5 is following suit. Timing here could be everything. From Peak to Pivot: Bitcoin’s Role in the Rotation Bitcoin is currently trading above $118,700, having recently reached a new all-time high amid continued ETF inflows and broad macro support. For some early investors, including the trader who reportedly entered around the $16,000 level in late 2022, this marks a full market cycle, turning strategic accumulation into a realized gain of over $114 million. Now, instead of doubling down, that capital is rotating into higher-upside opportunities with favorable tokenomics and early-stage momentum. The move toward Little Pepe, an EVM-based Layer-2 asset currently in Stage 5 of its presale, highlights a broader trend, using profits from mature assets like BTC to seek exponential returns elsewhere. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Presale Stage 5 in Full Swing Stage 5 of the Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale is now live, and interest continues to climb. Built on a Layer 2 network focused on digital community culture, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers fast transactions, low fees, and a unique Launchpad designed to back emerging, community-driven tokens. The current presale price remains at $0.0014, with over $5.8 million already raised. $777,000 Giveaway Driving Participation To fuel engagement, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has launched a $777,000 giveaway. Anyone who contributes $100 or more during the presale and completes a few simple steps is eligible to win one of ten prizes, each worth $77,000 in tokens. Meanwhile, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has secured high-ranking positions on CoinMarketCap, reflecting the growing attention it’s receiving. Further strengthening its reputation, the project recently passed a smart contract audit from Freshcoin.io with a score of 81.55/100. With Stage 4 completed ahead of schedule and the price still holding at $0.0014, interest continues to grow. Strong Progress as Stage 5 Accelerates Momentum hasn’t slowed, Stage 5 is advancing quickly. Investor activity is rising, key listings are on the way, and the ongoing giveaway continues to bring in new backers. After turning a $16K Bitcoin (BTC) entry into $114 million, one of crypto’s most successful traders is shifting focus to the next big opportunity, Little Pepe (LILPEPE). This EVM Layer-2 token, now in Stage 5 of its presale at just $0.0014, is catching serious attention with over $5.9 million raised and 4.8 billion tokens sold. The confirmed listing price of $0.003 guarantees an instant 2.14x return, but top analysts are already forecasting post-launch targets as high as $0.02, a staggering 100,000% upside.

With talks of a possible XRP ETF, Ripple’s IPO, and the end of its battle with the SEC , many wonder if XRP could reach $10 or more this year. In a new video , crypto analyst VirtualBacon breaks down what’s really happening, what’s driving the buzz, and where XRP could be headed next. XRP Beats Bitcoin in Online Searches He points out that XRP has now become the most searched crypto on both Google and YouTube, even more than Bitcoin and Ethereum. This shows a big jump in interest from the public. Many people are curious about what’s next for XRP, which could be a sign of growing momentum before a major move. According to crypto analyst Kyle Chassé, XRP is set for a major breakout. XRP has already outperformed Bitcoin by triple digits, without a US ETF, treasury adoption, or DeFi yield. What’s Brewing Inside? A recent report from the CME Group, a big name in traditional finance, gives XRP some serious credit. It confirms XRP’s price moves are just as active as other big cryptos like Ethereum and Solana, but what’s more important is that XRP doesn’t move in sync with Bitcoin or the stock market. That makes it stand out. For big investors looking for variety in their portfolios, XRP now looks more attractive. The report also touches on XRP’s controversial token supply. But according to the analyst, Ripple is following its plan to release tokens slowly over the next 10 to 13 years. As long as they stick to this, the supply won’t flood the market. This gives investors more confidence that XRP’s price won’t be dragged down by unexpected token releases. Can XRP Hit $10 This Year? However, Analyst gives a realistic price target of $4.50 to $5 by the end of this year, assuming Bitcoin hits $140K . He says this is very possible if XRP continues to gain attention and if Bitcoin starts its next big rally. As for $10, it’s not impossible, but it may only happen later in the cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will XRP Price Hit $4 After Ripple vs SEC Officially Ends? , Why $20 XRP Is Unrealistic This Cycle While some XRP supporters dream of a $20 price tag, Analyst strongly warns against such expectations. He explains that during the 2017 bull run, when XRP reached its all-time high , there were far fewer competing altcoins in the market. Today, XRP faces competition from Solana, BNB, Cardano, AI, and gaming tokens, and even stablecoins. For XRP to reach $20, it would need to reclaim a 23% market dominance, the level it had in 2017. Given the explosion of crypto sectors and narratives, this is nearly impossible in today’s market structure. Overall he emphasizes that while a momentary kick to $20 during peak euphoria is possible, such a price wouldn’t be sustainable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin and Ethereum have led the charge with fresh highs, but the spotlight is now shifting toward next-generation platforms that offer real utility—especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. One of the names climbing rapidly up that list is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol that’s building momentum at an impressive pace. The $4 Trillion Moment On July 18, the total crypto market cap officially crossed the $4 trillion mark, fueled by significant gains across Ethereum, XRP, and broader altcoin sectors. This surge has been amplified by a wave of institutional inflows, increasing adoption of crypto ETFs, and favorable regulatory developments in the U.S. The passage of key legislation has boosted investor confidence, signaling that digital assets are becoming a mainstream part of global finance. This level of market growth creates a strong backdrop for new and emerging cryptocurrencies that are positioned to benefit from broader liquidity and shifting investor attention. As traders search for the next big cryptocurrency, projects like Mutuum Finance are standing out—not with hype, but with substance. Why Attention Is Turning to MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized protocol designed for lending and borrowing digital assets, with built-in mechanisms for passive earnings, real-time rate adjustments, and smart-contract-driven security. In contrast to hype-driven tokens, Mutuum delivers real utility—something that’s clearly resonating with buyers looking beyond short-term speculation. Now well into Phase 5 of its presale, more than 80% of the tokens in this round have already been secured. The current price remains at $0.03, but with Phase 6 on the horizon—bringing a price jump to $0.035—investors are moving quickly to lock in their allocation before the next increase. Fast-Selling Presale & Whale Activity Over the last 24 hours alone, investors have contributed more than $200,000 to Mutuum’s ongoing presale, signaling growing interest as momentum builds. Several large wallet addresses—commonly known as crypto whales—have been seen making substantial purchases, signaling confidence from experienced players in the space. This surge in activity is further amplifying the sense of urgency among investors who don’t want to miss out on what’s shaping up to be one of the most watched presales this quarter. To put this in perspective, anyone buying MUTM at the current price of $0.03 will see their investment grow 100% by the time the token reaches its launch price of $0.06. That alone is a strong incentive, but the upside doesn’t stop there. For example, a $2,400 investment now could realistically grow in value to over $48,000 when MUTM reaches $0.50 post-launch—a figure many believe is attainable based on the project’s roadmap, token utility, and development progress. That represents a 15x gain, and it’s not just based on speculation. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works At its core, Mutuum operates as a non-custodial lending protocol. Participants have the option to either deposit crypto assets to generate yield or access loans by securing them with collateral that exceeds the borrowed amount. Depositors receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that represent their share in the liquidity pool and increase in redeemable value over time. Borrowers can choose between variable or fixed rates and repay on their own timeline, as long as their collateral maintains safe levels. This structure creates flexibility and transparency, making the protocol attractive to both passive earners and active traders. MUTM’s design doesn’t rely on inflationary rewards or unsustainable tokenomics. Instead, it uses a buy-and-redistribute model: protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market, then redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This creates consistent demand without diluting token value. Strong Development and Certik Audit Beyond strong tokenomics, Mutuum’s team is actively working on launching a beta version of the platform around the same time as the token goes live. That means investors won’t be waiting long to see utility in action. This focus on timely delivery is a strong trust signal for early participants. Mutuum Finance has also completed its CertiK audit, achieving a top-tier score of 95, which adds another layer of confidence for those looking to avoid projects without proper security review. Combine that with a well-paced presale and transparent roadmap, and it’s no surprise that demand for MUTM continues to accelerate. With the crypto market heating up and the $4 trillion milestone already here, attention is rapidly shifting toward projects that are still early—but not for long. Mutuum Finance sits right at that intersection: credible, well-structured, and already gathering serious traction. The presale is moving quickly, with over 80% of Phase 5 already sold and the next price increase just around the corner. If you’re looking for the best cryptocurrency to buy now before the next leg up, MUTM may be your best shot at early gains—without chasing hype.

After reaching its all-time high of around $122,800, the premier cryptocurrency has succumbed to a sobering wave of bearish pressure in the past few days. This recent wave of downward pressure was precipitated by the movement of a Satoshi-era whale on Thursday, July 17. However, the Bitcoin price never seemed likely to cross the $123,000 level, and a prominent on-chain expert on X has explained why. Is The Move To $143,000 Still Possible? In a recent post on the social media platform X, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson explained why the price of BTC failed to break the $123,000 level during its rally to a new all-time high in the past week. According to the crypto expert, this seeming loss of momentum could spell danger for the market leader in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Long-Term Holders Sell As Short-Term Buyers Step In – Sign Of Rally Exhaustion? The rationale behind this prediction is that the $123,000 region (or more precisely, $123,370) is the second Alpha Price level for the Bitcoin price. For context, the Alpha Price is a powerful on-chain indicator that uses several key metrics to estimate where the BTC price is likely to find support or resistance. In essence, the Alpha Price is a level that the price of Bitcoin needs to breach and stay above to enter the next significant phase of the bull cycle. “It begins by calculating the market’s age in days and uses that to derive the average market cap—essentially the historical valuation baseline,” Wedson added about the indicator. As shown in the chart above, the Alpha Price indicator has multiple threshold levels, which behave like pressure regions. These thresholds reflect zones where investor sentiment is likely to shift; lower levels act as supports because investors often buy to defend their positions, while upper levels signal increased selling pressure due to profit taking. Wedson noted that the Bitcoin price failing to breach the second Alpha Price level doesn’t imply that the market top is in. However, the $123,370 region is a clear resistance zone, and the BTC price might need to face some pullback before climbing to new highs. Wedson also mentioned that the Alpha Price level will update on Saturday, July 19, as it’s dynamically adjusted based on real-time on-chain transaction flows. Nevertheless, if the Bitcoin price does break this level, a move to above $143,000 could still be on the cards. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,610, reflecting an over 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Whales?

The issue was caused by a server compromise, but was quickly contained by isolating the affected internal account. Since this account is separate from customer wallets, the impact was limited. He also shared that trading and INR withdrawals continue to function normally, and losses are being fully absorbed by CoinDCX’s own treasury. Sumit said their team is working with cybersecurity experts to fix the issue, recover funds, and launch a bug bounty program to improve security. He promised to keep the community updated and stressed the importance of staying transparent during incidents like this.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-19 16:06:47

After nearly four months of silence, it just incinerated 24.066 million DYDX tokens. That equals roughly $15.7 million. The transaction hit Etherscan at 13:13 UTC today. So far, the burn tally sits at 123 million DYDX—about $79.42 million removed from circulation. This ritual isn’t random. It’s a core piece of dYdX’s deflationary playbook. Since March, the Rewards Treasury wallet lay quiet. No burns. No transfers. Just waiting. Now, in one decisive move, it shrinks the floating supply by another 24 million tokens. Each transaction like this tightens tokenomics. It signals conviction. And it raises eyebrows across DeFi. Key Metrics at a Glance DYDX Price: $0.6441 Market Cap: $485.3 million Circulating Supply: 753.4 million DYDX Those figures come straight from CoinMarketCap at the time of writing this line. Buybacks Fuel the Fire Burns are only half the story. Since March, the dYdX Chain has funneled $1.88 million of protocol fees into repurchasing DYDX tokens. That effort scooped up 2.87 million DYDX, now staked with network validators. Revenue → Buyback: Turns fees into token demand. Buyback → Stake: Strengthens network security. It’s a two‑step move. First, the protocol uses trading-fee revenue to fuel on‑chain buybacks. Then, instead of parking tokens in a treasury, it stakes them—locking them up to power node operations. This cycle creates a positive feedback loop: as fees rise, more tokens get bought and staked. As staking grows, network health improves. Crypto watchers are taking note. On X (formerly Twitter), @WuBlockchain flagged today’s burn as “a major deflationary milestone” that underscores dYdX’s evolving tokenomics. According to Etherscan, after nearly four months of inactivity, dYdX: Rewards Treasury burned 24.066 million DYDX tokens today at 13:13, worth approximately $15.7 million. To date, around 123 million DYDX tokens have been burned, with a total burn value of approximately $79.42… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 19, 2025 Meanwhile, @esatoshiclub praised the move as “one of the most impactful tokenomic actions in the space,” lauding dYdX for “consistent, revenue-driven execution.” Why dYdX Burn Matters 1. Supply Deflation: Each burn permanently cuts circulating DYDX. 2. Network Backing: Staked tokens fortify consensus and security. 3. Market Confidence: Demonstrates disciplined treasury management. In DeFi, tokenomics can make or break a protocol. High emissions spark growth but risk price pressure. Deflationary burns counter that. By pairing burns with buyback‑and‑stake cycles, dYdX aims to deliver a sustainable model: drip‑feed rewards but remove a chunk of supply. The @dYdX Chain has used $1.88 million in protocol fees to buy back and stake 2.87 million $DYDX tokens since March. The program uses revenue to support the network by staking with validators. pic.twitter.com/S4sEgv3lgN — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) July 18, 2025 DYDX’s broader vision extends beyond episodic burns. The team plans periodic reviews of protocol revenues. As trading volume ebbs and flows, so will the buyback‑and‑stake cadence. Stakeholders can expect future burns whenever fees cross certain thresholds. Critics may point out that burns alone don’t guarantee price appreciation. Demand still matters. But by locking tokens with validators, dYdX isn’t just burning; it’s building. Validators earn rewards, secure the chain, and align incentives. For now, the numbers speak loudest: 123 million tokens out of a 1 billion max supply—over 12% removed. At today’s price of $0.6441, that’s $79.4 million of market value destroyed. Whether the market bids the price up next is uncertain. But on‑chain, the deflation engine is roaring back to life. And the stage is set for the next phase of dYdX’s Layer 1 journey.

This surprising projection shines a spotlight on XYZVerse as a possible breakout in the market. Readers may be curious about what sets XYZVerse apart and why it’s capturing expert attention. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain with Tokenized Assets Ondo Finance combines traditional finance with blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This approach makes high-grade financial products more accessible and uses blockchain to improve financial infrastructure. The platform has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products, and a technology arm that develops decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This structure enhances the functionality and scalability of Ondo’s financial offerings. Ondo works with established partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody, focusing on security and compliance. Its product USDY is a stablecoin backed by US Treasuries and bank demand deposits, offering both yield and stability. By setting high transparency and disclosure standards, Ondo aims to build trust in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The ONDO token reflects the platform’s effort to integrate traditional financial assets into the blockchain ecosystem. In the current market cycle, the coin’s emphasis on regulated and transparent financial products may appeal to investors looking for stability in crypto investments. Pi Network: Mobile Cryptocurrency Mining for Accessible Digital Currency Pi Network is a mobile-based cryptocurrency that lets users mine Pi coins without specialized hardware. Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, it aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to a wider audience. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining, Pi coins are earned by verifying daily presence on the app, making it energy-efficient and not draining mobile batteries. The network uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, where users nominate trusted contacts to build a network of verified members that secure the network without massive computing power. Pi Network offers potential through its decentralized and energy-efficient approach to cryptocurrency. By encouraging user participation via daily check-ins and trusted networks, it aims to create a secure and scalable digital currency ecosystem. During its current “enclosed” Mainnet phase, users must complete know your customer verification to transfer mined Pi to the blockchain. The planned “open network” phase will allow full external connectivity, which may increase its utility and adoption. In the current market cycle, Pi’s focus on accessibility and community-driven growth could make it an interesting project, though its attractiveness depends on successful implementation and acceptance. Conclusion Though ONDO and PI show promise, XYZVerse’s pioneering sports-meme ecosystem positions it to outperform them, targeting unparalleled growth in the ongoing bull run.

The message was posted directly to the WLFI Twitter account after a surge of community questions about token distribution and trading timelines. The update also confirmed that there will be no new private sale round, shutting down rumors that more behind-the-scenes deals would take place before trading begins. According to WLFI, the decision was made to focus entirely on early public buyers, especially those who got in during the first public sale at $0.015 and $0.05 per token. Only a portion of those tokens will unlock initially, and everything else will be voted on by the community after launch. This includes not just the remainder of public sale tokens but also all OTC allocations. The unlock schedule for team, advisor, and founder tokens will require a separate community vote, with the team stating clearly that they are “in no rush” to access those tokens. WLFI confirms no new presale, launches reward plan instead The team said they will not be holding another presale. Instead, they’re working with major centralized exchanges to launch a WLFI rewards program that lets users earn tokens through platforms they already use. “We’re NOT opening another pre-sale round,” the WLFI thread said. “Instead, we’re partnering with major exchanges to create a $WLFI reward program – allowing you to earn on platforms you already use and trust. A new path for everyone to join the liberty movement!” The team explained that a “massive alignment” was still being finalized before the official trading goes live. No details were given about what that alignment involves. But the delay is intentional. “Everyone wants $WLFI live ASAP – we get it! But we’re holding for one of the largest alignments yet… Patience will pay off,” they said. WLFI also made it clear they are coordinating with top CEX partners to ensure the token is listed on exchanges “you know and love,” with DeFi options also coming for decentralized trading preferences. After the token launches, a community vote will decide when the rest of the public sale and OTC tokens will unlock. Then, a final vote will be held to decide the unlock schedule for team-related holdings. Until those votes pass, none of those tokens will be released. “All that matters is building for the future,” the WLFI thread stated. Retail buyers get access after earlier vote ends exclusivity WLFI originally launched as a private crypto project, with early tokens only sold to accredited investors. That changed after a community vote, which opened up access for average retail buyers. The WLFI website now says the token will soon be tradable to begin the “next phase of community ownership and engagement.” The platform gave no exact timeline for when WLFI will hit exchanges, but it confirmed that demand from community members had pushed this shift forward. WLFI is the Ethereum-based governance token for World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project co-founded by Chase Herro, Zak Folkman, and members of the Trump and Witkoff families. The project was first teased by Eric Trump last year and is pitched as a platform for crypto-based lending and borrowing. Although no live product exists yet, the team continues to promote it as one of the biggest DeFi initiatives in the space. On the website, WLFI describes itself as a token that allows holders to vote on protocol changes, but also one that can be traded and sold on exchanges. One message on the site said, “This would… open the door for broader community participation, access, and protocol development.” Details about where WLFI will be listed are still unclear. The team said that more information will be shared soon, but gave no exact date. “Full details on the launch plan – coming soon!” the WLFI account posted. They also thanked early believers for waiting. “A bit more patience ensures we do this right – so you can say ‘I told you so.” President Trump disclosed last month a $57.3 million gain from WLFI token sales, drawing fire from lawmakers, especially Democrats, who have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest.

Pendle (PENDLE) innovates the DeFi space by enabling future yield trading. This unique approach helps users maximize returns through advanced smart contracts and seamless integration with other DeFi platforms. Pendle’s recent progress, such as smart contract updates and strategic partnerships, marks its growth and commitment to innovation. Will these developments increase the value of $PENDLE? Is Pendle worth investing in? Let’s dive into the Pendle price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Token PENDLE Price $4.46 Market Cap $735.02M Trading Volume (24 hour) $128.34M Circulating Supply 164.66M PENDLE All-time High $7.52 (Apr 11, 2024) All-time Low $0.03349 (Nov 10, 2022) 24-hour High $4.65 24-hour Low $4.32 Pendle price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 3.44 (0.51%) Volatility 8.15% 50-day SMA $ 3.97 14-Day RSI 40.59 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 63 ( Greed ) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $3.67 Pendle price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Daily chart shows a clear uptrend as price moves from mid-$3 to $4.50 while riding upper Bollinger Band and staying above the 20-day SMA RSI near 67 and positive MACD histogram indicate healthy bullish momentum without extreme overbought conditions Four-hour chart confirms breakout above the short-term SMA and a successful retest of $4.30 support pointing to a potential rally toward $5.00 PENDLE/USD 1-day chart PENDLEUSD chart by TradingView Pendle has broken above its 20-day moving average around $3.78 and reached the upper Bollinger Band near $4.52, signaling renewed bullish momentum on the daily chart. The RSI at 67 is approaching overbought territory without showing divergence, suggesting strength but caution for a pause or slight pullback. MACD has just crossed above its signal line, confirming momentum is shifting in favor of buyers. A consolidation between $4.00 and $4.20 would offer a healthier pattern before resuming the uptrend, while a sustained close above $4.52 could pave the way toward the next resistance at $5.00. PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart PENDLEUSD chart by TradingView Pendle’s daily chart reveals a steady uptrend as price has climbed from the mid-$3 range to test resistance near $4.50, riding the upper Bollinger Band and holding above its 20‐day moving average. RSI reading around 67 indicates bullish momentum without extended overbought stress, while MACD histogram bars have turned positive, suggesting room for further gains. On the four-hour timeframe, Pendle recently broke above its short-term moving average and briefly touched the upper Bollinger Band around $4.62 before retreating to support at $4.30. Overall, strengthening momentum points toward a push toward $5.00 if $4.30 holds. Pendle technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3.20 BUY SMA 5 3.47 BUY SMA 10 3.33 BUY SMA 21 3.54 BUY SMA 50 3.97 SELL SMA 100 3.64 SELL SMA 200 3.67 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3.71 BUY EMA 5 3.75 BUY EMA 10 3.62 BUY EMA 21 3.33 BUY EMA 50 3.12 BUY EMA 100 3.34 BUY EMA 200 3.68 BUY What can you expect from PENDLE price analysis next Pendle (PENDLE/USDT) shows a tentative recovery across both the 4-hour and daily charts after rebounding from recent lows around $3.17. On the daily timeframe, price is advancing toward the Bollinger midline at approximately $3.60, though the RSI near 43 signals limited bullish conviction. Intraday momentum on the 4-hour chart is supported by a positive Balance of Power reading and an emerging MACD crossover, indicating buyers are stepping in. Key resistance near $3.72 must be cleared to retest the $4.00–$4.20 zone; otherwise, Pendle is likely to oscillate between $3.25 and $3.70, warranting caution for traders. Overall, momentum remains fragile short term. Is PENDLE a good investment? Investing in Pendle coin offers a unique opportunity in the DeFi sector.

The comment alludes to the growing anticipation that institutional finance giants will soon recognize XRP’s utility and position in global finance. Many retail investors have accumulated XRP with expectations that its price will one day reflect the real-world use cases it enables. However, the notion that even holding one XRP might eventually be significant shows a belief in extreme long-term appreciation, potentially driven by institutional adoption. If you hold 1 XRP or 1,000 XRP Understand that you understand what XRP is. When Blackrock come in, you will be glad you have 1 XRP — BALE (@AltcoinBale) July 19, 2025 Institutional Entry Could Signal a Turning Point Bale’s post plays into a broader conversation among XRP supporters who believe that traditional finance is quietly preparing to integrate XRP into future infrastructure. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently predicted that XRP is on the cusp of mass institutional adoption , and BlackRock’s involvement with Bitcoin through ETFs shows that the firm is interested in cryptocurrencies. Its entrance into the XRP market would signal institutional validation that could change the market landscape entirely. Such involvement would carry more than just symbolic weight, as BlackRock manages trillions in assets. Anticipation for a BlackRock XRP ETF has been building for years, and such a product would introduce XRP to a wider investor base, bring major capital inflows, boost liquidity, and give the asset a level of credibility retail investors cannot provide on their own. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Holding At Least 1 XRP Is Important Prominent voices in the crypto space, such as Edoardo Farina, have constantly advised investors to hold up to 10,000 XRP. He opined that the amount may soon be impossible for average investors . However, Bale suggests that holding just one token could be life-changing. A growing number of XRP advocates believe that in a future where demand for XRP surges, individual holders could lend out their tokens to institutions , generating passive income from them. XRP has a fixed supply. As more tokens are burned and supply diminishes, the asset will become more valuable. As the supply shrinks, institutions that need to use the asset will have to depend on retail investors who purchased early. If a player like BlackRock does enter, Bale’s post may age well, and even the smallest holders could find themselves in a strong position.

However, savvy investors are seeking tokens that can replicate this success. If you’re aiming to turn $4,000 into $800,000, here are four high-potential altcoins that could lead the next wave, starting with the standout contender, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme-Powered Layer 2 Juggernaut Leading the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme-inspired token that’s packing more than just humor—it’s built with real tech. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype, LILPEPE is creating a next-gen Layer 2 blockchain that combines the virality of meme culture with cutting-edge infrastructure. This includes ultra-low gas fees, lightning-fast finality, enhanced security, and Ethereum scalability. But what truly sets LILPEPE apart is its bold ambition—not just to scale Ethereum, but to out-meme it entirely. The token is currently in presale, with Stage 5 underway at $0.0014 per token. Over $5.66 million has already been raised, and previous stages sold out rapidly, showing immense investor demand. LILPEPE has been listed on CoinMarketCap, and the company has announced that it will debut on two of the top centralized exchanges (CEXs) following the presale. LILPEPE has also set the stage for a future listing on the world’s largest crypto exchange, which could bring significant attention and demand. Market analysts are eyeing LILPEPE as the next 20,000% moonshot, potentially turning a $4,000 investment into $800,000 or more. With a powerful narrative, real technology, and backing from anonymous experts who’ve helped other meme tokens go parabolic, LILPEPE is more than hype—it’s positioned to lead the next crypto revolution. Jupiter (JUP): Solana’s DeFi Aggregator with High Upside Potential Technical indicators show that JUP is forming a solid base. The 50-day EMA at $0.45 provides firm support, while resistance at $0.50 suggests that a breakout is imminent. The RSI of 55 indicates a healthy trend with room for further growth. Coupled with increasing daily volume, Jupiter is attracting rising interest from both retail and institutional traders. Analysts forecast a rally toward $2–$3 by Q4 2025, driven by its utility, integrations, and continued growth within the Solana ecosystem. At $0.46, a $4,000 investment buys about 8,696 tokens. If JUP were to pull off a 20,000% gain like XRP once did, that investment could skyrocket to $800,000, making it one of the most exciting low-cap picks this year. Sei (SEI): Lightning-Fast Layer 1 for DeFi Traders Currently priced at $0.26 and with a market cap of $820 million, Sei is slightly down on the day but showing strong long-term fundamentals. Technical analysis highlights a support level at $0.20 and a resistance level at $0.36, with a rising 200-day moving average and an RSI near 50, indicating a balanced trend with upside potential. Earlier in 2025, SEI experienced a 31% rally fueled by user adoption and increased integration with DeFi projects. If SEI breaks past its resistance and gains broader adoption, analysts believe it could trade between $1 and $2 by year-end. At $0.26, a $4,000 investment secures around 15,385 tokens. If SEI performs a 20,000% rally, that position would be worth $800,000, putting it squarely in moonshot territory for long-term investors. Flare (FLR): Cross-Chain Infrastructure Ready for Liftoff FLR is currently trading at just $0.02, with a market cap of $1.15 billion. The coin has been consolidating in recent weeks but is showing signs of a potential breakout. Technical indicators show support at $0.015 and resistance at $0.03, while the 50-day moving average is stable, and the RSI of 52 shows moderate strength with room to rally. A $4,000 investment at $0.02 buys 200,000 FLR tokens. If FLR rises 20,000%, that investment would balloon to $800,000—a dramatic payoff for those willing to bet early on this overlooked infrastructure play. Conclusion Ripple’s historical run is proof that early investments in transformative crypto projects can yield life-changing returns. LILPEPE stands out as the most unique and disruptive. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a Layer 2 blockchain with real utility, viral appeal, and institutional-level planning. With its presale selling fast, exchange listings lined up, and top experts backing the project, LILPEPE could be the next big winner to turn a modest $4,000 into $800,000 or more.

The hit happened about 17 hours ago, and the company didn’t say a word until on-chain sleuth ZachXBT exposed it. The stolen crypto was first flagged by Cyvers, a blockchain security firm that spotted suspicious transactions and alerted Zach. Zach went public with the information on Telegram : “ Looks like the India centralized exchange ‘CoinDCX’ was likely drained for ~$44.2M almost 17 hours ago and has yet to disclose the incident to the community. ” He said the hacker address got 1 ETH from Tornado Cash, and then bridged part of the stolen funds from Solana to Ethereum. The hack wasn’t traced to a tagged wallet or listed in CoinDCX’s proof of reserves. Zach said he figured out the link by checking counterparties manually. He also listed the attacker’s addresses: Solana: 6peRRbTz28xofaJPJzEkxnpcpR5xhYsQcmJHQFdP22n Solana: 3btch8cSVp3Uh2SiY9DeiRNYUBmFiBNHZQzDyecJs7Gu Ethereum: 0xEF0c5b9E0E9643937D75C229648158584A8CD8D CEO confirms internal account got breached Right after Zach’s post started circulating, Sumit Gupta, the CEO of CoinDCX, finally stepped up with a statement on X, saying, “ Hi everyone, At CoinDCX, we have always believed in being transparent with our community, hence I am sharing this with you directly. ” According to Sumit, the compromised account was an internal operational wallet, not one that holds customer funds. He said it was used “only for liquidity provisioning on a partner exchange” . The breach was caused by a “sophisticated server attack,” but Sumit claims all customer wallets were safe and hadn’t been touched. “ No customer funds have been impacted. Your assets remain completely safe and protected in our secure cold wallet infrastructure. All trading activity and INR withdrawals are fully operational. ” The team isolated the breached account fast and says the loss is being covered from their own treasury, not customers’ assets. They’ve brought in cybersecurity firms to dig through the breach, patch vulnerabilities, and track where the funds are moving. Gupta said they’re also working with the unnamed exchange partner where the liquidity account was being used. They plan to launch a bug bounty program to catch other possible security gaps. He also said, “ Every security incident is a learning, and we will learn from this and further strengthen our platform… this is our time to win this war against cyberthreats in the industry. ” He ended by promising real-time updates going forward: “I understand incidents like this can be unsettling – even when customer assets are unaffected. That’s why I am sharing this incident with you with full transparency. Thank you for your continued trust. I will keep you informed on a real-time basis as we learn more.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|CoinDCX,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|SOL|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-19 16:35:19

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10?

Per our technical indicators, ALGO is bullish, but is correcting, indicating sector-wide profit-taking rather than ALGO-specific issues. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it is oversold. Recent news Robinhood and Gemini exchanges recently launched tokenized stocks, sparking investor interest in this new type of asset. Against this backdrop, the blockchain chosen by issuers could become a fresh opportunity for investors. Right now, Algorand commands over 66% of the market share. However, the picture of market share in tokenized stocks could change if this trend keeps gaining momentum. Why is ALGO up? Algorand turned bullish this week as altcoins continued to outperform Bitcoin. Algorand also cleared key resistance at $0.20. Algorand’s rising RWA adoption also contributed to the rise. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June. It crossed into July, trading at $0.18.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-19 16:40:00

Authorities say Zin Nwe Nyunt of Singapore set up a wholesale trading firm, and after the company’s accounts received SGD $640.7 million – about $500 million – she stated she had no idea where it came from, The Straits Times reports . Her trading firm, called Unione Pte Ltd, set up bank accounts with Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), United Overseas Bank (UOB) and DBS. She then received large sums of money via wire transfer between 2020 and 2021, court proceedings show. Nyunt first hit the police’s radar when an Australian investment scam victim provided information that led investigators to Unione’s bank account in 2021, which received $1.8 million in proceeds from the scheme. Court proceedings revealed a friend of Nyunt’s husband, Nyan Win, was approached by a Myanmar national named Ko Phillip, who asked him if he wanted to assist him in his commodities trading business by receiving wire transfers to a Singaporean business account. The deal was that Win would be paid 0.5 Myanmar kyat – a small fraction of a cent – for every US$1 received. However, Win decided it was too risky for him to receive money to his company’s bank account, and instead referred the alleged “opportunity” to Nyunt’s husband. In what appears to be an elaborate money laundering operation for scams, neither Nyunt nor Nyan were ever aware of the source of the funds, but each admitted to receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in “commissions.” Nyunt will begin serving an 18 month prison sentence in August while Nyan is expected to be sentenced at the end of this month.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has gone up by 10% in the past 24 hours and currently sits at $0.2360 as the top meme coin is playing catch-up with newcomers to maintain its leadership, and Pepeto, which brings wisdom and unity, creating an exchange that adopts all memecoins, giving them real value and a place to thrive. Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a meteoric rise in 2021, gaining over 17,000,000% before a significant decline. While its initial success captured the attention of many, the coin has since largely lost value. In 2025, investors are once again scanning the market for that next Shiba-style rocket—the asset that goes from overlooked to unavoidable. So, which one has the better setup for a Shiba-style run through 2026 and beyond? Dogecoin Price – Is This Cryptocurrency Heading For massive gains ? Dogecoin moved from $0.21 to $0.24 over a 24-hour stretch ending July 18. The trading range spanned from $0.205 to $0.25, reflecting an 18% price swing. It posted a 14% gain in that time. Over the last seven days, the price rose by 23%. In particular, trading volume hit $16.8 billion, pointing to heavy activity. Whale accumulation and rising institutional interest are driving demand. The meme coin market overall added $17 billion in July, pushing its market cap to $72 billion. Dogecoin Price Target : Thin Resistance Between $0.21 and $0.36 The largest group of DOGE holders acquired their tokens near $0.207, totaling 11 billion coins, about 7.3% of the supply. That zone had acted as a major cap on the price. With the asset now trading above it, attention is shifting upward. Meanwhile, the next high-volume holding zone is around $0.36, with 5.64 billion DOGE (3.8% of the supply) purchased near that range. Between $0.21 and $0.36, the data shows little concentration of holders, meaning there are fewer likely sell points in this range. Why is Pepeto Sleeper Hit That Could 100x? Pepe doesn’t look like much on the surface, a frog-faced meme coin in a sea of animal-themed tokens. But under the hood, it’s something far more ambitious: a meme coin with its own Exchange. That’s right, it’s the first token set to list memecoins that is built for memecoins. The goal? Solid projects, zero listing fees, swap tech, and no corruption. Its designed to solve every pain point shady meme coin investors complain about, gaining momentum and viral appeal / rumours that make viral meme coins work in the early stage. Currently in final stage of its presale, Pepeto is priced at 1 $Pepeto = $0.000000141. An investor would receive approximately 17.73 billion PEPETO tokens for a $2500 investment at the current price of $0.000000141 per token, your $2500 could grow to approximately $231,667.58 That’s a 92x return – similar to what early SHIBA or DOGE investors saw. Additionally, the story of pepeto, returns with true power— T echnology and O ptimization, which are the two missing pieces of Pepe. Pepeto, the God of frogs, holds the missing pieces Pepe went live without. Rumours highlight that an ex founder of pepe being betrayed is behind the Pepeto empire, which is illustrated in the story of Pepeto by the documents P (Power), E (Energy), P (Precision), E (Efficiency) and the two missing utilities : T for Technology and O for Optimisation, with the same max supply : 420 T . Beyond strength, Pepeto brings wisdom and unity with its value to the cryptocurrency market. Doge or Pepeto in 2025 ? Few names resonate within the crypto community as much as Elon Musk. His tweets and public statements have historically had a significant impact on cryptocurrency markets, and Dogecoin is no exception. But what have been noticied is the use of the frog theme meme such as Pepe in his personal official X account. Pepeto ? it’s early, it’s loud, and it’s built for the kind of run that Shiba made in 2021, an underdog with real tech and explosive upside. It’s not trying to replace the financial system like Shiba and Dogecoin. It’s trying to own meme culture on-chain through its exchange, and that’s a space crypto knows how to reward. Your choice depends on your strategy. But if you’re chasing that next Shiba-style moonshot, Pepeto might just be the one wearing the jetpack. Visit pepeto to get in before pre sale end closes.

The ITRC says there’s been a rise in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered phishing attacks, which are more difficult to detect, and other new threats to personal information. “The introduction of repackaged and recirculated personal information – PCD (previously compromised data) – into the risk environment represents a significant new threat to organizations that are vulnerable to the use of stolen logins and passwords to gain access to mission-critical systems for ransom attacks and/or data exfiltration.

Dogecoin is projected to reach the $1 milestone, Shiba Inu to hit $0.0001, and newcomer Little Pepe to reach $3. However, the timeline is even more shocking. After selling out Stage 4 ahead of schedule, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has entered Stage 5 at a price of $0.0014, marking a 40% rise from its Stage 1 price. Current buyers are already positioned for a 2.14x return, with a confirmed listing at $0.003. However, Grok AI’s full projection reveals much more than a simple double, it anticipates Little Pepe (LILPEPE) reaching $3 by Q2 2026. That is a staggering 2,042x gain from today’s price, outperforming many of the top assets in circulation. Backed by over $5.8 million raised and more than 4.9 billion tokens sold in record time, the project’s acceleration isn’t slowing down. Grok AI’s Forecast: Where Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Are Headed According to Grok AI’s latest projections, Dogecoin is expected to reach $1 by April 2026, a nearly 5x increase from its current price of $0.20. This trajectory is supported by steady adoption, integration with payment systems, and potential market-wide momentum following anticipated Bitcoin surges. Shiba Inu, currently trading at $0.0000134, is forecasted to hit $0.0001 by late 2025, marking a projected 7.5x return. While both tokens have strong community backing, Grok’s data suggests Dogecoin’s growth may be more short-term event-driven, while Shiba Inu’s path depends more on ecosystem expansion like Shibarium. These predictions also provide a performance benchmark for newer entrants such as Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which Grok forecasts could reach $3, far surpassing both in relative ROI. Stage 4 Sells Out Quickly as $5.9 M Raised Momentum continues to build around Little Pepe (LILPEPE), with Stage 4 of the presale completely selling out. Over 4.8 billion tokens were snapped up, bringing in $5.9 million. With that phase now closed, the price has moved up to $0.0014 in Stage 5. The strong response highlights growing belief in the project and where it’s headed next. Audit Score of 81.55 and CoinMarketCap Listing Boost Credibility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has undergone a full audit by Freshcoins.io, receiving a solid score of 81.55. This third-party validation adds an extra layer of trust for those just discovering the project. It’s also now listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it greater visibility and showing that LILPEPE is hitting key development milestones. Layer 2 Built for Speed and Simplicity The team behind Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is launching its own Layer 2 blockchain. It’s designed for quick, low-cost transactions and an overall smoother user and developer experience. This approach aims to solve the performance issues seen on many older networks. $777,000 Giveaway Now Live A massive giveaway is now underway, with $777,000 in prizes.

According to Grok AI, Dogecoin is on track to reach $1 by April 2026, while Shiba Inu could hit $0.0001 before the end of 2025. But it’s LILPEPE’s projected rise to $3 by Q2 2026, a staggering 2,042x gain from the current $0.0014 price, that’s capturing the spotlight.

This chart was amplified by prominent XRP influencer JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) and has reignited optimism around the current altcoin cycle, with many XRP holders interpreting it as a major validation of their long-held expectations and the start of the altseason. BREAKING: The Legend – Peter Brandt confirms altcoin season! #XRP pic.twitter.com/TuSSKUPBOJ — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) July 19, 2025 Is Altcoin Season Here? Brandt is well-known for his strict technical approach. While he was previously skeptical about XRP, the asset changed his mind in late 2024, and his current analysis suggests that XRP and other altcoins are primed for a substantial breakout. The chart he shared marks the development of a textbook cup and handle formation, a bullish continuation pattern typically signaling the resumption of an upward trend after consolidation. The structure spans several years, capturing the retracement of late 2021, a slow accumulation phase, and the formation of a smaller corrective handle that began in early 2025 and continued until the recent market resurgence. XRP’s Recent Momentum Recent price action supports Brandt’s technical argument. XRP surged to $3.65 on July 18, marking a new all-time high for the asset. This came after a breakout from the $3 zone, followed by a brief retest and a strong continuation upward. The rapid ascent has been accompanied by a renewed sense of urgency in the market, as buyers rush in, anticipating a broader altcoin rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While XRP has since pulled back slightly to $3.42, Brandt’s analysis suggests that the market is at the beginning of the altcoin season, and many market participants have high expectations for XRP and other altcoins. Analysts have also spotted a similar cup and handle formation on XRP’s chart, suggesting that this rally is not over. XRP Community’s Reaction and Excitement Within the XRP community, Brandt’s apparent endorsement of an altseason has been met with enthusiasm. One commenter suggested dollar-cost averaging as the best investment method for now, and others shared their excitement for the asset’s future, with some anticipating further growth driven by increasing utility. XRP’s resilience in regulatory scrutiny, coupled with improving technicals, positions it uniquely among its peers. The excitement the community is showing suggests that bulls are ready to put XRP at the forefront of the 2025 altseason.

What often separates those with strong momentum from those stuck in place? It comes down to solid utility, working features, and actual usage. That’s why finding the top crypto gainers in 2025 is more important than ever if you’re tracking growth-driven coins. This updated list spotlights four standout projects making notable progress: BlockDAG, SUI, SEI, and Jupiter. Each offers active networks, increasing traction, or tools that people actually use. One of them is already signaling the potential to be the most talked-about launch of the year. BlockDAG: A Tech-Focused Coin Delivering Solid Growth Among the top crypto gainers in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention for offering real tools that work now, not years later. Unlike many projects that rely on speculation, BlockDAG has live systems, including a testnet with functional smart contracts, a blockchain explorer, and a mobile mining app with over 2 million downloads. The current attraction lies in its NO VESTING PASS, which allows 100% access to all purchased coins from day one, no delays, no lockups. This feature will remain active for the next 6 days. Right now, BDAG is selling at $0.0016, and this price holds until August 11. The project has sold more than 24 billion coins, raising $342 million so far. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. What further strengthens BlockDAG’s reach is its marketing push through sports partnerships, including with Inter Milan and the Seattle Seawolves. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH event scheduled for August 11, and mining already live via mobile and hardware units, BlockDAG is shaping up to be one of the top crypto gainers in 2025. SUI: Built for Speed and Real Adoption SUI has steadily been making its mark in the blockchain space. Designed as a Layer-1 protocol, SUI isn’t just built to be fast; it’s engineered for practical use cases like NFTs, DeFi applications, and gaming. Its developer-friendly structure helps projects get up and running quickly. Recently, daily active users spiked by 145%, a strong indicator that the network is being used, not just talked about. Increased wallet activity and a notable integration with tBTC through the Threshold Network suggest that its ecosystem is steadily expanding. Priced at about $3.94, SUI currently sits around 26% below its peak of $5.35. Should it sustain levels above $4, analysts believe it could climb to $10 in the next market run. Its growing traction and solid tech base place it among the top crypto gainers in 2025. SEI: Optimized for High-Speed Financial Trading SEI has been purpose-built for one specific job: trading. Rather than trying to do everything, it’s focused on being the fastest, most reliable Layer-1 chain for traders. It offers extremely fast transaction speeds, tailored especially for DeFi and tokenized assets. Over the last month, SEI saw a 105% rise in price and currently trades near $0.37. Network strength is also climbing, with its total value locked (TVL) crossing $682 million. This shows growing confidence and user activity. Technically, SEI has broken key resistance zones, indicating further upside. Price targets range from $0.50 to potentially $1.14 by the end of the year. Its defined focus and steady expansion make SEI one of the top crypto gainers in 2025. Jupiter: Powering Solana’s Core DeFi Activity Jupiter (JUP) might not be in the spotlight, but it plays a major role in Solana’s DeFi space. Acting as the leading DEX aggregator, it helps users find the best trading prices by pulling liquidity from multiple sources. Nearly 80% of DEX transactions on Solana are executed via Jupiter, showing its integral role in the ecosystem. It also provides tools like automated dollar-cost averaging and limit orders, enhancing user convenience. With Solana gaining renewed attention due to meme coin activity, Jupiter is seeing increased adoption. The price is currently around $0.85, with some watchers expecting a revisit of its $2.04 high, and possibly touching $5 in 2025.

Notably, with the U.S. advancing regulation through laws like the Genius Act, the case for crypto as a legitimate investment class is gaining traction. To this end, and beyond leading names like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), Finbold has identified the following altcoins worth considering for your retirement portfolio. Solana (SOL) Solana has matured significantly in recent years, following a near collapse in 2022 due to its ties to the FTX saga. Notably, Solana earns a place in the portfolio thanks to its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming applications. The ecosystem is also expanding, with the potential to attract institutional investors, especially with a possible spot ETF on the horizon. Solana’s architecture also appeals to developers migrating from congested and costly Ethereum chains, giving it strong forward momentum. Previously, Solana surged from $0.22 in 2020 to over $200 at its peak and has undergone upgrades aimed at improving the network. Analysts, such as VanEck, project that its price could exceed $3,200 by 2030, making it an ideal investment option. At press time, SOL was trading at $176.96, having rallied over 11% in the past week. SOL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Hedera (HBAR) Hedera ( HBAR ) is quietly becoming the go-to network for enterprise adoption. Built on its unique Hashgraph consensus, a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchain, Hedera can process over 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality. What sets HBAR apart is its governance council, composed of industry giants such as Google, IBM, LG, and Deutsche Telekom. These stakeholders not only validate the network but also build on it, demonstrating rare institutional confidence in a crypto project. Use cases include tokenization, identity verification, carbon tracking, and supply chain solutions, offering solid potential for long-term growth. At press time, HBAR was trading at $0.27, up 0.1% in the last 24 hours and 12% over the past week. HBAR one-week price chart.

The platform’s co-founder and CEO Sumit Gupta disclosed the exploit on Saturday, describing it as a “sophisticated server breach.” The disclosure of the breach came only after popular blockchain sleuth ZachXBT revealed the breach on his Telegram channel. While the attack affected an operational wallet, Gupta said that customer assets were untouched and remain securely stored in cold wallets. ""The incident was quickly contained by isolating the affected operational account,” Gupta said in a public statement . “Since our operational accounts are segregated from customer wallets, the exposure is only limited to this specific account and is being fully absorbed by us - from our own treasury reserves.” ZachXBT traced the attacker’s movements, noting that the wallet involved was funded via crypto mixing service Tornado Cash. A portion of the stolen crypto was later bridged from Solana to Ethereum. The timing of the hack carries an unsettling echo: it occurred exactly one year after another Indian exchange, WazirX, was h acked for $235 million . CoinDCX says it is working with cybersecurity partners to investigate the breach, and is working with exchange partners to recover freeze and recover assets.

In the last 24-hour period, AVAX’s price dipped around 0.5% to $23.63, but moving the timeline to 30 days shows a major 30.3% rise, slightly outperforming the wider crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, which rose 30.1%. During the rise, AVAX’s volatility was accompanied by above-average volume, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This kind of price action, where buyers step in quickly at key levels, suggests a growing confidence among traders. The token has recently exited a multi-month descending channel, a technical pattern many traders interpret as a bullish reversal. Some market analysts, including OKX-partnered trader Ted Pillows, have floated $32 to $35 as a possible short-term target, citing improved sentiment and chart structure. Per Pillows, the “AVAX breakout has finally happened.” AVAX’s steady climb also comes amid a broader rebound in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. Total value locked on its protocols, measured in AVAX, has risen from 37 million tokens in early 2025 to around 76.4 million, according to DeFiLlama data.

On Saturday, in a post on X , crypto analyst Ali Martinez said that Ethereum whales have acquired over 500,000 ETH over the past two weeks, signaling what some analysts interpret as quiet confidence among large holders. Historically, such buying behavior has often preceded major price moves or ecosystem developments. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat, CIO of Fundstrat Capital, and the Chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), talked about his valuation outlook for ether. He referenced a model developed by Fundstrat’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, Sean Farrell, which draws comparisons to private firms like Circle. Using EBITDA-based multiples, Farrell estimates that ether could be worth up to $15,000. Lee supported that logic, noting that Layer-1 platforms like Ethereum — because they power entire ecosystems — often warrant higher valuation multiples, similar to how software firms command richer pricing than consumer businesses. Lee also cited technical analysis from Mark Newton, Fundstrat’s Head of Technical Strategy, who sees ether potentially reaching $4,000 before the end of July. Lee said that level is only a first target, adding that a range between $10,000 and $15,000 is realistic based on current adoption and valuation trends. While he stopped short of offering a precise timeline, he noted that such a move could come by year-end — or potentially sooner. Earlier this month, in an interview with CNBC, Lee called Ethereum “Wall Street’s preferred choice” for blockchain infrastructure. He pointed to JPMorgan’s stablecoin and Robinhood’s tokenization initiatives — both built on Ethereum — as evidence that traditional finance is increasingly aligning with the network. Lee added that Ethereum currently hosts more than 60% of all tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), a figure he expects will continue growing. If stablecoins surpass the $2 trillion mark, as forecast by Treasury Secretary Bessent, he said Ethereum would likely benefit from exponential growth in usage. As of 16:41 GMT on July 19, ETH was trading at $3,564.10, down 0.26% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH-USD exhibited notable volatility over the 23-hour window from July 18 at 13:00 UTC to July 19 at 12:00 UTC, with prices fluctuating across a $189.98 range, marking a 5% swing between the $3,670.26 peak and the $3,480.58 trough, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. The sharpest movement occurred between 14:00 and 20:00 UTC on July 18, as ETH dropped from $3,670.26 to $3,480.58 on heavy volume, peaking at 830,808 units. This established strong resistance around $3,670 and support near $3,480.Following the decline, ETH entered a consolidation phase between $3,540 and $3,600, with falling trading volume suggesting a slowdown in sell-side momentum and potential price stabilization. During the final 60-minute period ending July 19 at 12:49 UTC, ETH showed renewed strength, climbing from an intraday low of $3,546.17 at 12:07 to $3,557.98 at 12:46. This V-shaped rebound occurred on increased volume at key inflection points, with spikes to 8,319 and 9,841 units at 12:08 and 12:29 UTC, respectively — potential signs of institutional accumulation and a reversal from the prior downtrend.

While Sui continues to quietly build momentum with its sleek tech and growing developer base, all eyes are suddenly on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap altcoin that’s performing well. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 of presale. It will never be lower than this, with a 16.67% token price increase coming in phase 6. Mutuum Finance’s fifth presale phase is more than 80% sold out and has drawn in over 12,700,000, and 13,700 unique holders now own the token. Early adopters are already piling in, and this low-price coin might make you millions. Sui: A Solid Layer‑1 Backdrop Gearing Up for Summer Upside Sui (SUI) is currently trading around $4.02, gently rebounding toward its early‑July levels of roughly $3.90 after a substantial 44% rally this month that pushed on‑chain TVL past $2.3 billion. The network has widened its institutional footprint, with Valour and DeFi Technologies allocating over $80 million to SUI and expanded developer support by opening a Lagos innovation hub. Its active DeFi ecosystem is launching more Bitcoin-compatible assets and hackathon winners are building on its low‑latency, object‑centric Layer‑1 . While arriving late in July may miss some momentum, Sui’s infrastructure‑led growth offers a stable play in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Surpasses $12.7 Million Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 is trending and live. Over 13700 investors have already made their investments in the presale and have raised $12.7 million, a clear indication of growing hype. Price increases are unavoidable since Phase 5 has already reached 80%. Investing now makes it possible for investors to receive the lowest price for the maximum ROI. Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not on hype but on actual utility and security at scale, with its game-changing dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin. Mutuum Finance Launches $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance in its security and transparency aspect has introduced its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK with a reward of $50,000 USDT. It rewards in four categories namely, critical, major, minor and low where there is reward for all types of vulnerability. This is another aspect which indicates the proactive approach of Mutuum to establish trust in terms of strong infrastructure and good security. Moreover, the project is creating an Ethereum-based USD-pegged stablecoin. The asset will remain stable in volatile markets in contrast to algorithmic stablecoins that depeg in a fluctuating market. $100,000 Giveaway The project is already audited and certified by CertiK paving the way for mass adoption. MUTM is also organizing a $100,000 giveaway and 10 lucky people will be awarded $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. Over $12.7 million raised and more than 13,700 investors locked in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving it’s not just another cheap altcoin, but a serious contender for explosive growth in 2025. Phase 5 is already over 80% sold out, and the price jumps 16.67% in the next phase, meaning the clock is ticking for investors looking to enter at the lowest possible price. Real utility, audited security, a dual-lending system, and a USD-backed stablecoin in development all point to a project built for the long haul. This is where smart money is moving before the rest of the market catches up. Secure your MUTM tokens now, before Phase 5 ends and the price rises.

The data visualizes how MicroStrategy’s famous Bitcoin purchases would have performed had Michael Saylor, the company’s executive chairman, chosen XRP instead. According to the post, “Michael Saylor would be up 2X today if he bought XRP instead of Bitcoin.” Michael Saylor would be up 2X today if he bought XRP instead of Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/g5D9t1ukK4 — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 19, 2025 Chart Shows XRP Outpacing Bitcoin by 2025 The chart illustrates portfolio performance starting from August 2020 through July 2025. Both the Bitcoin and XRP portfolios initially tracked each other closely through late 2021, showing modest gains with some fluctuations. From December 2023 onwards, however, the XRP portfolio began to outperform Bitcoin significantly. Around September 2024, XRP’s cumulative value visibly exceeded Bitcoin’s and maintained its lead through to July 2025. By the end of the charted period, XRP’s hypothetical value crossed $140 billion while Bitcoin’s hovered near $70 billion. Gordon Emphasizes Missed Opportunity Gordon framed this as evidence that XRP would have yielded double the gains compared to Bitcoin over the same period. The data implies that the decision to focus solely on Bitcoin came at the expense of greater returns that could have been realized with XRP . Gordon presented the comparison as a hypothetical scenario, highlighting what he described as a missed opportunity for MicroStrategy’s treasury strategy. Responses Defend Bitcoin’s Long-Term Appeal In response to Gordon’s post , users on the platform weighed in with differing views. One user argued that the comparison overlooks Bitcoin’s unique properties. They stated that short-term gains do not outweigh long-term fundamentals, suggesting that Saylor’s choice of Bitcoin stemmed from his recognition of it as “the apex digital commodity” and a position unmatched by any other cryptocurrency. This user also highlighted Bitcoin’s network effects and institutional adoption as key factors behind Saylor’s investment thesis. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Debate Between Immediate Returns and Vision Another commenter echoed this sentiment by asserting that while XRP may have delivered superior gains over the past two years, Bitcoin laid the groundwork for the entire digital asset ecosystem. According to this perspective, Bitcoin represents a long-term bet on a future where fiat currencies decline and monetary sovereignty becomes more important. The same user emphasized that Saylor’s intent was not to pursue short-term gains but rather to align with what they described as a rewriting of monetary history. Gordon’s tweet and the attached chart focused primarily on cumulative portfolio performance, measuring the returns of each asset over nearly five years. The comparison underscored XRP’s more recent appreciation, particularly from late 2023 onwards, where its growth accelerated relative to Bitcoin. The chart clearly visualized a sharp divergence between the two portfolios as XRP climbed rapidly, while Bitcoin’s growth remained steady but comparatively subdued. Overall, the post by Gordon asserted that Saylor could have doubled MicroStrategy’s portfolio value had he opted for XRP instead of Bitcoin. However, several respondents contended that the choice of Bitcoin reflects a long-term strategy centered on digital scarcity and foundational strength, rather than short-term market performance.

The rapid push to that level was preceded by a week of frenzied trading and heavy inflows, with BTC breaking through multiple resistance zones in quick succession. However, once that peak was hit, a series of volatile intraday movements followed to give a pullback to $116,000 and Bitcoin is now back to trading between the $117,000 and $118,500 price zone. Related Reading: If You’re Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says A notable bearish call came from crypto analyst Melikatrader94, who posted a technical breakdown on the TradingView platform that might send Bitcoin down to $113,000. QML Zone Rejection Points To Downtrend Toward $113,600 According to the hourly candlestick chart shared by Melikatrader94, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a Quasimodo Level (QML) structure. The Quasimodo Level (QML) structure is characterized by three peaks in a bearish scenario or three troughs in a bullish scenario, with the middle one being the most prominent, identifying the price. The post predicted that Bitcoin’s entry into the $119,000–$121,000 zone would draw sellers, and this was indeed the case. The quick rejection after its all-time high confirms a bearish shift in structure, and now the momentum is tilted to the downside. This rejection came after a significant price move that engulfed a previous structural support level. “BTC rejected from QML zone and the selloff confirms bears are active,” the analyst noted. The bearish outlook remains valid as long as Bitcoin stays below the QML zone, with the next critical support level situated at $113,600. This area could serve as a potential point for either a bounce or short-term consolidation if the price continues downward. However, a pullback is likely to occur around $116,000 before Bitcoin falls to $113,600. Altcoins Under Threat As BTC Price Weakens The potential Bitcoin crash to the $113,000 region could have serious implications for many altcoins that are already starting to post massive gains. However, these altcoins, which often follow Bitcoin’s lead, are already showing signs of nervousness as BTC struggles to maintain upward momentum. Among the notable movers, XRP finally broke its eight-year-old resistance to hit a new all-time high of $3.65. However, the rally appears to be stalling, with the token now showing early signs of a correction around the $3.45 zone. Ethereum, which also surged on the back of Bitcoin’s push to $122,000, climbed above $3,600 for the first time in months but has since settled into a consolidation phase just below $3,500.

This represents a tenfold increase from current levels and is expected to enable the network to handle high-volume use cases such as up to 5,000 decentralized exchange (DEX) swaps per second. BNB Chain’s Bold Bet According to the official blog post, BNB Chain aims to match Nasdaq’s scale and speed with its planned upgrade. The network expects to process 20,000+ transactions per second across complex on-chain actions, including swaps, restaking, and yield strategies, positioning itself for high-volume on-chain use cases. To support this throughput, BNB Chain will roll out a new Rust-based client with BSC-specific customizations by leveraging Ethereum’s Reth as its foundation. This multi-threaded client is designed to improve memory management, accelerate node syncing, and enable high-performance execution while maintaining efficiency. BNB Chain also plans to boost smart contract execution by introducing “Super Instructions,” which optimize multiple common operations into single instructions to reduce performance bottlenecks, particularly in areas like DEX swaps and launchpad events. In addition to that, upgrades to the StateDB layer, which bridges the EVM and the storage system, are expected to improve state access speed and efficiency, addressing a component that currently accounts for about 30% of execution time on BSC. These improvements aim to reduce duplicated state access and improve cache access performance, to ensure that BNB Chain can support a larger dataset and more users as activity scales, while simultaneously maintaining low latency for builders and users operating on the network. BNB Turns Eight Earlier this week, BNB celebrated its eighth birthday, recording more than 10,000x growth since its initial coin offering (ICO) back in 2017, where it launched on Ethereum before migrating to the BNB Chain. Originally sold at $0.15, BNB now trades around $703, as the fifth-largest crypto asset. Binance initially launched BNB to serve as the native asset of its ecosystem and has since introduced mechanisms like the BNB Auto-Burn program, which has reduced supply by automatically adjusting burn amounts based on price and block metrics. As a result, the total supply has been lowered to around 139.28 million BNB, thereby contributing to its scarcity and price appreciation. Meanwhile, BNB is also experiencing rising institutional adoption. Some companies are adding it to their corporate treasuries, including at least one aiming to hold $1 billion worth of the asset.

It is a further acknowledgement of the commitment of the pro-crypto administration of Donald Trump, the 47th President of the United States (POTUS). All Protocol Duly Observed For US GENIUS Act The US has welcomed its first significant piece of legislation since Trump assumed the presidency for the second time. The GENIUS Act, signed into law by the president, provides regulatory clarity for USD-pegged stablecoin issuers, including Tether, Circle, and Ripple. The GENIUS Act was first passed in the Senate about a month ago, with a decisive bipartisan vote of 68-30. Next was the House of Representatives, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority over Democrats. To ensure that the bill receives the required support, Trump urged members of the House to move “LIGHTNING FAST” to send the bill to his desk, emphasizing, “NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS.” America Enters a New Digital Finance Era Fast forward to the present day, America has taken a significant step forward in digital finance leadership by signing the bill into law. Notably, the US House also passed the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC Acts. For a nation that has battled regulatory uncertainty for years and faced criticism for it , the US has struck gold with these regulatory frameworks. Notably, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under Gary Gensler’s leadership, has leveraged a regulation-by-enforcement approach that has triggered backlashes from crypto firms. American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been unable to stop talking about the Commission’s regulatory chaos . What Does the GENIUS Act Demand? Now that regulatory clarity for stablecoins has been established through the GENIUS Act, issuers are required to maintain a strict 1:1 reserve backing. Additionally, each digital dollar should be fully backed by a U.S. dollar or an equivalent low-risk asset. All Issuers in the region would be required to obtain either federal or state licenses and comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. In addition, stablecoin issuers would be restricted from using customer reserves for anything beyond redemption or safe investments, such as short-term Treasury securities. This is intended to reduce systemic risks and protect investors’ funds. Precisely, it would avoid the kind of shadow banking issues that have plagued parts of the financial sector.

Just days after Windsurf, an AI coding innovator, announced its acquisition by Cognition, its interim CEO Jeff Wang pulled back the curtain on the intense drama and uncertainty that defined the deal. This story isn’t just about a business transaction; it’s a testament to resilience in the face of adversity, offering crucial insights for anyone navigating the volatile landscape of tech and crypto investments. The Initial Storm: Navigating AI Startup Uncertainty The tech world often buzzes with rumors of major deals, and Windsurf was no stranger to the spotlight. Initially, reports linked the promising AI startup to acquisition talks with OpenAI, a potential union that could have reshaped the AI development landscape. However, as is often the case in high-stakes negotiations, this anticipated deal ultimately fell through. What followed was a complex series of events that sent ripples of uncertainty through Windsurf’s team. Instead of a full acquisition, Google DeepMind made a strategic move, hiring Windsurf’s former CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and several key researchers. This arrangement reportedly involved Google licensing Windsurf’s technology for a substantial $2.4 billion, but notably, without taking an equity stake. This trend, dubbed “reverse acquihires,” has become a clever tactic for large tech companies to circumvent antitrust scrutiny. By absorbing talent and licensing technology rather than outright acquiring companies, they gain innovation without the regulatory headaches. But this approach leaves a critical question hanging: what becomes of the startups and the employees left behind? The Fallout: Why the OpenAI Deal Collapsed and Startup Morale Plummeted The impact of the Google DeepMind deal on Windsurf was immediate and profound. Jeff Wang, who stepped in as interim CEO after Mohan’s departure, recounted an all-hands meeting that Friday, June 11, which he described as having a “very bleak” mood. Most team members had arrived expecting news of the OpenAI acquisition, only to be confronted with the reality of key leadership departures and the new Google arrangement. The emotional toll was significant. Wang observed that “some people were upset about financial outcomes or colleagues leaving, while others were worried about the future. A few were in tears, and the Q&A had been understandably hostile.” This period highlighted a severe blow to startup morale . The departure of key executives, especially in such a pivotal moment, can feel like a captain abandoning ship, as one founder reportedly likened it. Wang, while empathetic to Mohan and Chen’s difficult situation, was left to steer a ship facing a crisis of confidence and talent retention. A Glimmer of Hope: How the Cognition Deal Emerged Despite the severe blow to morale and the loss of key personnel, Wang recognized that Windsurf still possessed valuable assets: its intellectual property, product, and a strong remaining talent pool, particularly in its go-to-market (GTM) machine. The options were clear: seek new funding, pursue another acquisition, or continue independently. It was in this critical juncture that a new path opened. That very evening, Wang received an unexpected call from Cognition executives Scott Wu and Russell Kaplan. The conversation quickly turned serious, leading to intense negotiations over a frantic weekend. Wang recounted the whirlwind of discussions with Cognition, while also managing inbound interest from other potential acquirers and working tirelessly to convince Windsurf’s remaining engineers to stay. The two companies quickly identified a strong synergy. Wang noted, “While they had overinvested in engineering, they had frankly underinvested in GTM and Marketing, and our teams in those functions are nothing short of world class.” Conversely, Windsurf, now lacking a core engineering team, found an ideal partner in Cognition, renowned for its “better group of AI engineers.” This alignment proved crucial for the eventual Cognition deal . Beyond the Headlines: What This Tech Acquisition Means for Employees One of the most compelling aspects of the Windsurf-Cognition agreement was the commitment to its people. Wang emphasized his alignment with Cognition’s Scott Wu on the critical need to “take care of all Windsurf employees.” This shared principle translated into tangible benefits for the entire team, addressing one of the core anxieties that arose during the period of uncertainty. Key elements of the deal designed to support employees included: Payout to Every Employee: Ensuring financial compensation for all, not just a select few. Waiver of All Cliffs: Removing vesting cliffs, providing immediate access to equity. Accelerated Vesting: Speeding up the timeline for employees to gain full ownership of their Windsurf equity. This commitment stood in stark contrast to the initial Google DeepMind arrangement, which left many Windsurf employees in limbo. The successful negotiation of these terms transformed a period of despair into one of immense relief and celebration. Wang famously described that Friday all-hands as “probably the worst day of 250 people’s lives,” followed by Monday, the day the deal was signed and announced, as “probably the best day.” This tech acquisition serves as a powerful example of how strategic alignment and a focus on human capital can lead to a positive outcome even after significant setbacks. The Road Ahead for Windsurf Acquisition The finalization of the Windsurf acquisition by Cognition was a rapid process, with the agreement signed on a Monday morning, followed by internal and public announcements. This swift resolution brought an end to a tumultuous chapter for the AI startup and its dedicated team. The integration of Windsurf’s strong go-to-market capabilities with Cognition’s deep engineering talent creates a formidable force in the AI coding space. This acquisition is more than just a business transaction; it’s a narrative of corporate resilience, strategic pivoting, and the critical importance of leadership during crisis. For those in the startup ecosystem, it offers valuable lessons on navigating failed deals, managing team morale, and identifying synergistic partnerships that truly benefit all stakeholders. As the AI industry continues its rapid evolution, such stories of survival and success provide crucial insights into building robust and adaptable ventures. The journey of Windsurf, from the brink of collapse after a major deal fell through and key departures, to its triumphant acquisition by Cognition, is a powerful reminder of the unpredictable yet often rewarding path of innovation. Jeff Wang’s candid account highlights the emotional and strategic challenges faced by startups, but also the immense potential for recovery when leadership remains focused on core strengths and employee well-being. This outcome not only secures Windsurf’s future but also sets a new benchmark for how acquisitions can prioritize people alongside profit.

The Central American country’s Bitcoin Office has published regular updates on X, claiming that El Salvador is purchasing Bitcoin regularly. However, the IMF stated that El Salvador was merely moving BTC between government wallets. The IMF says El Salvador lied about its BTC purchases The IMF report is the first review of the 40-month, $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement with El Salvador. In the report, the IMF stated that “the overall stock of Bitcoin held by the public sector has remained unchanged since program approval.” This statement debunks El Salvador’s claims of purchasing 1 BTC every single day. The IMF explained that the perceived increase in El Salvador’s public Bitcoin reserves was due to internal transfers and wallet consolidations among government-controlled wallets. More specifically, the BTC movements occurred between the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund and the Chivo e‑wallet. The IMF report included a footnote that says, “Increases in Bitcoin holdings in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund reflect the consolidation of Bitcoin across various government‑owned wallets.” The report, however, noted minor fluctuations in Chivo wallet balances due to client deposit activity. These were not the result of new public BTC purchases. As part of its $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility agreement, the IMF explicitly required El Salvador to halt new Bitcoin purchases. Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, took to X on March 4 and said , “No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining.” The rhetoric of the Salvadoran government is mostly showmanship, but its actions align with the IMF’s demands. At the moment, the country’s Bitcoin Office website claims that the fund holds 6,242.18 BTC and an increase of 30 BTC in the last 30 days. Bitcoin City stalled, other projects halted At the end of 2021, Nayib Bukele announced his plan to build a Bitcoin City in the southeastern region of La Unión. Bukele promised zero income tax, zero property tax, no procurement tax, zero city tax, and zero CO₂ emissions. After almost four years, Bitcoin City remains a proposal, and no construction has commenced. Volcano Bonds, another project that promised the issuance of a $1 billion Bitcoin bond, was indefinitely postponed in March 2022. The delayed issuance of the “Volcano Bonds” was tied to global market volatility and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the time, the country’s Finance Minister, Alejandro Zelaya, said on local TV, “We believe that between March 15 and 20 is the right timing, we have the tools almost finished. But the international context will tell us … I didn’t expect the war in Ukraine.” The LaGeo crypto mining facility, a state-owned geothermal Bitcoin mining initiative, was announced in June 2021. Bukele proposed a plan to use 100% clean, volcano-powered geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin. He even shared a video of a Bitcoin mining facility using volcanic power. As of 2025, the mining project is reportedly inactive. Other projects, like El Salvador’s Bitcoin-funded Chivo Pets hospital , were completely halted in March. El Salvador’s long list of failed Bitcoin projects also includes an NFT casino, the Chivo Wallet, and Chivo Pets. The lie of a continuous Bitcoin acquisition is the final nail in the coffin.

One project that’s been steadily gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — and its presale numbers speak for themselves. With over $12.6 million raised and Phase 5 almost sold out, time is running out to grab MUTM at its current price of $0.03 before it climbs by 20% in the next stage. As more buyers enter ahead of the next price increase, many are starting to view MUTM not just as a promising altcoin, but as a strong candidate for the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized protocol built around lending, borrowing, and passive earnings. Unlike platforms that rely on custodians or centralized control, Mutuum operates entirely through non-custodial smart contracts. Users can act as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators, depending on their strategy. When users contribute assets to Mutuum’s liquidity pools, they’re issued mtTokens — ERC-20 tokens that represent their deposit and accumulate interest over time. These tokens are not static in value. As platform activity expands, mtTokens gradually increase in redeemable value, reflecting the interest earned on the original deposit. Borrowers, on the other hand, can access loans by locking in overcollateralized assets. They also get to choose between variable or stable rates, depending on market conditions and their needs. The platform offers both pooled and peer-to-peer models, giving users control over how they participate in lending markets. Its built-in liquidation engine also adds a layer of protection, ensuring healthy borrowing practices while still maintaining flexibility. Phase 6 Is Next So far, Mutuum’s presale has seen over $12.6 million in contributions, with more than 13,600 holders and 550 million tokens sold. Over 80% of Phase 5 has already been sold, with the $0.03 price point available for a limited time before the next increase. Once Phase 6 begins, the price will increase to $0.035 — a 20% jump that’s already creating urgency among those who’ve been waiting on the sidelines. And that’s not the only thing putting pressure on the clock. The token is scheduled to launch at $0.06, which means anyone buying in now could see a 100% increase in value by the time MUTM goes live. For early investors, this is a chance to double their capital before the token even hits exchanges. Why Experts Are Bullish on MUTM Analysts are starting to focus on Mutuum’s practical applications, noting that its growing utility is a major reason behind its strong potential. Unlike many speculative tokens that rely on hype, MUTM is backed by a functional ecosystem that’s currently in development. The platform’s beta version is expected to launch around the same time as the token, giving early users access to core features like lending markets and mtToken tracking from day one. This rollout aligns with a strategy focused on long-term growth. Instead of short-term price manipulation, the project is building toward sustainable usage — something that’s becoming more important in the current market. Combined with a buy-and-distribute model that rewards mtToken stakers with additional MUTM bought on the open market, the protocol is built to support both stability and demand. This makes it stand out as one of the top cryptocurrencies under development — and a possible next big crypto to watch. Don’t Miss the 20% Price Jump As Phase 5 wraps up and the protocol edges closer to launch, the 20% price increase set for Phase 6 adds another reason to act fast. With fewer than 20% of tokens remaining at the current tier, this stage may not last long. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, MUTM offers a compelling answer. It combines a working product roadmap with a solid presale track record and a team focused on delivering value from launch. With the beta version of the platform expected to go live alongside the token, buyers aren’t just investing in a concept — they’re getting early access to a usable ecosystem. Add in the upcoming 100% increase from presale to launch, and it becomes clear why MUTM is being mentioned in conversations about the best crypto to buy before the next bull run gains full momentum. Mutuum Finance is building more than just hype. It’s creating a structured, utility-first protocol that aims to deliver value across lending, borrowing, and on-chain earnings. With over $12.6 million raised, an expanding holder base, and Phase 5 nearly complete, the final stretch of this presale is all about timing. The next price move is locked in — and with a 20% increase coming in Phase 6, early movers stand to benefit the most. As launch day approaches and momentum builds, MUTM is shaping up to be more than just a presale token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining recognition as a standout cryptocurrency investment for Q3 2025.

Helium , Pendle , SEI , and ENA emerge as strong contenders. These coins are capturing attention for their unique features and promising trajectories. Investors and enthusiasts alike will want to explore what makes these coins stand out in the evolving crypto landscape. Helium (HNT) Price Analysis: Strong Month Rally, Caution Over 6-Month Downtrend Helium saw significant volatility over the past month, gaining 68.49%. A 1-week surge of 33.25% indicates strong near-term buying interest, contrasting with a 6-month decline of 17.31% that suggests caution among traders. Recent price action pushed values into the range of $1.71 to $3.19, reflecting swift movements that market participants have been closely tracking. The data shows that immediate gains have yet to solidify into long-term strength, making this a crucial time for traders. Currently, Helium trades between a floor of $1.16 and a ceiling around $4.12, with frequent values found primarily in the $1.71 to $3.19 range. Near resistance at $4.12 may prompt profit-taking, while support at $1.16 encourages buying during price dips. Short-term indicators reveal strong upward momentum, but caution prevails as the Relative Strength Index approaches 78, indicating a potential overbought condition. Bulls dominate the market for now with heightened buying activity, yet the longer-term trend remains unclear due to the negative half-year performance. Traders should consider the immediate range before making long-term commitments, looking to buy near support and plan exits at resistance levels, while monitoring conditions closely for either breakout or pullback signals. Pendle Price Analysis: Key Levels Shape Upcoming Moves Pendle showed strong gains in the recent month with an 18.98% price increase, and over the past six months, the coin climbed by about 22.45%, reflecting consistent market interest. Price behavior over these periods indicates notable upward movement paired with robust investor enthusiasm. The weekly growth of 13.65% further underlines the coin’s ability to rally over short spans, suggesting that market participants have been quick to respond to new developments. The current trading landscape for Pendle is defined by key boundaries that offer opportunities for tactical moves. The coin trades within a range of approximately $2.85 to $4.31, with the nearest support identified at $2.25 and resistance at $5.16. Bulls appear to be controlling the market as price action moves toward higher territory, although the RSI value of 68.18 indicates that buyers might be pushing the coin into overbought areas. A lack of a distinctly clear trend exists as rallies are interspersed with pauses, suggesting caution is needed. Traders might consider buying near the support level of $2.25 while preparing to sell or take partial profits as prices approach the $5.16 resistance. Sei Price Surge Reflects Recent Rally Amid Stable Long-Term Trends Sei recorded a dramatic one-month gain of 91.36% while maintaining a near-flat performance over the past six months with a slight decline of 0.22%. A seven-day increase of 4.55% showcases short-term optimism amid a period of consolidation. The price range has been established between $0.18 and $0.36, indicating that recent buying activity has spurred a notable surge in short-term value, even though long-term market behavior remains more measured and steady. Current price levels for Sei are observed between $0.18 and $0.36. This trading range has held firm despite recent buying activity. Strong resistance is found at $0.44, with an additional barrier near $0.61 where sellers may intervene. Support is secured at $0.08, preventing deep declines. The market shows a bullish tilt with the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator at 0.08, and an RSI of 64.30 indicates active buyers. Trading ideas include looking for a lift if price breaches the $0.44 resistance or entering between $0.36 and $0.44 on pullbacks. The market remains active, inviting strategic moves. Ethena (ENA): Volatile Past and Strategic Price Levels Ethena recent performance shows a one-week increase of 17.83% and a strong monthly gain of 38.74%, contrasting sharply with a 52.89% decline over the past six months. Price has moved within the range of $0.20 to $0.35, reflecting rapid shifts that have puzzled many traders. The coin’s price behavior over these periods reveals swings offering both opportunities and challenges, highlighting a market sentiment that shifts quickly from bullish bursts to deeper corrections. Ethena currently trades between a defined range of $0.20 and $0.35, with resistance at $0.44 and support at $0.14. The Relative Strength Index at 71.78 indicates overbought conditions, showing strong bullish interest short term. The momentum indicator at 0.109, along with an Awesome Oscillator value of 0.078, suggests upward pressure, though caution is advised. Traders may consider acquiring near the lower bound, anticipating a rebound toward $0.44, while others might wait for a decisive breakout. Neither bulls nor bears dominate, creating a delicate balance; strategies could include range trading or accumulation at support levels. Conclusion HNT , PENDLE , SEI , and ENA present high potential for investment in the third quarter. These altcoins offer unique features and promising developments in their respective blockchain projects. HNT focuses on wireless networking, PENDLE aims to innovate in decentralized finance, SEI targets speed and efficiency, and ENA brings creative solutions to the table. These characteristics make them strong candidates for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Vet specifically pointed to remarks made by White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks, who has previously stated that regulatory certainty for stablecoins could unlock trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasuries. As RLUSD is a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issued directly on the XRP Ledger, it stands to benefit from both institutional confidence and compliance with the new legal framework. Currently, the stablecoin market is valued at approximately $250 billion, according to Vet, implying substantial room for growth as regulated issuers enter the space. Vet wrote, “With the signing of the Genius Act, we should see good growth for $RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. Trillions in potential demand for treasuries by stablecoin issuers, as per David Sacks, would also mean trillions in marketcap. Currently 1/4 Trillion stablecoin marketcap.” With the signing of the Genius Act we should see good growth for $RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. Trillions in potential demand for treasuries by stablecoin issuers as per David Sacks would also mean trillions in marketcap. Currently 1/4 Trillion stablecoin marketcap. — Vet (@Vet_X0) July 18, 2025 Legislative Background of the GENIUS Act The remarks from Vet came shortly after the U.S. government finalized the GENIUS Act. As reported by Times Tabloid , the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) on July 17, 2025, with overwhelming bipartisan support in a 308–122 vote. The Senate had already approved the bill in June, and President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 18. The GENIUS Act has been described as the most consequential piece of financial regulation since the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The law establishes a comprehensive, national regulatory framework specifically for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. Only federally licensed or state-supervised entities—including banks, credit unions, and approved fintech firms—will be permitted to issue such stablecoins. Issuers are required to maintain full one-to-one dollar reserves, submit to monthly audits by third parties, and operate under ongoing regulatory oversight. Algorithmic stablecoins and non-dollar-pegged stablecoins are explicitly excluded from this regulated category. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Timeline and Consumer Protections While the GENIUS Act is already law, its provisions will not take full effect immediately. Regulators have up to 180 days to draft and publish implementing rules, and full enforcement of the law is expected by the end of 2026. This means that although the signing of the Act provides a strong signal to the market, the exact timeline for when RLUSD and similar stablecoins can fully operate under the new framework remains dependent on forthcoming regulatory guidance. The Act also includes notable consumer protections. Stablecoin holders are given priority claims on reserves in the event of an issuer’s insolvency, and issuers are prohibited from paying interest on their coins. However, third-party platforms may still offer such features independently. These protections are designed to increase trust in regulated stablecoins, which could encourage broader adoption by institutions and retail users. Vet’s remarks underscore the opportunities it creates for RLUSD and the XRP Ledger. While implementation details and timing remain to be clarified, the law sets the stage for expanded regulated use of stablecoins and positions the XRP Ledger as a potential beneficiary of this regulatory clarity.

Meanwhile, a crypto wallet belonging to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen sent $26 million worth of XRP to Coinbase on Tuesday. The transfer occurred on the same day that the XRP price hit a seven-month high.

In a new blog post , Google is announcing that it has filed a lawsuit in a New York federal court against BadBox 2.0 – the largest botnet of IoT television devices in the world – after it was discovered by its cybersecurity experts. According to Google, BadBox 2.0 compromised over 10 million uncertified devices running the Android open source operating system and installed malware to “conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.” The original BadBox went down in 2023. BadBox 2.0 came into operation the following year and has been running since. The tech giant says that it has already taken action to stop the threat, updating its security measures to automatically block all applications associated with the malicious botnet. In a recent blog post, the cybersecurity firm HUMAN – a partner of Google – explains how BadBox 2.0 operates. “BADBOX 2.0, like its predecessor, begins with backdoors on low-cost consumer devices that enable threat actors to load fraud modules remotely. These devices communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers owned and operated by a series of distinct but cooperative threat actors. The BADBOX and BADBOX 2.0 threat actors exploit software or hardware supply chains or distribute seemingly benign applications that contain ‘loader’ functionality in order to infect these devices and applications with the backdoor. Once a fraud module is deployed, infected devices may become part of a botnet and subsequently have the capacity to conduct several attacks.” Some of the attacks the botnet is capable of include programmatic ad fraud, click fraud, and residential proxy services, which lead to account takeovers, fake account creations, DDoS attacks, malware distribution, and one-time password thefts, according to HUMAN. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note that Android TV OS devices or Play Protect-certified Android devices were not affected by the exploit.

Major Milestone For Strategy Previously known as Strategy, the company has intentionally worked its way up the ladder of success. S&P 500 companies are generally recognized for having the largest corporate treasuries. Moreover, Nvidia is believed to be the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Therefore, overtaking NVDA is no small feat, and Strategy owes a significant part of this performance to the recent rally in Bitcoin price. The companies ahead of Strategy (with a $71 billion treasury reserve) on the list are Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Ford, Meta, and General Motors. BTC Treasury Reserve Serves as Strategy’s Growth Catalyst Notably, the company holds Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. In the last five years, it has invested strongly in a Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Within the period above, the company has acquired more than 600,000 Bitcoin and is still looking to buy more. According to its new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Strategy acquired an additional 4,225 Bitcoins for approximately $472.5 million between July 7 and July 13. This purchase increased the company’s total stash to 601,550 BTC, valued at over $70.9 billion at the current price of the firstborn digital asset. Metaplanet Learns From MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Another firm making giant strides with a growing Bitcoin accumulation strategy is Metaplanet. This Japanese financial leader launched this strategy about a year ago and has remained true to it. In the first week of July, it reported a purchase of 2,205 BTC, worth about $238.7 million at the time. Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings climbed to 15,555 BTC as a result of the acquisition. As we advance, the firm aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is approximately 1% of the total supply. This Bitcoin strategy, which mirrors that of the company, has triggered significant growth for Metaplanet. It is currently ranked as the fifth-largest publicly listed company, holding the top cryptocurrency. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin has jumped by 0.39% in the past 24 hours to $117,930.

Daily volumes have also seen an uptick in numbers, rising from $700 million last week to $6.8 billion. Still, while PEPE appears to be enjoying a bullish phase, another frog-themed token, Pepeto, is gaining ground on other memecoins in the market. The “God of Frogs” has raised over $5.5 million in presale, boasting of a fully verified ecosystem. Per several market analysts on socials, Pepeto is a more promising long-term bet than PEPE. Pepe Price Rallies, But Resistance Lies Ahead PEPE’s recent rally is a sight for sore eyes for short-term traders. The memecoin has formed a rounding bottom pattern on the 8-hour chart, with analysts eyeing a breakout above the neckline in the coming sessions. Technical indicators suggest that a move past $0.000014 could push the token toward additional targets at $0.000015 and $0.000016. A closer look at PEPE’s trendlines on the 3-day chart shows a breakdown from an ascending channel earlier this year, mostly caused by macroeconomic pressures, including tariff-related selloffs. Yet, the current recovery momentum has PEPE back in bullish territory. Traders have spotted an entry point on the token’s daily chart between $0.00001330 and $0.00001380, and bulls are in a tug-of-war with bears at the $0.00001600 resistance level. However, PEPE’s year-long performance is a modest 15% gain in the last 12 months. Much of its price surge is controlled by short-term sentiment and volume spikes, but its longer-term possibilities of sustaining a positive market rally is overly reliant on the continuity of the broader crypto market’s bull run. Pepeto’s Frog Power: More Than Just a Meme Pepeto is winning over Pepe investors with a more defined project backed by utility and staking returns that most memecoins skipped over during their market debuts. According to the God of Frogs whitepaper backstory, the new token’s name stands for Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization, six principles that Pepe failed to deliver during its launch till date. Currently priced at $0.000000141, the Pepeto presale has already raised over $5.56 million, attracting a community of committed hodlers ahead of its Tier 1 exchange debut. The team behind the project recently confirmed that all audits, bridge approvals, and documentation verifications have been completed.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $9.57 , driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $22.22 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price rose by over 1.3% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.80 and $2.85, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for July 19 shows that NEAR price continues to rise towards $3.00 NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR climbs past $2.80 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the near protocol price traded in a steady downwards trend since rising toward $3.40. However, recent days observed a sharp shift as NEAR broke out of the channel with bullish momentum. SOL price has increased significantly with buyers climbing back above $2.80 after almost 50 days since crashing below the level. NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView The technical indicators suggest rising bullish momentum as NEAR moves toward $2.90 with the MACD bullish at 0.059 units suggesting steady bullish pressure. The EMAs are around the mean position, and the latest data shows declining bearish pressure. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator rose to 71.29 from below the 50.00 index level; though, it suggests little to no room for further upwards movement in short term. The wide Bollinger Bands suggest increasing volatility, indicating that the $2.850 level resistance may not hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has found strong support at the $2.55 price level enabling the price to recover rapidly to $2.60 as bulls sought to go higher. Despite short retracements, the price has continued to soar, crossing the $2.80 mark in recent hours. NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView The RSI is at 57.88, suggesting that the asset is near the top of the neutral region, which indicates that NEAR price observes steady bullish sentiment with room for movement in either direction.

NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView NEAR observes the bulls crashing into an iron board at the $3.3 mark that has sent the price crumbling back toward the $2 mark. If the bulls are unable to defend the level, any short-term gains made by the asset might be neutralized. As previously expected, the price rose to $2.50 and is expected to continue with the momentum. As such, traders should expect the coin to continue rising towards the $2.70-2.90 mark for the next few days. Key levels to watch are $2.65 and $2.50 with each level suggesting a breakdown from the trend. Is Near Protocol a good investment?

Why is NEAR up? NEAR has found strong support at the $2.55 price level enabling the price to recover rapidly to $2.60 as bulls sought to go higher. Despite short retracements, the price has continued to soar, crossing the $2.80 mark in recent hours. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level. However, analysts believe that this bearish momentum will be short-term, predicting a price range of $2.25 and the $5.5 by the end of 2025. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR protocol price is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the end of 2027. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream.

The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth.

Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction .

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50. June saw further decay as despite the early bullish signals, bears dominated the month and NEAR closed the month around $2.12.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-19 19:00:00

Expert Tells New Investors To Go All In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-over-everything-expert-tells-new-investors-to-go-all-in/,"A well‑known commentator in the crypto space has made a bold pitch. According to reports, Crypto Bitlord urged every new investor to put all their money into XRP. Related Reading: XRP To $13 in 40 Days? Analyst Predicts Explosive Final Rally This call comes after XRP surged to seven‑year highs above $3 and hit a peak of $3.60. The token posted a 21% gain in a single week, outpacing even Bitcoin’s record run. Eye‑Popping Returns Fuel Bold Call Bitlord pointed out that someone who invested $50,000 in XRP at roughly $0.60 last November would now hold about $289,000 as prices hover near $3.47. He reminded followers how XRP broke above $1 during last year’s rally and then climbed beyond the $3 level this summer. This kind of windfall led him to tell new market entrants to skip the usual research and “take all your money and go all into XRP.” If you’re new to crypto, don’t even think or question it. Take all your money and go all into $XRP — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 18, 2025 Bitlord’s track record on XRP has had its twists. In mid‑2023, he touted the token when it traded around $0.50–$0.60, only to walk back those comments the following July. Some saw his pullback as sarcastic, since prices soon climbed past his earlier targets. Based on charts, he has also laid out what he thinks XRP could achieve—calling for dramatic moves that few other analysts dare to mention. Critics And Risks Remain Despite the rally, the altcoin still faces obstacles. Its connection to Ripple and the ongoing US Securities and Exchange Commission legal showdown create uncertainty. A court decision could go either way, and any ruling against Ripple might send the price sharply lower. Other analysts have echoed bullish views, encouraging investors to stack at least 10,000 XRP tokens. They said he won’t sell until XRP reaches $100. That price would value a 10,000‑token stash at $1 million. For many, that goal sounds distant. But analysts point to XRP’s history: it once traded for $0.002, making skeptics eat their words when it hit $1. Sky‑High Targets Or Pipe Dream? Bitlord has even floated a $10 target—an increase of about 180% from today’s levels. He believes some critics will end up “in mental institutions” if XRP ever tops that mark.

Hitting $1,000 would push XRP’s market cap into the trillions, dwarfing most assets on the market today. As the market buzzes, investors face a choice. Some are drawn to XRP’s meteoric rise and rosy forecasts. Others warn against betting everything on a single crypto token. The numbers show a balanced approach—dividing funds across several coins and setting clear exit points—might help guard against the next big swing. For now, XRP remains one of the most talked‑about tokens in the crypto world.

Recently, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) became the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. Unsurprisingly, the growing popularity and acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs appear to be shifting the crypto investment landscape. As recently revealed by a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, BTC investors seem to be favoring a more traditional way to interact with the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Are Bitcoin ETFs A Deviation From BTC’s Decentralization Ethos? In a July 18 post on X, crypto analyst Willy Woo shared that the growth rate of self-custody Bitcoin users has continued to fall over the past year. This growing development, which Woo attributed to the ascent of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, has led to the end of a 15-year trend. This on-chain insight is based on the Glassnode Entities Net Growth metric, which measures the rate at which new users are coming onto a blockchain network per day (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Woo clarified that this metric does not just track addresses but entities, which refer to addresses forensically clustered together into single controlling users. The Entities Net Growth estimates the difference between new entities and “disappearing” entities (entities with a zero balance that had a non–zero balance at the previous timestamp). As observed in the chart below, this metric has been on a downward trend since 2023, which has worsened since the Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the US. This trend suggests that investors are increasingly choosing to enter the Bitcoin market through institutional crypto products like exchange-traded funds rather than by purchasing directly into private crypto wallets. Woo highlighted in a response to a comment on X that this shift could lead to a centralization of the supply. Interestingly, this development somewhat defeats the primary ethos of Bitcoin as defined by Satoshi Nakamoto, which revolves around building a decentralized financial system. However, the belief is that the Bitcoin ETFs are a gateway to crypto investments for people—primarily the older generation—who can’t easily access them via the typical route (self-custody wallets). A crypto community member on X: ETFs didn’t steal users from cold storage… They opened the market to those who were locked behind compliance walls. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,200, reflecting a 0.4% increase in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-19 19:00:30

Historically, such incidents have rattled investors, but Bitcoin is holding firm, trading just below the $120,000 resistance level. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $117,966, showing minimal intraday fluctuations, down 0.21% in the past hour, but up 0.15% over the last 24 hours and 0.36% over the past week.

A portion of the stolen funds was later bridged from Solana ( SOL ) to Ethereum ( ETH ), complicating tracking efforts. CoinDCX’s response According to CoinDCX co-founders Sumit Gupta and Neeraj Khandelwal, the compromised account was an internal operational wallet used for liquidity provisioning on a partner exchange. They also assured users that customer wallets remain unaffected, as these are segregated from the breached infrastructure.

The exchange is now working with forensic agencies and partners to trace and potentially recover the stolen assets. It also plans to introduce a bug bounty program to strengthen its security protocols. More broadly, the CoinDCX hack adds to a growing list of exchange vulnerabilities in 2025. According to a Finbold report , global cryptocurrency exchanges lost $2.24 billion to various attacks in the first half of the year. Among the most notable incidents was the $48 million hack of Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, an attack partially linked to geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel.

This development is especially notable in countries that have long supported innovation in the space. But what is perhaps even more striking is how it is now nudging governments that were once wary of crypto to reconsider their approaches. Nations that previously took a critical or restrictive view are finding it harder to maintain old positions as the use of digital assets spreads and their potential becomes more visible across industries and communities. Global Policy Is Being Redrawn as Crypto Use Surges In India, the crypto market has grown in size and energy despite government efforts to limit it through heavy taxes and unclear rules. Prominent crypto voices believe the government will soon be pushed to make meaningful changes. According to them, a growing wave of stock and forex traders is shifting toward crypto, not deterred by the one percent tax collected on each transaction or the thirty percent flat tax on profits. This ongoing activity has created a strong user base that policymakers can no longer ignore. Crypto Comeback in India? 🇮🇳After a brutal 30% tax in 2022 drove 90% of crypto trading offshore, tides may be turning. As per the FT , the Indian government is holding weekly policy talks, and tax cuts are on the table.Analysts can see India’s crypto market growing 6x by… pic.twitter.com/leT2xttByQ — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 27, 2025 The signs are showing even within India’s political circles. Calls have been made for the country to consider creating a Bitcoin reserve, drawing inspiration from the United States. This comes after the US Genius Act set up requirements for stablecoins to be fully backed by safe assets like the dollar, reflecting a push to formalize crypto’s presence in the wider financial system. The Genius Act is not without critics, especially those worried about risks to consumers if tech firms are allowed to act like financial institutions without full oversight. Still, the key outcome is that it places crypto inside national-level policy discussions, giving it a seat at the table. These shifts are not limited to India and the US. Worldwide, the growing use of blockchain applications in payments, investment, and business operations is quietly pushing governments to rethink earlier positions. What once seemed like a market confined to tech enthusiasts and early adopters has transformed into something governments must address seriously. It is not only about regulation or control, but also about understanding how the asset class fits into the future of finance. Progress may be slow in some regions, but with demand showing no sign of fading, the pressure on governments to adapt is only expected to build further. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Policies Turn Pro Crypto Amid Bull Market Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is built to serve as the backbone of a multi-chain platform designed for seamless interaction across decentralized finance. Unlike wallets that simply store assets, Best Wallet functions as a complete toolkit where users can swap tokens, stake holdings, explore decentralized applications, and manage portfolios across networks like Ethereum, Solana, and others. Its core strength lies in making this experience accessible, reducing the need for external platforms or cumbersome transfers between chains. What makes Best Wallet Token stand out now is its relevance in a market where institutional and individual interest is expanding, driven partly by regulatory shifts like the Genius Act. As the demand for secure and versatile tools rises, projects offering integrated services are likely to benefit from a broader user base. Best Wallet’s ongoing development includes plans to add more staking pools, governance features, and partnerships with emerging decentralized applications, all designed to strengthen its ecosystem. For users, this means they are not just holding a token but gaining entry to an evolving financial platform. In the current environment, where blockchain’s role in mainstream finance is under review globally, having a tool that allows people to participate in DeFi without added complexity holds strong appeal. Best Wallet Token is positioning itself as a useful gateway for those looking to navigate the expanding digital asset space with confidence and simplicity, making it a project that aligns well with both present needs and the direction the sector is moving toward. Token 6900 Token 6900 has recently been introduced as one of the most curious additions to the meme coin landscape, but behind its humorous surface lies a project with noteworthy layers. While many meme tokens depend purely on social media buzz, Token 6900 has been focusing on building interactive features within its ecosystem, including community challenges, NFT integrations, and rewards structures aimed at keeping holders engaged. These are not just gimmicks but mechanisms that create real utility, helping the token carve out space beyond the typical rise-and-fall pattern seen in many meme-driven assets. What adds intrigue right now is the context of growing blockchain adoption. As nations grapple with crypto regulation, tokens that combine entertainment with functionality may end up playing an unexpected role in drawing new users into the space. Token 6900 has plans to integrate micro-transactions within partner platforms, allowing its coin to be used for small-scale purchases, tipping, or game-related activities. This adds a layer of use that goes beyond trading. The project’s endorsements have come from top creators across the crypto space, an example being ClayBro , who has speculated it to be a top gainer meme coin in the coming weeks or months. Importantly, in a market shaped by shifting policy and rising mainstream participation, Token 6900 offers a lighthearted yet structured entry point. While it may not claim to revolutionize finance, its approach reflects a corner of the crypto world where culture, community, and blockchain use meet. With regulators looking to balance innovation and oversight, such tokens could become quiet participants in expanding crypto’s everyday reach, providing entertainment while still holding onto real-world application. Snorter Snorter operates as an AI-powered bot service built within Telegram, offering users the ability to monitor, analyze, and act on crypto market movements with remarkable speed. At its heart, Snorter is designed to make trading insights and automation tools available to everyday users without requiring them to manage complex systems. From tracking wallet flows to identifying token launches and executing preset commands, the bot brings a set of practical features that tap into the demand for efficient and accessible crypto engagement. What strengthens Snorter’s appeal is how it fits into the wider market conversation. As countries formalize crypto rules, from the Genius Act in the US to growing debates in Asia, platforms that enable informed, responsive participation are becoming more valuable. Snorter’s tools cater to a wide range of traders, from beginners looking for alerts to experienced users who want to automate strategies directly inside their messaging app. Its roadmap includes plans for multi-platform integration, allowing Snorter’s services to expand beyond Telegram and into other communication tools. This could further solidify its place as a practical layer between users and the increasingly complex crypto market. In a world where regulatory frameworks are being written to bring digital assets into broader financial systems, Snorter offers a straightforward way for people to stay engaged, informed, and ready to act, reflecting the type of functional innovation that tends to thrive as the space matures. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is an ambitious Layer 2 solution designed to tackle Bitcoin’s most persistent challenges: speed, cost, and scalability. While Bitcoin remains the most widely recognized digital asset, its network has long been criticized for being slow and expensive when handling high volumes of transactions. Bitcoin Hyper aims to address these problems by creating an additional layer where transactions can be processed more quickly and at a fraction of the usual cost, all while remaining anchored to Bitcoin’s secure main chain. What makes Bitcoin Hyper particularly interesting now is how its mission aligns with the broader policy and regulatory shifts unfolding worldwide. As governments start formalizing crypto’s place within national financial systems, solutions like Bitcoin Hyper could play a key role in expanding Bitcoin’s practical use. By enabling micro-payments, decentralized applications, and more efficient smart contracts on Bitcoin, the project moves the currency beyond its reputation as just a store of value. Having raised over $3 million, Bitcoin Hyper’s token serves multiple purposes within this ecosystem, from paying network fees to staking for governance. This gives holders a role not just as investors, but as participants helping shape the platform’s development. In a world where the demand for blockchain solutions is pushing governments to rethink their stance, Bitcoin Hyper offers a concrete example of how innovation can open new doors for a legacy asset like Bitcoin. With the digital asset space becoming more intertwined with formal financial systems, Bitcoin Hyper positions itself as a project that could amplify Bitcoin’s relevance in the next chapter of crypto adoption. Conclusion As blockchain use continues to grow and governments reshape their approaches, the moment feels increasingly important for anyone watching the digital asset space. What was once viewed with hesitation is now becoming part of official discussions, with regulation aiming to match the pace of innovation. This creates a landscape where well-designed projects can thrive, offering real tools and services rather than passing trends. Given the way policy shifts are unfolding worldwide, the cryptos mentioned above are all worth considering right now. They reflect the kind of development that meets both current needs and future potential, making them notable picks as the market moves through this new phase.

Since artificial intelligence has taken center stage in data analytics, it can predict market behavior by leveraging past experience, new trends, and the foundation of technology. AI models trained on macroeconomic trends, blockchain implementation curves, and tokenomics predict that five crypto coins will receive the largest positive emoticon in 2025, making them the best long-term bets to grow your $2,000-dollar portfolio to at least $5 million by 2032. Leading the pack is $LILPEPE, followed by four other high-performing, yet still undervalued, launched tokens. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme-Chain Revolution That’s Built Different Currently in Stage 5 of its presale with a price of $0.0014, Little Pepe is not just another memecoin—it’s a full-fledged Layer 2 blockchain optimized for meme tokens. It fuses meme culture with Ethereum scaling, offering ultra-low fees, warp-speed security, and finality faster than most L2s on the market. But what truly sets Little Pepe apart is its sniper bot-proof infrastructure and a dedicated Launchpad for deploying meme-based projects without the fear of rug pulls or manipulation. The roadmap is ahead of schedule, already hitting milestones like a CoinMarketCap listing and forming strategic partnerships with anonymous experts who helped shape top meme projects like SHIB and FLOKI. With zero tax, built-in staking rewards, and plans for listings on two top-tier exchanges, AI models project a realistic price trajectory toward $1 or higher by 2032, especially as the Layer 2 narrative for niche sectors gains momentum. A $2,000 allocation today could yield over 1.4 million tokens—a potential $1.4 million bag if it reaches that $1 mark. Polygon ($MATIC): The Ethereum Scaling Giant With Institutional Momentum Institutional relationships, high-profile integrations, and real-world use cases keep Polygon one of the most resilient Layer 2 ecosystems. MATIC powers NFT platforms like DraftKings and DeSo and works with Adobe and Disney at a pricing below $1. Polygon’s future hinges on its successful zkEVM development, its ability to tokenize real-world assets, and its deep integration into Ethereum’s upcoming scalability phases. AI projections see MATIC hitting between $40–$60 by 2032 as institutional capital continues flowing into Ethereum-based infrastructure. A $2,000 allocation today could reasonably secure over 2,000 MATIC tokens, which would convert into over $100,000–$120,000 at its upper-end projection. Pair that with This Layer 2 juggernaut, which offers staking yields and long-term ecosystem growth, and holds significant potential for exponential gains. Arbitrum ($ARB): The DeFi Titan Among Ethereum L2s Launched in 2023 and quickly dominating the Layer 2 narrative, Arbitrum ($ARB) has become a DeFi heavyweight, hosting thousands of dApps, and locking billions in total value. As of 2025, Arbitrum remains undervalued, considering its superior throughput, low fees, and its core role in Ethereum’s scaling future, at around $0.70–$1.00. What makes ARB attractive to AI algorithms is its organic user growth, consistent developer activity, and upcoming proposals for ARB staking and protocol upgrades. Analysts anticipate its long-term value climbing as high as $150 by 2032, driven by global adoption of decentralized finance and Ethereum’s maturing roadmap. A $2,000 investment today could potentially yield a 7-figure valuation if market cap expansion matches Ethereum’s historical growth curve. Optimism ($OP): Redefining Governance and Public Goods Funding Optimism is a Layer 2 Ethereum solution with a difference—it’s not just about scaling but also sustainable governance and retroactive public goods funding. With its Optimism Collective and Token House model, the OP token facilitates both gas fee reduction and future incentive mechanisms for developers and contributors. As the blockchain world increasingly focuses on decentralized funding for infrastructure, Optimism’s positioning gives it long-term relevance. Priced under $2, Optimism is seen by AI models as a future governance giant, especially with continued integration into Coinbase’s Base L2 and other ecosystem bridges. At a forecasted price between $80 and $100 by 2032, a $2,000 allocation could be worth $ 100,000 or more, depending on adoption speed and token utility expansion. Avalanche ($AVAX): The High-Speed Multi-Chain Innovator As a competitor to Ethereum, Avalanche is a collaborative Layer 1 that can be easily integrated into subnet systems, GameFi activities, and enterprise-level tokenization. Developers who want speedy deployment without Ethereum's congestion choose AVAX's fast transaction finality and customized chains. AVAX is trading below $40, and AI models track traditional financial adoption. As institutions adopt tokenized securities, carbon credits, and CBDCs, Avalanche's multi-chain platform stands out. The creeping whales could potentially yield 10x-20x returns if AVAX increases to $500-700 by 2032. Without stakes and subnets, a $ 2,000 stake can be worth $100,000 to $140,000. Summary: With a smart $2,000, you can invest in a multi-million dollar future. The key to turning $2,000 into $5 million by 2032 isn’t chasing short-term hype but staking long-term positions in infrastructure-driven, culturally resonant, and utility-backed tokens. Little Pepe leads this AI-curated list by combining meme virality with authentic technical architecture, followed by Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche, all of which play essential roles in the blockchain economy’s future. These are AI-driven, data-driven estimates based on narrative convenience, developer activity, tokenomics, and macroeconomic compatibility. In five precise actions, you can turn $2,000 into generational wealth.

This information comes from a report published by the international organization. According to the document, the government wallet, Chivo, ”does not adjust its bitcoin reserves according to changes in customer deposits.” Since the Chivo wallet does not sell assets, this results in ”minor” discrepancies (no more than 1%). According to the Fund’s experts, this creates the impression that the country's public sector is accumulating cryptocurrency. The government of the Latin American country plans to receive a $1.4 billion loan from the IMF under a 40-month program. Taking into account additional financing from the Inter-American Development Bank and other regional institutions, the total amount of the package may exceed $3.5 billion. As part of the agreements with the Fund, the Salvadoran authorities have pledged to adjust their current bitcoin strategy. As early as January, lawmakers made the necessary changes to regulations, which included: Withdrawing government support for the Chivo wallet Mandating that taxes be paid only in U.S. dollars Limiting transactions with bitcoin for the public sector Making the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments voluntary for individuals However, according to Stacy Herbert, head of the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador continued to build up its crypto reserves ”at an accelerated pace,” despite the agreement. At that time, authorities reportedly held 5,980.8 BTC. In May, the IMF warned the government to stop buying cryptocurrency, stating that a staff-level agreement had been reached. At the same time, according to data from the Bitcoin Office, bitcoin inflows continued regularly. On May 19, the authorities added another 1 BTC to the balance, bringing the reserves to 6,242 BTC. Attached to the IMF report is a letter of intent addressed to IMF chief Christina Georgieva, dated June 11. In the message, Douglas Pablo Rodriguez Fuentes, President of the Central Bank of El Salvador, and Rogelio Posada Molina, Minister of Finance of El Salvador, assured: ”In line with program commitments, the amount of bitcoin held by the public sector remains unchanged, and we are taking steps to mitigate fiscal risks by reducing our role in the Chivo wallet and rethinking the BTC project.” El Salvador has been mining bitcoin at a state-owned geothermal power plant since 2021. The initiative was launched on a trial basis about a month after the law recognizing bitcoin as legal tender came into force.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-19 19:26:28

Both offer unique features and potential for growth this quarter. Evaluating their strengths and market trends could reveal which might be the more lucrative choice. Delve into the analysis to uncover which cryptocurrency stands out as the better investment opportunity. Chainlink Price Analysis: Recent Surge Amid Lingering Downtrend Chainlink experienced a strong monthly surge of 37.04% and a weekly jump of 17.66%, reflecting renewed investor interest even as the coin faced a longer-term decline of -25.80% over the past six months. Price movements were marked by a rally that temporarily overpowered lingering bearish sentiment, hinting at the potential for short-term recovery. Volatility increased as buyers pushed prices upward while earlier downtrends continued to influence overall performance. The coin’s behavior indicates that recent activity is not yet strong enough to completely reverse persistent challenges seen over the half-year period, suggesting that investor sentiment has shifted in spurts rather than establishing a consistent upward trend. Current Chainlink prices trade between $11.00 and $15.70, reflecting mixed market forces. Immediate resistance is at $18.03, with a second resistance level at $22.73, while support holds near $8.63 and stronger backing around $3.93. The RSI at 77.02 indicates an overbought condition, suggesting caution among traders despite recent rallies. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at 3.03 and Momentum near 3.71 underscore the balance between bullish enthusiasm and lingering bearish pressure. Bulls push prices upward, yet bears maintain influence within a defined range. The market lacks a clear trend, with sentiment oscillating between optimism and skepticism. Traders may consider short-term strategies, watching for breakthroughs above $18.03 or taking profits near resistance levels while setting stop orders near support thresholds. Polkadot's Shifting Dynamics Amid Key Price Zones Polkadot has shown mixed behavior with a notable rise over the last month, advancing nearly 18% while a week-long push of around 9% suggests short-term bullish activity. Over the past six months, the coin has relaxed by roughly 31%, indicating a longer-term pullback despite recent recoveries. Price fluctuations have provided opportunities as the asset oscillated between retracements and spurts in momentum. Sudden accelerations followed by steady recoveries have painted a picture of a coin testing significant price thresholds over multiple intervals. Current price action reflects a trading range between $2.83 and $4.16, with the nearest support around $2.26 and resistance at approximately $4.92. A secondary support exists near $0.93, while another target resistance is seen at $6.25. Momentum indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator of 0.549 and a momentum read of 0.66, combined with an RSI of nearly 69, highlight a market nearing overbought conditions. Bulls seem active in the short term, yet persistent lower levels caution a balanced outlook without a clearly defined trend. Prices testing key boundaries suggest traders might consider cautious entries near support with conservative targets while monitoring resistance levels for potential reversals or breakouts. Conclusion LINK shows consistent growth due to its strong position in the market. DOT 's diverse use cases offer significant future potential. Both coins have unique strengths. LINK excels in data integration, while DOT focuses on interoperability. Investors might consider LINK for stability and DOT for innovation. Evaluating specific goals can guide the choice. Both present viable options this quarter. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-xrp-price-rally-beyond-20-heres-the-timeline/,"Technical analyst and prominent XRP community member, XRPunkie, has shared an ambitious price target for XRP , forecasting a rally to over $20 within the current market cycle. The analysis was posted on X alongside a detailed monthly price chart illustrating key breakout levels and potential trajectories for the asset. In the tweet, XRPunkie described the outlook as “Just simple Technical Analysis,” asserting confidently, “Target of $20+- $XRP is a given. It shall happen by the end of this cycle.” The attached chart presents a long-term view of XRP/USD on the Bitstamp exchange, highlighting prior peaks, trend lines, and an aggressive upward projection marked at approximately $20.25. The chart illustrated a historical breakout pattern similar to the 2017–2018 bull run, with price action appearing to replicate a steep parabolic advance. At the time of the post, XRP was trading slightly above $3.45 on the monthly chart. Just simple Technical Analysis. Target of $20+- $XRP is a given.

XRPunkie responded with two possible scenarios based on market momentum and historical patterns. According to the analyst, the rally could extend into the fourth quarter of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026. However, he also noted the possibility of the parabolic move completing much sooner, saying, “Or it could just completely finish its parabolic run by end Aug early Sept which is 30-60 days from now.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart Highlights Historical Breakout Patterns The chart accompanying the analysis demonstrated a clear breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern, with previous resistance levels now acting as support. Arrows on the chart drew parallels between the 2017 breakout and the current move, showing similar steep upward price movement. A labeled marker near the projected top indicated the specific price target of $20.25, aligning with the broader technical narrative outlined by XRPunkie. Confidence in Reaching $20 This Cycle The forecast comes amid broader optimism in digital asset markets and increasing institutional interest in blockchain-based payment solutions. Although no specific external catalysts were cited, the analysis focused exclusively on price structure, historical patterns, and cyclical behavior observed on the long-term chart. By providing both a price target and a flexible timeline, XRPunkie’s commentary underscores a belief in the technical strength of the current market phase while acknowledging that timing can vary depending on market dynamics. Whether the price rally concludes as early as late August or stretches into early 2026, the analyst maintained confidence that the $20 region would be reached within this cycle.

Ousting Powell would cause an uptick in US Treasury yields, driving up the government’s interest spending amid concerns over surging inflation and growing political uncertainty. According to Telegraph , investors watch Treasury yields closely because they reflect the government’s cost of borrowing and the economy’s health. Gennadiy Goldberg of TD Securities said firing the Fed chair could add about $58 billion to the yearly interest cost. This week, the president hinted he could dismiss the Fed chair because renovating the central bank’s headquarters went $2.5 billion over budget. Following Wednesday’s reports that he was ready to move at once, Trump told reporters, “I don’t rule out anything but I think it’s highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud.” Trump has frequently taken aim at Powell, labeling him a “numbskull” over what he perceives as unnecessarily slow rate reductions. As chair of the Federal Reserve, Powell serves a four-year term and plays a central role in shaping U.S. monetary policy, including setting interest rates. Experts warn that removing him, or even signaling political pressure, could make investors demand much higher interest rates, since they’d fear the Fed might be swayed by politics and lose its power to keep inflation in check. $58 billion estimate covers only part of the picture Goldberg added that long-term Treasury yields might climb by 20–50 basis points (with each basis point equal to 0.01%), edging 20‑ and 30‑year rates toward approximately 5.5%. He calculated this uptick would amount to an additional $58 billion in annual interest on the roughly $276 billion of 30‑year and $168 billion of 20‑year securities the Treasury rolls out each year. The estimate covers only 20 and 30 year bonds and does not include other maturities like 10 year notes, which could also see rates climb. This projection assumes yield levels remain stable and that the government’s debt issuance strategy stays the same. “If interest rates jump, the debt burden could very quickly become unsustainable,” Goldberg warned. Alex Everett, a fund manager at Aberdeen, suggested that in a span of two to three months, this shock could push 30‑year yields up by an entire percentage point, approaching 6%. That scenario would represent the sharpest upswing in US bond yields since the early‑1980s Volcker period, when then‑Fed chair Paul Volcker aggressively raised rates to tame inflation. Everett pointed out that today’s rise would reflect market concerns over the Fed’s ability to curb inflation, rather than its success in doing so. “[Markets will think] inflation will not be kept under control by an institution that exists to moderate the economy,” he said. Firing Fed chair could trigger political and fiscal volatility Removing a Fed chair could also spark wagers on heightened political instability and looser fiscal spending. “It would be a very key progression point in Trump’s agenda; you’d assume the next logical step is that he can push harder on other things,” Mr Everett said. He added that elevated Treasury yields would probably weigh on the dollar, inflicting losses on investors. This increase would coincide with interest outlays, now about 3.2% of federal expenditures, expected to rise to roughly 6.1% by 2054, if Mr Trump’s budget proposals are adopted, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. At the same time, higher Treasury yields would push mortgage rates, already around 7%, even higher. This will slow down the housing market to its weakest in 30 years.

The change was announced on July 18, 2025, and will go into effect before trading begins on July 23. Following the announcement, Block’s shares (ticker: XYZ) surged 8.5% in premarket trading to $79, according to TradingView . The company’s market capitalization now stands at $44.8 billion. Investors reacted strongly to the news, and analysts expect Block’s inclusion in the S&P 500 will significantly increase demand for its shares among institutional investors. The cryptocurrency community also welcomed the move, viewing it as further evidence of mainstream acceptance of the industry. Block currently holds 8,584 BTC, actively integrates bitcoin into its services, and is pursuing its own bitcoin accumulation strategy, the community noted. “It’s not just a headline. It’s trillions of passive streams gradually approaching bitcoin,” emphasized the Wise Advice account on X (formerly Twitter). Admission to the S&P 500 index is governed by strict financial criteria. Companies must: Record positive net income over the most recent four quarters (on a GAAP basis) Achieve a market capitalization above $18 billion Maintain sufficient liquidity According to many experts, Block has long met these requirements. Matthew Siegel, VanEck’s head of digital research, noted in January 2025 that Block was set to become the first public company with a bitcoin strategy accepted into the index. Analysts also frequently compare Block to Coinbase, which became the first cryptocurrency platform included in the S&P 500 this past May. Following that inclusion, the market speculated on which company would be next. Many expected MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, to follow, but Block was ultimately selected first. Earlier, Block also announced the launch of bitcoin payments within its Square division. The Lightning Network protocol will be used for instant transactions, with a public demonstration taking place at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

With macroeconomic shifts, growing ETF adoption, and limited supply dynamics driving long-term price, many analysts are pointing towards an ambitious $300,000 price target by 2025. At the same time, a new project within the crypto world— Ozak AI (OZ) —is shooting early investor attention with its AI-powered utility and low access price of $0.005. As BTC solidifies its location as a store of value, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most compelling AI-token narratives of this cycle. Bitcoin’s Path to $300,000 The current price of Bitcoin hovers around $117,546, and recent technical setups indicate a robust upward trend. The introduction and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have performed a pivotal position in onboarding traditional capital into crypto markets. Additionally, institutional adoption is at an all-time high, with banks, asset managers, or even governments exploring Bitcoin either as an asset or a reserve hedge. Bitcoin’s shortage is a major driving force. With the handiest 21 million BTC ever to exist—and almost 93% already mined—the supply shock from increasing demand is growing bullish strain. The 2024 halving event has similarly reduced block rewards, intensifying the scarcity effect. All these elements set the level for a major upward movement that might push BTC in the direction of the $300K mark through 2025, specifically in bullish macro surroundings. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Support and Resistance Levels Bitcoin’s ascending channel pattern on TradingView highlights a well-defined bullish trajectory, where price consistently respects upper resistance and lower support boundaries. Within this pattern, three key resistance levels to watch are: $130,000, a short-term breakout target. $180,000, an area that aligns with Fibonacci extension zones. $300,000, the projected cycle top based on institutional momentum. On the downside, Bitcoin has solid structural supports at: $105,000, the lower boundary of the ascending channel. $92,000, a strong accumulation zone from recent months. $78,000, a critical psychological level and base for long-term buyers. These levels collectively indicate that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further gains, with each dip offering potential buying opportunities. Ozak AI: The Next Big Thing in AI and Blockchain Integration While Bitcoin garners attention as a store-of-value asset, Ozak AI (OZ) is turning heads with its futuristic approach to decentralized artificial intelligence. Ozak AI is presently in Stage 4 of its presale , priced at simply $0.005, and has already raised over $1.3 million—a clear indicator of early traction. The project aims to create a decentralized AI ecosystem in which customers can leverage blockchain-secured AI gear for predictive analytics, automated workflows, intelligent agents, and greater. As the global interest in AI continues to bounce, Ozak AI gives an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize at the intersection of two mega traits: AI and crypto. The tokenomics of OZ are designed to help long-term growth, with a capped supply, deflationary mechanisms, and real-world AI utilities that move far past hype. If the challenge hits its $1 target, early traders should see a 200x return, placing it some of the highest potential ROI performances of the current cycle. Why BTC and Ozak AI Could Dominate the 2025 Narrative Bitcoin and Ozak AI may represent two ends of the crypto spectrum, but their investment theses complement each other. Bitcoin offers macroeconomic resilience, institutional adoption, and global recognition. Ozak AI brings innovative utility, early-stage upside, and exposure to one of the most disruptive technologies of the century. In a maturing crypto market, smart investors are looking for both security and opportunity. Bitcoin provides the former, acting as a foundational asset for portfolios. Ozak AI offers the latter, serving as a high-upside play with clear demand in AI-focused sectors like finance, logistics, marketing, and healthcare. If Bitcoin does reach $300,000 via 2025, it might mark a 2.5x increase from present levels—a big pass for a trillion-dollar asset. Simultaneously, if Ozak AI hits its $1 milestone, early investors at the $0.005 level ought to see exquisite profits. The contrasting risk-reward profiles of these assets cause them to ideal opposite numbers for a different crypto portfolio. Bitcoin stays the king, but new narratives like Ozak AI are proving that the next era of crypto increase could be driven via utility, innovation, and AI integration. For investors looking to role themselves for the following wave of crypto possibility, each BTC and OZ offer awesome, powerful paths to long-term price introduction. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

Nevertheless, the price has now reached a critical order block around the $3.7K range, suggesting a potential period of consolidation before any further upside continuation. Technical Analysis By Shayan ETH Price Analysis: The Daily Chart ETH has continued its bullish advance, reclaiming the significant psychological resistance at $3.5K. This move underscores strong market demand and growing investor confidence. Adding to the bullish narrative, the 100-day moving average is nearing a crossover above the 200-day MA (currently around $ 2,476), signaling a potential golden cross —a classic long-term bullish indicator. Should it materialise, it could act as a catalyst for further upside momentum toward Ethereum’s all-time high. However, the price is currently approaching a key supply zone (order block) in the $3.6K–$3.7K range. This zone is likely to introduce short-term headwinds, and a period of consolidation or mild correction is probable before any sustained breakout can occur. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has demonstrated impressive strength, slicing through multiple resistance levels with conviction. The recent rally above the $3.5K zone reflects intensified buying pressure; however, the price action now finds itself boxed in between the $3.5K support and the $3.8K resistance. This narrow range suggests a consolidation phase is underway. A short-term retracement toward the $3.5K level, now a potential support, is anticipated. If buyers defend this level, it could serve as a launchpad for a breakout above the upper boundary of the current range. Until then, continued sideways movement within this channel remains the most probable outcome. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan The Ethereum Futures Volume Bubble Map reveals clear signs of market overheating, especially in the regions highlighted by yellow circles. These zones show concentrated bursts in futures trading volume, signalling a sharp increase in leveraged positioning. This is often associated with short-term market euphoria and momentum-driven rallies. In ETH’s case, the surge in futures activity appears to have driven the recent price appreciation. On the other hand, Ethereum’s Spot Volume Bubble Map paints a more subdued picture. Despite the strong upward price action, spot trading volumes have remained relatively flat and show no signs of overheating. This divergence suggests that while leveraged futures traders are aggressively participating, spot market buyers remain cautious or inactive, implying a lack of fundamental demand backing the move. The current state of the market raises a key question: Can speculative futures-driven momentum evolve into broader spot market participation? If spot buyers begin entering the market in force, it would validate the rally and potentially expand it across the broader altcoin space.

Topping this list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a meme-powered Layer 2 blockchain that is making serious waves with its lightning-fast speed, ultra-low fees, and massive meme appeal. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Magic Meets Layer 2 Power If you missed early Dogecoin or Pepe Coin, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is your second chance. But LILPEPE isn’t just another meme token; it’s a Layer 2 blockchain with real utility, low transaction fees, and blazing speeds. It combines Ethereum scalability with meme virality, a hybrid formula that’s turning heads across crypto Twitter and major investor circles. Currently in Stage 5 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at just $0.0014, up 40% since the presale launched. Over 4.99 billion tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.47 million, and Stage 4 sold out faster than expected, signaling strong demand. CoinMarketCap has already listed LILPEPE, boosting visibility ahead of its full launch. According to ChatGPT’s analysis, LILPEPE could soar by 4000%, targeting $0.057 by November 2025. With a growing community, a Layer 2 infrastructure, and a thriving presale, Little Pepe is emerging as July’s number 1 cheap crypto to invest in. Little Pepe isn’t just attracting attention from retail investors; it’s also backed by anonymous experts who have successfully launched some of today’s most iconic meme coins. Their involvement adds credibility and behind-the-scenes muscle to LILPEPE’s meme-driven mission. Add to that the $777,000 giveaway, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each, and it’s clear this project is not only scaling fast but also rewarding its early supporters. With over 45,000 entries, this giveaway is drawing massive engagement and expanding LILPEPE’s already passionate community. Cronos (CRO): Undervalued Exchange Giant Next on the list is Cronos (CRO). CRO, which was previously valued at only $0.10, has seen a 16% increase recently, as more people are utilizing it on DeFi and exchange platforms. A breakout above $0.12 could signal the start of a new bullish phase. ChatGPT's technical model predicts that the price might rise to $4.10, which would be a 4,000% increase from its current value. With deep liquidity, exchange integration, and growing use cases in DeFi, Cronos is a strong buy for investors in July, seeking a fundamentally sound, low-cost token with moonshot potential. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Meme OG Poised for Rebound PEPE is starting to stabilize, despite dropping 10% last week. The 14-day RSI indicates that the momentum is neutral, and the token is near the 50-day moving average, which is often a sign of a potential positive reversal. The risk-to-reward ratio is 7:1, with a critical entry point at $0.00001376 and a target price of $0.0005, which is a 4000% increase. If sentiment around meme coins continues to rise, PEPE could deliver a sharp rally, making it one of July’s best speculative plays under a penny. VeChain (VET): Real-World Utility, Unreal Growth Potential VeChain (VET) stands out as the most enterprise-focused of the bunch. Focused on supply chain transparency, VET has been integrated into systems used by giants in retail, logistics, and pharmaceuticals. Technically, VET is forming a double bottom above the 200-day EMA, accompanied by a bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart. Support is at $0.020, and resistance is at $0.025. If it breaks this range, VET could quickly rise to $0.84, representing a 4,000% increase from its current value. VeChain is a suitable choice for long-term investors, as it has a low market capitalization and numerous real-world applications. This makes it a good option compared to other utility tokens and meme coins. Conclusion: Little Pepe Leads the Charge in July If you’re looking for the best cheap cryptos to invest in this July, these four tokens—especially Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —should be on your radar. Each token offers distinct strengths, but Little Pepe stands out with its unique blend of meme energy, real-world utility, low entry price, and substantial growth potential. As the crypto market heats up, July may be your last chance to buy in before these coins explode 4000% or more by November 2025.

This came hours after on-chain investigators flagged unusual activity. The company says customer funds are safe and operations remain unaffected. Investigators Raise Early Alarm Over Wallet Security Concerns about wallet security rose on Saturday after blockchain trackers ZachXBT and Cyvers noticed suspicious fund movements from CoinDCX. This activity happened nearly 17 hours before the exchange made its statement. CoinDCX later confirmed that one of its internal wallets had been breached. However, it was quickly pointed out that customer funds were not affected. The affected wallet was separate from user funds, which are kept in cold storage. The company states that all trading activities and rupee withdrawals are operating as usual. To manage the loss, CoinDCX will use its treasury funds. This means users will not bear any loss from the incident. In related news, Arcadia Finance, a DeFi platform on Coinbase’s Base blockchain, was exploited for around $2.5 million, adding to the wave of 2025 DeFi breaches. CoinDCX Begins Investigation, Brings in Security Experts In response, the company has engaged cybersecurity partners to investigate the cause of the breach. These teams will help trace the movement of funds, close any loopholes, and find out how the attacker gained access. The exchange is also working with its partner platforms to block and recover the stolen assets. In addition, CoinDCX says it will introduce a bug bounty programme. The plan is to invite independent security researchers to report vulnerabilities in exchange for a reward, thereby improving overall wallet security in the long term. Meanwhile, to protect the public from scammers, Shenzhen’s financial authorities have issued a fresh warning. They caution that some dishonest businesses are using popular terms like financial innovation and digital assets to deceive people. WazirX Breach Last Year Still Fresh in Industry Minds The timing of this breach has reminded many in the crypto space of what happened last year with WazirX, another top Indian exchange. Reports indicated that the attack led to a loss of over $200 million and was later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. It is essential to add that earlier this year, North Korea’s Lazarus Group was also linked to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack . While the CoinDCX case is not as large, it has once again highlighted the risks associated with wallet security and the need for stronger protection systems in cryptocurrency exchanges.

Immediate resistance is seen near $0.04435, a level that has capped recent upside attempts and remains crucial for any breakout. Sustained buying pressure near the current range could push CHZ out of consolidation, signalling a potential short-term bullish breakout in the Chiliz market.

Optimistic forecasts extend into 2031, suggesting potential peaks up to $1.19. Chiliz historic price sentiment CHZ Price History CHZ saw significant volatility, starting strong in December 2021 at $0.2834 but dropping sharply by March 2022 to $0.2830. This period reflected intense speculative activity and price discovery in the cryptocurrency market. The price of CHZ continued to decline from $0.2830 in April to $0.1221 by July 2022. This decline marked a period of correction after previous highs, with market sentiment turning bearish amidst broader market volatility. CHZ rebounded strongly from $0.1221 in August to $0.1656 by November 2022. This recovery period suggested renewed investor confidence and a bullish trend emerging in the cryptocurrency. CHZ experienced mixed sentiment from December 2022 to March 2023, rising from $0.1002 to $0.1497 before dropping to $0.0773 by July 2023 due to market corrections and cautious sentiment. The price recovered from $0.0773 in August to $0.1078 by November 2023, reflecting renewed interest and positive developments. It continued its upward trend into December 2023. CHZ started 2024 at $0.0998, climbing to $0.1497 by March amid bullish sentiment, but dropped to $0.0759 by June due to market corrections and cautious sentiment. By late 2024, CHZ stabilized between $0.07 and $0.08, showing minor fluctuations and a gradual recovery in December, reflecting renewed buying interest. For January 2025, Chiliz maintained stability around $0.081, showing consistent performance without significant spikes or drops, likely reflecting steady market sentiment. In February and March, CHZ traded within a tight range between $0.080 and $0.085, reflecting low volatility and neutral sentiment. Despite growing interest in sports-based blockchain platforms, CHZ lacked the momentum to break out of its consolidation zone. April 2025 brought a moderate upward push as the token crossed the $0.090 mark, boosted by improved sentiment across the broader crypto market and growing adoption narratives within Chiliz’s ecosystem. The price gradually climbed, reflecting mild bullish activity. In May, CHZ sustained its upward trajectory, reaching $0.038 by the end of the month. This was accompanied by rising trading volumes and improved technical outlooks, hinting at increasing investor interest. By June 2025, CHZ gained traction and began showing stronger bullish signals, moving toward the $0.040 zone. This period marked the beginning of renewed accumulation, likely driven by upcoming ecosystem announcements and validator developments. As of mid-July 2025, CHZ trades at approximately $0.0422, extending its climb from early-year levels. The token has shown consistent growth from its January base, supported by real-world integrations like PSG’s validator launch and ecosystem expansion, positioning it favorably in the Web3 sports narrative.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|CHZ|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-19 20:00:00

Analysts Project 100x ROI for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as Presale Momentum Accelerates,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/from-0-03-to-3-analysts-project-100x-roi-for-mutuum-finance-mutm-as-presale-momentum-accelerates/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become one of the most talked-about presale tokens this summer, and for good reason. With its current presale price sitting at just $0.03 and analysts forecasting it could hit $3 by the end of 2026, the projected 100x return on investment is turning heads across the cryptocurrency space. More than just hype, this projection is supported by Mutuum’s growing fundamentals, completed security audits, and upcoming launch roadmap. As excitement builds and Phase 5 nears completion, investors are rushing to lock in before Phase 6 kicks off with a 20% price increase. A Token With Real Utility and Audited Infrastructure At the core of this momentum is Mutuum’s unique approach to decentralized lending and borrowing. The platform enables users to supply or borrow crypto assets through smart contracts, while introducing a dual model that supports both pool-based (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. Mutuum sets itself apart by offering a defined financial purpose, unlike tokens that lack a concrete use case or long-term vision. Users receive mtTokens when they deposit into the protocol — tokenized representations of their deposits that accrue value over time. mtTokens aren’t just passive holdings — they can serve as collateral, be moved between wallets, or exchanged on secondary markets, all while steadily accumulating interest. To ensure trust, the team recently completed a full audit with CertiK, one of the most respected security firms in the blockchain space. The platform received a 95 score, confirming that its smart contracts are secure and built to scale. Alongside the audit, Mutuum launched a $50,000 bug bounty program to further reinforce safety and attract whitehat contributors. Presale Momentum Continues: Over $12.6M Raised Mutuum Finance has now raised more than $12.6 million, attracted over 13,600 holders, and officially passed 80% of Phase 5 token allocation. These figures indicate not only strong community interest but also growing institutional attention. The platform’s structured roadmap, real-world application in DeFi, and expanding token holder base are putting it in a solid position ahead of launch. The current price of $0.03 won’t last long. As Phase 6 approaches, the price is confirmed to rise by 20% to $0.035, meaning that investors entering now are getting a more favorable entry point than those who wait. With only 11 presale phases total, every new stage adds buying pressure — especially as the token edges closer to its official launch price of $0.06. Why a $3 Target Is Being Taken Seriously A 100x prediction might sound bold at first glance, but when you break down the math and upcoming milestones, it starts to look much more grounded. By the time Mutuum goes live, the beta version of the platform will be available for early users. This means that MUTM won’t launch as an empty token, but rather as a live utility asset within an active protocol. The platform has also introduced a model where part of the fees it earns will be used to purchase MUTM tokens, which are then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens. This model not only creates additional demand for MUTM but also incentivizes long-term holding. Combined with its passive income features and expanding use cases, MUTM is well-positioned to become one of the top cryptocurrencies built around real financial participation. In addition, sources close to the project suggest that top-tier centralized exchange listings are already being lined up. With its non-custodial design, ERC-20 compliance, and utility-driven appeal, analysts believe that MUTM is likely to debut on at least one or two major exchanges after the presale wraps — a move that often drives sharp increases in token visibility and demand. Let’s say an investor enters now with $1,200 while the token is still priced at $0.03. When the token reaches $3 by the end of 2026 — as current projections suggest — that initial investment could be worth $120,000. Even at a more conservative target of $1, the investor would still see a 33x return, turning $1,200 into $40,000. In either scenario, getting in during the presale provides a significant advantage over waiting until launch or post-listing. $100K Giveaway Adds More Incentive To amplify community engagement, Mutuum has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , with 10 winners set to receive equal shares. Entry is open to all participants who contribute during the presale. It’s an added layer of incentive during a period when investor interest is already accelerating. Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be far more than just another presale token. It’s a fully structured decentralized finance protocol backed by a smart contract audit, a security bounty, and a rapidly growing community. With over $12.6 million raised, over 80% of tokens in Phase 5 already claimed, and the next phase bringing a 20% price hike, the opportunity to get in at $0.03 is quickly closing. For those asking what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in today, MUTM presents a compelling case: real utility, a working product, and a price that hasn’t yet caught up to its potential. The 100x target may not happen overnight — but with launch plans, exchange listings, and ecosystem rollouts all scheduled in the near term, the clock is clearly ticking.

In an earnings call for the second quarter of 2025, Dimon said that the fintech-fee decision was made to protect its customers when asked about the new policy. “So, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they – do they actually know what’s being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn’t be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be re-marketed or resold to third parties. And so, we’re kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system’s protection. So, we just think it should be done and done right. And that’s the main part. It’s not like you can’t do it.” The fintech companies use the information to make it easier for their customers to send, receive and trade money. JPMorgan is reportedly poised to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the service. Alex Rampell, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and co-founder of the buy now, pay later business Affirm, is slamming JPMorgan’s move, warning it will make it more difficult to move money into crypto. “This isn’t about a new revenue stream. It’s about strangling competition. And if they get away with this, every bank will follow… If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a Coinbase or Robinhood account – maybe fewer people will do it.” Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of crypto platform Kraken, is criticizing JPMorgan for “asserting ownership over data that is generated by users but stored inside infrastructure the bank controls.” “We should not be optimizing for defensibility through restriction. We should be leveraging our position and profitability to build better access, more open architecture and more composable systems. That means investing in protocols, not just platforms. It means participating in shared infrastructure, not just extracting value from it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

BONK Slows & DOT Pulls Back",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-offers-3025-roi-no-vesting-pass-for-6-days-bonk-slows-dot-pulls-back/,"Some charts are flashing potential. The BONK price target inches toward $0.00004, but rapid moves often face pressure before continuation. Meanwhile, the Polkadot (DOT) price outlook is setting up for a textbook move, though DOT’s past behavior suggests surprises aren’t out of the question. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t waiting for setups. With a strict 6-day window, BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS converts every BDAG coin purchased during this period into instant full-access holdings upon launch. While BONK and DOT still assess their next breakout, BlockDAG is letting buyers jump ahead. But the real question is, who leads the race among the top crypto gainers? Let’s explore that. BONK Price Target Pushes Forward as Resistance Nears BONK’s recent price momentum reflects a climb from under $0.0000150 to around $0.0000279 within weeks. Current indicators, including the MACD, hint at solid upward strength, and sentiment has drifted into the positive zone based on cycle trend models. As the BONK price target aims toward the $0.00004 level, rising trade volume supports the outlook. However, moving at such speed raises concerns about how long this strength can be sustained. For now, those watching BONK closely are trying to determine if it can hold ground or whether expectations may cool the rally. Polkadot (DOT) Price Outlook Hints at Caution The setup on DOT’s chart suggests the coin might respond to a known supply area in the second half of the year. Many were anticipating a typical liquidity grab, but DOT skipped it, creating two equal lows that now rest beneath current price levels. This signals potential for a dip if liquidity is sought below. Given the proximity to a supply zone, the Polkadot price outlook considers a pullback plausible. Still, DOT has a track record of reacting outside of expectations, which means any movement should be seen as possible, not certain. The DOT setup remains worth watching, but it may still need confirmation. BlockDAG’s No Vesting Move Delivers What Buyers Want Now BlockDAG’s record-breaking presale is rewriting how early participation works by giving people total control over their BDAG coins. For just 6 days, the NO VESTING PASS eliminates phased release schedules and waiting periods. Those buying during this active window can secure 100% access to their BDAG holdings the moment the launch occurs. This removes the usual lockups, giving early supporters an upper hand. Priced at $0.0016 per coin until August 11th, this offer lands just as BlockDAG enters a critical stretch toward its GLOBAL LAUNCH Release. Over $342 million has already been raised, with 24 billion coins sold, showing massive traction. Since batch 1, early contributors have seen a 2,660% growth in their holdings, and with the expected listing price at $0.05, those entering at the current rate could be staring at a 3025% return. Alongside this offer, BlockDAG’s community continues expanding rapidly. More than 2 million users have engaged with the X1 miner app, and the number of BDAG holders has surpassed 200,000. This initiative isn’t just another crypto event; it’s shifting the structure of presales by offering complete coin liquidity at launch without restrictions. Final Remarks! As BONK hovers near a key resistance and DOT teases setups that may or may not materialize, BlockDAG is pushing forward without hesitation. Instead of uncertainty, it delivers certainty: 100% liquidity at launch via the NO VESTING PASS. That, coupled with the potential 3025% upside from today’s presale rate, places BlockDAG firmly in the running among the top crypto gainers . While BONK and DOT depend on favorable price action, BlockDAG is already giving holders a clear route to unlock gains, no lockups, no delays, and no guesswork.

In a statement, WLFI announced that only a portion of the tokens belonging to investors participating in the public sale at prices of $0.015 and $0.05 will be unlocked initially, while the rest will be determined according to an unlock schedule that will be submitted to a community vote. The WLFI team made the following statements: “We understand that everyone wants WLFI to be operational as soon as possible. However, we are close to finalizing a major collaboration that will shape the future of the project before launch. We believe this step is critical to its long-term success.” Related News: And Jack Dorsey Did It Again: His Cryptocurrency-Focused Company Joins the S&P 500 In order to provide clarity about the token locking process, the following emphasis was highlighted in the statement: Tokens belonging to co-founders, team members, and advisors will not be unlocked at launch. There will be no new pre-sale. Instead, a program is planned in partnership with major centralized exchanges (CEX) where users can earn WLFI rewards through their existing platforms. Only a portion of the tokens will be released to early investors who participated in the public open sale. Furthermore, treasury tokens will be used solely to support liquidity. The release schedule for the remaining public sale and over-the-counter (OTC) tokens will be put to a community vote. The opening schedule for the team, founder and advisor tokens will be voted on separately following these votes. *This is not investment advice.
