The pair must clear the $2,525 and $2,550 resistance levels to continue higher in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,300 level and started a fresh increase. ETH was able to clear the $2,350 resistance to move into a positive zone like Bitcoin. The price was able to climb above the $2,400 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,656 swing high to the $2,310 low.

The price could gain pace if it clears the $0.5450 resistance zone in the near term. XRP price is still consolidating above the $0.5080 support. The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish pace if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Recovery XRP price extended its decline below the $0.5350 level, underperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price even declined heavily below the $0.5250 support zone. A low was formed at $0.5070 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.5250 level. Recently, the price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6640 swing high to the $0.5070 low. The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5450 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5500 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5650. A clear move above the $0.5650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6000 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5300 level. The next major support is near the $0.5250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5120 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

DOGE is now showing positive signs and might clear the $0.1165 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1100 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.1120 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1100 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1165 and $0.1180 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Starts Recovery Dogecoin price declined toward the $0.100 support. DOGE traded as low as $0.1012 and recently started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.1060 and $0.1080 resistance levels. The price surpassed the $0.1120 resistance level. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1100 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. It traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.1320 swing high to the $0.1012 low. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1120 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1165 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.1320 swing high to the $0.1012 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.1180 level. A close above the $0.1180 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1240 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1265 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1320. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1165 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1120 level. The next major support is near the $0.1100 level. The main support sits at $0.1080. If there is a downside break below the $0.1080 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1020 level or even $0.0980 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1120 and $0.1080.

The unexpected movement caused the token to fall by nearly 16% causing a whopping $87k wipeout of STRK long positions in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? The market’s current positioning puts many investors at risk with big losses for the bulls if investor sentiment does not flip bullish in the coming days. With no solid backing for a bull run this week, STRK starts weakly as investors continue to be cautious of the market’s volatility. Surprise For Investors Despite the market’s bearishness, STRK bulls pulled a small win in the shape of a localized breakthrough on the $0.3891 resistance level which might translate to big gains in the coming days. However, this can only occur if the token stabilizes above $0.3891 in the short to medium term. With the token possibly entering a crucial crossover point hinted at by STRK’s relative strength index, a bullish reversal might be around the corner for investors. But this may only come if the market flips on the side of the bulls. As of writing, Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency in the world, is currently moving in the same zone as well. The broader financial market’s current bullishness might leak to the crypto market through Bitcoin’s correlation with major finance indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones index, both are up a few hundred points in the past 24 hours. But with investors split between investing or pulling out of the market, it might take a while before STRK experiences a jump in price that will wipe out last week’s losses. For the current losses to be completely reversed, the token needs to attempt a breakthrough on the $0.5083 resistance level. However, STRK’s current trajectory may only permit a move above the $0.3891 support level. Once the token stabilizes on this support level, STRK bulls might find new strength, targeting $0.4628 in the medium to long term.

This price level is one that other market experts like Standard Chartered have predicted that the flagship crypto could hit even before year-end. Why The Bitcoin Price Can Reach $100,000 By Year-End Ash Crypto stated in an X post that the answer to whether Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in the fourth quarter of this year lies in the past halving cycles. He noted that BTC usually goes through a consolidation phase of around six months after each halving. In 2016, the flagship crypto is said to have witnessed 161 days of consolidation before a price breakout. Meanwhile, in 2020, Bitcoin recorded 175 days of consolidation before its price broke out. Related Reading: ‘FLOKI Master Plan’: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor In line with this, Ash Crypto noted that the flagship crypto has consolidated for 161 days since the Halving event in April earlier this year. Therefore, the analyst claimed that there is a high probability that the Bitcoin price could witness a breakout in the next two to three weeks. He then went on to outline fundamentals that could spark this price breakout. Firstly, Ash Crypto stated that China is printing $280 billion to boost its economy. This is about the People Bank of China’s announcement of a stimulus package to help revive the country’s economy. China’s monetary easing policies have been bullish for Bitcoin, historically leading to price surges for the flagship crypto. Furthermore, the analyst noted that the US Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. The Fed announced a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut at its September FOMC meeting. There are also expectations that there could be another 50 bps rate cut before the year ends. This is also bullish for the Bitcoin price since more liquidity could flow into the flagship crypto with US investors having access to more capital. Another macro factor that the analyst cited is the fact that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) looks to have turned dovish and is, in the meantime, no longer considering rate hikes. The Bitcoin price crashed below $50,000 in the infamous August 5 crypto market following the BOJ’s decision to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years. Therefore, the BOJ’s decision not to hike rates further is positive for Bitcoin. Doing otherwise could revive the ghosts of the yen carry trade as Japanese investors liquidate their positions in risk assets like BTC. Other Factors That Could Spark The Rise To $100,000 Ash Crypto also listed other factors that could help the Bitcoin price reach $100,000. The analyst noted that Donald Trump is again leading in the opinion polls and looks likely to win the US presidential elections in November. A Trump victory is considered a win for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market because the former US President has declared his support for cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: 72% Of ETHUSDT Traders On Binance Go Long – Is This The Buy Signal You Need? The analyst also cited the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have started to accumulate again. The Bitcoin flow to exchange has also reached a very low level, which indicates that investors are choosing to hold for the long term, meaning less selling pressure. FTX customers are also expected to receive their repayments this quarter, which could cause more liquidity to flow into Bitcoin. Lastly, Russia plans to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for cross-border payments starting in November, while the global money supply has reached new highs. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is currently bullish. Interestingly, Ash Crypto claimed that the crypto market has still not factored in all these bullish fundamentals. He stated that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high (ATH) when that happens.

The concept of a “memecoin supercycle,” which posits that memecoins will lead the upcoming crypto bull run, gained traction on X. In this context, crypto analyst Kai (@Kaiwen0x) released a widely-shared article explaining the ongoing allure of memecoins as a viable investment choice. The Case For Memecoins In The Crypto Bull Run 2025 Kai argues that memecoins are poised to outperform the market by 2025, suggesting that owning a “curated basket of memecoins” could allow investors to surpass 99% of market participants. “Outside of Bitcoin and stablecoins, memecoin is the only category that has found a clear product-market fit. They combine the best features of an ICO (capital formation) and an NFT (community building) in delivering a killer product: global, permissionless speculation,” he states. The analyst emphasizes that traditional crypto projects often juggle both product development and token management, whereas memecoins focus solely on the token itself. “Memecoins removed the product and made the token its entire business, with the value of the token deriving from the attention generated by its community,” Kai explains. Citing data from crypto analyst @MustStopMurad, Kai notes that in 2024, 16 of the top 20 tokens within the top 300 that outperformed Bitcoin were memecoins. Related Reading: RIP Altcoin Seasons? Crypto Analyst Debates Whether They’ll Ever Return Kai identifies two main external factors which are crucial for a memecoin surge. First, the macro liquidity and interest rates need to be favorable for the entire market: “The macro setup points to higher liquidity and lower interest rates in the next 12 months. Memecoins act as levered beta on Bitcoin, allowing you to capture maximum upside in a risk-on environment,” Kai explains. Second, the analyst references financial nihilism, a term popularized by Ikigai Investment CEO Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling). This theory suggests that a rise in financial nihilism and the “YOLO” mindset is drawing more participants into speculative markets. Internally, memecoins have shown they possess a clear product-market fit and benefit from what is known as the Lindy effect—where the future life expectancy of some technologies or ideas is proportional to their current age, suggesting that memecoins are here to stay. Additionally, memecoins are particularly adept at creating and maintaining compelling narratives, a critical aspect in a market driven by speculation and investor sentiment. The Art Of Memecoin Selection Kai delves into strategies for selecting promising memecoins, emphasizing the importance of nuanced analysis: Emotional Resonance: “I’m looking for memes that generate a strong emotional reaction. Is it funny, relatable, catchy, powerful, or memorable? The average retail investor is going to be the last marginal bidder of our magic internet coins, so you need to buy and hold what they emotionally resonate with,” Kai explains. Ticker Simplicity: Favoring simple and powerful tickers, ideally 3 to 5 letters long, such as WIF, GIGA, and BULL. Holder Count Growth: Monitoring steady growth in the number of holders as an indicator of increasing adoption. Wide Token Distribution: Preferring coins with broad distribution to avoid centralization risks. Resilience to Drawdowns: Identifying coins that have survived multiple significant price drops and rebounded, indicating strong community support. Active Community Engagement: Looking for an “active army of reply guys getting engagements on X,” which signals a vibrant and engaged community. Exchange Listings: Noting that announcements of centralized exchange (CEX) listings can significantly impact a token’s valuation. Absence of Insiders: Being cautious of coins with insider involvement, such as pre-sales or venture capital backing, which can lead to uneven playing fields. Potential Risks and Invalidation Scenarios Kai acknowledges the risks associated with investing in memecoins: Macro Regime Change: A significant rebound in inflation or a reversal of monetary easing could invalidate the macro thesis for being long on risk assets. Idiosyncratic Events: Events like major exchange hacks, regulatory shifts, or significant market collapses could disproportionately affect memecoins. US Election Outcomes: “Counterintuitively, memecoins could underperform this cycle if Trump wins the election,” Kai speculates. Emotional Attachment: He cautions against becoming too emotionally invested in any one community, as this can cloud judgment. “Identity can create emotional ties that cloud your judgment as an investor.” Related Reading: Crypto Guru Warns: Only 6 Years Left To ‘Make As Much Money As Possible’ Kai emphasizes the importance of understanding investor psychology in the crypto market. “Ultimately, the question returns to: ‘What does the average crypto investor actually care about?’ It’s not the tech. It’s not the product. It’s the token—embodying greed and the expectation of greater profit—that ultimately consumes this investor,” he writes. However, the crypto analyst advises investors to remain vigilant and adaptable: “To avoid getting wrecked, we need to monitor macro conditions for any signs of a regime shift. We must also keep an eye on idiosyncratic events that could invalidate the thesis for investing in any specific token.” Kai concludes, “Good luck, and for the love of dogs, don’t mid-curve this (still) 100x opportunity.” At press time, WIF traded at $2.67.

After bouncing back from key support zones, the cryptocurrency has caught the attention of traders as upward pressure begins to build. With buying interest growing and technical indicators showing signs of strength, the stage is set for FET to potentially reclaim higher price levels, positioning $1.8 as a crucial target for bulls looking to extend the rally. The aim of this article is to analyze FET’s recent bullish momentum as it approaches the $1.8 resistance level. By examining key technical indicators, price patterns, and market sentiment, this piece seeks to assess the likelihood of a breakout and the potential for further upside movement in the near term. Indicators Point Toward More Upward Movement For FET On the 4-hour chart, FET is exhibiting bullish signs as it aims to break above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A push above this key technical indicator successfully could attract large buying interest, indicating that the bulls are regaining control and setting the stage for additional gains toward the $1.8 resistance level. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a renewed bullish potential, as the RSI has climbed above the 50% threshold and is currently sitting at 58%. This upward shift indicates increasing buying pressure. If the RSI continues on this trajectory, it could signal more upward movements for FET, paving the way for new highs, and reinforcing the bullish trend. Related Reading: FET Price Targets $3.4 After Breakout, Here Are The Key Levels To Watch After successfully avoiding a drop below the daily 100-day SMA, FET has positioned itself firmly above this key level, indicating that buyers have regained control. Holding above this crucial technical indicator suggests that FET may continue its upward trajectory, with the 100-day SMA now acting as a solid support level, further reinforcing the potential for continued gains. Also, the RSI on the daily chart is currently sitting at 54%, after a previous dip to 44%. The rise from lower levels indicates that FET may be regaining strength, with the potential for more growth if buying interest remains consistent. What Could Happen Beyond $1.8? FET is currently on an upward trajectory, eyeing a breakout above the $1.8 resistance level. A successful push beyond this mark could pave the way for further gains, with the next target set around $2.5. Should FET surpass $2.5, increased buying interest could fuel additional momentum, driving the price higher toward the $3.4 resistance level. Related Reading: Fetch.AI (FET) Surges 21%: Why This Rally Is Just Getting Started However, failure to sustain momentum and break below the $1.8 resistance could lead to a pullback toward the $0.966 support level. If the price drops below this critical point, it may trigger additional declines, potentially opening the door for deeper price corrections.

His prediction has gotten a range of responses, from doubt to fun, especially from people who support the ADA like the Cardano Whale. Some people see this prediction as a chance to buy at a lower price, while others are more wary because the crypto market is so unstable. Related Reading: Starknet: Long Positions Liquidated Lead To 16% Losses It’s easy to see why so many people are sticking with Bitcoin: it keeps looking like the best asset for long-term buyers. Bitcoin has a good brand associated with their value and a decentralized nature that gives it the push. It’s also a relatively stable cryptocurrency compared to many, with the sheer size of the network effect, an infrastructure firmly supported by institutional players, and high liquidity. Cardano (ADA) will lose another 90% vs. Bitcoin over the next 6 months. pic.twitter.com/jQHhJg1m59 — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 5, 2024 What Makes Cardano Stand Out Although Kaiser made a somewhat negative forecast, Cardano is demonstrating that cryptocurrencies are a real competitor. By offering a solution that can last longer and expand with the demands of the society, it seeks to be superior to Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. Cardano focuses on scalability, energy efficiency, and building a strong base for decentralized applications and finance projects. It uses a peer-reviewed academic method and proof-of-stake consensus. But things haven’t been easy for ADA. Some market observers say that the fact that it is taking a long time to catch on and grow is a big problem. Many investors are confused as to whether ADA is going to maintain its edge in the smart contract platform space post the price going down quite sharply over the last year. Cardano has to step up the act as it is playing against stiff competition in a game by renowned companies. A Mixed Bag For The Short Term Even though there are problems, Cardano has a small chance of getting a boost in price. CoinCodex recently made a price prediction that says Cardano’s price will go up by 17% and hit about $0.42492 by November 6, 2024. The current mood of the market is neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index also has a score of 50, which means it is balanced. In the last 30 days, there have been 63% “green days” for Cardano, and the price has changed only 6%. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? These details imply a level of stability that could lead people to invest. Thus far, Cardano has done well, which is an indication that it could well catch on, notwithstanding its remaining concerns. Analysts feel that these are the best times to buy-in since the probability of going up is consistent with the general trend of the market.
