The price is trading above $2,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,435 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,525 and $2,550 resistance levels to continue higher in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,300 level and started a fresh increase. ETH was able to clear the $2,350 resistance to move into a positive zone like Bitcoin. The price was able to climb above the $2,400 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,656 swing high to the $2,310 low.

The price could gain pace if it clears the $0.5450 resistance zone in the near term. XRP price is still consolidating above the $0.5080 support. The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish pace if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Recovery XRP price extended its decline below the $0.5350 level, underperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price even declined heavily below the $0.5250 support zone. A low was formed at $0.5070 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.5250 level. Recently, the price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6640 swing high to the $0.5070 low. The price is now trading above $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5450 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5500 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5650. A clear move above the $0.5650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6000 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5300 level. The next major support is near the $0.5250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5120 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

DOGE is now showing positive signs and might clear the $0.1165 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1100 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.1120 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1100 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1165 and $0.1180 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Starts Recovery Dogecoin price declined toward the $0.100 support. DOGE traded as low as $0.1012 and recently started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.1060 and $0.1080 resistance levels. The price surpassed the $0.1120 resistance level. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1100 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. It traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.1320 swing high to the $0.1012 low. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1120 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1165 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.1320 swing high to the $0.1012 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.1180 level. A close above the $0.1180 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1240 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1265 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1320. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1165 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1120 level. The next major support is near the $0.1100 level. The main support sits at $0.1080. If there is a downside break below the $0.1080 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1020 level or even $0.0980 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1120 and $0.1080.

The unexpected movement caused the token to fall by nearly 16% causing a whopping $87k wipeout of STRK long positions in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? The market’s current positioning puts many investors at risk with big losses for the bulls if investor sentiment does not flip bullish in the coming days. With no solid backing for a bull run this week, STRK starts weakly as investors continue to be cautious of the market’s volatility. Surprise For Investors Despite the market’s bearishness, STRK bulls pulled a small win in the shape of a localized breakthrough on the $0.3891 resistance level which might translate to big gains in the coming days. However, this can only occur if the token stabilizes above $0.3891 in the short to medium term. With the token possibly entering a crucial crossover point hinted at by STRK’s relative strength index, a bullish reversal might be around the corner for investors. But this may only come if the market flips on the side of the bulls. As of writing, Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency in the world, is currently moving in the same zone as well. The broader financial market’s current bullishness might leak to the crypto market through Bitcoin’s correlation with major finance indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones index, both are up a few hundred points in the past 24 hours. But with investors split between investing or pulling out of the market, it might take a while before STRK experiences a jump in price that will wipe out last week’s losses. For the current losses to be completely reversed, the token needs to attempt a breakthrough on the $0.5083 resistance level. However, STRK’s current trajectory may only permit a move above the $0.3891 support level. Once the token stabilizes on this support level, STRK bulls might find new strength, targeting $0.4628 in the medium to long term.
