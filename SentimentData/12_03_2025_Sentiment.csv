Bahrain-based ATME exchange has just turned this dream into reality with the launch of their gold-backed token . This groundbreaking move is injecting a fresh wave of innovation into the real world assets (RWA) market, promising to democratize access to precious metals and reshape how we perceive digital gold . Are you ready to dive into the future of finance? Why a Gold-Backed Token? The Power of Tokenized Gold For centuries, gold has been synonymous with wealth preservation and stability. However, physical gold comes with its own set of challenges: storage, security, transportation, and divisibility. Enter the gold-backed token – a revolutionary solution that merges the timeless appeal of gold with the cutting-edge efficiency of blockchain technology. ATME’s initiative directly addresses these pain points, offering a modern, streamlined approach to gold ownership. Key Advantages of Tokenized Gold: Accessibility: Tokenization lowers the barrier to entry for gold investment. You no longer need to buy large bars; you can own fractions of gold represented by tokens. Liquidity: Trading gold-backed tokens on exchanges like ATME offers significantly higher liquidity compared to physical gold markets. Buy and sell with ease, 24/7. Security: Blockchain’s inherent security features protect your digital gold holdings. Transactions are transparent and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud. Efficiency: Say goodbye to cumbersome paperwork and lengthy settlement times. Tokenized gold transactions are fast, efficient, and cost-effective. Portability: Carry your gold wealth digitally, without worrying about physical storage or transportation risks. ATME’s Gold-Backed Token: A Deep Dive into Tokenized Real World Assets ATME’s newly launched token is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a representation of a tangible asset – 1 kilogram of physical gold for each token. This places it firmly within the realm of tokenized real world assets (RWAs), a rapidly growing segment in the crypto space. RWAs bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain, bringing real-world value on-chain. How ATME’s Gold-Backed Token Works: 1 Token = 1 KG Gold: Each token issued by ATME is backed by 1 kilogram of physical gold, stored securely. Secondary Market Trading: Tokens can be traded on ATME’s secondary market, offering price discovery and liquidity. Redemption for Physical Gold: Token holders have the option to exchange their tokens for physical gold directly through the ATME platform. Expansion Plans: ATME isn’t stopping at gold. They plan to expand their tokenization efforts to other asset classes, further diversifying their RWA offerings. Blockchain Technology: The Backbone of Digital Gold and RWAs The magic behind digital gold and RWAs lies in blockchain technology . Blockchain provides the secure, transparent, and immutable infrastructure necessary for tokenization to thrive. It ensures the provenance and authenticity of the underlying asset, in this case, gold, and facilitates seamless transactions. Blockchain Benefits for Gold Tokenization: Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent audit trail. Immutability: Once recorded, blockchain data is virtually tamper-proof, enhancing security and trust. Decentralization: Blockchain’s decentralized nature reduces reliance on intermediaries, potentially lowering costs and increasing efficiency. Smart Contracts: Blockchain enables the use of smart contracts to automate processes like redemption and ownership transfer, streamlining operations. Benefits of Investing in Gold-Backed Tokens and Digital Gold Investing in gold-backed tokens and embracing digital gold presents a compelling proposition for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto space. Beyond the inherent advantages of tokenization, gold itself has historically served as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Combining these factors creates a potentially powerful investment vehicle. Investor Advantages: Diversification: Gold-backed tokens offer portfolio diversification, especially in volatile market conditions. Inflation Hedge: Gold has traditionally acted as a safe haven asset during inflationary periods, potentially preserving wealth. Accessibility to Gold: Tokenization democratizes gold investment, making it accessible to a wider range of investors. Potential for Appreciation: Like any asset, the value of gold and consequently, gold-backed tokens, can appreciate over time. Modern Investment: Embracing digital gold positions investors at the forefront of financial innovation. Navigating the Landscape of Tokenized Gold and Real World Assets While the future of tokenized gold and real world assets is bright, it’s crucial to approach this evolving landscape with informed awareness. Like any investment, there are factors to consider and potential challenges to navigate. Considerations for Investors: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory framework for RWAs and digital assets is still developing globally. Stay informed about relevant regulations in your jurisdiction. Platform Risk: The security and reliability of the exchange or platform issuing and managing the tokens are crucial. Research and choose reputable platforms like ATME. Market Volatility: While gold is generally considered stable, the price of gold-backed tokens can still be influenced by market fluctuations and crypto market sentiment. Custodial vs. Non-Custodial: Understand whether you are holding the tokens in a custodial wallet (managed by the platform) or a non-custodial wallet (where you control your private keys). Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any crypto asset, including gold-backed tokens. Understand the project, the platform, and the risks involved. ATME’s launch of their gold-backed token marks a significant step forward in the tokenization of real-world assets. By leveraging blockchain technology to modernize gold ownership, they are not only solving practical challenges but also paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and secure financial future. As the RWA market continues to expand, initiatives like this will be instrumental in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the exciting world of crypto.

Watch This Key Level,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-set-for-a-50-crash-watch-this-key-level/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is staging a much needed rebound after being slaughtered over the course of the last week, as the broader crypto market rebounds from lows. ADA was last changing hands around $0.7250, a more than 11% rebound from the lows it hit earlier in the day around $0.65. But that leaves the crypto still down close to 40% from the highs it hit 9 days ago when President Trump announced a crypto reserve including ADA in a tweet on X. In the end, Cardano only made it into a national US crypto stockpile, which was set up by US President Trump last Thursday. And unlike the strategic Bitcoin reserve that Trump signed into law at the same time, there are currently no plans to increase the size of the stockpile via additional Cardano purchases. Worse yet for Cardano , its co-founder and figurehead head Charles Hoskinson wasn’t invited to the White House summit on crypto last week. Charles Hoskinson confirms no White House invite for Cardano?. #Cardano #crypto pic.twitter.com/W49FbqyT49 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) March 6, 2025 The snub is a gut punch for ADA investors who had been hoping for bullish outcomes like Cardano being included in the strategic reserve (not stockpile) and for Charles Hoskinson to work his way into Trump’s inner circle as a crypto advisor that could bolster the crypto’s US adoption. That leaves the Cardano price vulnerable to a breakout to fresh multi-month lows under $0.55 in the coming weeks as the broader macro backdrop sours. How Low Could the Cardano Price Go? Bullish Cardano narratives have lost a great deal of traction over the last week and as the broader crypto market faces a difficult period, ADA could be destined for some underperformance. Rising concerns that the Trump administration is knowingly pursuing policies that will create short-term economic pain ( D.O.G.E austerity and trade wars) have battered risk appetite in recent weeks. If we are having a recession over a decline in govt spending, then the GDP wasn't real to begin with. The US govt has a $2 trillion annual budget deficit. That is basically $2 trillion of artificial GDP that is funded by more debt. Removing $2 trillion of GDP is where the… — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) March 10, 2025 US stocks have seen a substantial slide from their yearly peaks and this has weighed heavily on crypto. With things likely to worsen for the US economy in the coming weeks and months, this is a trend in financial markets that is unlikely to let up anytime soon. That means risks are tilted to the downside for major cryptos like Cardano, which are very sensitive to the market’s broader sentiment. The Cardano price is currently testing its 200DMA for the third time in just over one month, with a convincing breakout to the downside looking increasingly likely, which could then cascade into a breakout below the February lows. That could open the door to a prolonged move lower back to the late-2024 $0.27-41 range. That would mark a drop of potentially as much as 50% from current levels. Buy the Cardano Dip? Should Cardano drop back to these depressed levels, that could offer a compelling risk-reward bet for the coming years. That’s because the current macro pain weighing on the market will almost certainly be temporary. Sure, it could last for a few months or even a year. But once macro conditions improve and the liquidity flood comes, it’s likely to be off to the races for the crypto market. That’s because the narratives behind the industry and markets are just so bullish right now – accelerating global adoption, particularly of Bitcoin, but also a now very friendly regulatory environment in the USA. Cardano could easily 10x from its lows in the $0.40 area back to record highs around $4 by the end of Trump’s four-year term. However, investors would be wise not to put all their eggs in one basket, Cardano remains a highly speculative crypto owing to its lack of real world adoption and reliance on community and hype. Investors might want to consider allocating a bigger percentage of their portfolios to better-established cryptos like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana. The post Cardano Price Set for a 50% Crash?

On-Chain Signals You Need to See,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-recovery-near-on-chain-signals-you-need-to-see/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest dump has market participants speculating whether there will be more bloodshed in the coming weeks or if the asset’s value will record a significant recovery. Market analytics firm Santiment has identified some on-chain indicators that can offer insight into bitcoin’s movement in the short term. According to Santiment, several on-chain metrics signal that the market still has rocky times ahead, with turbulence triggered by macroeconomic and global concerns. However, BTC reaccumulation by whales and the increasing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) indicate that positive signs are beginning to emerge. “The Sky is Not Falling in Crypto” Since BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $109,000 the day before U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the cryptocurrency has been on a seven-week slump. Santiment said the fear of missing out (FOMO) did not slow down the rally, as it has often done – this was due to large BTC accumulation by whales and sharks. This accumulation continued until Trump’s inauguration in mid-January, but it began to slow down after the event and stopped in mid-February. Bitcoin’s price began to record deeper corrections when sharks and whales started taking profit. Prices have continued to plunge even after high capital BTC wallets resumed accumulation on March 3. Despite the reaccumulation, the amount of BTC moving to exchanges has been high. Santiment found that a combined 22,702 BTC (approximately 0.11% of Bitcoin’s entire supply) moved from non-exchange wallets to exchange addresses between February 20 to March 8. This is a cause for concern because the primary purpose of moving coins to exchanges is often selling. However, Santiment sees whale accumulation and exchange supply as long-term indicators, so short-term traders ought to focus more on the level of FOMO and FUD the retail crowd demonstrates daily on social media. An Incoming Bounce? Examining social media content, mentions of BTC predictions related to lower prices ($50,000 to $69,000) are currently higher than mentions for prices ranging from $100,000 to $119,000. Santiment says this is a good sign because the crypto market often moves in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. The analytics firm is rooting for the social media mentions to spam lower price predictions because it shows that they are still bearish. Another metric to consider is the average rate of gains or losses from short and long term traders. Bitcoin traders active in the last 30 days have lost 11%, while those active in the past 365 days are down 5%, suggesting that the market is not in historically negative zones yet. “Don’t be surprised if there is a bit more pain in store first, though. It’s always darkest before the dawn,” the firm added. The post Is Bitcoin’s Recovery Near?

Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of content creation and the broader implications for the generative AI landscape. Is This the Dawn of AI Fiction Writers? Sam Altman’s recent post on X (formerly Twitter) has ignited a firestorm of discussion. He showcased a sample of creative writing produced by this new OpenAI model , prompted with a request for a ‘metafictional literary short story about AI and grief’. Altman expressed genuine surprise and admiration, stating it was the ‘first time I have been really struck by something written by AI,’ particularly noting its grasp of metafiction. This isn’t just about AI generating text; it’s about AI understanding and executing nuanced literary concepts, suggesting a leap in AI’s creative capabilities. But what exactly makes this announcement so significant? Beyond Logic and Code: OpenAI has primarily focused on AI applications in logical and structured domains like math and programming. Venturing into AI creative writing signals a significant shift towards understanding and replicating human creativity, a domain long considered uniquely human. Wordsmithing Upgrade: This move suggests that OpenAI believes its latest generation of models represents a substantial improvement in natural language processing and generation, moving beyond basic essay writing to sophisticated storytelling. Industry Disruption?: While the release timeline remains uncertain, this development has profound implications for writers, publishers, and the entertainment industry. Could AI become a collaborator, a tool, or even a competitor in the realm of creative content? The Power of Generative AI in Storytelling Generative AI , in its essence, is about creating something new from existing data. In the context of writing, this means AI models learn from vast datasets of text and code to understand language patterns, styles, and narrative structures. The potential benefits of such advanced writing AI are vast and varied: Benefit Description Content Creation at Scale Imagine generating diverse and engaging content for marketing, education, or entertainment at unprecedented speed and volume. Personalized Storytelling AI could tailor stories to individual preferences, creating hyper-personalized reading experiences. Overcoming Writer’s Block Writers could use AI as a brainstorming partner, generating ideas, plot points, or even initial drafts to overcome creative hurdles. Accessibility and Inclusivity AI writing tools could empower individuals with writing difficulties or language barriers to express themselves creatively. Challenges and Considerations for AI Fiction While the prospect of sophisticated AI fiction is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and ethical considerations that come with it: Originality and Creativity: Can AI truly be original, or is it merely remixing existing human creativity? The question of AI’s capacity for genuine creative thought remains a philosophical and practical debate. Copyright and Authorship: Who owns the copyright of AI-generated content? Establishing clear legal frameworks for AI authorship is essential. Emotional Depth and Human Experience: Can AI truly capture the nuances of human emotion, experience, and the complexities of the human condition that often form the heart of compelling stories? Job Displacement Concerns: The rise of advanced writing AI raises concerns about potential job displacement for human writers and creative professionals. Examples of AI’s Creative Spark While OpenAI’s announcement is generating buzz, it’s important to remember that AI has been making inroads into creative fields for some time. We’ve seen examples of generative AI being used for: Poetry and Songwriting: AI models can generate poems and song lyrics, sometimes with surprising artistic merit. Scriptwriting: AI is being explored for generating scripts for movies, TV shows, and even video games. Interactive Narratives: AI can power dynamic and branching storylines in games and interactive fiction, creating more immersive experiences. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the AI Creative Revolution The development of powerful AI creative writing tools is not a distant future; it’s happening now. Here’s how to prepare: Embrace AI as a Tool: Instead of fearing AI as a replacement, explore its potential as a powerful tool to augment human creativity and productivity. Develop AI Literacy: Understand how OpenAI models and other AI writing tools work, their capabilities, and limitations. Focus on Human Strengths: Hone uniquely human skills like emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and nuanced storytelling that AI may struggle to replicate fully. Engage in the Ethical Conversation: Participate in discussions about the ethical implications of AI in creative fields and help shape responsible development and usage. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Storytelling OpenAI’s announcement is a clear signal that generative AI is rapidly advancing into the realm of creative arts. While the full impact of these OpenAI models on AI fiction and content creation is yet to unfold, one thing is certain: we are on the cusp of a significant shift in how stories are created and consumed. The future of writing will likely be a collaborative dance between human ingenuity and the astonishing capabilities of artificial intelligence. It’s a time of both excitement and careful consideration as we navigate this new frontier of creative expression.

Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act,https://cryptonews.com/news/rep-nick-begich-introduces-companion-legislation-to-sen-cynthia-lummis-bitcoin-act/,"Key Takeaways: The companion bill seeks to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic, long‑term reserve asset in the national financial framework. Lawmakers look to bolster economic independence by integrating digital assets into government holdings. The proposal mandates secure, decentralized storage and enshrines permanent, not temporary, asset management. It also emphasizes protecting individual self‑custody rights while driving innovation in fiscal policy. Congressman Nick Begich (R-AK) introduced companion legislation to Senator Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, March 11, at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin For America forum. Cynthia Lummis, Nick Begich Re-introduce BITCOIN Act Speaking at the March 11 event, Begich said that he would introduce same-day legislation that would see the United States develop a strategic bitcoin reserve.

The war on innovation is over and the golden age of digital currency has arrived. pic.twitter.com/5GvbP0nH4y — Congressman Nick Begich (@RepNickBegich) March 11, 2025 Representatives Addison McDowell (R-NC), Pat Harrigan (R-NC), Michael Rulli (R-OH), Troy Nehls (R-TX), Dave Taylor (R-OH), and Mike Collins (R-GA) are co-sponsoring the bill . “This legislative initiative aims to ensure the United States maintains financial independence and leadership in the global digital economy,” Begich said. “This bill recognizes bitcoin’s potential to complement our gold reserves, fortify national security, and provide economic stability in an increasingly volatile financial world,” he added. What Does The BITCOIN Act Entail? Begich’s announcement comes the same day that Lummis unveiled she would reintroduce the BITCOIN Act after her initial proposal in July 2024. If passed, the bill would establish a program to purchase 1 million Bitcoin units—representing 5% of the total Bitcoin supply—create a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin vaults for government holdings, and affirm the self-custody rights of private Bitcoin holders. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Justice (R-WV), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) have signed on as co-sponsors for the Senate version of the legislation. “Bitcoin is not simply a technological opportunity, but a national imperative for America’s continued financial leadership in the 21st century,” Lummis said in a statement. “Together, we are not just adapting to the future—we are actively shaping it, writing the next chapter in America’s proud history of financial innovation and securing lasting prosperity for all our citizens,” she added. As lawmakers like Begich and Lummis push for the integration of Bitcoin into America’s financial framework, important questions emerge: How will such an unprecedented reserve affect global financial dynamics, and will other nations follow suit? The BITCOIN Act signals a major shift—not only in how the U.S. views digital assets but also how it approaches economic sovereignty in an era defined by technological innovation. Only time will tell if this move cements America’s position in the evolving digital economy or sets the stage for intense debate about government’s role in cryptocurrency . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might a Bitcoin reserve enhance the nation’s financial posture? Integrating Bitcoin into national reserves aims to diversify government assets and provide an inflation hedge, reinforcing fiscal stability while significantly enhancing the dollar’s global standing. What risks does the proposed reserve introduce for asset management? Risks center on Bitcoin’s volatility and shifting policies that may undermine long‑term reserve strategies. Robust asset management will require strict oversight and adaptable regulations to counter market moves. How does this legislation differ from prior executive measures on digital assets? Unlike past executive orders, the bill creates a permanent legal structure for Bitcoin acquisition and storage. It enshrines long‑term holding with decentralized vaults, marking a shift from temporary measures. The post Rep. Nick Begich Introduces Companion Legislation to Sen.

The event occurred in the wake of President Trump’s signing an executive order (EO) to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and the White House’s hosting its first-ever Crypto Summit . One might have expected jingoistic overtones from an event with such a title. However, many of the speakers acknowledged that Bitcoin is something that will benefit the whole world, and that, partially because of this, the U.S. should lead the way in adoption. David Zell, Director of BPI, set the tone for the event in his opening remarks. “Our goal for today is to continue this process, to help people understand how Bitcoin benefits America — and the world writ large,” he declared. Zell was followed by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time Bitcoin advocate, who made the case that it’s only natural for America to set the pace when it comes to Bitcoin adoption. “This really is freedom money,” said Senator Lummis. “And America should lead when it comes to freedom money.” Michael Saylor: Bitcoin And American Digital Supremacy Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor agreed with the Senator, making the case for why the U.S. should lead in this arena. “I’m here today to show you how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents a strategy for United States digital supremacy in the 21st century,” he began. He went on to argue in favor of bitcoin as digital property, asserting that the United States should acquire as much of it as possible so that it can “rent and finance” on top of that property. He also posited that trillions of dollars in commerce will flow over the Bitcoin network, which is another reason why the U.S. should prioritize acquiring its share of the network. Moreover, he asserted that Bitcoin embodies American values and that owning it is the next best thing to living in the U.S. “Everybody who is living in Asia, in Africa would move to the U.S. if they could,” said Saylor. “They’d move their money to the U.S. if they could. They want the currency of the U.S. They want the security of the U.S. They want the values of the U.S., but they can’t have it,” he added. “So, the second best thing they can have is to move their money into the Bitcoin network, which has all of the values, protection, and security of the U.S.” Vivek Ramaswamy: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Return Is The New High-Risk Hurdle Rate Ohio gubernatorial candidate and American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy followed Saylor, putting forward the motion that the rate of return on holding bitcoin for a decade or more is now the new high-risk hurdle rate. He set the stage for this claim by making the case that we’re moving back into an “era of scarce capital.” He shared that this will be the inverse of the past 15 years, during which the Fed printed money en masse , in a manner similar to a cocaine dealer doling out cocaine to hungry users, as he put it. He explained that institutions are going to once again have to consider the question “What is my opportunity cost of capital?” and, in doing so, they’ll have to define a hurdle rate for both low- and high-risk investments. Ramaswamy argued that the hurdle rate for low-risk investments is the 10-year U.S. Treasury, while the hurdle rate for a high-risk investment will be the rate of return on bitcoin over a 10-to-15-year period. He then closed out his talk by pointing out how the American ethos and the Bitcoin ethos overlap, and that, like the American flag, Bitcoin is a symbol of hope. “I think Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps to fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” said Ramaswamy. “And I think it makes it, in the national context, an even more fitting asset to fill our national Strategic Reserve.” Matthew Pines: The World Is Paying Attention To Bitcoin After SBR EO Matthew Pines, Executive Director of BPI, pointed out that bitcoin is beginning to take center stage in the eyes of world leaders for two reasons. The first, he claimed, is because U.S. debt markets have become increasingly fragile, prompting global leaders to start looking to invest in a global reserve asset aside from U.S. Treasuries. The second reason is that President Trump’s SBR EO clearly stated that the United States sees bitcoin as “digital gold,” and that it will only be a matter of time before other leaders view it as the same. “Last Thursday’s executive order landed on the desk of every major president, central bank [chair] and finance minister in the world,” said Pines. “There are now discussions happening about how to interpret that. What does that mean for their own country’s relationship to bitcoin? Governments don’t move too fast, but when they do, they move in size, they move in scale and they can deploy trillions of dollars in capital that can have geopolitical effects,” he added. “And I think we’re at this inflection point where the geopolitical aspects of bitcoin start to become extremely important, and can shape the next several years of Bitcoin’s future. The Bitcoin race is now on, and the ball is in our court to maintain our advantage.” Congressman Nick Begich Reintroduces The Bitcoin Act After Pines concluded his talk, he introduced Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) to the stage, where the Congressman made a major announcement . “Today, I will be announcing the Bitcoin Act of 2025 in the United States House,” said Rep. Begich. The bill, which is an updated version of the bill Sen. Lummis proposed last year , proposes that the U.S. acquire 1 million bitcoin (at no expense to taxpayers) and protects U.S. citizens’ right to self-custody to their bitcoin. “[The bill] explicitly protects the rights of individuals to own, hold and transact with bitcoin freely,” said Rep. Begich. “It recognizes self-custody as a fundamental right.” Congressman Ro Khanna: Democrats Should Support Bitcoin After a brief talk from Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at BPI, on why U.S. states should hold bitcoin in their reserves, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) made the case for why Democrats should embrace Bitcoin. “Bitcoin should be bipartisan,” said Rep. Khanna, the only Democratic politician to speak at the event. “Now, people are going to be able to get bitcoin. That is transformational for so many people around the world, and that is why the Democratic Party should be embracing this as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world,” he added. Jack Mallers: Bitcoin Is A Return To American Values After a handful of talks and panels including the likes of Casa CEO Nick Neuman , Newmarket Capital CEO Andrew Hohns and Lightspark CSO Christian Catalini, Strike CEO Jack Mallers took the stage as the final speaker of the summit. In his talk, entitled “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: The American Monetary Revolution”, Mallers made the case that the establishment of the SBR was “a return to American values — including life, liberty and property.” “The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order and the Bitcoin Act proposed by Senator Lummis is the most significant economic shift and announcement and the only positive economic announcement that’s come out of this nation’s capitol in the last 100 years,” said Mallers. He went on to say that American economic policy has been working against the principles the country was founded on and cited Executive Order 6102 (gold confiscation under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933), the Nixon Shock (President Nixon’s depegging the U.S. dollar from gold in 1971) and the 2008 bank bailouts as evidence. However, he ended on a high note. “[This is a] pivotal moment in American history and a turning point in economic policy for this country,” said Mallers. “The story of humanity is [people] engineering a better world — that’s America, that’s Bitcoin.” This post The United States Must Embrace Bitcoin Now: A Recap Of Bitcoin For America first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",NEWS|FEATURED|Bitcoin Policy|Bitcoin Policy Institute|Events|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|washington dc,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-11 22:58:28

This breakdown has pushed the market to its lowest levels since November 2024, increasing fear and uncertainty among investors. The entire crypto market has been struggling, weighed down by negative macroeconomic conditions and an overall shift in risk-off sentiment. Related Reading: Charts Reveal Cardano Holds Key Support Zone – Staying Above Could ‘Set The Next Move’ U.S. President Trump’s policies have added to the volatility and instability, as rising global trade war fears and erratic economic decisions continue to rattle investors. The U.S. stock market has dropped to its lowest point since September 2024, further fueling concerns that broader financial markets are weakening, dragging Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies down with them. According to Glassnode data, the Mayer Multiplier suggests that the next key support level for Bitcoin sits at $66,000. If the current sell-off continues, BTC could test this level in the coming weeks, marking a significant correction from its recent highs. With Bitcoin at a crucial point, traders and investors are closely watching whether BTC can stabilize and reclaim key levels or if further downside is ahead. The coming days will be critical for Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Bitcoin Struggles Below 200-Day MA Bitcoin has been in a consistent downtrend since late January, with fear dominating investor sentiment. Many now believe that the bull cycle is over, as BTC continues to set lower highs and break key support levels. With selling pressure mounting, the market remains under bearish control, and lower targets are being set by cautious investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Rally Above ATH To $128K – On-Chain Indicator Signals Potential Recovery Since the U.S. elections in November 2024, macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility have been major drivers of the market. The rise in global trade tensions, erratic economic policies, and shaken investor confidence have all contributed to Bitcoin’s extended correction. With U.S. stock markets also struggling, Bitcoin has failed to find the momentum needed for a recovery. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting that Bitcoin is now trading below the 200-day moving average, a key technical indicator that often signals long-term trend direction. According to the Mayer Multiple, the next major support level sits at $66,000. If BTC fails to stabilize above current levels, further selling pressure could send Bitcoin toward this lower support zone in the coming weeks. For Bitcoin to reverse its downward trend, bulls must reclaim the 200-day MA around $83,500. A break and hold above this level would indicate strength returning to the market and could prevent further downside. However, if BTC fails to regain momentum, fear and uncertainty will continue to drive prices lower, making the next few weeks crucial for Bitcoin’s market structure. Investors are closely watching price action as Bitcoin remains at a critical point that could define its mid-term trend. BTC Eyes $85K For Recovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $81,700 after losing the 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $83,450, a key technical level that previously supported its bullish momentum. With BTC now trading below this critical indicator, the market remains under bearish pressure, and traders are closely watching for signs of a potential reversal. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the $85,000 mark in the coming days. A strong push above this level would indicate renewed buying interest, potentially setting the stage for a recovery rally. However, if BTC fails to break above $85K, the market could see further downside pressure. Related Reading: Cardano Bulls Eye $10 Target – Analyst Reveals Key Levels To Break If BTC drops below the $80,000–$78,000 range, it will increase the likelihood of a decline toward the next major support levels at $75,000–$72,000. Such a move would reinforce bearish sentiment, delaying any chances of a meaningful recovery in the near term. The next few trading sessions will be critical, as Bitcoin remains in a vulnerable position where either a reclaim of key levels or a deeper correction is imminent.

This important achievement helps Kraken improve its services in the UK and strengthens its role in the fast-changing cryptocurrency market. Kraken to Offer More Financial Products According to the announcement , Kraken is now officially allowed to issue electronic money (e-money) in the UK. This approval will also help the company make it easier and faster for UK users to deposit and withdraw their funds. By issuing e-money, Kraken can manage users’ money directly, which reduces the need for third-party financial institutions and speeds up transaction times. Notably, the FCA’s endorsement allows Kraken to offer more financial products for the UK market. As more people adopt cryptocurrency worldwide, Kraken is now in a better position to launch new crypto-related financial services that meet the needs of its growing UK customer base. These services may include options like crypto-backed lending, payment processing, and It is worth noting that regulatory approval is important for protecting consumers. With the FCA monitoring Kraken’s activities, UK customers can feel safer about their funds and the rules the company follows. This will likely help build trust in Kraken’s services, especially for new users or those who are careful about using digital assets. Kraken Exchange Bows to MiCA Recall that Kraken announced plans to fully delist five stablecoins, including Tether’s USDT , across the European Economic Area (EEA). The exchange is trying to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) to retain its relevance in the EU region. Additionally, this decision comes as part of a broader regulatory change enforced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). As reported, Kraken will remove support for Tether USDt (USDT), PayPal USD (PYUSD), Tether EURt (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and TerraClassicUSD (UST) in Europe. However, the delisting will take place in multiple stages. The exchange also assured users that the delisting strategy is strictly for its EEA clients, spanning 30 countries, including Spain, Sweden, Austria, Portugal, and Malta. Exchanges Expands Crypto Services in the UK Like Kraken, Austrian cryptocurrency platform Bitpanda expanded its footprint in the United Kingdom in February. This expansion came after Bitpanda received regulatory approval from the FCA. With this green light, Bitpanda is set to offer UK investors access to over 500 crypto assets, marking one of the broadest selections available in the country. Furthermore, this approval is a significant milestone for Bitpanda, which had previously paused new user onboarding in the UK. The pause was due to FCA’s tightened Financial Promotions (FinProm) regime in late 2023 . Similarly, Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange secured a spot on the FCA register , permitting Coinbase to offer crypto services in the U.K. from now on, Coinbase can offer crypto and cash services to U.K. investors and traders.

41505578,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139290,1741734049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: SEC Delays VanEck’s Spot Solana ETF Approval – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-vaneck-solana-etf/,"Exciting times in the crypto world, or so we thought! Just when Solana enthusiasts were gearing up for a potential spot Solana ETF, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. The regulatory body announced a postponement on its decision regarding VanEck’s proposal for a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Let’s unpack what this significant development means for you, the crypto community, and the future of Solana ETFs. Why the SEC Postpones Decision on Solana ETF? The SEC’s move to postpone the decision isn’t entirely unexpected in the world of crypto regulation. The agency has a track record of taking its time, often citing the need for investor protection and market integrity. While the official announcement doesn’t explicitly detail the reasons for the delay, we can infer some likely factors: Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market, including Solana, is known for its price swings. The SEC may be taking extra time to assess the potential risks associated with a spot Solana ETF, especially considering past market events. Regulatory Scrutiny: Spot crypto ETFs are still relatively new territory for the SEC. Each application undergoes rigorous examination to ensure compliance with existing securities laws and to address potential manipulation and fraud risks. Custody and Security: A crucial aspect of any crypto ETF approval is the secure custody of the underlying assets. The SEC needs to be satisfied that VanEck’s proposed custody solutions for Solana are robust and secure enough to protect investors’ holdings. Precedent Setting: Approving a spot Solana ETF would set a precedent for other altcoins. The SEC is likely considering the broader implications of such a decision and its potential impact on the wider crypto ecosystem. It’s important to remember that a postponement is not a rejection. It simply means the SEC needs more time to conduct its due diligence. Think of it as a regulatory pause button rather than a stop sign. Spot Solana ETF: What Exactly Is It? For those new to the ETF world, let’s quickly break down what a spot Solana ETF is and why it’s generating so much buzz: Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF): An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. It holds a basket of assets, in this case, Solana. Spot ETF vs. Futures ETF: A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, actual SOL tokens. This is different from a futures ETF, which invests in futures contracts that predict the future price of Solana, rather than holding the asset itself. Accessibility and Convenience: A spot Solana ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Solana without directly buying and managing SOL tokens themselves. This makes investing in Solana more accessible through brokerage accounts they already use. Potential for Increased Adoption: Approval of a spot Solana ETF could significantly boost Solana’s mainstream adoption by opening the doors to institutional investors and retail investors who prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Essentially, a spot Solana ETF could be a game-changer for Solana, bringing in new capital and potentially driving up demand for SOL tokens. VanEck Solana ETF: Who is VanEck and Why Does It Matter? VanEck is a well-established global investment manager with a strong track record in ETFs, including in the digital assets space. They were among the first to launch a Bitcoin futures ETF and have been vocal advocates for crypto adoption. Their proposal for a spot Solana ETF carries weight for several reasons: Aspect Significance of VanEck Reputation and Experience VanEck’s established reputation in the ETF market lends credibility to the Solana ETF proposal. Their experience navigating regulatory processes increases the likelihood of a well-structured and compliant application. First Mover Advantage If approved, VanEck’s Solana ETF would be the first of its kind in the U.S., giving them a significant first-mover advantage in capturing market share. Commitment to Crypto VanEck’s ongoing commitment to digital assets signals their belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Solana. Their investment in developing a Solana ETF further validates Solana’s position in the market. VanEck’s involvement is a positive signal for the Solana ETF’s prospects, although SEC approval is still the ultimate hurdle. Crypto ETF Approval: A Broader Regulatory Landscape The SEC’s decision on the VanEck Solana ETF is happening within a broader context of evolving crypto regulation and ETF approvals. Here’s a look at the bigger picture: Bitcoin ETF Approval: The SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was a watershed moment for the crypto industry. It demonstrated a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto as an investment asset class. Ethereum ETF Race: Following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, the focus shifted to Ethereum ETFs. Several applications are currently under review, and the market is eagerly anticipating a decision. Altcoin ETFs on the Horizon?: With Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum ETFs gaining traction, the possibility of ETFs for other established cryptocurrencies like Solana is becoming a more realistic prospect. However, the SEC is likely to proceed cautiously and evaluate each case individually. Regulatory Uncertainty Remains: Despite progress, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a major factor in the crypto space. The SEC’s approach to crypto ETFs and digital asset regulation is still evolving, leading to delays and cautious decision-making. The journey towards broader crypto ETF adoption is a marathon, not a sprint. The SEC’s postponement on the Solana ETF underscores the ongoing regulatory hurdles and the need for patience. What Does the SEC Postpones Decision Mean for Solana Investors? So, what should Solana investors make of this news? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Expect Continued Volatility: The delay introduces uncertainty, which could lead to continued price volatility for SOL. Be prepared for potential price swings in response to regulatory news. Long-Term Perspective is Key: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Solana and its ecosystem. ETF approval is a potential catalyst, but Solana’s value proposition extends beyond just ETFs. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and SEC announcements regarding crypto ETFs. News and updates can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. Don’t Panic Sell: A postponement is not a rejection. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Consider this a temporary delay in the broader adoption narrative. Diversification is Crucial: As always, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if you are bullish on Solana. While the delay might be disappointing for some, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective and focus on the bigger picture. The crypto market is known for its resilience and innovation, and regulatory developments are part of the maturation process. Future Outlook: When Might We See a Solana ETF? Predicting the SEC’s timeline is always challenging, but we can look at historical patterns and current trends to speculate on the future outlook for a spot Solana ETF: Extended Review Period: SEC reviews can take months, sometimes even years. Expect the review period for the Solana ETF to be extended beyond the initial deadline. Further Information Requests: The SEC may issue further requests for information to VanEck, seeking more details on custody, security, market surveillance, and other aspects of the ETF proposal. Potential for Approval (Eventually): While there are no guarantees, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs suggests a potential pathway for other crypto ETFs, including Solana. The key will be addressing the SEC’s concerns and demonstrating compliance. Timeline Uncertainty: It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline, but realistically, a decision on the VanEck Solana ETF might not come until late 2024 or even into 2025. Patience will be paramount for those anticipating a spot Solana ETF. The regulatory process is deliberate and thorough, and approvals are not guaranteed. However, the direction of travel in the crypto ETF space suggests that Solana ETFs, along with other altcoin ETFs, are a matter of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. Conclusion: The Solana ETF Journey Continues The SEC’s postponement of the decision on VanEck’s spot Solana ETF is a temporary setback, not a dead end. It reflects the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and cautious approach to crypto ETFs. For Solana and the broader crypto market, this means the wait for a spot Solana ETF continues. While the delay introduces short-term uncertainty, the long-term potential of Solana and the increasing acceptance of crypto as an asset class remain powerful drivers. Investors should stay informed, maintain a long-term perspective, and prepare for continued developments in the evolving landscape of crypto regulation and ETFs. The journey to a Solana ETF may be taking longer than anticipated, but the destination remains a compelling prospect for the future of crypto investment.

This rebound is encompassing, as altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also seen their prices clear immediate resistance levels. When writing, the combined crypto market cap jumped by 4.51% in 24 hours to $2.69 trillion. With Bitcoin price leading the charge, the market may be set to recover the over $1 trillion lost thus far this year. Bitcoin Price and Altcoin Outlook Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin is up by 4.68% in 24 hours and trading for $83,014. From a low of $76,624.25 in 24 hours, BTC price rallied as high as $83,577.75 before settling at its current level. Beyond the coin’s price uptick, the trading volume has also jumped by 3%, reaching $57 billion. BTC 1D Price Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price also joined the rally, soaring 7.42% to $2.193. After dropping as low as $0.1453, its lowest in over 90 days, the Dogecoin price also jumped by 7.67% in 24 hours to $0.1669. Cardano followed a similar path, staging a recovery after ADA bears took control around the $0.76 level. The price actions of this altcoin have also been showcased in the crypto liquidation trend. With short sellers roped in, the market has now recorded over $599 million in 24 hours. Why are BTC, XRP, and ADA Prices Soaring? Despite the drawdown in the market over the past few weeks, key ecosystem catalyst have remained a constant. Earlier on March 11, Senator Cynthia Lummis re-introduced the Bitcoin Bill that will aid the delivery of President Donald Trump’s promise. Shortly before the White House Crypto Summit, the strategic Bitcoin reserve Executive Order had already been signed. However, BTC investors are just pricing in this positive shift with the introduction of the Bill. Other altcoins have also seen impressive ecosystem shifts in the past few hours. An increase in active addresses on the Ethereum network has boosted social sentiment for XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin. XRP and altcoin price growth also benefitted from their correlation with BTC. What Next for the Market? The trend in the market that has seen a massive recovery does not mean most coins have seen their prices bottom out. Market analysts are still calling for steeper corrections in the coming weeks, a trend considered normal in a bull market cycle. BitMEX co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes has called a $70,000 BTC price bottom in this cycle. However, one underlying agreement is that the market will hit a new top, which many say will be a selective rally moving forward.

Immutable X (IMX) has seen a 19.03% drop in the past seven days, with its price sinking to $0.4945 after hitting $0.5771 on March 9, 2025. Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential 300% breakout, but a new altcoin might outshine it with projected 3000% gains. Both projects are facing critical moments, and traders are on edge, waiting to see if IMX can recover or if NEAR will truly deliver on its hype. Amidst all this, a new powerhouse is emerging— Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike IMX and NEAR, which rely on market trends and speculation, Qubetics is solving a real-world problem: blockchain development complexity. With its QubeQode IDE, Qubetics makes building Web3 applications as simple as drag-and-drop, something even the biggest blockchain platforms haven’t fully mastered. And the best part? Its presale is exploding, with over $14.9 million already raised, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Qubetics: QubeQode IDE is Changing the Web3 Game Developing on blockchain has always been a nightmare for non-technical users. Most platforms require complex coding, smart contract audits, and deep knowledge of multiple blockchains. That’s where Qubetics comes in with QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment that simplifies blockchain application building. Imagine a startup that wants to launch a tokenized loyalty program without hiring an expensive blockchain developer. With QubeQode’s drag-and-drop components, they can integrate user authentication, token management, and data storage effortlessly. Or think about a gaming company looking to build a play-to-earn model—instead of coding smart contracts from scratch, they can use pre-written code snippets to integrate NFT rewards in minutes. For businesses, this means faster deployment, lower costs, and reduced risk of errors. And for individual creators, it means building Web3 applications without writing a single line of code. With QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is making blockchain accessible to everyone, which is why it’s being called one of the best crypto investments of the year. Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto Investment for Massive ROI The Qubetics presale is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about events in crypto. Every Sunday at 12 AM, the presale price increases by 10%, meaning early buyers secure the best deals. Currently, in Stage 25, $TICS is priced at $0.1074, with over 22,800 token holders and nearly 500 million tokens sold. As demand surges, those getting in now could be locking in life-changing gains in the best crypto investment of 2025. A $100 investment today gets you 930 $TICS at the current price. If $TICS climbs to $0.25 by the presale’s end, that turns into $232.50 (132.66% ROI). But that’s just the beginning. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that $100 turns into $930 (830.65% ROI). At $5, it skyrockets to $4,650 (4,553.26% ROI), and at $10, it becomes $9,300 (9,206.51% ROI). The most bullish predictions put $TICS at $15, which would turn that $100 investment into $13,950 (13,859.77% ROI). With the Qubetics presale gaining momentum and the Q2 2025 mainnet launch set to bring full functionality, this is shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments before the price jumps again. Those waiting on the sidelines might regret not locking in their tokens before the next price increase. Immutable X (IMX) Sees a Sharp Decline—What’s Next? Immutable X (IMX) has faced a rough week, dropping 19.03% over the past seven days. The token is now trading at $0.4945, down from $0.5771 on March 9, 2025. This decline has also hit its market cap, which fell 8.44% to $874.44 million, despite a 32.20% surge in 24-hour trading volume to $48.07 million. With IMX’s total supply capped at 2 billion tokens and a circulating supply of 1.76 billion, some traders see this dip as a potential buy opportunity, while others worry about continued downward momentum. If IMX can reclaim the $0.55–$0.60 range, it could signal a reversal, but failure to do so might lead to further declines. While Immutable X remains a leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs and gaming, short-term volatility is keeping traders on edge. Whether it can recover depends largely on market sentiment and upcoming ecosystem developments. NEAR Protocol: Promising Price Projections NEAR Protocol has been making waves with its focus on scalability, usability, and developer-friendly features for dApps and smart contracts. As of early 2025, NEAR is trading at $3.08, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.92 billion. Price predictions suggest that by the end of 2025, NEAR could reach a maximum price of $6.71, with an average price of $4.99. This anticipated growth is attributed to increasing adoption of NEAR’s technology, especially as decentralized applications gain traction in sectors like finance and gaming. The platform’s emphasis on improving scalability and reducing transaction costs positions it favorably in the blockchain space. Looking further ahead, projections indicate that NEAR could break the $10 barrier by 2027, driven by the expanding DeFi sector and the growing demand for scalable blockchain solutions Final Verdict: Which Crypto Has the Best Upside? Immutable X is struggling to hold its price, and Near Protocol is waiting for a breakout. But Qubetics ($TICS) is offering something neither IMX nor NEAR can match—true accessibility for blockchain development. By making Web3 application building as easy as drag-and-drop, Qubetics is removing barriers that have kept blockchain adoption limited to developers and tech experts. And with the Qubetics presale still open, there’s a limited-time opportunity to buy in before the next price increase. With over $14.9 million raised, a mainnet launch in Q2 2025, and ROI projections reaching 13,859.77%, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being called one of the best crypto investments of the year. Those looking to join this crypto presale might not want to wait much longer—before prices rise again.

Qubetics simplifies blockchain development with QubeQode IDE, making it easy for businesses and individuals to build Web3 applications without coding. How does the Qubetics presale work? The Qubetics presale price increases by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring that early participants secure the best prices before the Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Can Immutable X (IMX) and Near Protocol (NEAR) recover? IMX needs to reclaim $0.55–$0.60 to regain strength, while NEAR is positioned for a potential 300% breakout if market conditions stay favorable.

According to the analyst firm, Bitcoin remains on a downward trajectory, forming lower highs and lower lows, despite a short-term reaction at the critical $79,300 Fibonacci level (0.5 Fib). Selling pressure remains dominant, with analysts pointing to a potential bottom if key resistance levels are reclaimed. Here are the critical price levels ahead of BTC, according to the analytics firm: $87,500-$89,900: A break above this zone could signal short-term bullish momentum. $91,700 – $95,900: A stronger resistance area with significant liquidity. Only a sustainable break above this range would confirm a possible trend reversal. $79,300 (0.5 Fib): This level has held so far, but repeated tests increase the chances of a breakdown. $70,900-$72,800: If the $79,300 support fails, Bitcoin could target this lower liquidity zone that lines up with the trendline support. Related News: White House Makes Statement on Recent Market Declines According to MakroVision, Bitcoin is struggling with a downtrend and holding the $79,300 area could lead to a relief rally. However, a break above $91,700 is needed for bullish confirmation. *This is not investment advice.

However, the wait just got a bit longer. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just dropped news that has sent ripples through the crypto market: the decision on Canary Capital’s proposed spot LTC ETF has been postponed. Let’s dive into what this means, why it matters, and what could be next. What’s the Latest on the SEC and the Litecoin ETF? In a recent filing, the SEC officially announced that it needs more time to evaluate Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin ETF . This isn’t a rejection, but rather a pause – a regulatory deep breath before potentially giving the green light. The initial proposal aimed to list and trade shares of an ETF that directly holds Litecoin, offering investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to LTC without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This postponement means the SEC requires additional scrutiny before making a final verdict on this novel financial product. Why the SEC Delay on ETF Approval? The SEC’s cautious approach to crypto-related investment products is no secret. When it comes to ETF approval , particularly for spot crypto ETFs, the regulator has consistently emphasized investor protection and market integrity. Here are a few key reasons likely contributing to this delay: Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its price swings. The SEC needs to ensure that the underlying Litecoin market is robust enough to support an ETF and prevent manipulation. Regulatory Framework Evolution: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still developing. The SEC might be waiting for further clarity or establishing precedents before approving a spot Litecoin ETF . Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Litecoin assets within the ETF structure is paramount. The SEC will meticulously examine Canary Capital’s custody solutions. Market Surveillance: The SEC needs confidence in the surveillance mechanisms in place to detect and prevent fraud and manipulation in the Litecoin trading markets that would underpin the ETF. Canary Capital’s Spot Litecoin ETF Proposal: A Closer Look Canary Capital, the firm behind this LTC ETF proposal, is aiming to provide investors with a straightforward way to invest in Litecoin through a traditional exchange. Here’s what we know about their proposition: Aspect Details Type of ETF Spot Litecoin ETF – directly holds Litecoin Proposer Canary Capital Objective Provide accessible and regulated Litecoin exposure Current Status Decision postponed by the SEC The ETF, if approved, would trade on a major exchange, making it easily accessible to both institutional and retail investors. This accessibility is a key benefit, potentially opening up Litecoin investment to a wider audience who may be hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges directly. The Potential Impact of a Spot Litecoin ETF The approval of a spot Litecoin ETF could be a significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Here’s a glimpse at the potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar and regulated investment vehicle, potentially attracting substantial institutional capital into Litecoin. Enhanced Liquidity: ETF trading could boost liquidity in the Litecoin market, making it easier for larger trades to be executed without significant price slippage. Mainstream Adoption: An ETF can simplify Litecoin investment for retail investors, driving broader adoption and awareness of the cryptocurrency. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF inflows could exert upward pressure on Litecoin’s price. What Does This Delay Mean for Litecoin and Crypto Investors? While a postponement can be disappointing, it’s crucial to remember that it’s not a rejection. The SEC is conducting its due diligence, which is ultimately aimed at creating a safer and more regulated crypto investment environment. For crypto investors , this means: Continued Patience: The path to spot crypto ETFs is likely to be gradual. Delays are part of the regulatory process. Focus on Fundamentals: This postponement underscores the importance of focusing on the long-term fundamentals of crypto projects like Litecoin, rather than relying solely on ETF approvals for price appreciation. Monitoring Regulatory Developments: Keeping an eye on SEC announcements and regulatory updates will be crucial to understanding the timeline for potential ETF approvals. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto ETFs The demand for spot crypto ETFs is undeniable. While the SEC has been cautious, the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US signals a potential shift in attitude. This delay for the LTC ETF might simply be part of a phased approach, with regulators carefully assessing each asset class. The industry is closely watching to see if this postponement is a temporary setback or a sign of continued regulatory hurdles for spot crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. In conclusion, the SEC’s decision to postpone the verdict on Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF is a reminder of the ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. While the delay might temper immediate enthusiasm, it also highlights the SEC’s commitment to investor protection and market integrity. The journey towards mainstream crypto investment through ETFs continues, and while the road may have a few bumps, the direction appears to be forward. Investors should remain informed, patient, and focused on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency market.

MiCA has reportedly “opened the door for banks to start offering the custody and the sale of crypto,” the outlet wrote. CaixaBank Confirms Crypto Plans, Report Claims BBVA announced its own plans to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading services earlier this week. However, El Español claimed that a number of other major Spanish banking players, including Bankinter, Sabadell, Unicaja, and MyInvestor said they were “not working on” launching crypto-related services.

BBVA will begin offering custody and sales for BTC and ETH via its mobile application later this year. The bank has completed authorization protocols with the Spanish regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The new regulations provided companies that already offer crypto trading with a year to complete their own registration protocols. The media outlet added that the CNMV “is now working” on the applications from three other financial services operators. While the four firms’ foray into the Spanish crypto scene represents an adoption milestone, the same newspaper noted: “We are not seeing an avalanche of applications from banks. The supervisor is only currently working to process four applications.” The media outlet said it had been able to “confirm” that one of the applications was from Renta 4. The other two, however, come from “non-banking platforms,” El Español wrote. CaixaBank and Kutxabank Have Not Yet Filed Applications Spokespeople from CaixaBank and Kutxabank told the media outlet they were still “working” on plans to offer crypto trading. But the spokespeople confirmed the two banks are yet to file their CNMV applications. CaixaBank said that it was “studying the idea” of “launching cryptoasset services in Spain this year.” The CaixaBank offices in Barcelona, Spain.

It confirmed that it was “already working on” its CNMV application. By most estimations, CaixaBank is Spain’s third-largest bank.

Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of XRP and the broader crypto ETF landscape. Why the SEC’s ETF Postponement for Grayscale’s XRP Proposal? The SEC’s decision to delay the verdict on Grayscale’s XRP ETF isn’t entirely unexpected, but it certainly injects more uncertainty into the market. Regulatory bodies like the SEC often take their time to thoroughly assess new financial products, especially those in the volatile cryptocurrency space. Here’s a breakdown of potential reasons behind this ETF Postponement : Market Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrencies, including XRP, are known for their price swings. The SEC might be taking extra time to evaluate the potential risks associated with an XRP ETF, especially concerning investor protection in such a volatile market. Regulatory Clarity Still Evolving: The regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies is still under development. The SEC might be waiting for more clarity on crypto regulations before giving the green light to an XRP ETF. This cautious approach is typical when dealing with novel asset classes. Thorough Due Diligence: ETFs are complex financial instruments. The SEC needs to conduct thorough due diligence to ensure that the proposed XRP ETF meets all regulatory requirements and protects investors from potential fraud and manipulation. This process inherently takes time. Precedent Setting: Approving an XRP ETF would set a significant precedent. The SEC likely wants to carefully consider the implications of such a decision on the broader crypto market and future ETF applications. It’s crucial to remember that a postponement isn’t a rejection. It simply means the SEC requires more time to evaluate all aspects of Grayscale’s proposal. The crypto community now waits with bated breath for further updates and insights into the SEC’s deliberation process. Franklin Templeton Joins the XRP ETF Race: A Glimmer of Hope? While the SEC’s delay might seem like a setback, the entry of Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF race is a significant development that injects optimism into the situation. Franklin Templeton, a global investment management firm with trillions in assets under management, is a heavyweight player in the financial world. Their decision to file for an XRP ETF signals growing institutional interest in XRP and the potential for crypto ETFs. Here’s why Franklin Templeton’s involvement is noteworthy: Institutional Validation: A firm of Franklin Templeton’s stature entering the XRP ETF space provides substantial validation to XRP as an asset class. It demonstrates that institutional investors are taking XRP seriously and see its potential. Increased Competition: Franklin Templeton’s entry creates competition in the XRP ETF application process. This competitive landscape could potentially push the SEC to expedite its review process and ultimately lead to a more favorable outcome for XRP ETFs in general. Market Confidence Boost: Despite the SEC delay, Franklin Templeton’s move can boost market confidence in XRP. It suggests that even amidst regulatory hurdles, major financial institutions believe in the long-term prospects of XRP and crypto ETFs. Wider Investor Access: If both Grayscale and Franklin Templeton (or either of them) succeed in launching an XRP ETF, it will open up XRP investment to a wider range of investors, including those who prefer traditional investment vehicles like ETFs. Franklin Templeton’s participation could be a game-changer, potentially accelerating the path towards an approved XRP ETF despite the current regulatory delays. Decoding the Grayscale XRP ETF Proposal Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, is at the forefront of pushing for crypto ETFs. Their XRP ETF proposal is part of a broader effort to make cryptocurrency investments more accessible through regulated and familiar investment products. Understanding Grayscale’s proposal is key to grasping the significance of the SEC’s delay. Key aspects of Grayscale’s XRP ETF proposal likely include: Aspect Description Objective To provide investors with exposure to XRP through a traditional ETF structure, traded on major stock exchanges. Structure Likely a physically-backed ETF, meaning it would hold actual XRP tokens, similar to how gold ETFs hold physical gold. Custody Secure custody solutions for the underlying XRP assets, likely using institutional-grade custodians experienced in digital asset storage. Trading Shares of the ETF would be traded on stock exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of access for investors. Regulatory Compliance Designed to comply with all relevant SEC regulations and ETF listing requirements. The SEC’s scrutiny of Grayscale’s proposal, and now Franklin Templeton’s, highlights the regulatory hurdles that crypto ETFs face. However, the persistence of major players like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton signals a strong belief in the eventual approval of these products. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Opportunities in XRP ETFs The path to an approved XRP ETF is not without its challenges. The SEC’s cautious approach, coupled with the inherent volatility of the crypto market, presents significant hurdles. However, the potential benefits for investors and the crypto ecosystem are substantial. Challenges: SEC Regulatory Scrutiny: The primary challenge remains the SEC’s rigorous regulatory review process. Gaining SEC approval for any crypto ETF, especially one based on XRP, requires overcoming significant regulatory hurdles. Market Volatility: XRP’s price volatility can be a concern for regulators who prioritize investor protection. Mitigating volatility risks within an ETF structure is crucial. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of XRP assets held by the ETF is paramount. Robust security measures and trusted custodians are essential for SEC approval. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is wary of market manipulation in the crypto space. ETF proposals must demonstrate mechanisms to prevent and detect market manipulation. Opportunities: Increased Investor Access: An XRP ETF would democratize access to XRP investment, allowing retail and institutional investors to participate without directly holding XRP tokens. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on regulated exchanges, providing greater liquidity compared to directly trading XRP on crypto exchanges. Mainstream Adoption: Approval of an XRP ETF would be a major step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, signaling regulatory acceptance and fostering greater institutional involvement. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF investments could potentially lead to price appreciation for XRP. Actionable Insights: What Should XRP Investors Do Now? So, what should investors make of this situation? The SEC’s delay and Franklin Templeton’s entry create a mixed bag of signals. Here are some actionable insights for XRP investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates regarding the SEC’s decision on Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF proposals. Regulatory developments can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is key in the volatile crypto market. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and investment strategies. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are often long-term plays. Focus on the long-term potential of XRP and the broader crypto market rather than short-term price fluctuations driven by regulatory news. Understand ETF Risks: While ETFs offer convenience, they also come with risks. Understand the specific risks associated with crypto ETFs before investing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the volatility, consider using dollar-cost averaging to invest in XRP or other cryptocurrencies. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of price swings. The current situation calls for patience and informed decision-making. The journey to an XRP ETF may be taking longer than anticipated, but the underlying momentum and institutional interest remain strong. Conclusion: The Crypto ETF Saga Continues The SEC’s postponement of the decision on Grayscale’s XRP ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles that the crypto industry still faces. However, the entry of Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF arena injects a powerful dose of optimism and underscores the growing institutional appetite for crypto investment products. The road to an XRP ETF approval might be winding, but the destination – a more accessible and mainstream crypto investment landscape – remains firmly in sight.

Yann LeCun has been vocal about his dislike for the US first buddy and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. Last year, in a lengthy post on X, LeCun slammed Musk for his public positions on sensitive issues like politics, journalism, and the media. He also stated that Musk has no problem spreading “batshit-crazy conspiracy theories as long as they serve his interests.” My opinion of @elonmusk I like his cars (I own a 2015 S, and 2023 S), his rockets, his solar energy systems, and his satellite communication system. I also like his positions on open source and patents. But I very much disagree with him on a number of issues. I disagree with… — Yann LeCun (@ylecun) June 2, 2024 LeCun has also been pretty critical of Trump, going as far as calling the president a pathological liar. Now that Musk and Trump have strengthened their relationship and are essentially running the country together, LeCun is back to openly criticizing their methods and the potential damage their strategies could cause now and in the future. LeCun criticizes Trump’s policies on academia and AI research LeCun has accused the Trump administration of initiating a “witch hunt in academia.” His remarks follow several warnings from leaders in the AI industry that President Donald Trump’s policies could weaken America’s standing in the AI sector. On Monday, a coalition of AI and tech groups sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, stating that the Trump administration’s decision to make cuts to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) budget could negatively impact the US in terms of AI leadership. President Trump initially supported AI research at NIST during his first term, but his current administration is scaling back funding and public-private collaboration. In the letter sent to Lutnick, the group outlined the importance of their work to the US government and stated that they are open to working with the administration to work out a strategy that benefits both parties. “NIST’s work in AI, begun under President Trump’s first term, has proven to be a critical enabler for the U.S. government and U.S. industry to maintain AI leadership globally. As the Administration considers changes to personnel and programs to better align agencies with priorities, we encourage a strategy that leverages NIST’s leadership and expertise on standards development, voluntary frameworks, public-private sector collaboration, and international harmonization,” the letter read. The group went on to acknowledge the administration’s dedication to managing federal funds effectively and how the agency contributes to the economic growth of the US. “We recognize the need to shift priorities toward a security-focused approach that maximizes economic potential and continues to foster innovation. In this context, we emphasize that NIST’s work represents a high value investment that directly contributes to U.S. economic growth, competitiveness, and technological leadership. We caution that downsizing NIST or eliminating these initiatives will have ramifications for the ability of the American AI industry to continue to lead globally.” LeCun drew parallels between Trump’s decision to cut the NIST budget and the Cold War-era Red Scare. At that time, Qian Xuesen, a Chinese scientist was deported from the US in the 1950s and later worked to advance China’s nuclear missile program. Dan A. Kimball, the then-United States Undersecretary of the Navy, remarked that deporting Qian Xuesen was “the stupidest thing this country ever did.” In relation to this situation, LeCun is saying that Trump is making a stupid decision by stifling AI research. The effect of the Trump administration on research The Trump administration is blowing its way through federal agencies and employees, serially issuing executive orders to reduce funding and lay off employees. It announced drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health, not acknowledging that the move would effectively and abruptly cut off billions in federal funding for biomedical research. These cuts in funding have sparked significant concern among the US-based scientific community. Elon Musk’s DOGE , created for the purpose of cost cutting, has also been deployed to federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA. Trump also signed an executive order against the DEIA mandate. The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Talent Sourcing for America initiative was launched in September 2022 to position the federal government as a model of inclusion and equity. With Trump putting an end to it, many are concerned that it could threaten scientific research at universities. “The US seems set on destroying its public research funding system. Many US-based scientists are looking for a Plan B,” LeCun wrote in a post on LinkedIn . Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

CEO Arvind Krishna has weighed in on the burning question: Will AI replace programmers? His answer? Not anytime soon. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where technology evolves at warp speed, understanding the trajectory of AI and its impact on related fields like coding is crucial. Let’s dive into Krishna’s insights and what they mean for the future of tech professionals. Will AI Coding Tools Truly Replace Human Programmers? The fear of automation looms large in many industries, and software development is no exception. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, recently predicted that a staggering 90% of code could be AI-generated within a mere three to six months. However, IBM’s Arvind Krishna offers a more grounded perspective. He estimates that AI might handle around 20-30% of coding tasks, a far cry from a complete takeover. Krishna emphasizes that while AI excels at simple coding tasks, complex scenarios still demand human ingenuity and problem-solving skills. This is particularly relevant in the crypto world, where intricate smart contracts and decentralized applications require nuanced coding expertise. IBM CEO AI Insights on Global Talent and Growth Krishna’s SXSW interview wasn’t solely focused on AI. He also touched upon global trade and talent, issues that indirectly impact the tech landscape, including the cryptocurrency sector. He highlighted the importance of global collaboration for economic growth, stating, “every 10% increase in global trade leads to a 1% increase in local GDP.” This interconnectedness extends to talent acquisition. Krishna advocated for policies that encourage international talent flow into the U.S., arguing that it fosters innovation and mutual learning. In the crypto space, which is inherently global and decentralized, this perspective resonates deeply. Openness to international talent is vital for the continued growth and diversification of blockchain technology. AI Augmentation, Not Replacement: The Future of Programmers Instead of viewing AI as a job-stealing menace, Krishna positions it as a powerful tool to enhance programmer productivity. He argues that AI will augment human capabilities, allowing programmers to achieve more in less time. Think of it like this: Increased Efficiency: AI can automate repetitive coding tasks, freeing up programmers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving. Faster Development Cycles: With AI assistance, software development can become significantly faster, enabling quicker iterations and time-to-market, crucial in the fast-paced crypto industry. Improved Code Quality: AI tools can help identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities, leading to more robust and secure code, especially important for blockchain applications where security is paramount. Krishna draws parallels to the introduction of calculators and Photoshop, tools that initially sparked fears of replacing mathematicians and artists but ultimately amplified their capabilities. He believes AI will follow a similar trajectory, empowering programmers rather than rendering them obsolete. This is good news for the blockchain developer community, suggesting a future where AI assists in building even more sophisticated and innovative crypto solutions. Navigating the Challenges of AI Coding While optimistic about AI’s potential, Krishna acknowledges existing challenges, particularly around intellectual property related to AI training and outputs. These are critical considerations as AI models become more sophisticated and are trained on vast datasets. For the cryptocurrency world, where open-source principles often prevail, navigating IP issues related to AI-generated code will be an evolving discussion. Another point Krishna raises is the energy consumption of current AI models. He notes that while models like OpenAI’s o1 are energy-intensive, advancements like those from DeepSeek indicate a path towards smaller, more efficient models. This is a significant factor for the crypto community, which is increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of technology. The development of energy-efficient AI could align well with the growing focus on sustainable blockchain solutions. Quantum Computing: The Next Frontier Beyond AI Interestingly, Krishna differentiates between AI’s capabilities and those of quantum computing. He argues that while AI excels at learning from existing knowledge, quantum computing holds the key to unlocking new scientific discoveries. IBM is heavily invested in quantum computing, and Krishna sees it as the technology that will truly accelerate innovation, going beyond the limitations of current AI. For the crypto world, quantum computing poses both potential opportunities and threats, particularly in the realm of cryptography and blockchain security. Understanding its trajectory is essential for future-proofing blockchain technologies. In essence, Krishna’s message is one of measured optimism. He sees AI as a powerful tool that will transform the programming landscape but not decimate it. His insights provide a valuable counterpoint to more alarmist predictions and offer a reassuring outlook for those in the tech and cryptocurrency industries. The future of programmers, according to IBM’s CEO, is not about replacement but about evolution and collaboration with AI. Key Takeaways: AI will augment, not replace, programmers: Expect AI to become a powerful tool for developers, increasing productivity and efficiency. Focus on complex problem-solving: Human programmers will continue to be essential for intricate coding tasks and innovative solutions, especially in fields like blockchain. Global talent is crucial: Embrace international collaboration to foster innovation and growth in the tech sector, including cryptocurrency. Energy efficiency in AI is key: Advancements are being made towards more sustainable AI models, aligning with the sustainability goals of the crypto community. Quantum computing holds future potential: Keep an eye on quantum computing as a technology that could revolutionize scientific discovery and impact blockchain security. Ultimately, the future of AI and programming appears to be one of synergy, not substitution. As AI tools become more sophisticated, the role of human programmers will evolve, demanding adaptability and a willingness to leverage these powerful new capabilities. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this means exciting opportunities to build even more innovative and impactful decentralized technologies with the assistance of AI.

41507565,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139309,1741737033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent SEC Delay: Canary Capital’s Solana ETF Approval Faces Postponement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delay-solana-etf/,"In a move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a postponement on its decision regarding the proposed Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Canary Capital. This delay introduces a layer of uncertainty into the highly anticipated crypto ETF space, particularly for Solana enthusiasts and the broader digital asset investment community. Let’s delve into what this SEC ETF delay means and what could be the potential ramifications. What Does the SEC’s Solana ETF Delay Signify? The SEC’s decision to postpone the verdict on Canary Capital’s Solana ETF application isn’t entirely unexpected, but it’s undoubtedly a significant development. For those unfamiliar, an ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot crypto ETF approval , specifically for Solana, would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This is a game-changer because: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, making crypto investments available to a wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges directly. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a sense of security and compliance that some investors find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, meaning they can be bought and sold easily during market hours, providing flexibility to investors. However, the SEC’s postponement injects a dose of reality into the optimistic narrative surrounding crypto ETFs, especially those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It raises questions about the regulatory body’s comfort level with altcoins like Solana and the broader implications for future crypto ETF approval processes. Why Canary Capital’s Solana ETF is a Big Deal? Canary Capital ETF proposing a spot Solana ETF is a noteworthy event for several reasons: First Mover Advantage (Potentially): If approved, this would be the first spot Solana ETF in the U.S. market, giving Canary Capital a significant first-mover advantage. This could attract substantial investment as Solana gains more mainstream acceptance. Validation for Solana: A successful Canary Capital ETF would be a massive validation for Solana as an asset class. It signals institutional interest and growing confidence in SOL’s long-term prospects beyond just retail investment. Diversification in Crypto ETFs: Currently, the ETF market is heavily focused on Bitcoin and, increasingly, Ethereum. A Solana ETF would diversify the crypto ETF landscape, offering investors more choices and opportunities to invest in different blockchain ecosystems. The proposal itself underscores the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the desire from traditional financial players to offer regulated investment products centered around digital assets beyond the giants like Bitcoin. What’s Behind the SEC’s Hesitation on Solana ETF? While the SEC has approved Bitcoin spot ETFs and is seemingly moving towards Ethereum ETFs, the delay in the Solana ETF decision suggests ongoing scrutiny. What could be the potential reasons for this hesitation? Regulatory Uncertainty around Altcoins: The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum remains somewhat ambiguous. There are ongoing debates about whether certain cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. Solana, while a major player, falls into this category of altcoins that face greater regulatory uncertainty compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are often considered commodities. Market Volatility and Maturity of Solana: While Solana has established itself as a prominent blockchain, it’s still relatively newer and potentially more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SEC might be taking a more cautious approach to ensure the market’s maturity and resilience before approving ETFs based on assets like SOL. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators are always concerned about market manipulation. The SEC needs to be convinced that the Solana market is sufficiently robust and surveilled to prevent manipulation in an ETF product. This requires assessing the liquidity and oversight mechanisms in place for Solana trading. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of underlying Solana assets for an ETF is crucial. The SEC needs to be satisfied with the custody solutions proposed by Canary Capital and the overall security framework for holding SOL at an institutional scale. It’s important to remember that the SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Their due diligence process, while frustrating for those eager for a Solana ETF, is a necessary step to ensure responsible innovation in the financial markets. The Impact of the SEC ETF Delay on SOL Price News of the SEC ETF delay can have a noticeable impact on the SOL price impact and broader market sentiment. In the short term, such delays can lead to: Price Volatility: Disappointment surrounding the delayed approval can trigger price volatility for Solana. Some investors might sell off their SOL holdings due to the uncertainty, leading to downward pressure. Conversely, others might see this as a temporary setback and an opportunity to buy at lower prices. Market Sentiment Shift: The delay could dampen overall market sentiment towards Solana and potentially other altcoins seeking ETF approvals. It might reinforce the perception that regulatory hurdles are significant and that widespread ETF adoption for altcoins is still some time away. Reduced Institutional Investment in Short-Term: Institutional investors often wait for regulatory clarity before making significant investments. Delays in ETF approvals can postpone the influx of institutional capital into Solana and similar assets. However, it’s crucial to consider the long-term perspective. While short-term SOL price impact might be negative, the underlying fundamentals of Solana and the broader trend towards crypto adoption remain unchanged. A delay is not a rejection, and the SEC is still in the process of evaluation. What’s Next for the Solana ETF and Crypto ETF Landscape? While this SEC ETF delay is a temporary setback, it doesn’t necessarily derail the prospect of a Solana ETF in the future. Here’s what to watch for: SEC’s Revised Timeline: The SEC will likely announce a new deadline for their decision. Investors should monitor official SEC filings and announcements for updates on the revised timeline. Canary Capital’s Response: How Canary Capital responds to this delay will be crucial. They might need to provide additional information or address specific concerns raised by the SEC. Their engagement with the regulatory body will be key. Broader Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on overall regulatory developments in the crypto space. Any shifts in the SEC’s stance on crypto assets or ETF approvals will impact the future prospects of a Solana ETF. Market Evolution: The continued growth and maturation of the Solana ecosystem, including increased adoption, network upgrades, and developer activity, will strengthen the case for a Solana ETF in the long run. Conclusion: Patience is Key in the Crypto ETF Race The SEC’s postponement of the decision on the Canary Capital Solana ETF is a reminder that regulatory processes take time, especially in the nascent and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. While the delay might bring short-term disappointment and SOL price impact concerns, it’s not an outright rejection. The path to crypto ETF approval , particularly for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, is likely to be gradual and require ongoing dialogue between industry players and regulators. For investors, this situation underscores the importance of patience and a long-term perspective in crypto investments. The demand for crypto ETFs is undeniable, and the eventual approval of a Solana ETF, while delayed, remains a strong possibility. Staying informed, understanding the regulatory landscape, and focusing on the fundamental value of projects like Solana will be crucial navigating this evolving space.

President Donald Trump, who previously threatened to raise the tariffs to 50%, ultimately opted against a higher increase, offering no exemptions or waivers. “Pursuant to previous executive orders, the 25 percent steel and aluminum tariff will go into effect at midnight on March 12, with no exceptions or waivers for Canada and all of our other trading partners,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement announcing the decision. Trump first said today that he would double tariffs on Canadian metals in retaliation for Ontario's decision to impose a 25% tax on electricity exported to U.S. states. The announcement sent markets tumbling, adding to the recent volatility in North American trade sectors. Related News: Will the White House Organize a New Big Cryptocurrency Summit? Senior Official Answers But there was a breakthrough after Ontario Premier Doug Ford and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the Canadian province would suspend a planned tariff on electricity exports. The two officials are set to meet in Washington on Thursday to discuss trade relations. Following the decision, Ford said it was important to reduce tensions, saying: “In every negotiation, there comes a point where the tensions get heated and need to come down. This was the right decision.” Shortly after, Trump indicated that he was open to reconsidering the increased tariffs. Despite the temporary reprieve, trade tensions between the US and Canada remain high. *This is not investment advice.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,400 followers on the social media platform X that he believes SOL will spend the next two years in deep bear territory. While Bluntz is long-term bearish on SOL, he predicts that the altcoin will witness counter-trend rallies in the coming months but notes that the surges will likely set up Solana for an even deeper drawdown. “SOL now down 57% from the highs. Now that it’s cool to hate it again, I can share my thoughts without having to worry about getting roasted by pleb reply guys. The rise/bull market lasted 762 days, the bear, (AT MINIMUM) will likely last about 70% or so in time. Best case, this drags out to mid-2026 and in the worst case, end of 2026. This move so far is likely an A wave and at some point there will probably be a very slow drawn-out complacency shoulder up that most will mistake for a new bull market.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his analysis, which states that an asset will go through an ABC correction after completing a five-wave surge. Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SOL will end its A-wave pullback once it goes below $100. He also predicts that SOL will kick off a counter-trend B-wave rally en route to $200 by early 2026 before crashing to around $80 in 2027 for the C-wave correction. At that point, Bluntz predicts that SOL will launch a new five-wave rally that could see Solana trading above $300 in 2028. At time of writing, SOL is worth $118.10, down nearly 7% on the day. Turning the US Dollar Index (DXY), a benchmark of the value of the US dollar compared to a basket of six major currencies, Bluntz says that 2025 will be a horrible year for the dominant global reserve asset. “DXY getting absolutely murdered this week probably continues throughout the whole of 2025 in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that the DXY is now in the midst of a C-wave correction that could take the index below 100 points. At time of writing, the DXY is trading at 103.84 points.

41507978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139312,1741737687,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Stablecoin Debate: US House Committee Begins Regulatory Talks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-regulation-house-committee/,"The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with anticipation as the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has officially commenced discussions on stablecoins . This marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset landscape, signaling a deeper dive into regulatory frameworks that could shape the future of these increasingly popular digital currencies. For crypto enthusiasts and industry stakeholders alike, this development is something to watch closely. Why are Stablecoins Under the Spotlight? Stablecoins have emerged as a significant component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike their more volatile counterparts like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes them attractive for various use cases, including: Facilitating Trading: Stablecoins provide a less volatile asset for traders to move in and out of positions within the crypto market, acting as a safe haven during market fluctuations. Enabling Payments: Their price stability makes stablecoins suitable for everyday transactions and cross-border payments, offering a digital alternative to traditional currencies. DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the backbone of many Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, used for lending, borrowing, and yield farming due to their predictable value. However, the rapid growth and increasing adoption of stablecoins have also raised concerns among regulators globally. These concerns primarily revolve around: Systemic Risk: The potential for large-scale stablecoin adoption to impact the broader financial system if not properly regulated. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users are protected from potential risks associated with stablecoin issuers, including transparency and reserve management. Money Laundering and Illicit Activities: Addressing concerns about the use of stablecoins for illegal activities due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Inside the House Financial Services Committee Discussions on Crypto Regulations According to a report by Blockworks, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is not starting from scratch. Lawmakers are reportedly considering several bills, indicating a proactive approach to crafting crypto regulations . Key discussion points appear to include: Rep. Tom Emmer’s CBDC Issuance Restriction Law: This proposed law aims to limit the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The implications of a CBDC are far-reaching, and this bill suggests a cautious approach from some lawmakers, potentially favoring private sector innovation in the digital currency space. CFPB Regulations Targeting Tech Companies: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is reportedly looking at regulations targeting technology companies involved in payment apps and digital wallets. This could directly impact how stablecoins are integrated into existing payment infrastructures and consumer-facing applications. These discussions signal a multi-faceted approach to crypto regulations , encompassing both the potential of CBDCs and the existing landscape of private stablecoins and digital payment systems. The committee’s deliberations are crucial as they will likely set the stage for future legislation and regulatory clarity within the U.S. crypto market. Trump’s Stance: Stablecoin Legislation Before August Recess? Adding another layer of intrigue, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed a desire to see stablecoin legislation passed before the August recess. Speaking at the White House Crypto Summit, Trump’s comments highlight the urgency and political attention that stablecoin regulation is now receiving at the highest levels of government. This timeline, while ambitious, underscores the momentum behind establishing a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The push for swift action could be driven by various factors, including: Geopolitical Competition: The U.S. may be keen to establish itself as a leader in blockchain technology and digital asset regulation, particularly as other nations advance their own digital currency initiatives. Economic Stability: Policymakers might be aiming to mitigate potential risks associated with unregulated stablecoin growth to safeguard financial stability. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework could foster innovation and growth within the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency sectors by providing businesses with the necessary legal certainty to operate and invest. What Could These Discussions Mean for the Future of Stablecoins? The ongoing discussions by the House Financial Services Committee are not just procedural; they represent a critical juncture for the future of stablecoins and the broader crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Potential Outcome Impact on Stablecoins Clear Regulatory Framework Could foster wider adoption by institutional investors and mainstream users due to increased trust and legitimacy. May also lead to standardization and interoperability. Strict Regulations Could stifle innovation if overly burdensome, potentially pushing stablecoin activity to other jurisdictions with more lenient rules. May increase compliance costs for issuers. CBDC Development Could compete with private stablecoins, potentially reshaping the market. The extent of competition will depend on the design and accessibility of the CBDC. Consumer Protection Focus Likely to lead to enhanced transparency requirements for stablecoin issuers, potentially requiring regular audits and disclosures of reserves. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead of the Curve For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, whether as investors, developers, or businesses, staying informed about these regulatory developments is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Regulatory News: Keep a close watch on updates from the House Financial Services Committee and other regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC. Engage in Industry Discussions: Participate in industry forums and discussions to understand the potential impacts of upcoming regulations and contribute to shaping responsible regulatory frameworks. Assess Compliance Readiness: If you are involved in issuing or using stablecoins, begin assessing your compliance readiness for potential new regulations. This includes reviewing reserve management practices, KYC/AML procedures, and transparency measures. Diversify and Adapt: Be prepared to adapt your strategies based on the evolving regulatory landscape. Diversification across different types of cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols can help mitigate risks associated with regulatory changes. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Currency The U.S. House Financial Services Committee’s commencement of discussions on stablecoins is undeniably a crucial moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These deliberations will likely pave the way for significant regulatory changes that could define the trajectory of stablecoins and the broader digital currency ecosystem in the United States and potentially globally. As lawmakers grapple with balancing innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability, the crypto world watches with bated breath, anticipating the outcomes that will shape the future of finance.

41508300,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139313,1741738224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking SEC Delay: Canary Spot XRP ETF Decision Postponed – Crypto Investors Brace for Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-xrp-etf-decision/,"Just when crypto enthusiasts were holding their breath, anticipating a potential green light for another groundbreaking investment vehicle, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. In a recent filing that sent ripples through the digital asset space, the SEC announced a delay in its decision regarding the proposed Canary spot XRP ETF. This news has undoubtedly left many wondering – what does this mean for the future of XRP and the broader crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this significant development and explore its potential ramifications. What Exactly is a Spot XRP ETF and Why the Hype? Before we delve into the specifics of the SEC delay, let’s quickly recap what a spot XRP ETF is and why it’s generating so much buzz. In simple terms, a spot XRP ETF is a type of investment fund that directly holds XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the future price of an asset, a spot ETF holds the actual asset itself. This distinction is crucial because many investors, particularly institutional ones, prefer the direct exposure offered by spot ETFs. Here’s why the hype is real: Direct XRP Exposure: For investors keen on XRP, a spot ETF provides a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure without directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. This simplifies the investment process significantly. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: The approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a major catalyst for institutional adoption. Many institutions are hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties and custody concerns. An ETF listed on traditional exchanges alleviates these concerns. Market Maturation Signal: The launch of a spot crypto ETF , especially one tied to a prominent cryptocurrency like XRP, is seen as another step towards the maturation of the crypto market. It signals growing acceptance and integration with traditional financial systems. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and easy accessibility for a broad range of investors, from retail to institutional. Why the SEC Delay on the Canary Spot XRP ETF? Unpacking the Potential Reasons The burning question on everyone’s mind is: why the SEC delay ? While the official filing simply states a postponement, we can speculate on several potential reasons behind this decision. It’s important to remember that the SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Here are some likely factors contributing to the delay: Regulatory Scrutiny of XRP: XRP has had a complex relationship with the SEC, primarily due to the lawsuit filed against Ripple Labs in December 2020. Although there have been positive developments in the case, the SEC might still be exercising caution until there is complete clarity on XRP’s regulatory status. Market Volatility and Risk Assessment: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. The SEC may be taking extra time to thoroughly assess the risks associated with a spot XRP ETF, particularly in light of recent market fluctuations and concerns about investor protection. Novelty of Spot Crypto ETFs: Spot crypto ETFs are relatively new investment products, especially in the US. The SEC is likely treading carefully to establish a robust regulatory framework before approving more spot ETFs, including those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Internal Review Processes: The SEC has internal processes and timelines for reviewing complex financial products like ETFs. These processes can be lengthy and may involve multiple rounds of review and feedback, naturally leading to delays. Political and External Pressures: Regulatory bodies often operate under political and external pressures. There might be ongoing discussions and debates within the SEC or with other government agencies regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto ETFs, contributing to the delay. Impact of the SEC Delay on XRP and the Crypto Market The news of the SEC delay on the Canary spot XRP ETF has immediate and potential long-term implications for both XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Let’s examine some key impacts: Impact Area Short-Term Effects Long-Term Effects XRP Price Potential price dip due to dampened investor enthusiasm and uncertainty. Continued price volatility influenced by regulatory developments and overall market sentiment. Investor Sentiment Disappointment and frustration among XRP holders and crypto ETF hopefuls. Potential shift in investor strategies, with some becoming more cautious while others remain optimistic about eventual approval. Crypto ETF Market Slowdown in the expansion of spot crypto ETF offerings in the US. Delayed but not necessarily derailed progress towards broader acceptance of crypto ETFs as mainstream investment products. Regulatory Landscape Reinforces the cautious approach of the SEC towards crypto regulation. May prompt further dialogue and clarification on regulatory frameworks for digital assets and ETFs. While the delay is undoubtedly a setback for those anticipating a spot XRP ETF, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The SEC’s decision is not a rejection, but rather a postponement. This indicates that the application is still under consideration, and the SEC is likely seeking more time to conduct thorough due diligence. What’s Next for the Canary Spot XRP ETF and Crypto ETFs in General? So, what can we expect moving forward? Here are some key points to consider regarding the future of the Canary spot XRP ETF and the broader landscape of crypto ETFs: Continued SEC Review: The SEC will continue its review process. The timeframe for a final decision remains uncertain, but investors should monitor SEC filings and announcements for updates. Industry Engagement: ETF issuers and crypto industry players will likely engage in further dialogue with the SEC to address concerns and provide additional information to support the approval of spot crypto ETFs. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: The delay underscores the ongoing need for greater regulatory clarity in the crypto space. Industry participants and regulators need to work collaboratively to establish clear rules and guidelines that foster innovation while protecting investors. Global Developments: It’s worth noting that other jurisdictions have already approved spot crypto ETFs. The US may eventually follow suit, but the timeline remains subject to regulatory considerations. Diversification and Innovation: Despite the delay, the demand for crypto investment products is likely to persist. The industry will continue to innovate and explore various avenues to offer investors regulated and accessible exposure to digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty of Crypto ETF Approvals The SEC’s decision to delay the Canary spot XRP ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles and complexities inherent in the cryptocurrency market. While disappointing for those eager to see XRP ETFs become a reality, this delay is not necessarily a dead end. It underscores the SEC’s commitment to careful consideration and investor protection in a rapidly evolving landscape. For crypto investors, patience and vigilance remain key. The journey towards broader crypto ETF adoption may be taking longer than anticipated, but the underlying momentum and demand for these products suggest that it’s still a matter of when, not if, they will become more widely available in the US market. Stay informed, stay resilient, and continue to navigate the exciting, albeit sometimes turbulent, world of crypto investments.

His post included a tweet and a video of himself explaining how he would have had to give up running his sports, gambling, and pop-culture media company to fill such a role. Dave Portnoy wants to know Elon Musk’s secret formula Portnoy, who goes by @stoolpresidente on X, shared the post on Tuesday with claims that he had received a call that potentially offered him the opportunity to join the Commerce Department working under Secretary Howard Lutnick. Portnoy conveniently omitted details regarding the nature of the job. However, he said he was told that if he agreed to become a government employee, he would have to relinquish his role as leader of Barstool. It made him question how a person like Elon Musk, who serves as CEO of not one one, not two but a number of companies including Tesla and SpaceX, is able to juggle all his responsibilities while maintaining appearances as the leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Elon Musk poses beside President Trump after delivering his new Tesla. Source: The White House (X/Twitter) “How do you run Tesla when you’re working on DOGE 24-7?” Portnoy wanted to know in the video. “You kind of want your CEO with the eye on the ball, right?” Portnoy also stated that the White House never followed up after the initial outreach. That part did not surprise some of his followers on X. In fact, one user went as far as saying that they most probably had a rethink — most likely after realizing Portnoy has too much baggage to be in any position of government. It is not completely far-fetched for Portnoy to have gotten such an offer, after all, he has been a vocal supporter of Trump since 2020 when he interviewed him at the White House at the tail end of Trump’s first term. In fact, as far back as 2015, Portnoy was already planning to vote for Trump. “I don’t care if he’s a joke. I don’t care if he’s racist. I don’t care if he’s sexist. I don’t care about any of it. I hope he stays in the race and I hope he wins. Why? Because I love the fact that he is making other politicians squirm,” he wrote in a blog post at the time. Dave Portnoy has become a high-profile memecoin investor Dave Portnoy has courted controversy recently with his foray into the world of memecoin trading. Some of the memes he has been involved with include $Jailstool, a meme tied to his Barstool persona, which he personally endorsed and invested in; then $Trump and $Libra, which he promoted and also invested in. Portnoy sees memecoin trading as a game of risk. He attracted criticism for leveraging his fame to manipulate market movements and advertise memes to his less crypto-savvy audience, transforming them into exit liquidity at the push of a button. His involvement has led to accusations of rugs and market manipulation, with accusers claiming Portnoy typically sells his holdings after tweeting about a token. So far, he has had massive wins and incredible losses in the space and while his approach to trading is seen as chaotic, it has been a source of entertainment to his audience whom he often carries along via live. Dave Portnoy poses for a selfie on a street. Source: Dave Portnoy (X/Twitter) Dave Portnoy is most popular for being the founder of Barstool Sports, which he established as a print publication. In 2023, Dave Portnoy became the owner of Barstool again after buying it back from casino and online gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1. The sale came months after Penn Entertainment paid about $550 million to acquire 100% control of Barstool before deciding to drop the company due to regulatory hurdles. It was only after buying back the company that he realized an important fact — “we underestimated just how tough it is for myself and Barstool to operate in a regulated world.” Portnoy claimed they were denied [gambling] licenses because of his affiliation with the company and even conceded that the regulated industry [is] probably not the best place for Barstool Sports or its content. Reasons why his affiliation would cause so much harm to his company can most likely be traced to the many past allegations of racism, sexism and sexual misconduct Portnoy has been linked to over the past several years. Portnoy has publicly denied all the allegations, claiming that the encounters were consensual. That was years ago. More recent scandals involving Portnoy have not had anything to do with his Barstool business. Business owners who received offers of employment from Trump’s government Portnoy’s desire to know how Musk can juggle his roles as CEO and handle his responsibilities at DOGE is valid. When the government reaches out to a person with a post and they accept the position, they usually have to step back from their previous engagements to be able to serve fully. Musk did not have to leave his roles because he is a special government employee, not a Cabinet member. Aside from Elon Musk, four other cabinet members of Trump also have extensive roots in the business world. Howard Lutnick, who, was nominated as Secretary of Commerce is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major financial services firm; Linda McMahon who, was nominated as Secretary of Education, is the former CEO of WWE and a prominent business figure; Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury is a hedge fund manager and CEO of Key Square Group, a major investment firm while Doug Burgum the Secretary of the Interior is a former CEO of Great Plains Software which was sold to Microsoft for $1.1 billion. Lutnick has had to disclose his financial holdings and step back as CEO of Cantor after rivals highlighted how his ties to the company, which is famous for its relationship with the Chinese, could pose a conflict of interest.

41509134,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710083,1741739458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/41509134.jpeg,Solana Falls Under Realized Price: Here’s What Happened Last Time,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-falls-realized-price-happened-last-time/,"On-chain data shows Solana (SOL) has seen its spot value drop under the Realized Price for the first time in three years following the recent bearish action. Solana Has Just Seen A Breakdown Of The Realized Price According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Solana has slipped around 8% below its Realized Price. The “Realized Price” is an indicator that basically tells us about the cost basis of the average investor or address on a given network. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $2 Could Be Next If DOGE Holds This Level: Analyst When the spot price of the asset is trading above this metric, it means the holders as a whole are carrying a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator suggests the average investor is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Realized Price for Solana over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, SOL broke above its Realized Price back in 2023, putting investors into the green. Throughout 2024 and the first couple of months of this year, the price remained above the line, but recently, it seems another crossover has finally occurred. “Solana just plunged below its Realized Price for the first time in nearly 3 years,” notes Glassnode. At the current exchange rate, the price is around 8% below this metric, which means the average holder of the asset could be assumed to be 8% in the red. From the chart, it’s apparent that the last time the cryptocurrency saw this type of crossover was back in 2022. Losing the level then meant the start of a bear market. Thus, it’s possible that the latest breakdown of the line could prove to be a bad sign for the coin this time as well. Historically, the Realized Price has played the role of a boundary between bear and bull trends for not just SOL, but also other digital assets. In another X post, Glassnode has shared the data for a version of the indicator for Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency. The metric displayed in the chart is the Realized Price of the short-term holders, which only measures the average cost basis of the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Unlike the Realized Price of the entire network, this version of the indicator serves more like a boundary line for short-term momentum shifts.

Market indicators suggest weakening strength, while large whale transactions to exchanges raise concerns about increased selling pressure. Therefore, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether ETH can recover or extend its downtrend below $1500. Ethereum Price Testing Key Levels Notably, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) pricing bands indicate Ethereum has reached essential price thresholds. Analyst Ali Martinez has determined the Realized Price to be $2,060 at present. The next significant support point for Ethereum price exists at $1,440 when its price fails to stay above the Realized Value threshold of $2,060. Source: X According to MVRV pricing bands, Ethereum price shows reduced market strength while existing closer to its lower boundary deviation point. These bands indicate the price levels the top altcoin must surpass to trigger a market recovery or extend its downward trend. More so, recent analysis suggests that the upcoming Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse could play a role in Ethereum’s price action, potentially triggering heightened volatility. While some analysts predict a bullish reversal due to historical lunar cycle trends, others warn of another wave of panic selling. With Ethereum already in oversold territory, the market’s reaction to this event could be a decisive moment Amber Group’s ETH Transfers Additionally, in recent hours, the crypto trading platform Amber Group moved a substantial amount of 20,000 ETH worth $37.34 million to Binance, OKX and Gate.io. Such large Ethereum moves have sparked doubts about the companies’ intentions for moving ETH to exchanges during market decline. Such whale transactions into top exchanges normally attract attention and could increase selling pressure. Amber Group deposited 20,000 $ETH ($37.34M) to #Binance , #OKX and #Gateio ~40 mins ago. https://t.co/GMZTZP3SjZ pic.twitter.com/CzUOZj9CrF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 11, 2025 Market activity shows strong signals from the large movement of ETH. The rising availability of ETH on exchanges during trading periods causes market prices to decrease. Ethereum Price Action And Predictions However, despite the bearish outlook, the top altcoin has formed a bullish diamond pattern that signals a potential breakout. This technical setup suggests that the asset is approaching a pivotal moment, where a surge could follow if resistance levels are breached. If buyers gain control, Ethereum may see accelerated upward momentum in the coming sessions. Similarly, a recent ETH price prediction projected that the altcoin would fall further below $1,500, possibly reaching $1,250 if key support levels continue to break. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is slipping out of a parallel channel, a technical pattern often associated with bearish price action. Despite the bearish sentiments, ETH price has shown resilience, rising from $1,814.5 to $1,915.13 in the last 24 hours. This 6% increase reflects renewed buying pressure, despite a significant drop in trading volume.

Many experienced connectivity problems early in the day, with error messages appearing on their screens. Downdetector tracked a peak of 40,000 complaints as the service remained unstable for several hours. A hacker group with alleged Russian ties, known as Dark Storm, has now claimed responsibility for the cyberattack that temporarily crippled the social media platform. Hackers’ IPs Traced to Ukraine Region The attack, identified as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assault, left thousands unable to access the platform before functionality was swiftly restored. Cybersecurity firm SpyoSecure reported that Dark Storm’s leader had announced the attack in a now-deleted Telegram post. Before its removal, the message boasted about taking X offline, with screenshots showing widespread connection failures across multiple locations. While the group’s Telegram channel has been shut down for violating the platform’s policies, evidence of the attack continues circulating online. For instance, Ed Krassenstein, an entrepreneur, and a social media commentator who also happens to be the co-founder of NFT marketplace NFTz.me, weighed in and claimed direct communication with Dark Storm’s leader. According to Krassenstein’s tweet, the hackers described their actions as a show of force rather than an operation driven by political motives. However, Dark Storm’s history suggests otherwise. The group, which has been active since 2023, has a track record of targeting NATO countries and is known for its pro-Palestinian stance. Meanwhile, Elon Musk confirmed the attack in an interview and noted that his team traced the origin of the hackers’ IP addresses to the “Ukraine area” without elaborating any further. Political Firestorm The latest development comes amidst the “Take Down Tesla” movement, as Tesla facilities nationwide have become hotspots for protests and vandalism, fueled by opposition to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been eliminating government agencies. Demonstrators are reacting to Musk’s political influence within the Trump administration. He has publicly accused five activist groups – Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project, and Democratic Socialists of America – of orchestrating the growing wave of demonstrations.

Investors hoping for a quick green light will now have to wait until May 2025 to find out if these applications will be approved, rejected, or kicked further down the road. The SEC says it needs more time to review the proposals. Each ETF now has a new deadline where the SEC will either approve, reject, or delay the process again if it so wishes. No approvals, no denials—just another delay. SEC pushes back deadlines for multiple ETFs For ADA, the SEC has officially designated May 29, 2025, as the new deadline for deciding on the Canary Spot ADA ETF. In its filing, the commission said the extension gives it “sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” For XRP, the new deadline is May 22, 2025. This affects both the Canary Spot XRP ETF, Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF and the Grayscale Spot XRP ETF, both of which have been waiting for approval. According to the filing, the SEC is using Section 19(b)(2) of the Act to justify the delay, which allows the agency to extend deadlines if additional review is required. Litecoin (LTC) was originally scheduled for a decision by March 29, 2025, but the SEC invoked its right to push that deadline to May 13, 2025. The filing says the SEC needed extra time to “evaluate the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1.” Dogecoin (DOGE) is in the same boat. The SEC has now designated May 21, 2025, as the date for its ruling on the Grayscale Spot Dogecoin ETF. Like the others, this delay is being handled under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, which allows the SEC to push back decisions when further analysis is needed. For Solana (SOL), the commission has set May 19, 2025, as the new deadline for deciding on the VanEck Spot Solana ETF and the Canary Spot Solana ETF. The SEC’s filing confirms that, like the other cases, this delay is being used to allow for “further review of the proposed rule change.” SEC sets roundtables to discuss crypto regulation Meanwhile on March 3rd, the SEC announced that it is moving forward with a series of crypto regulation roundtables as part of its Crypto Task Force. The first event, “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” is scheduled for March 21, at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The event will be open to the public, running from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., with a live stream available on SEC.gov and a recording posted afterward. Discussion topics will include how crypto assets are classified, what regulatory standards should be applied, and how the SEC plans to enforce compliance. Hester Peirce, the SEC Commissioner leading the Crypto Task Force, commented on the importance of the event, saying, “I am looking forward to drawing on the expertise of the public in developing a workable regulatory framework for crypto. The roundtables are an important part of our engagement with the public.” The Crypto Task Force was officially launched on January 21 by Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda. Its goal is to create clearer rules for crypto, provide realistic compliance pathways, and refine the SEC’s approach to enforcement. The public will have opportunities to contribute to discussions, either by attending the roundtables or requesting direct meetings with the task force. Trump’s permanent pick for SEC Chairman, Paul Atkins, is still waiting for Senate confirmation.

The legislation, which builds on President Trump’s executive order, is designed to make Bitcoin a core financial asset for the federal government. Cynthia, along with several Republican senators, wants to use Bitcoin to help tackle the country’s $36 trillion national debt while securing America’s role in global finance. “Today, I am proud to reintroduce landmark legislation that will codify President Trump’s bold vision to establish the United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and strengthen our nation’s economic foundation for generations to come,” Cynthia said. She called Bitcoin a “national imperative” and said the BITCOIN Act would allow the U.S. to “harness the full potential of digital innovation” while keeping its competitive edge. Lawmakers push for Bitcoin to strengthen the U.S. economy The BITCOIN Act has strong backing from Republican senators, who see Bitcoin as an opportunity to stabilize the country’s financial future. Jim Justice, one of the original cosponsors, said he supports the bill because it “makes sense” from a business perspective. “This bill represents America’s continued leadership in financial innovation, bolsters both our economic security, and gives us an opportunity to wrangle in our soaring national debt,” Jim said. Senator Tommy Tuberville also threw his support behind the bill, arguing that Bitcoin should be used to pay off the national debt. “Like President Trump, Bitcoin has shaken up the status quo in Washington D.C. and is completely revolutionizing the way Americans invest in their futures,” Tommy said. “Creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is an important step in making sure the United States remains the strongest economy in the world.” The bill also has backing from Bernie Moreno, who pointed to the $36 trillion national debt as the driving force behind his support. “Decades of out-of-control spending has led to a $36 trillion national debt, and developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a critical step to improving our nation’s balance sheet,” Bernie said. He added that the BITCOIN Act would “strengthen the U.S. dollar, help Americans hedge against inflation, and improve our financial security.” Senator Roger Marshall emphasized that Bitcoin would help protect the country’s financial position. “The world’s economic landscape is ever-evolving, and America must adapt to remain the world’s foremost finance superpower,” Roger said. He argued that the BITCOIN Act would “diversify, strengthen, and decentralize the critically important assets that back our currency.” In the House of Representatives, Nick Begich has introduced a companion bill to ensure Bitcoin is recognized as a strategic asset on both legislative fronts. “Bitcoin is the future of financial sovereignty, and the United States has a unique moment in time to secure its leadership in the global digital economy,” Nick said. He called Cynthia a “trailblazer” for pushing Bitcoin legislation in Congress and said the BITCOIN Act would help solidify Bitcoin’s role in America’s financial future. What the BITCOIN Act actually does The BITCOIN Act lays out a plan for the United States to acquire a massive Bitcoin reserve, similar in scale to its gold holdings. Under the bill, the government would launch a 1-million-unit Bitcoin purchase program, giving the U.S. control over roughly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. This would be funded by reallocating resources from the Federal Reserve System and Treasury Department without additional taxpayer spending. The bill also proposes creating a network of secure Bitcoin vaults under the control of the U.S. Treasury, with strict physical and cybersecurity measures in place. Cynthia made it clear that private Bitcoin holders would not be affected, emphasizing that the reserve would not infringe on self-custody rights. Following President Trump’s executive order, Cynthia said the administration is staying true to its promise to support crypto. “President Trump promised to lead the most pro-crypto administration in U.S. history, and today he is fulfilling that promise,” Cynthia said. “By embracing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, President Trump has charted a path to addressing our national debt and securing America’s position as the world leader in financial innovation.” Cynthia said she was confident the BITCOIN Act would pass. “The American people will look back on this decision as the moment we reclaimed our financial future, and I look forward to partnering with President Trump to get this across the finish line.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

All You Should Know About This DeFi Powerhouse,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-real-deal-all-you-should-know-about-this-defi-powerhouse/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has experienced rapid investor demand because it raised $3 million through its presale while acquiring more than 5,000 token holders since its launch. The third phase of MUTM demonstrates high market interest since most available tokens have already been purchased before reaching this price point at $0.02. Those who acquire MUTM tokens in the current third phase will experience a 25% value increase until the next stage begins at $0.025 while the exchange listing at $0.06 will yield 200% profit for immediate token holders. Presale Momentum and Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) receives exceptional market attention because its pre-sale continues to gain momentum rapidly. The second phase of presale proved extremely popular while current third stage sales keep growing at an equally rapid rate. The third phase will increase MUTM from its present price of $0.02 to $0.025 thus granting investors a 25% return on their early investment. Mutuum Finance will offer investors a 200% return opportunity because its structured pricing system starts at $0.06 and ends at a $0.06 listing price. The platform has gained over 5000 holders because of its distinct lending protocols along with the $100,000 giveaway program for early participants. The tokenomics system strengthens investor confidence at the platform. The predicted trading value of $3.50 after launch substantiates that the presale investors may achieve a return of 23000% according to adoption and exchange forecasts. The highly elevated values exceed what the average DeFi project can achieve given they depend on speculative predictions instead of practical business applications. The main advantage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies in its focus on practical financial functions which support decentralized loan lending as well as collateral-based transactions while sustaining market demand for their token. Tokenomics and Profit Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generates its popularity through a carefully structured economic system. The presale program has a progressive pricing model which gives increased value to the investors who join early before each milestone completion. The current $0.02 price for tokens has the potential to grow four times its value when listed on exchanges while showing future market potential with a $3.50 estimation. The $3.50 prediction comes from the revenue-sharing model of the platform that dedicates earnings to MUTM token buyback operations. The system gives stakers tokens which create ongoing market purchase pressure thus lowering price fluctuations in the market. The platform enhances its utility by introducing the mtTokens which operate as interest-bearing user-deposit representative assets. The mtETH and mtDAI tokens received by depositors gain value as interest flows through while holding money safely without the need to sell holdings. Through this system Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with greater liquidity accessibility as well as integration capabilities with other DeFi external platforms to expand its ecosystem. The protocol appeals to yield-seeking participants along with conservative investors through its volatile interest rate adjustments based on market conditions which creates an active community of multiple dynamics. Strategic Mechanisms Driving Growth Supply-security functions as a critical aspect and third-party auditors perform tests to ensure smart contracts stay secure. The practice of full disclosure promotes trust because most DeFi sectors face serious exploit issues. The buy-and-distribute system maintains constant demand capability which opens up long-term growth opportunities for MUTM. Investors who seek anticipated returns from MUTM tokens have growing urgency because the time available to purchase at $0.02 during the presale Phase three is running out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines financial principles of DeFi innovation to offer more than speculative hype. The presale results together with ongoing demand stimulation protocols demonstrate MUTM’s aptness to dominate the market. The project stands out because it approaches profitability through both short-term gains during phase three subscription completion and long-term viability leading to its $3.50 target price. Potential investors should consider purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its presale token campaign since token availability expires at some point.

The leading cryptocurrency has been in the spotlight throughout this market cycle, but a technical outlook suggests that it needs to give way. Particularly, a crypto analyst known as Seth on social media platform X pointed to Bitcoin’s dominance relative strength index (RSI) as a crucial factor that must change before Bitcoin and the broader market can kick off another leg upward. Bitcoin Dominance RSI Hits New Level Seth’s latest analysis, shared on social media platform X, highlights a critical observation regarding Bitcoin’s market dominance. He noted that Bitcoin’s monthly dominance RSI recently surged to 70, a level that has never been reached before in Bitcoin’s history. While this might seem like a bullish signal at first glance, the analyst suggests otherwise, warning that the dominance RSI must cool down for the final phase of the bull run to take place. This perspective comes as the crypto market experiences a downturn, leaving investors questioning when the next bullish wave will begin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? RSI, or relative strength index, tracks the speed and change of price movements and is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. With Bitcoin’s RSI dominance at such an extreme level, even with the recent price decline, it suggests that BTC’s control over the market is at an unsustainable peak, which could slow down the broader market rally. According to Seth, those who fail to grasp this concept do not understand the fundamental mechanics of financial markets, as this principle applies beyond just Bitcoin and altcoins. Given this, the healthiest path forward would be a reduction in Bitcoin’s dominance over the next few weeks, with the analyst projecting a fall to 44% dominance. Why BTC’s RSI Dominance Decline Matters A decline in Bitcoin’s RSI dominance would mean that the market is shifting toward more balanced conditions, allowing capital to flow into altcoins and drive up their prices. Throughout past bull cycles, particularly in 2021, Bitcoin’s rise to a peak was often followed by a surge in altcoin investments, triggering widespread rallies across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Consolidates In Tight Zone: Why A Crash To $84,000 Is Likely This pattern has historically marked the final phase of a bull run, where capital flows away from Bitcoin and into altcoins with a higher potential for short-term gains. Until Bitcoin’s dominance cools off, the altcoin sector may struggle to gain momentum and continue to derail the final phase of the BTC bull run. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $81,500, reflecting a 2.5% decline in the last 24 hours. Market data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Bitcoin’s dominance currently stands at 61.0%, having risen by 0.65% within the same period. This growing dominance suggests that capital remains concentrated in BTC.

The House passed the vote 292-132, following the Senate’s decision to reject the rule that was finalized during the final days of former President Biden’s administration. This could change how crypto businesses are regulated. Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that due to a rule that budget-related bills must start in the House, the Senate will need to vote on the resolution one more time. Once that vote passes, it will go to President Trump’s desk as the first crypto-related bill to become law.

He added that the rule might be impossible to enforce, as DeFi platforms are different from centralized crypto exchanges or banks and cannot gather the required user information to comply with the rule. Last week, 70 Senators voted to overturn the IRS rule, with Trump’s advisers urging him to sign it. Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) noted the Senate must approve it again due to budget rules. If signed, the IRS would be blocked from enforcing similar rules in the future. Illinois Democrat Danny Davis argued the rule was part of the 2021 Infrastructure Act, comparing crypto to stocks and saying crypto platforms should report like stock brokers. Meanwhile, North Carolina Republican Tim Moore claimed the rule overstepped and could harm U.S. innovation in digital assets. Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett called the resolution “special interest legislation,” saying that it could help tax cheats, criminals, and terrorist financiers, and add $4 billion to the national debt, going against President Trump’s goal to cut the debt.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 02:02:14

The bill, first introduced in July, directs the US government to buy 200,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) a year over five years for a total acquisition of 1 million Bitcoin, which would be paid for by diversifying existing funds within the Federal Reserve system and the Treasury department. However, the reintroduced act, the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act of 2025, opens the door for the US to acquire and hold in excess of 1 million BTC as long as it is acquired through lawful means other than direct purchase, such as civil or criminal forfeitures, gifts made to the US or transfers from federal agencies. Proud to re-introduce the BITCOIN Act. Let’s secure America’s financial future. pic.twitter.com/jJFmMopP7h — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) March 11, 2025 The extra Bitcoin can also come from US states that voluntarily store their Bitcoin holdings in the strategic Bitcoin reserve, though it’ll be stored in a segregated account. “By transforming the president’s visionary executive action into enduring law, we can ensure that our nation will harness the full potential of digital innovation to address our national debt while maintaining our competitive edge in the global economy,” said Lummis, who announced the revamped bill during a March 11 conference hosted by The Bitcoin Policy Institute. Lummis taps new bill co-sponsors The BITCOIN Act also has a number of new co-sponsors, including Republican Senators Jim Justice, Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall, Marsha Blackburn and Bernie Moreno. “I’m proud to join Senator Lummis on this common-sense bill to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and codify President Trump’s executive order,” Justice said in a statement. “This bill represents America’s continued leadership in financial innovation, bolsters both our economic security, and gives us an opportunity to wrangle in our soaring national debt,” he added. Other changes The bill also now sets a formal evaluation process for Bitcoin forked assets and airdropped assets in the reserve. Initially, the bill required all forked assets to be stored in the reserve and couldn’t be sold or disposed of for five years unless authorized by law. Related: Texas Senate passes Bitcoin reserve bill, New York targets memecoin rug pulls: Law Decoded The new bill now directs the Secretary after the mandatory holding period to evaluate and retain the most valuable asset based on market capitalization while retaining the “dominant asset.” Bitcoin has hard forked a number of times in the past to create new cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), which forked on Aug. 1, 2017, and Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ), which forked on Oct. 24, 2017. Lummis’ reintroduced bill comes just days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” The reserve and stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal and civil cases, but the reserve won’t sell the stashed Bitcoin and will use “budget-neutral” ways to increase its size, while tokens from the stockpile could be sold.

According to industry insiders, the increasing number of ETF registrations is a result of a larger trend to offer investors regulated substitutes for conventional digital asset investments. Many believe that these ETFs are an essential step in improving market transparency and protecting investors. The SEC is still wary despite the spike in filings. In the past, the SEC has been hesitant to approve crypto-based ETFs, citing worries about regulatory uncertainty and market manipulation. However, according to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, XRP ETFs have a 65–75% chance of being approved in 2025. Market sentiment also remains optimistic. In the cryptocurrency betting platform Polymarket, bettors have currently placed the odds of approval at around 72%, indicating confidence in a positive result. Investors are now awaiting further information, with many expecting that a more transparent regulatory environment will open up new avenues for investment in the digital asset space.

Strong whale selling activity is indicated by a high ratio, which frequently causes brief corrections. This metric’s recent downward trend, however, indicates that big holders are reducing their sell orders, which is typically an indication of an impending market recovery. 📊Is Binance's whale selling pressure ending ?

The recent announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve by the U.S. government appeared optimistic at first. Later on, though, it became evident that these holdings would primarily come from seized assets rather than aggressive acquisitions. This has increased investor uncertainty, as have record outflows from Bitcoin ETFs and macroeconomic worries like possible tariffs. Traditional markets, especially the NASDAQ, continue to have a strong influence on the price of bitcoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes offered his take on the market in a Mar.11 post on X. He predicts that Bitcoin could bottom around $70,000, a 36% drop from its all-time high, before beginning its next rally. However, he argues that a true recovery will require more than just crypto market dynamics. According to Hayes, a downturn in the stock market is part of a larger financial shift that is required. As of now, the continuous accumulation by large investors and the declining whale ratio indicate that selling pressure is abating. Bitcoin, which is trading at $83,234 at the time of press, might be headed for a recovery if this pattern holds.

Trump has yet to make an official announcement, but advisers have indicated to allies that Michelle is the leading candidate. Michelle, who has been on the Fed’s Board of Governors since 2018, was originally appointed by Trump and has a history in community banking and bank regulation. She worked at her family’s Kansas bank before becoming Kansas banking commissioner. The seat she currently holds at the Fed is specifically designated for someone with experience in community banking. Some Republican lawmakers are frustrated by Jerome Powell’s suggestions that the vice chair position remain vacant. Powell, who testified before Congress last month, called the position a “liability”, arguing that it made regulatory decisions vulnerable to political cycles. Trump, speaking in an interview on Fox News last Sunday, said he would make a decision “fairly soon.” Lawmakers don’t want any delays, seeing the vacancy as an opportunity to move regulatory power away from Powell before Trump picks a new Fed chair next year. Barr stepped down last month to avoid legal battles that could have arisen if Trump had followed through on calls to strip him of his position. He remains a Fed governor until 2032 but no longer has the regulatory authority he once did. Michelle was always against Michael Barr’s regulatory agenda During his tenure, Barr pushed for strict banking regulations, often facing resistance from the industry and even from some of his own colleagues inside the Fed. Michelle repeatedly opposed his policies, aligning with the view that excessive regulation could hurt banks and slow economic growth. One of the biggest fights under Barr’s leadership was over capital requirements for large banks. His efforts to increase those requirements failed twice, with other banking agencies refusing to reach a consensus. With Michelle expected to step in, a third attempt at rewriting the capital rules could play out very differently. Republicans have also expressed concerns over Powell’s role in setting regulatory policy. Tim Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said last week on Fox Business: “It is not in America’s best interest to let Jay Powell continue having dual roles. We need a vice chair of supervision that President Trump has complete confidence in to rightsize the regulatory environment.” There is no open seat on the Fed board, which is why Michelle has been seen as the likeliest pick. Unless a current governor steps down, a nominee outside the board would have to wait until next year to fill a vacancy. Michelle has told associates she is not planning to leave the Fed, which makes her the most logical choice if Republicans want to fill the role quickly. Last week, over two dozen Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging a fast appointment. The power of the Fed’s vice chair for supervision The vice chair for supervision has a significant role at the Fed, overseeing hundreds of bank examiners and shaping the day-to-day approach to regulation. However, major regulatory changes require a majority vote from the seven-member board, and the Fed chair ultimately controls the agenda for board meetings. Despite this, the vice chair for supervision has the ability to influence how regulations are enforced. This makes Michelle’s stance on banking regulation critical, especially given the banking industry’s ongoing legal battles over the Fed’s stress tests and other regulatory rules. Many trade groups representing community banks had previously encouraged Scott to select Michelle for the role, because they see her as someone who understands small and mid-sized banks and can push back against what they see as excessive oversight, said the WSJ report . Beyond banking regulation, Michelle has taken a hawkish stance on interest rates. She has repeatedly warned that the Fed is not doing enough to combat inflation. She was the only Fed official to vote against the half-point rate cut in September—the first time the Fed had lowered rates in four years. Her reasoning? She believed that cutting rates too soon would fail to control inflation. Just last Friday, Michelle spoke at a Fed event, saying that while inflation had been the Fed’s primary concern, she expected the focus to change toward labor markets and the broader economy in the coming months.

The Starknet Foundation said in its March 11 Bitcoin roadmap that it’s aiming for Starknet to become Bitcoin’s execution layer , scaling it from 13 transactions per second to thousands, reducing blocks and gas fees, and creating a better user experience. “Most Bitcoin today sits static in wallets and exchanges, constrained by the limitations of the network’s original design: a lack of scalability and an inability to natively support applications beyond simple buying, selling, and transferring,” the foundation said. It added that while some investors view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” it believes “there is a demand for utilizing Bitcoin for purposes beyond that.” Source: Starknet Previously, StarkWare CEO Eli Ben Sasson, the company behind the STARK proof that contributes to the development of Starknet, said OP_CAT , a Satoshi-era opcode for unlocking programmability on Bitcoin that was disabled over security concerns, would allow Starknet to settle on the Bitcoin blockchain. If successful, Starknet said the move would allow developers to build applications on the Bitcoin network through smart contracts and enable applications such as staking, borrowing, lending, leveraged trading, and yield farming. As part of the announcement, StarkWare said it has joined the growing number of firms in creating a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, holding a growing portion of its treasury in crypto. Source: Ameen Soleimani Starknet will also team up with Bitcoin Web3 wallet Xverse, whose founder and CEO Ken Liao said the integration, slated for the second quarter of 2025, will achieve Bitcoin’s “DeFi take-off moment.” Xverse said wallets need to be more than just storage solutions; and allow easy access to Bitcoin’s growing utility. Liao said in a statement that the endgame is trustless DeFi on Bitcoin. Related: Unknown attacker causes headaches during Pectra upgrade on Sepolia “In today’s environment, there is a temptation for wallet teams to say, ‘yeah, let’s just focus on making it easier for people to use Bitcoin as a store of value,’” Liao said. “But the long-term future of Bitcoin also includes utility, and that’s why layer 2 solutions must reach the public via the wallets they actually use,” he added. Meanwhile, in a March 11 X space discussing Starknet’s plan, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said a proper Bitcoin L2 that can satisfy the needed security properties would “make crypto payments great again, and all those use cases can work.” Starknet on Bitcoin and Ethereum https://t.co/tCyQDHY7Yr — StarkWare 🐺🐱 (@StarkWareLtd) March 11, 2025 Buterin said there is a “lot of value” in enabling the trustless flow of assets between the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems, such as easier paths for decentralized exchange. “If you go back to the white paper, Bitcoin was meant to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and obviously, layer 1 is not nearly scalable enough for that,” Buterin said. “I think we’ve also seen some of the limits of the Lightning Network and that kind of approach.“ Magazine: MegaETH launch could save Ethereum… but at what cost?",,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|STRK|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 02:57:41

This, after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies by using tokens already held by the government. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have been greenlit for inclusion into the reserves under this initiative. The announcement emphasizes the government’s will to improve its national financial posture in the rapidly changing digital asset space. The Crypto Reserve In Motion One of the measures toward bringing virtual currencies into the government financial system is the Crypto Strategic Reserve . By including the above mentioned cryptocurrencies, the government wants to diversify national assets and support advances in financial technology. This move suggests that the probable economic impact of digital currencies is beginning to be more defined. The Function Of The Treasury In Management Of Crypto Sacks has gone into great lengths on how the Treasury Department plans to manage the Bitcoin holdings and raise their value. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will oversee this endeavor. The approach emphasizes prudent management to maximize the potential returns from these digital assets. According to Sacks, during the All In Podcast, the purpose of the stockpile is “responsible stewardship.” He pointed out that it is “a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” To put it in perspective, the federal government’s failure to fully utilize its Bitcoin assets resulted in a loss of $17 billion. Sacks claims that the government used to own over 400,000 Bitcoin tokens. But it has sold off more than half of its holdings in the last decade for slightly more than $350 million. Market Response The introduction of the Crypto Strategic Reserve has elicited a range of responses from the cryptocurrency market . Initially, the disclosure caused the values of the related cryptocurrencies to rise sharply. Market euphoria was, however, dampened by later comments that the reserve would primarily consist of assets obtained through forfeitures, with no immediate intentions for new acquisitions. For example, Bitcoin experienced a 5% decline, ultimately falling below the crucial $80,000 level, while Ethereum and XRP fell 3% and 4% apiece. Congressional Viewpoints Regarding The Initiative The feasibility and implementation of the proposal have prompted discussions within Congress. Chairman Tim Scott of the House Banking Committee recommended a cautious approach, stating that a delay is necessary until Congress is more adequately equipped to address the intricacies of incorporating cryptocurrencies into national reserves.

Similarly, Senator Cynthia Lummis echoed the same sentiment on X, stating that ‘Big Things are coming every day’ and that she is ‘for real this time.'” Some speculate that this could suggest the U.S. is preparing to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. While some humorously hope that it’s not another round of higher interest rates or more tariffs. Senator Lummis Reintroduces Bitcoin Act! Recently, Senator Lummis revealed that she has reintroduced the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act to Trump, proposing the purchase of $81 billion worth of Bitcoin by 2025. The BITCOIN Act is back. pic.twitter.com/WNeU6SWPj3 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) March 11, 2025 The bill, originally introduced by Lummis last year, proposes that the government purchase 1 million bitcoins over five years. These bitcoins would then be stored in a “decentralized network” of storage facilities. According to a press release, the funds for purchasing bitcoins would come from “diversifying existing funds” in the Federal Reserve system. The first $6 billion in remittances from reserve banks would be set aside each year from 2025 to 2029 to build the reserve. The plan would also use the Fed’s gold certificates. Lummis stated that Bitcoin is not just a tech opportunity but a national necessity for America’s financial leadership in the 21st century. She added, “By turning the president’s executive action into law, we can use digital innovation to address the national debt and maintain our global competitiveness.” This move could boost the legitimacy of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This reserve was recently created by President Donald Trump with an Executive Order, making this bill a key step in strengthening the U.S.’s position on Bitcoin. A Slight Difference In Plan Lummis’s new legislation, backed by several Republican Senators, is slightly different from Trump’s plan. While Lummis wants the government to buy 1 million bitcoins over five years, Trump’s executive order focuses on using bitcoin seized by law enforcement, alongside other digital assets from forfeitures, to create a strategic reserve. David Sacks, Trump’s crypto and AI advisor, reassured that this plan won’t cost taxpayers a penny. The government will only use assets already seized through legal proceedings. The order also asks the Treasury and Commerce departments to find ways to acquire more bitcoin without impacting the budget. However, Trump’s push for a crypto reserve has sparked mixed reactions across the industry.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 03:07:00

41516051,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710572,1741750235,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Suppressed? Bitwise CIO Predicts Market Shock Post-Lawsuit,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bitwise-cio-predicts-market-shock-post-lawsuit/,"In an interview with the Paul Barron Network, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan expressed his perspective on the long-debated regulatory battle surrounding XRP and its potential market reaction once legal uncertainties are resolved. According to Hougan, the crypto asset—long restrained by litigation—may be significantly undervalued, with the potential for a sharp market correction following a favorable resolution to its legal entanglements. Since 2020, XRP has been entangled in a legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which accused Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering. The lawsuit has cast a long shadow over the token, restricting its growth within the US market and leading to its delisting from several major exchanges in the past. Related Reading: Analyst Says Only Buy XRP If It Reaches This Level Now, with the lawsuit potentially reaching its final ruling by April 16, according to Barron, market participants are speculating on XRP’s future trajectory. Hougan weighed in on the matter, pointing out that a resolution could unlock significant latent demand and shift the narrative around the asset. “From my 30,000-foot view, specific to XRP, I think there’s a significant chunk of the crypto market that has sort of written it off or forgotten about it. And I think that part of the market is wrong,” Hougan stated. What Happens Post-Lawsuit With XRP? One of the key takeaways from Hougan’s analysis is the idea that XRP remains an unknown variable in the broader crypto landscape. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which have seen major adoption and institutional inflows, XRP has remained stagnant due to regulatory overhang. If the lawsuit concludes with clarity that allows unrestricted US adoption, the real potential of XRP in global finance could finally be realized. “The reality is, XRP has been suppressed by litigation for multiple years, and we don’t yet know what it can do on the global stage when it’s freed from those restraints,” he added. While Hougan did not make outright price predictions, he did note that institutional and retail sentiment could pivot quickly if XRP gains renewed regulatory clarity in the US. Related Reading: XRP Flirts With A Daily Range Breakdown – Price Must Hold Above $2 Level The discussion also delved into Japan’s aggressive adoption of XRP, with SBI Holdings leading the charge in integrating the asset into its digital banking ecosystem. As noted in the interview, XRP has now surpassed Ethereum in Japanese investor holdings, signaling deep institutional confidence in its future. Paul Barron emphasized that Japan’s approach could foreshadow broader global adoption: “SBI seems to be doing with XRP what Michael Saylor did with Bitcoin—strategically accumulating and positioning it for long-term institutional use.” Hougan agreed, highlighting that XRP’s role in international remittances and liquidity solutions remains underappreciated, and the ongoing legal battle has hindered a more comprehensive evaluation of its utility-driven demand. Another major topic of discussion was the possibility of an spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). While Hougan did not reveal any detail about Bitwise’s ETF filing and its progress with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he highlighted the firm’s confidence. “We don’t file for ETPs for fun. We file for them because we think they can launch, and we think there is a significant audience, and we think it’s an important asset.” While some analysts argue that XRP’s legal troubles have already been priced in, Hougan’s comments concluded that the potential upside remains largely ignored by the broader market. If the SEC case concludes favorably, the re-listing of XRP on major US exchanges, new institutional flows, and expanded adoption in banking systems could lead to a market repricing event. “There’s no guarantee XRP will be enormously successful, but there’s equally no guarantee that it won’t be,” Hougan emphasized. At press time, XRP traded at $2.12.

Despite this bearishness, a veteran trader and analyst explains his ideal scenario for a Bitcoin price bottom and a bullish reversal that leads to a $100,000 revisit. Ideal Scenario for a Bitcoin Price Bottom According to Analyst Due to the 23% crash in Bitcoin price from a high of $99,431 to $76,560, the outlook for crypto markets has been bearish, at least until BTC forms a potential bottom. RektProof, a veteran trader who turned $500 to nearly $360K, posted his thoughts on a potential Bitcoin bottom. According to this expert, Bitcoin price will likely form a bottom in the high time frame demand zone, extending from $73,000 to $65,000. This means that RektProof is expecting another leg down, i.e., after the sweep of the recently formed local high of around $83,000. Analyst’s Ideal Scenario For Bitcoin Price Bottom Before $100,000 BTC/USDT 1-hour chart Analysts’ Price Targets After BTC Bottoms? To predict Bitcoin price targets after a potential bottom formation, the analyst considers the 21% price swing between February 28 and March 2, extending from $78,200 to $94,984. A sweep of $78,200 into a high time frame demand zone could lead to a rally that revisits roughly $95K. However, this is the short-term Bitcoin price rally that the analyst is expecting. From a long-term perspective, RektProof expects a dip into the HTF demand zone to be a bottom that leads to a new all-time high of $130,000. BTC/USDT 1-hour chart So, the expert forecasts two Bitcoin price targets , one at $95,000 and the other at $130,000 . Bitcoin’s Options Data Hints Investors Are Hedging for Further Downside According to a researcher and analyst, CNO, the bottom is still not in and indicates that the “(crypto) market is still hedged for downside.” CNO sends a warning signal for eager bulls, indicating that there might be another flush to the downside before Bitcoin price reenters the $85,000 to $95,000 range. The basis for his prediction is options data that measures the call and put options pricing over time to gauge market sentiment and potential price direction. BTC Options In other tweets , CNO highlights that this flush will likely occur in the next few days due to the blood moon lunar eclipse that will catalyze heightened volatility for crypto markets, including BTC’s value . So, the overall Bitcoin price forecast from two analysts suggests another temporary but downside move that could lead to a bottom formation before BTC price targets $100K or a new ATH at $130K.

The miner became the 297th solo miner to mine a Bitcoin block from the solo.ckpool Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining pool, its developer, Con Kolivas, said in a March 10 X post. He added the miner used a 480-gigahash per second (GH/s) Bitaxe machine. For comparison, many big crypto-mining companies use machines that can operate at over 230,000 GH/s. “A miner of this size has only less than a 1 in a million chance of finding a block per day, or put alternatively, would take 3,500 years to find a block on average,” Kolivas added. The miner snared a total of 3.15 BTC for solving block 887,212, which was timestamped on March 10 at 7:22 pm UTC. That bounty includes the current 3.125 Bitcoin mining reward and another 0.025 Bitcoin from transaction fees, mempool.space data shows . Source: Con Kolivas A 1,200 gigahash Bitaxe Gamma 601 machine, which is nearly three times more powerful than the one used by the solo miner, is priced at around $158, according to Bitcoin miner marketplace ASIC Miner Value. ASIC Miner Value estimates that the Bitaxe Gamma 601 will make just over $20 a year while using around $18 worth of electricity, coming out to a yearly net profit of under $3. The Bitaxe Gamma 601 is roughly the size of a smartphone. Source: ASIC Miner Value It also states the odds of the Bitaxe Gamma 601 mining a solo block on any given day is one in 4.6 million, or one in 12,700 over a year. Related: Solo miner snags Bitcoin block reward worth $300K Solo Bitcoin miners rarely solve blocks, let alone those with tiny mining rigs. Most Bitcoin is mined from the larger pools such as Foundry USA — which obtains a large share of its hashrate from public Bitcoin miners like Cipher Mining, Bitfarms and Hut 8. The largest public Bitcoin mining firm by market cap and hashrate, MARA Holdings, uses its own Bitcoin mining pool, MARA Pool. While pocket-sized Bitcoin miners are hardly profitable, some of these micro miners are being built in an open-source manner to fight the “secrecy and exclusivity” of the Bitcoin mining industry, one of the builders of Bitaxe miners, “Skot,” told Cointelegraph in a September 2023 interview. Most Bitcoin miners, such as those made by Bitmai,n are closed-sourced, which runs contrary to Bitcoin’s ethos, Skot said. “The advent of these open-source projects serves to shed light on this often opaque area, making it more transparent and accessible to the public.” Magazine: Train AI agents to make better predictions… for token rewards",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 03:37:03

PEPE Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, PEPE is currently at a level with a history of price reversals and upside rallies. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the meme coin holds the $0.0000062 level, it could soar by 60% to reach $0.000010 in the coming days.

On March 11, the House of Representatives voted 292 for and 132 against a motion to repeal the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule that aimed to expand existing IRS reporting requirements to crypto. All 132 votes to keep the rule were Democrats. However, 76 of those in the party joined the Republican vote to repeal it. This follows the US Senate’s March 4 vote on the motion to repeal, which saw it pass with a vote of 70 to 27. The rule would force DeFi platforms, such as decentralized exchanges, to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions. Speaking after the vote, Republican Representative Mike Carey, who submitted the repeal motion, said, “The DeFi broker rule invades the privacy of tens of millions of Americans, hinders the development of an important new industry in the United States and would overwhelm the IRS.” Congressman Mike Carey speaking after the vote. Source: Mike Carey House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill also applauded the overturning of the rule, calling it “a clear example of government overreach that threatens to push American digital asset development overseas.” The resolution will need to pass another Senate vote before being sent to President Donald Trump, who has signaled he’d support it. Those opposing the rule repeal included Democrat Representative Lloyd Doggett, who said getting a “special interest exemption” from IRS disclosures “makes tax evasion and money laundering so much easier for wealthy Republican donors who have been using these decentralized exchanges.” He claimed killing the rule would create a “loophole that would be exploited by wealthy tax cheats, drug traffickers and terrorist financiers.” Related: US lawmakers advance resolution to repeal ‘unfair’ crypto tax rule In early March, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks said the administration would support congressional efforts to rescind the DeFi broker rule. At the time, officials from the Office of Management and Budget wrote “This rule … would stifle American innovation and raise privacy concerns over the sharing of taxpayers’ personal information, while imposing an unprecedented compliance burden on American DeFi companies.” Magazine: Mystery celeb memecoin scam factory, HK firm dumps Bitcoin: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 04:08:09

This includes imports from the other trading partners of the United States. This announcement came after Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick discussed turning down the electricity surcharge plan in exchange for easing Canadian metals’ tariffs. Ford added that a meeting had been arranged on Thursday with Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The meeting will be based on re-establishing the trade pact between the US, Mexico, and Canada before Trump imposes automobile tariffs on Canada on April 2. Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister-designate, said Trump’s tariffs are a direct attack on the country’s households and businesses. He says Canadian tariffs will continue until the U.S. makes “credible, reliable commitments” to fair trade. Ottawa has been alarmingly aware of Trump’s threat to annex Canada. Officials believe that Trump may act on these threats, causing serious harm to the Canadian economy. Trump’s tariffs threats lead to stock market losses The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 1.1%.S&P experienced a drop of 0.8%. Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2%. All these indexes experienced their worst two-day drop since August 2024. However, these stock market indexes experienced some recovery following the reports about Ontario backing off from electricity export tax. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the US is in a “period of economic transition from the mess that was created under Joe Biden and the previous administration.” Officials have emphasized that metal imports will not be exempt from the tariffs starting Wednesday. “The White House has shown itself to be adaptable on this tariff issue”, says Sen. Bill Hagerty, an ambassador to Japan during Trump’s first term. He added “I’ve seen him do steel and aluminum tariffs before, so I have no reason to not expect that will take place.” The observers at Capitol Hill see uncertainty in the final policy outcome due to U.S. past exemptions of Canada and Mexico’s tariffs.

Dogecoin has gained widespread popularity since its inception in 2013. While several factors have driven DOGE’s popularity over the years, investors cannot ignore Elon Musk's influence on the firstborn memecoin.Musk’s Effect on Dogecoin Tesla's CEO remains one of the top advocates who brought significant attention to DOGE during the 2020/2021 market cycle. The American businessman has continued to draw significant attention to DOGE by characterizing the token as the “people’s crypto.” Three months after this comment, the price of DOGE spiked to an all-time high of $0.7376 per token on May 8, 20221. Although DOGE has plunged significantly from its peak, many believe that the influence of public figures like Musk, alongside strong institutional adoption, could propel Dogecoin’s price to new heights. Amid this optimism, some imagine a scenario where DOGE’s market cap might match Musk’s net worth. Overview of DOGE Market Cap vs Elon Musk's Net Worth Musk is currently the world’s richest man, boasting an estimated net worth of $342.4 billion as of March 8, 2024. He is the CEO of several multi-billion dollar companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter). Elon Musk Net Worth On the other hand, DOGE stands as the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency globally, with a market cap of $28.94 billion. At this valuation, DOGE is trading at $0.1951, marking a 24-hour decrease of 5.37%. DOGE Price If It Equals Musk Net Worth For DOGE to match Musk’s net worth of $342.4 billion, its market cap must grow more than tenfold from its current value. Specifically, DOGE’s market cap must soar astronomically by 1,083% from its current valuation of $28.94 billion to equal Musk’s $342.4 billion net worth. If this hypothetical scenario happens, Dogecoin will be worth $2.3 per token, assuming its circulating supply of 148.34 billion DOGE remains relatively stable. To demonstrate the significance of this rally, a portfolio of 100,000 DOGE, currently valued at $19,510, will be worth $230,000 if DOGE hits the $2.3 projected target. DOGE to $2.3 Prediction Interestingly, several crypto experts, including Dogecoin’s co-founder Billy Markus, have predicted DOGE’s potential surge to the $2 mark. In January, Markus called for an upsurge of 500% that could potentially take DOGE’s price to $2.3. At the time, he envisioned the possibility of the token being supported as a tipping currency on X. A few weeks later, renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks referenced DOGE’s historical price pattern to predict the meme coin’s future rally to around the $2.3 mark. Meanwhile, Changelly experts set a timeline on when DOGE might hit the $2.3 target. According to the experts, the $2.3 price projection could become a reality for DOGE by July 2032, more than seven years from now. However, the popular prediction platform Telegaon suggests that DOGE might reach the $2.3 target early next year. It remains to be seen whether DOGE will reach this target or what the exact timeline is for this to happen. In the meantime, investors must exercise caution and seek professional advice before investing in cryptocurrencies like DOGE.",Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-03-12 04:50:53

On March 11, the US House of Representatives approved a resolution to overturn the Biden Administration’s controversial “Broker Rule.” Resolution Approved to Overturn “Broker Rule” The US House of Representatives voted 292-132 to approve H.J Res. 25, aiming to overturn the controversial Biden Administration “Broker Rule.” The resolution seeks to eliminate an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that requires certain brokers, including DeFi entities, to report transaction details. Bloomberg Law reports that the bipartisan vote seeks to relieve decentralized crypto exchanges from reporting sales, proceeds, and transaction details, explaining that the rule is “burdensome for business.” The bipartisan vote followed a Senate resolution to overturn an IRS rule that classified DeFi software developers as “brokers.” On March 4, the S.J. Res.28, led by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, 70-28. The resolution was co-sponsored by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tim Sheehy (R-Utah), and Ted Budd (R-N.C.). Rep. Carey introduced the joint resolution in the House of Representatives. The IRS rule in question expanded the definition of “broker” to include DeFi protocols, requiring certain brokers to report the gross proceeds from digital asset sales. In a press release issued by Senator Cruz’s office, he said: “Last night’s vote was a victory for American innovation. In a midnight move, the Biden administration attempted to undermine American privacy and impose burdensome regulations on digital currency. Yesterday, an overwhelming bipartisan majority voted in support of my legislation to rescind this harmful regulation.” Significant Win for Digital Assets According to critics, the controversial “Broker Rule” opposed excessive burdens on digital asset transactions and stifled innovation within the sector. The press release from Cruz’s office explained the Broker Rule “defined those developers as “brokers,” even though they did not touch any of the cryptocurrency being exchanged.” Proponents of the resolutions argue the rule imposes unnecessary compliance costs and suppresses crypto development, threatening to drive such development offshore. Following the March 5 win, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR) shared his support of the decision: “The previous Administration’s controversial ‘Broker Rule’ is a clear example of government overreach that threatens to push American digital asset development overseas. I was proud to protect America’s leadership in the digital asset ecosystem and vote to overturn this harmful, anti-innovation midnight rulemaking.” Kristin Smith, CEO of Blockchain Association, an NPO dedicated to promoting a pro-innovation policy environment for the digital asset economy, commented: “Today’s a bright day for DeFi – and all of crypto – in the United States. An incredible showing of bipartisan support passed Senator Ted Cruz’s Congressional Review Act resolution to roll back the DeFi-killing broker rule out of the Senate. It’s a hopeful sign that shows there is true bipartisan agreement in Washington that the American crypto industry deserves the freedom to grow and innovate here in the United States.” While President Donald Trump must sign the resolution to become law, the White House will likely support the measure as it aligns with the Administration’s broader strategy to foster innovation in the digital asset sector.

In a slew of filings on March 11, the agency said it has “designated a longer period” to decide on the proposed rule changes that would allow the ETFs to proceed. Among the affected ETFs are Grayscale’s XRP ( XRP ) and Cboe BZX Exchange’s spot Solana ( SOL ) ETF filings , with the decisions on them pushed until May. The SEC has delayed making a decision to approve several altcoin ETFs. Source: SEC Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a March 11 X post that while the SEC just “punted on a bunch of altcoin ETF filings,” he didn’t see it as a cause for concern. “It’s expected, as this is standard procedure.” He added that US President Donald Trump’s pick to chair the SEC, Paul Atkins, “hasn’t even been confirmed yet.” “This doesn’t change our (relatively high) odds of approval. Also note that the final deadlines aren’t until October,” Seyffart said. Source: Samuel Maverick Fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also chimed in, saying that “everything [is] delayed,” including ETFs featuring Ether ( ETH ) staking and in-kind redemptions . Un early December, Trump picked pro-crypto businessman and former SEC Commissioner Atkins to be the agency’s next chair. However, congressional confirmation hearings are yet to be scheduled. This is not the first time the SEC has extended an ETF decision deadline. On Feb. 28, it extended the deadline for Cboe Exchange’s request to list options tied to Ether ( ETH ) ETFs. This followed the SEC receiving a raft of altcoin ETF filings in the wake of Trump’s election and the resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler . Related: Altcoin ETFs are coming, but demand may be limited: Analysts Gensler’s time at the SEC came with what the industry said was an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto , with 100 crypto-related regulatory actions during his tenure from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20. Since Gensler’s departure, a growing number of firms facing legal action from the regulator have had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4 .

His tweets suggest that while Bitcoin remains outside traditional financial structures, XRP is becoming increasingly integrated. This distinction, he argues, is influencing regulatory actions and institutional adoption. Bitcoin Outside the System, XRP Within In his latest tweet, SMQKE stated , “This is why attacks on XRP are increasing. Crypto is merging with the traditional financial system. Bitcoin operates outside that system. This is why attacks on XRP are increasing. Crypto is merging with the traditional financial system. Bitcoin operates outside that system. Meanwhile, XRP has been aligned with it from the start. https://t.co/CLkWTOIVKi pic.twitter.com/g7idBVAOzW — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 9, 2025 Meanwhile, XRP has been aligned with it from the start.” His perspective suggests that XRP’s deepening alignment with regulated financial institutions is making it a target of criticism, while Bitcoin continues to operate as an alternative outside mainstream finance. His previous tweet elaborated on this distinction: “The Bitcoin vs. XRP narrative is quietly being reversed. Why? Because Bitcoin ‘falls outside the system.’ Now, the IMF is pressuring countries not to use it as legal tender. Meanwhile, XRP ‘falls within the system.’ So ask yourself—what will the IMF push countries to adopt? Crypto assets that fall outside or inside the traditional system?” The mention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aligns with ongoing discussions about Bitcoin’s regulatory treatment. The IMF has repeatedly warned against nations adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, citing volatility and financial stability concerns. In contrast, XRP, designed for institutional use, appears to align more closely with global regulatory frameworks. Regulatory Integration and Institutional Adoption The images attached to SMQKE’s tweets reinforce this perspective. One document discusses how regulatory clarity paves the way for mainstream crypto adoption, stating, “Cryptoasset adoption is moving from the fringes of finance to the largest and most venerable trade centers in the world. Banks cannot afford to miss the moment.” This suggests an increasing role for digital assets within traditional finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another highlighted passage states, “The question of whether a given cryptoasset will be recognized as part of the formal payment system will largely depend on how it is meant to be used in a given jurisdiction. Bitcoin and Ether often fall outside, while XRP often falls within the system.” This further supports the idea that XRP is positioned within the regulated financial ecosystem, unlike Bitcoin, which remains separate. The discussion also touches on how different jurisdictions treat cryptoassets, with some banning them outright while others integrate them into legal frameworks. This divide influences how institutional investors and financial bodies interact with digital assets. XRP’s ability to fit within existing financial structures may make it a preferred option for regulatory acceptance compared to Bitcoin. Future of Crypto Regulation SMQKE’s observations highlight an evolving crypto landscape where assets that conform to regulatory standards may gain institutional backing, while those that remain outside the system could face increasing restrictions. If international financial organizations like the IMF continue to discourage Bitcoin adoption while supporting regulated crypto assets, the regulatory environment may increasingly favor tokens like XRP. The broader question remains whether regulatory pressures will shape the future of digital assets based on their compatibility with traditional finance. As governments and institutions integrate blockchain technology, distinguishing between “inside the system” and “outside the system” may define which assets thrive in the evolving financial order.

This exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks publicly traded companies that hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin as part of their financial holdings. Bitwise has now identified over 70 such organizations.

With the new tool, users can test strategies employed by more experienced traders and gain confidence in their trading skills before committing to the platform. Crypto copy trading While copy trading is typically a welcome feature on most exchanges, it is not without its problems, particularly considering that gains are never guaranteed, even when traders are executed by market veterans. WOO X’s new Demo Copy feature seeks to remedy some of the issues by allowing users to practice copy trading in a simulated environment, similar to how demo accounts allow users to try and practice investing without committing real funds. That is, with Demo Copy, users can simulate trades by copying top traders’ strategies without using real funds. Each trade’s performance, based on key metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and Profit and Loss (PnL), can be tracked from an interactive dashboard. While practicing, users can compare different strategies to identify the best performers, counter-copy less successful ones, and transition to actual copy trading once they have gained enough insight into the crypto market . Driving crypto adoption According to Ben Yorke, Ecosystem VP at WOO X, Demo Copy encourages crypto adoption by lowering entry barriers and making trading more accessible: WOO X has likewise promised to analyze the impact of Demo Copy on real copy trading adoption to ensure continuous improvements on the platform. As such, Demo Copy builds on WOO X’s already established Social Trading features — such as CounterTrading, which allows for strategic hedging against lead traders — and its Fair Profit-Sharing Model, which ensures profits are only shared when traders are in profit. In addition, enhanced risk management tools, such as WOO Shield and isolated portfolios, further emphasize the platform’s commitment to innovation and risk management.

The asset remains 25.1% below its all-time high of $109,000, recorded in January. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen an additional 0.7% decline, reflecting ongoing market hesitation and uncertainty among investors. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain has identified a notable trend in Bitcoin’s price channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Future Comes Down To This One Question, Says Bitwise Bitcoin Coinbase Premium and Market Sentiment Despite Bitcoin’s downward trajectory, the Coinbase premium has been forming higher lows, indicating potential underlying demand. However, the CryptoQuant analyst warns that no clear signals of a breakout or reversal have emerged, leaving the market in an uncertain state. Particularly, according to Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin’s price remains within a declining price channel, with repeated pullbacks making it difficult to determine a clear trend. Avocado noted: So far, there is no decisive movement indicating a full-fledged downtrend, but at the same time, there are no clear signs of a bullish reversal either. The market is becoming increasingly uncertain, creating an environment designed to confuse and unsettle investors. The Coinbase premium, which measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on Coinbase and other exchanges, has shown higher lows despite the downward price action. This could suggest that US-based investors are still accumulating BTC, even as the broader market struggles to find direction. The analyst cautions against overleveraging on bullish news or panic selling during downturns, emphasizing that strategic decisions should be made ahead of time rather than in reaction to market fluctuations. While there is no confirmation of a bear market, Avocado believes that exiting positions based on short-term fear could lead to missed opportunities in the long run. The analyst wrote: From my perspective, there isn’t enough data to declare a bear market at this point. Abandoning positions now could end up being an ill-timed exit rather than a calculated decision. Miner Selling Pressure and Market Implications Adding to the market pressure, CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech has noted a spike in BTC miner selling activity. Data shows that as Bitcoin dropped to $77,700, miners increased their BTC transfers to exchanges, a move that historically signals selling pressure at market lows. Related Reading: ‘The Magic Line’: Key Support Level At $74,000 Determines Bitcoin Bull Or Bear Future Miners often sell BTC to cover operational costs, especially during price declines. If miner selling pressure continues, it could limit Bitcoin’s ability to recover in the short term. However, if buyer demand remains strong enough to absorb the excess supply, Bitcoin may stabilize at its current levels before attempting a rebound.

This week, all eyes are glued to the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, and its potential ripple effects across currency markets, particularly in Asia. Let’s dive into why Asia FX is currently muted, how the dollar is flexing its muscles, and what this all means for you. Why is Asia FX Currently Muted? The foreign exchange (FX) markets in Asia are displaying a sense of cautious calm, or as some might say, are ‘muted’. This isn’t necessarily a sign of inactivity, but rather an indication that traders are holding their breath, anticipating a significant economic indicator. But what exactly does ‘muted’ mean in the context of Asia FX ? Reduced Volatility: We’re seeing less dramatic swings in the exchange rates of Asian currencies compared to the US dollar and other major global currencies. Narrow Trading Ranges: The difference between the highest and lowest prices for currencies like the Korean Won, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar within a trading day is tighter than usual. Lower Trading Volumes: Some market participants are choosing to sit on the sidelines, leading to decreased overall trading activity in Asia FX pairs. This muted behavior largely stems from the looming release of the US CPI data. Think of it like waiting for the starter pistol at a race – everyone is poised, ready to react, but holding steady until they hear the signal. Dollar Gains Ground: A Safe Haven or More? While Asia FX is taking a breather, the US dollar is showing noticeable strength. The ‘greenback’ is gaining ground against a basket of currencies, including those in Asia. But why is this happening, and is it just a temporary surge? Several factors are contributing to the dollar’s upward trajectory: Safe Haven Demand: In times of global economic uncertainty or anticipation of market-moving data, the US dollar is often perceived as a safe haven asset. Investors flock to the dollar, believing it will hold its value better than riskier assets during turbulent times. Anticipation of Hawkish Fed: Stronger-than-expected CPI data could reinforce expectations that the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) will maintain its hawkish stance on monetary policy. This means potentially continuing with interest rate hikes to combat inflation. Higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive to investors, boosting demand for the dollar. Economic Resilience (Perceived): Despite global headwinds, the US economy has shown a degree of resilience. This perception, even if debated, supports the dollar’s strength as investors see the US as a relatively stable economic powerhouse. However, it’s crucial to remember that dollar gains can be influenced by various global events and are not always linear. The CPI data will be a critical test for the sustainability of this dollar strength. CPI Data Looms: Why is it a Market Mover? So, why is this CPI data release causing such a stir and influencing currency markets across Asia and globally? Simply put, the CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is a key measure of inflation. It tracks the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. Think of it as a snapshot of how much more or less expensive everyday things are becoming. Here’s why CPI data is a market mover: Factor Impact on Markets Inflation Gauge CPI is the primary indicator of inflation for many central banks, including the US Federal Reserve. High inflation can erode purchasing power and impact economic growth. Central Bank Policy Driver Central banks, like the Fed, use CPI data to guide their monetary policy decisions. Higher CPI can lead to interest rate hikes to cool down the economy and curb inflation. Lower CPI might suggest a need for rate cuts to stimulate growth. Market Expectations vs. Reality Markets are driven by expectations. If the actual CPI data deviates significantly from economists’ forecasts, it can trigger sharp market reactions, including currency fluctuations. A higher-than-expected CPI could strengthen the dollar, while a lower-than-expected reading might weaken it. Impact on Forex Trends CPI data directly impacts forex trends . Changes in interest rate expectations, driven by CPI, influence currency valuations. For instance, if strong CPI data suggests further US rate hikes, investors might buy dollars, anticipating higher returns on dollar-denominated assets. In essence, the CPI data acts as a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding the future direction of interest rates, inflation, and consequently, currency markets . Navigating Forex Trends Amidst CPI Uncertainty For those involved in forex trading or simply monitoring currency movements, the current environment presents both challenges and opportunities. So, how can one navigate these forex trends with CPI data looming? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the actual CPI data release and expert analysis following it. Reputable financial news sources and economic calendars are invaluable tools. Manage Risk: Given the potential for volatility, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider using stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging your positions. Consider Dollar Pairs: With the dollar exhibiting strength, currency pairs involving the USD (like USD/JPY, EUR/USD, AUD/USD) are likely to be particularly active and sensitive to the CPI release. Look Beyond the Immediate Reaction: Market reactions to CPI data can be immediate and sometimes knee-jerk. Try to understand the underlying implications for longer-term forex trends rather than just reacting to short-term spikes. Diversification: In times of uncertainty, diversification across different currency pairs and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Remember, no one can predict the future with certainty, especially in the fast-paced world of forex trading . However, being well-informed, prepared, and disciplined are crucial for navigating periods of market uncertainty like the one we’re currently in. Conclusion: Awaiting the CPI Verdict The muted Asia FX markets and the strengthening dollar are clear indicators of the market’s anticipation of the US CPI data. This economic release is not just another number; it’s a potential catalyst that could reshape forex trends and influence central bank policies. Whether the CPI data confirms expectations, surprises to the upside, or disappoints to the downside, it promises to inject volatility and direction into the currency markets. For traders and observers alike, the coming hours and days will be crucial in understanding the next chapter for Asia FX and the global financial landscape. The markets are poised, and the world is watching – what will the CPI verdict be?

One day you’re riding high on waves of optimism, the next you’re bracing for a market crash. Keeping a pulse on market sentiment is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes into play. Recently, we’ve witnessed a significant shift in this key market indicator. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Sentiment Compass The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a sentiment compass, pointing towards the prevailing emotions driving investor behavior. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This zone indicates that investors are excessively worried. It can often signal a potential buying opportunity as assets may be undervalued. 25-49: Fear – While still negative, ‘Fear’ suggests a slightly less intense level of anxiety. Investors are cautious, but perhaps starting to see glimmers of hope. 50-74: Greed – This zone reflects growing optimism. Investors are becoming more confident and willing to take risks, potentially leading to market rallies. 75-100: Extreme Greed – ‘Extreme Greed’ signals excessive market exuberance. This can be a warning sign of a potential market bubble, as valuations may become unsustainable. The index isn’t based on guesswork; it’s calculated using a blend of six weighted factors, providing a holistic view of market sentiment: Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusual volatility spikes often indicate fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and volume against the last 30 and 90-day averages.

The Shift to the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does It Mean for Crypto? As of March 12th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a value of 34, a notable 10-point jump from the previous day. This upward movement signifies a crucial shift – the index has transitioned from the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (below 25) into the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49). But what does this actually tell us about the current state of the crypto market and potential future movements? This climb out of ‘Extreme Fear’ suggests a tentative improvement in crypto market sentiment . While ‘Fear’ still dominates, it’s a step away from the deep pessimism that characterizes ‘Extreme Fear’. Several factors could be contributing to this shift: Market Stabilization: After periods of intense volatility and price drops, markets often experience a period of consolidation. This stabilization can ease investor anxieties and reduce extreme fear. Positive Newsflow: Even amidst broader market uncertainty, pockets of positive news – such as adoption updates, technological advancements, or regulatory clarity in certain regions – can inject optimism into the market. Accumulation at Lower Prices: Savvy investors often view periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ as opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. Increased buying activity can contribute to a gradual shift in sentiment. Is Bitcoin Dominance a Key Indicator in the Fear Shift? Bitcoin dominance , one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, warrants closer attention. Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market can fluctuate based on risk appetite. During times of fear and uncertainty, investors often seek the relative safety of Bitcoin, increasing its dominance. Conversely, in bullish phases, investors may diversify into altcoins, reducing Bitcoin’s dominance. Analyzing Bitcoin dominance alongside the overall Fear & Greed Index can provide deeper insights. If the Fear & Greed Index is rising while Bitcoin dominance is stable or decreasing, it might suggest a broader recovery across the crypto market, with altcoins also participating in the improved sentiment. However, if the Fear & Greed Index is rising primarily due to increased Bitcoin dominance, it could indicate a flight to safety rather than a widespread bullish reversal. Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors make of this move into the ‘Fear’ zone? Here are some actionable insights: Acknowledge the Sentiment Shift: Recognize that market sentiment is improving, but caution is still warranted. ‘Fear’ is still the prevailing emotion, suggesting ongoing uncertainty. Don’t Get Carried Away: While the shift is positive, avoid impulsive decisions driven by early optimism. A move from ‘Extreme Fear’ to ‘Fear’ is not necessarily a signal of an immediate bull run. Monitor the Index Closely: Keep a close watch on the Fear & Greed Index. Continued upward movement towards ‘Greed’ could signal further recovery. Conversely, a reversal back into ‘Extreme Fear’ would indicate renewed market anxieties. Consider Fundamental Analysis: Don’t rely solely on sentiment indicators. Combine the Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis of projects you’re interested in. Assess their technology, adoption, and long-term potential. Manage Risk Prudently: Continue to practice sound risk management. Diversify your portfolio, invest only what you can afford to lose, and avoid excessive leverage, especially in volatile market conditions. Cautious Optimism: The Path Ahead for Crypto Market Sentiment The leap of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into the ‘Fear’ zone is a noteworthy development. It signals a tentative easing of extreme pessimism in the crypto market. While the journey from ‘Fear’ to ‘Greed’ can be lengthy and potentially volatile, this shift offers a glimmer of hope. For investors, it’s a reminder to remain vigilant, informed, and to balance cautious optimism with prudent risk management as the crypto market continues to evolve.

The blockchain entrepreneur, who co-founded the HyperVerse and HyperFund crypto investment schemes, is facing fraud charges from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Prosecutors accuse him of running a $1.89 billion Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors worldwide. The SEC alleges that Lee and his co-conspirators operated a multi-level marketing scam disguised as a high-return crypto investment. From June 2020 to November 2022, investors were lured in with promises of guaranteed profits, but instead, their money was funneled into a fraudulent system. One of Lee’s key promoters, Brenda Chunga, has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, admitting that HyperFund “mined” investors’ funds rather than cryptocurrencies . One analyst tracked his scam history. Here’s what happened so far. Update: #SamLee , co-founder of #HyperVerse and #HyperFund , faces $1.89B Ponzi scheme charges for defrauding thousands worldwide. Although charged in a $2B #PonziScheme , Sam Lee denies any wrongdoing and remains active in Dubai’s #Crypto scene with new projects. #CoinPedia … pic.twitter.com/A0HO4sjDrF — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) March 12, 2025 A Web of Lies and Fake CEOs Investigations have uncovered deeper layers of deception. Lee allegedly used a fake CEO to front the HyperVerse scheme, misleading investors about its legitimacy. He also had connections to the now-collapsed Australian crypto firm Blockchain Global, raising suspicions about his past dealings. The crackdown has ruined his reputation, and few now support him. Arrest in Dubai – But Is Justice Coming? In November 2024, Lee voluntarily surrendered to Dubai authorities following an Interpol Red Notice. He was detained for 60 days before being released, sparking speculation about whether he will ever face justice in the United States. The DOJ is charging Lee with conspiracy for securities and wire fraud, which could mean five years in prison. The SEC is also suing him for illegally selling unregistered securities. A Defiant Stance Despite the mounting legal trouble, Lee remains defiant. In a video interview with Bloomberg, he dismissed the accusations, claiming that multi-level marketing is legitimate and that U.S. regulators are simply trying to suppress crypto. He also praised Dubai’s regulatory environment , hinting at future ventures in the space. His closing remarks— “there are many exciting projects on the horizon”—have sparked concerns that he may already be plotting his next scheme. These fears have only grown stronger as a series of nine YouTube videos promoting his new venture have resurfaced. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : GainBitcoin Scam: CBI Seizes $2.75M in Crypto After 60 Raids in India , Red Flags to Watch Out For Sam Lee’s new venture shows worrying signs of another scam. He still relies on affiliate marketing and unclear token systems, just like past Ponzi schemes. Instead of taking responsibility for HyperVerse’s collapse, he brushes off legal charges and shifts the blame. His tactic of dismissing critics as dishonest while demanding loyalty is a classic scammer move. His vague promises and secretive plans make him even less trustworthy. With so many warning signs, investors should be very cautious. For now, Lee remains in Dubai, possibly plotting his next crypto scheme.

In a March 10 complaint filed to a Texas federal court, Watch Skins Corporation alleged that LVMH misappropriated its “pioneering NFT display technology.” Watch Skins claimed it developed a unique system that allows users to display verified NFT artworks on smartwatches and holds multiple patents related to the technology. It claimed that a smartwatch from the LVMH-owned watch brand TAG Heuer and other products from the conglomerate’s brands unlawfully used NFT display technology that was based on three patents that Watch Skins owned. The TAG Heuer Connected Calibre E4 (pictured) was one of the watches Watch Skins claimed infringed on its patent. Source: TAG Heuer LVMH is a multinational holding company that owns dozens of well-known luxury goods brands, including Louis Vuitton , Givenchy, TAG Heuer, Tiffany, Christian Dior, Hennessy and the champagne brand Moët & Chandon. Watch Skins said its first patent covers a system that verifies NFT ownership before allowing it to be displayed on a watch face, the second one covers a system where an NFT must be verified through a blockchain wallet before being displayed on a smartwatch, and the third focuses on the retrieval and display of customized watch faces based on NFT ownership. It claimed TAG Heuer encouraged customers to infringe on the patents by providing instructions on how to use its NFT display features. “The watch allows the NFT to be displayed if owned by the user’s crypto wallet [and] connects to a user’s crypto wallet to guarantee authenticity of works displayed,” the complaint explained. Related: NFTs just had their worst performing year since 2020: DappRadar Watch Skins requested a jury trial and compensation for lost profits and royalties due to infringement and a court order preventing LVMH from further use of the patented technology. The company announced the launch of the world’s first blockchain NFT watch face marketplace at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2020. The mobile app gives consumers “the ability to purchase authentic, licensed smartwatch faces from their favorite brands,” Watch Skins stated at the time. Cointelegraph has contacted LVMH for comment.

41520429,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139344,1741757131,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for DeFi: US House Overturns Controversial IRS Crypto Rule,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-irs-rule-overturned-house/,"In a significant win for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the U.S. House of Representatives has delivered a powerful blow against a controversial IRS rule. By a resounding vote of 292-132, lawmakers decided to overturn a regulation that would have mandated DeFi platforms to act as brokers, requiring them to collect sensitive taxpayer and transaction data. This move has sparked a wave of relief and celebration within the crypto community, but what exactly does it mean, and what comes next? What’s the Big Deal About the DeFi IRS Rule? Imagine if every time you traded stocks on your brokerage app, the platform had to meticulously track and report not just your trades, but also the personal details of everyone you traded with. That’s essentially what the now-overturned IRS rule aimed to impose on the burgeoning world of DeFi. This rule, intended to enhance tax compliance, was met with fierce opposition due to its potential to stifle innovation and impose impractical compliance burdens on DeFi platforms. Let’s break down why this rule was so problematic: Compliance Nightmares: DeFi platforms, often decentralized and automated, are not structured like traditional financial institutions. Implementing broker-like data collection would have been incredibly complex and costly, potentially pushing smaller platforms out of business. Privacy Concerns: The rule demanded the collection of user data, raising serious privacy red flags within a space that often prioritizes pseudonymity and decentralization. Innovation Chill: Supporters of the overturn argued that the rule threatened to cripple the rapidly evolving digital asset innovation within the U.S., potentially driving development and talent overseas. House Vote: A Victory for DeFi Regulation? The House vote represents a significant step back from what many considered an overreaching regulatory attempt. This bipartisan vote underscores a growing recognition in Washington of the need for nuanced and informed DeFi regulation . The resolution, having already cleared the Senate, now requires another Senate approval due to House amendments before it can reach President Trump’s desk. The expectation is that President Trump, known for his generally crypto-friendly stance, is likely to sign it into law. Key Highlights of the House Vote: Bipartisan Support: The 292-132 vote demonstrates significant bipartisan agreement on the need to reconsider the IRS rule. Focus on Innovation: Arguments in favor of overturning the rule heavily emphasized the need to protect U.S. digital asset innovation and competitiveness. Pushback on Overreach: The vote can be seen as a pushback against regulatory overreach that could harm a nascent and promising industry. Cryptocurrency Tax Implications: What Does This Mean for You? While this vote is a victory for DeFi platforms and innovation, it doesn’t mean that cryptocurrency tax compliance is off the table. It simply means the IRS will need to explore alternative, more practical approaches to tax regulation within the DeFi space. Here’s what you should keep in mind regarding cryptocurrency taxes: Tax Obligations Remain: Regardless of this specific rule being overturned, profits from cryptocurrency trading and DeFi activities are still taxable in the U.S. Existing Rules Apply: Current IRS guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, including reporting requirements for capital gains and losses, remain in effect. Future Regulations: While this particular rule is likely dead, the IRS will likely continue to seek ways to ensure tax compliance in the crypto space. Expect future regulatory proposals that are hopefully more tailored and less burdensome. Impact of the House Vote on DeFi & Crypto Taxes Aspect Before House Vote (IRS Rule in Place) After House Vote (Rule Overturned) DeFi Platform Compliance Burden Extremely High, Potentially Unfeasible Reduced, Focus Shifts to More Practical Solutions User Privacy Significantly Compromised Privacy Concerns Lessened Innovation in DeFi Threatened, Potential for Slowdown Boosted, Fosters Growth and Development Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Focus on Broker-like Reporting (Now Rejected) Need for Alternative Compliance Mechanisms Digital Asset Innovation: A Step Forward or a Step Back? The debate surrounding the IRS rule highlights a fundamental tension: how to regulate digital asset innovation without stifling its potential. Supporters of the overturn argue that the rule was a step backward, threatening to push innovation offshore and hinder the growth of a vital new technology sector within the U.S. Opponents, however, warn that rolling back the rule could create loopholes for tax evasion and potentially increase the national debt. Arguments For and Against Overturning the Rule: Pro-Overturn (Innovation Focus): Protects nascent DeFi industry from overly burdensome regulations. Encourages continued innovation and investment in the U.S. crypto space. Recognizes the unique nature of DeFi and the impracticality of traditional broker rules. Anti-Overturn (Tax Compliance Focus): Concerns about potential tax evasion in the DeFi space. Need for the IRS to have effective tools to ensure tax compliance. Arguments that all financial activities should be subject to similar reporting requirements. Navigating the Future of IRS Crypto Regulations The overturning of this specific IRS crypto rule is not the end of the story, but rather a pivot. It signals a need for a more collaborative and informed approach to regulating the crypto space. The IRS and lawmakers must now consider developing regulations that are both effective in ensuring tax compliance and practical for the unique characteristics of DeFi and other cryptocurrency activities. This could involve exploring alternative reporting mechanisms, focusing on user education, and working with the crypto industry to develop solutions that work for all parties involved. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of ongoing regulatory developments in the crypto space. Maintain Records: Regardless of specific rules, maintain detailed records of your crypto transactions for tax purposes. Engage in Dialogue: Support industry initiatives that promote sensible crypto regulation and engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers. Conclusion: A Breath of Relief, But the Journey Continues The U.S. House vote to overturn the IRS DeFi broker rule is undoubtedly a moment of relief and a testament to the crypto community’s advocacy efforts. It underscores the importance of informed and balanced regulation that fosters innovation rather than stifling it. While this victory is significant, the broader conversation around crypto regulation and taxation is far from over. The industry must continue to engage with policymakers, advocate for sensible rules, and work towards a future where digital asset innovation can thrive within a clear and supportive regulatory framework. The fight for balanced and effective cryptocurrency regulation continues, but for now, the DeFi space can breathe a little easier.

Why ETH and This New Coin Could Be 2025’s Top Performers”,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-big-rebound-why-eth-and-this-new-coin-could-be-2025s-top-performers/,"Ethereum (ETH) has had a rough ride recently, plunging 28% last month and falling below $2,000 in the recent crypto market crash.. investors wondering whether ETH can stage a comeback as it currently trades at $1,874.97, some critical indicators suggest a rebound could be on the horizon. From whale accumulation to technical signals and rising market interest, Ethereum price may be gearing up for a major rally. At the same time, a new coin – Rexas Finance (RXS), a promising Ethereum-based token, is gaining traction. With a record-breaking presale and growing investor confidence, RXS is currently priced at $0.20, with its launch price set at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Both ETH and RXS are positioning themselves as top contenders for the biggest crypto gains in 2025. Let’s dive into why. 3 Reasons Ethereum Price Could Rally Soon The following are reasons why ETH price is poised to surge soon. Whales Are Accumulating Ethereum Recently, Ethereum whales have been aggressively buying the ETH price dips while adding a total of 1.1 million coins within just 48 hours. This signals a potential rebound, due to increased confident in the leading altcoin. History records that, whenever whales accumulate during price declines, it often results into price recovery in the days that follow. As institutional investors look for cheaper entry opportunities, the current Ethereum price of $1,874.97 may be seen as undervalued, setting the stage for a significant rally. Ethereum price chart Ethereum Price RSI Suggests a Bullish Reversal Ethereum’s RSI is currently about 22, much below the 30 mark. This implies that ETH is oversold, so selling pressure has been too high, and a reversal could be about to happen. For traders trying to profit from a possible bounce, an RSI falling to such low levels usually indicates a strong buying possibility. Historically, Ethereum’s RSI falling below 30 has typically signaled a major price comeback. For instance, past cases of ETH exceeding sell conditions have resulted in a price recovery of 20% or more in the following weeks. Ethereum is presently in a similar state; hence, a relief rally might be imminent as buyers retreat to benefit from the lowered prices. Rising Social Dominance and Trading Volume Technical analysis isn’t the only factor backing Ethereum’s comeback potential. Its growing market presence adds weight to this possibility. Santiment , an on-chain analytics company, reports that ETH now makes up 9.2% of all crypto talks. This boost in attention shows that traders, analysts, and investors are keeping a close eye on Ethereum. More discussion and interest often come before price changes, as this buzz tends to draw in new buyers. Also, Ethereum stays one of the most traded assets on platforms like Coinbase, which points to steady demand even during the market slump. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star Poised for Explosive Growth As Ethereum price prepares for a possible recovery, another asset is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency market— Rexas Finance (RXS). As a token on the Ethereum network aimed at tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), RXS is rapidly gaining popularity in anticipation of its forthcoming exchange launch. Now priced at $0.20 in its last presale phase, the RWA token has successfully raised an impressive $47.01 million, with 91.02% of this round already sold. RXS will debut at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, representing an important achievement for early investors who have experienced increases exceeding 500%. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Reasons Investors Are Attracted to RXS Notable presale results: The high level of interest in RXS as a new cryptocurrency while in its presale phases, emphasizes investor trust in its future prospects. Whale interest: A significant recent acquisition of $85,000 in RXS reinforces the token’s increasing attraction to wealthy investors. $1 Million Giveaway : The project’s tactical marketing, featuring a $1 million giveaway with more than 1.6 million participants, has created significant excitement, drawing in both retail and institutional investors. RWA tokenization: As the tokenization of real-world assets gains traction in the crypto world, RXS stands out as a key contender in this area, establishing itself as one of the most promising tokens for 2025 Final Thoughts: ETH and RXS-A Perfect Pair for 2025? As Ethereum price gets ready for a possible price upturn, the mood in the wider crypto market will get better. This could help promising projects like Rexas Finance (RXS). Analysts anticipates that Ethereum’s comeback might spark a strong rally in other coins, and RXS, with its solid foundations, could be a big winner. Big investors are buying up ETH technical signs are good, and market interest is growing. All these point to a bright future for ETH. RXS is riding the wave of Ethereum’s network success. Both these assets could end up as some of the top performers in 2025. If you’re looking for chances to make big gains, watching Ethereum’s recovery and Rexas Finance’s upcoming launch could be a smart move that changes the game. The post Ethereum Price Big Rebound?

The tweet states: “The only $XRP guide you will ever need! Make sure to bookmark.” The post includes an informational image detailing XRP’s fundamentals, history, and utility. XRP’s Background and Development The guide provides a timeline of XRP’s development, beginning in 2004 when Ripple’s Ryan Fugger conceptualized the idea of a decentralized digital payment system. Jed McCaleb , David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto created the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2012. This marked the beginning of what is now known as Ripple Labs. XRP distribution began in 2013, with a total supply of 100 billion tokens pre-mined. The guide also highlights key events, such as XRP’s all-time high of $3.84 in 2017 and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. The legal battle led to significant price fluctuations. By 2023, Ripple secured a partial legal victory , with a court ruling that XRP was not a security in secondary market sales. The guide concludes with a 2024 update on XRP’s expanding utility in cross-border payments, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and enterprise adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How to Acquire and Store XRP The guide provides a brief overview of how to obtain XRP. It advises users to secure a wallet, purchase XRP on a cryptocurrency exchange, and finally store it in their wallet rather than keeping it on exchanges. This approach aligns with general best practices in cryptocurrency security, ensuring users maintain full control over their holdings. XRP’s Purpose and Functionality According to the guide, XRP aims to solve the problem of slow and costly international money transfers, which rely heavily on traditional banking systems. The guide states that XRP enables “near-instant, low-cost global transactions without intermediaries” and is used by financial institutions to improve liquidity efficiency. The XRP Ledger is a decentralized and open-source blockchain, designed to facilitate fast transactions at minimal cost. The guide highlights XRP’s quick settlement times of three to five seconds, its low transaction fees, and its adoption by over 300 banks and financial institutions. It also notes that, unlike Bitcoin, XRP is not mined, making it more energy-efficient. Key Features and Utility XRP is described as having a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens , with a small portion burned in each transaction, reducing the total supply over time. The guide emphasizes its use in cross-border payments, institutional finance, and decentralized applications built on the XRP Ledger. Additionally, it mentions that some investors view XRP as a hedge against traditional financial systems. Security and Adoption The guide affirms that XRP is a secure digital asset, as the XRP Ledger is decentralized and highly scalable. Its expanding adoption among financial institutions and enterprises further strengthens its position in the digital payments space. CryptoSensei’s post presents a structured and comprehensive overview of XRP, summarizing its history, functionality, and potential use cases. The guide is useful for those interested in understanding XRP’s role in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Experts Signal Now As The Best Time To Buy Remittix And Bitcoin As Market Looks To Recover,https://timestabloid.com/buy-these-cryptos-now-experts-signal-now-as-the-best-time/,"The crypto market is seeing initial signs of a strong recovery, and analysts are of the opinion that the moment is opportune to buy Remittix (RTX) and Bitcoin (BTC) before the price takes off. Bitcoin is currently gaining traction, and Remittix (RTX) is continuing with its explosive presale, creating huge interest among investors looking for high growth. While Bitcoin remains the king and Remittix (RTX) brings a revolutionary payment system, both these cryptos are what most traders are wagering on. Both BTC and RTX are likely to yield enormous returns when the market comes back, as predicted by experts. Bitcoin Gains Strength As Market Rebounds Bitcoin is 2.97% higher over the last 24 hours, reflecting renewed faith in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The market capitalization of BTC is now at $1.61 trillion, showing that despite the recent volatility, institutional investors remain positive. Although Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 18.08% to $60.51 billion, analysts are convinced the asset is preparing for a huge rally. In the past, BTC has always bounced back after market slumps, and most are convinced this is the last opportunity to purchase at these discounted prices. As confidence grows, investors are not only buying Bitcoin, but they’re also diversifying into Remittix (RTX)—a fast-growing token with real global financial applications beyond speculation. Why Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now As compared to Bitcoin, which is largely digital gold, Remittix (RTX) is disrupting the financial arena with its streamlined crypto-to-fiat payment solution. Worth $0.0734 at present, RTX has raised over $13.8 million and sold 518 million tokens, reflecting strong investor confidence. RTX’s PayFi solution allows for instant send and receive payments without banking lag and outrageous transaction fees. Instead of waiting days for funds to clear, freelancers, businesses, and individuals can off-ramp crypto to fiat with ease, making RTX one of the most practical blockchain projects in 2025. While Bitcoin recovers, Remittix (RTX) is picking up the interest of investors looking for practical financial solutions. While BTC remains a solid store of value, RTX is being heralded as the future of cross-border payments. Can Remittix (RTX) Outperform Bitcoin In Growth? While Bitcoin remains the crypto king, Remittix (RTX) is the growth contender. Unlike BTC, which is sustained by institutional investment and demand from the market, RTX generates demand by virtue of its real-world, practical applications in finance. A European freelancer getting paid by U.S. clients can utilize Remittix (RTX) to receive instant and low-cost settlements without incurring high bank charges and wire transfer latency. Likewise, institutions making cross-border transactions are starting to realize the benefits of RTX’s low-cost and scalable solution. As international remittances are a multi-trillion-dollar business, Remittix (RTX) is well on its way to becoming a leader in blockchain financial services. Bitcoin may indeed increase in value over the long term, but RTX’s adoption-driven growth might see even greater percentage gains. If Bitcoin recovers to new highs, Remittix (RTX) may catch the wave, making it one of the most valuable digital currencies of the year. Secure Your Spot In The Future Of Digital Finance While Bitcoin shows strength and Remittix (RTX) revolutionizes the payment system, investors are presented with the rare opportunity to buy two of the most promising cryptos for long-term gains. Though Bitcoin remains the industry leader, RTX is establishing a new standard for real-time transactions and therefore is one of the most promising investment opportunities for 2025. Since the crypto market is about to start a recovery, Bitcoin and Remittix (RTX) are among the top cryptos to invest in today. While BTC will surely appreciate in value as the market sentiment improves, RTX is poised to be one of the most promising blockchain payment projects. As the market recovers, those early investors who get into Bitcoin and Remittix are potentially positioning themselves to gain huge returns in the next cycle of cryptocurrencies.

Here’s Why Experts Say Solaxy Could Deliver Bigger Returns,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/xrp-headed-to-10-or-stuck-at-2-experts-say-solaxy-could-deliver-returns/,"The post XRP Headed to $10 or Stuck at $2? Here’s Why Experts Say Solaxy Could Deliver Bigger Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As cryptocurrencies face turbulence across the board, XRP has taken a substantial 14% hit this month. Industry experts are now examining recovery scenarios and potential price trajectories for the remainder of 2025 while also highlighting an emerging competitor in the blockchain space. Amid XRP’s price uncertainty, people are opting to look for alternative investments with strong utility like Solaxy. Q2 Forecast: XRP’s Legal Victory and Fed Policy Shift Could Spark Rally The crypto market faces numerous challenges as Q1 winds down. Bitcoin and Ethereum have surrendered critical support levels, escalating global trade tensions loom large, and the March 19 FOMC meeting will likely maintain current interest rates. The tide could turn dramatically in Q2, however. With a 48% probability of a May 7 interest rate reduction, market sentiment may improve weeks before the actual meeting. More significantly, April 16 marks the anticipated conclusion of the Ripple Labs vs SEC legal battle. The Motley Fool suggests this verdict could propel XRP beyond its current $2 price point, potentially challenging its previous all-time high of $3.84 if it maintains current support levels through March’s difficult market conditions. Rate Cuts Could Fuel Substantial Q3 Momentum The positive trajectory for XRP might accelerate during the year’s third quarter, driven by additional monetary policy adjustments and technical breakouts. FedWatch projections indicate interest rates potentially dropping to 350-375 basis points by September 17, representing a 75-point reduction from present levels. Historical patterns demonstrate how rate cuts in Q3 2024 coincided with robust crypto market performance, which only slowed when the Fed paused its easing policy. Similar conditions helped catalyze the 2020-2021 crypto surge. If XRP successfully establishes itself above $3 during Q2, these favorable monetary conditions could help drive prices into uncharted $4-$5 territory. ETF Decision Emerges as Q4’s Critical Catalyst October brings perhaps the most significant XRP price driver of 2025 – a potential ETF approval decision. Should regulators greenlight this investment vehicle, it would establish a formal channel for institutional money to flow into XRP, potentially creating both immediate buying pressure and widespread market excitement. Technical analyst Altcoin Pioneers has examined market cycles to project an ambitious $8-$10 price target, noting that XRP has already overcome a major trendline resistance that historically precedes substantial growth phases. Fellow market observer Crypto Bitlord offers a more tempered forecast of $7 – still representing a 3 – 5x return from current levels. Despite these impressive projections, some experts believe an emerging competitor offers even greater growth potential. Why Traders Are Pivoting to Solaxy’s Explosive Potential While XRP captures headlines, traders are still wary about the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and its upward potential. Meanwhile, Solaxy is quietly positioning itself as a revolutionary Layer-2 solution for Solana’s blockchain ecosystem. Solaxy’s infrastructure promises to deliver enhanced transaction speeds, reduced costs, and improved network reliability, which were already met with substantial user approval as the project managed to raise over $25 million in its ongoing presale. The project’s native $SOLX token serves multiple ecosystem functions, including staking, transaction fees, and governance participation. BEST SOLANA MEME COIN RIGHT NOW BUY NOW!? 1000X!? The Cryptonews YouTube channel has dubbed Solaxy “the best meme coin on Solana” due to its utility and meme coin culture blend. By addressing specific performance bottlenecks within one of blockchain’s leading platforms, Solaxy could generate billions in value, explaining why savvy investors are taking early positions in what could become one of the year’s most lucrative blockchain investments.

According to a recent Dragonfly report , up to 5.2 million Americans have been blocked from claiming airdrop tokens due to policies that aimed to reduce regulatory exposure. The report analyzed 11 geo-blocked airdrops. In total, these airdrops are valued at $7.16 billion and shared among 1.9 million wallet addresses. This means that the median payout per wallet address would be around $4,600. Between 2020 – 2024, US crypto users have missed airdrops worth between $1.84 billion and $2.64 billion, the report says. Another larger set of data analyzed by CoinGecko consists of 21 blocked airdrops. This brings the upper limit of the missed payouts to $5.02 billion. While some users would have accessed these airdrops via VPNs, there is still likely to be a significant portion of recipients who never claimed their tokens. The report said, “The economic repercussions of geoblocking on U.S. users are profound, with significant revenue losses that affect both the individual claimers and the broader economic landscape.” Overall, an estimated $418 million to $1.1 billion in federal tax revenue has been lost due to the restrictions. The report mentions that these estimates do not include the additional tax from capital gains from the sale of the airdrop tokens. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price gained around 2 percent to trade at about $81.6k on Wednesday, March 12, during the early Asian session. As a result, the fear of further crypto capitulation gradually declined as shown by Bitcoin’s fear and greed index, which jumped to 34 percent from 20 percent in the past 24 hours. XRP Price Update After teasing below a crucial support range between $2 and $1.9 on Tuesday, XRP price rebounded more than 10 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $2.15 at the time of this writing. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $215 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $6.9 billion, retested its falling logarithmic trend. From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price is on the cusp of a major bullish breakout if Bitcoin price regains a macro rising momentum beyond $100k. Moreover, the XRP price has been retesting the lower border of a multi-week horizontal consolidation coupled with a rising divergence of a daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How High Will XRP Price Go In 2025?

As a result, Franklin Templeton joined other top fund managers – led by Bitwise Management, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Grayscale Management – seeking to offer spot XRP ETF. Meanwhile, the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s application for spot XRP ETF on Tuesday.Consequently, the odds of a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States by the end of this year surged by 3 percent in the past 24 hours to about 73 percent on Polymarket . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The announcement sent the stock price 8% higher past 3,500 JPY levels on Wednesday’s trading session. Furthermore, the company issued 2 billion JPY worth of bonds at 0% rate to fund additional BTC purchases. Bitcoin price selling pressure has shot up this week ahead of the US CPI data release and macro uncertainties amid the Trump tariff war. The Japanese firm seems to be making the most of this opportunity by buying the dips. Metaplanet Stock Jumps 8% on Fresh Bitcoin Purchases On Wednesday, Metaplanet announced its latest Bitcoin acquisition , purchasing 162 BTC for approximately $13.5 million, with an average purchase price of $83,123 per Bitcoin. Additionally, the company reported a year-to-date (YTD) BTC yield of 53.2% in 2025, delivering impressive returns despite a volatile crypto market. As of March 12, 2025, Metaplanet holds a total of 3,050 BTC, acquired at a cumulative cost of roughly $253.7 million, with an average purchase price of $83,180 per Bitcoin. Nearly 50% of its total BTC holdings have been purchased in 2025 so far only. Earlier today, the firm announced that its Board of Directors has approved the issuance of its 8th Series of Ordinary Bonds to EVO FUND. The JPY 2 billion (approximately $18.2 million) bond issuance is part of the company’s strategy to acquire Bitcoin. The announcement comes just two days after MicroStrategy announced its plans to raise $21 billion for Bitcoin purchases . According to the notice, the funds raised will be specifically allocated for Bitcoin purchases, as per the plans detailed in its January 28, 2025 notice regarding Stock Acquisition Rights. Following today’s development, the stock price gained 7.93% moving all the way to 3,605 levels. Amid the current market volatility, the stock has been range bound between 3,300 to 4,000 JPY levels. BTC Whale Accumulation on the Rise Despite the strong selling pressure in BTC over the past few weeks, long term holders and Bitcoin whales have been strategically accumulating at every fall. As per the data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin whales have accumulated over 65,000 BTC in the last 30 days, even as the cryptocurrency faces ongoing market corrections. Source: CryptoQuant While the accumulation may not have an immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, it indicates significant absorption by influential holders. BTC’s price is currently holding above the crucial support of $80,000; however, there have been rising calls for a dip under $70,000 before the long-term uptrend is resumed .

But what are the best crypto to buy? This article reviews five promising projects that could have 100x potential this year. Solaxy Solaxy is building the first-ever Solana layer 2 blockchain. Using off-chain computation and transaction bundling technology, the project will eradicate Solana’s congestion issue. It’s a huge leap forward for the Solana ecosystem, making it cheaper, faster, and more reliable. This will open Solana to new users and use cases, potentially creating billions of dollars in new value. And right now, SOLX is undergoing a presale. It’s a way for investors to join from the start. The presale has raised $25.7 million so far. It’s currently priced at $0.001658, but this will rise throughout the campaign. Solaxy is at a rare juncture right now. Not only is it opening Solana to new possibilities, but it’s also available to buy from the ground floor. For SOLX presale participants, this setup could give 100x gains. MIND Of Pepe MIND Of Pepe is a new Pepe-themed AI agent that aims to make its holders money. The agent has a wide range of abilities, including trend analysis, launching tokens, interacting with dApps, and even writing social media posts. It covers all angles, from identifying trading opportunities to creating them and then shaping social discourse around them. But its bread-and-butter is trend analysis. MIND Of Pepe will consolidate social media and on-chain data into actionable insights to predict future trends, helping MIND holders know what to buy and when. Moreover, it can also fill gaps in the market by launching its own tokens. Again, MIND holders will have first access, providing them with the best entry prices. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $7.2 million so far. As MIND Of Pepe seeks to make its community more profitable, the project is positioned to amass significant adoption, which could make the MIND presale a highly lucrative opportunity for traders. Mantra Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all down today, as are many smaller altcoins. However, Mantra continues to push ahead in what’s becoming a running theme throughout the past year. While the total crypto market cap is down 3.8% in the past 24 hours, Mantra is up 2.5% in the same window. It’s clear that investors see real value in the Mantra use case. The reason is that Mantra is a real-world assets-focused layer 1 blockchain, providing a regulatory-adherent environment for institutions to tokenize their assets. It’s a use case that veers outside the walled garden of normal crypto use cases and penetrates the traditional financial system. And it isn’t just today that Mantra has outperformed the market. Its price has surged by 2,000% in the past year. Mantra has a $6 billion market cap, so it’s unlikely to give 100x gains this year. However, given its immense strength and focus on institutional adoption, there’s every chance it will become a top-five cryptocurrency and potentially rival XRP and Ethereum in the coming years. Hedera Hedera offers an alternative to traditional blockchain platforms with its Hashgraph distributed ledger technology. Unlike conventional blockchain systems, Hedera’s architecture provides improved efficiency in several key metrics. The platform processes transactions with fees of approximately $0.0001 USD and confirmation times under five seconds. Hedera’s network can handle more than 10,000 transactions per second, which compares favorably to the 5-20 TPS typical of many proof-of-work blockchains. HBAR Hedera Hashgraph Crypto Price News Today – Price Prediction and Technical Analysis! HBAR, the network’s utility token, experienced significant price movement in late November 2024, rising from $0.04 to $0.37 before settling at around $0.20. This price activity reflects growing market awareness of the platform’s capabilities, with the recent downturn being attributed to the general crypto market. According to crypto analysts at More Crypto Online, HBAR is looking for downturn confirmation between $0.09 and $0.016. However, its mid-term outlook is extremely positive, with potential targets at $0.4 and $0.6. With a governance structure managed by the Hedera Governing Council and features designed to support enterprise applications, Hedera aims to address practical business needs while maintaining security and decentralization principles. As organizations continue to explore blockchain alternatives, Hedera’s focus on performance and regulatory compatibility may position it for increased adoption. BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token is a Bitcoin-themed meme coin that pays its holders Bitcoin rewards. The idea is to increase Bitcoin ownership among meme coin fans and offset some of the volatility of meme coin investing through airdrops. Users will receive free BTC and BTCBULL airdrops at key milestones on Bitcoin’s journey to $1 million. At the same time, Bitcoin-related cryptos tend to track Bitcoin’s price, so we can also expect the BTCBULL price to grow as Bitcoin rises. Users also earn even more via the project’s staking mechanism, which is live now and offering a 123% APY. BTC Bull Token also has a burn mechanism, which destroys a portion of the total supply at key price milestones.

LINE reports approximately 200 million active users across its platform, and the agreement will bring four LINE-based games, or ""mini-apps,"" to Soneium: Sleepagotchi, Farm Frens, Puffy Match, and Pocket Mob. The integration is meant to facilitate features like in-game rewards and purchases. Soneium is mainly managed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint program between Sony and Singapore-based Startale Labs. SBSL envisions the partnership as a way to ""transcend boundaries, allowing users to experience the benefits of web3 without friction,"" according to a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""LINE has built a strong presence and integrating successful mini-apps into the Soneium ecosystem is a next step toward making Soneium more accessible,"" said Jun Watanabe, chairman of Sony Block Solutions Labs. ""We believe this collaboration will drive engagement and adoption in ways that were previously difficult to achieve."" Soneium went live in January, and at the time, the team said that they hoped to bridge web2 users into the web3 space. The blockchain is a layer-2 on top of Ethereum that uses Optimism’s OP Stack technology. It currently ranks as the 15th largest layer-2 network by total value locked, according to L2 Beat .

In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reportedly moving to drop its case against crypto YouTuber Ian Balina, reflecting a broader policy shift under the new administration. Meanwhile, in Europe, regulators are examining whether OKX’s Web3 services fall under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework after allegations that they were used to launder funds from the Bybit hack. EU Regulators Scrutinize OKX Over Potential Role in $100 Million Bybit Hack Laundering The European Union's financial regulators are reportedly investigating cryptocurrency exchange OKX over its Web3 wallet and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which may have been used to launder $100 million in stolen funds from the Bybit hack, according to a March 11 report by Bloomberg. This scrutiny follows concerns that OKX’s services may fall under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which governs digital assets across the EU. The controversy stems from whether OKX's decentralized platform and wallet should be subject to the same compliance standards as centralized exchanges. Sources cited in Bloomberg’s report state that national regulators from EU member states met on March 6 at a gathering hosted by the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) Digital Finance Standing Committee to discuss OKX’s involvement. At the core of the discussion is whether OKX's Web3 proxy and wallet service played a direct role in processing illicit transactions linked to the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit in January. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has claimed that 40,233 ETH (worth approximately $100 million) was laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with some funds now untraceable. With OKX having secured a full MiCA license in January, regulators are assessing if its Web3 wallet service and decentralized exchange fall under MiCA oversight. If found to be in violation of EU regulations, penalties could follow. Authorities from Austria and Croatia were particularly vocal, arguing that OKX's Web3 service should fall under EU regulatory purview, despite the exchange asserting that it operates as a decentralized platform. Under MiCA, fully decentralized platforms might be exempt from stringent compliance measures, but the case for OKX remains ambiguous. Amid these allegations, OKX has denied being the subject of any formal investigation by EU regulators. In a statement posted on X, the exchange rejected Bybit’s claims, accusing the firm of spreading misinformation about OKX’s Web3 wallet and platform. OKX’s Web3 wallet has 53 million addresses and can connect to 100 blockchains, making it one of the most expansive decentralized ecosystems in the crypto space. The company maintains that its self-custodial nature means it does not have direct control over users' transactions, which differentiates it from centralized services that facilitate laundering through custodial accounts. The Bybit hack, which saw the theft of $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) and ETH-related tokens, is now considered the largest crypto hack in history. Cybersecurity experts and blockchain analytics firms have attributed the attack to Lazarus Group, a North Korean-affiliated hacking syndicate responsible for numerous high-profile crypto thefts. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has taken an aggressive stance against the hackers, publicly declaring war on the Lazarus Group and working with authorities to trace and recover stolen assets. So far, 3% of the stolen funds have been frozen, while 20% remain untraceable, raising concerns about how hackers are laundering assets through DeFi services and decentralized wallets. MiCA's Challenge: Regulating Decentralized Finance The controversy surrounding OKX shows the ongoing challenge regulators face in applying traditional compliance measures to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallet services. Under MiCA regulations, crypto service providers operating in the EU must comply with stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. However, fully decentralized platforms remain a gray area. The EU’s approach to DeFi regulation remains unclear, with policymakers struggling to define what constitutes “sufficient decentralization” under MiCA. The OKX case could set a precedent for how DeFi platforms and non-custodial wallets are treated under the EU’s evolving crypto regulatory framework. As regulators continue to examine OKX’s operations, it remains to be seen whether formal action will be taken against the exchange. If the EU determines that OKX's Web3 service falls under MiCA, the company could face compliance requirements, fines, or operational restrictions. SEC to Drop Case Against Crypto YouTuber Ian Balina in Major Shift Under New Administration In other news, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly moving to dismiss its lawsuit against Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics and a prominent YouTuber with over 100,000 subscribers. The case, which accused Balina of violating securities laws by promoting Sparkster (SPRK) tokens in 2018, was originally filed in 2022 but appears to be another casualty of the SEC's changing stance on crypto enforcement under the new Trump administration. Balina confirmed the news in a March 11 interview, stating that the SEC had informed him of its intent to recommend the court drop the case. The decision reflects the regulator’s evolving priorities following the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler in January and the appointment of acting Chair Mark Uyeda by President Donald Trump. The SEC’s lawsuit against Balina stemmed from his alleged failure to disclose compensation received for promoting SPRK tokens. The September 2022 complaint claimed that Balina agreed to receive a 30% bonus on the $5 million worth of tokens he purchased during the Sparkster initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018 but did not inform his social media followers about this arrangement. In May 2024, a judge ruled that SPRK tokens were securities, reinforcing the SEC’s case. Balina’s legal team had planned to appeal the decision, and a jury trial was initially scheduled for January 2025 before being postponed to a later, undetermined date. At the time of publication, no official filing had been made in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas to dismiss the case. However, if the case is formally dropped, it would mark a significant retreat from the SEC's aggressive enforcement actions against crypto influencers. Balina, who has been an outspoken critic of the SEC’s enforcement-first approach, welcomed the development and pointed to political shifts in Washington as the key driver of the SEC’s decision. Despite celebrating the likely dismissal, Balina admitted the legal battle had been costly, saying “It definitely was not cheap, cost a lot of money in terms of legal fees, which definitely sucks. Makes me wish the SEC hadn’t put priority on all this.” The SEC’s move to drop the Balina case aligns with a broader policy shift under President Trump, whose administration has taken a more favorable stance toward crypto. Since Trump took office in January 2025, the SEC has dropped or scaled back enforcement actions against several major crypto firms, including: Robinhood Crypto Gemini Uniswap OpenSea Coinbase Consensys Kraken Additionally, the SEC has backed off efforts to classify crypto firms as exchanges under new regulatory rules, a significant win for the industry. Critics have suggested that the crypto industry’s financial support for Trump’s campaign and inauguration may have played a role in these regulatory decisions. Many major crypto firms and executives backed pro-crypto candidates in the 2024 election cycle and were prominent donors to Trump’s inauguration fund. The close relationship between the new administration and the crypto sector was further highlighted on March 7, when Trump hosted a crypto summit at the White House, attended by representatives from Robinhood, Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken. The SEC’s Ripple Case Still in Play While the SEC has backed off in several cases, one major lawsuit remains unresolved: the commission’s legal battle with Ripple Labs. The case, which has been ongoing since 2020, saw a $125 million ruling against Ripple in August 2024. However, both Ripple and the SEC have filed appeals, leaving its long-term impact on crypto regulation uncertain. With the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation shifting, many in the industry expect a more business-friendly environment in the coming years. The potential dismissal of Balina’s case could set a precedent for other crypto influencers and projects that previously faced regulatory scrutiny. However, questions remain about how the SEC will approach new crypto-related cases under Chair Mark Uyeda. While enforcement actions may be scaling down, the need for clear regulatory guidelines remains a pressing issue. For now, Balina’s case represents another win for the crypto industry as Washington redefines its approach to digital assets. Whether this shift leads to long-term regulatory clarity or simply temporary deregulation remains to be seen.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TOKEN SALE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-12 06:00:00

Glassnode said in a March 11 markets report that a recent sell-off by top buyers has driven “intense loss realization and a moderate capitulation event.” Short-term holders fled as Bitcoin dropped from peak The surge in buyers paying higher prices for Bitcoin ( BTC ) in recent months is reflected in the short-term holder realized price — the average purchase price for those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days. In October, the short-term realized price was $62,000. At the time of publication, it’s $91,362 — up about 47% in five months, according to Bitbo data. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at $81,930 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. This leaves the average short-term holder with an unrealized loss of roughly 10.6%. Bitcoin is down 5.90% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap Glassnode said that short-term holders’ realized price shows it is apparent that “market momentum and capital flows have turned negative, signaling a decline in demand strength.” “Investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence,” it added. Glassnode said that short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900 and warns that Bitcoin could bottom out as low as $70,000 if selling persists. “The probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is meaningful, at least in the near term,” Glassnode said. Bitcoin short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900. Source: Glassnode Market research firm 10x Research labeled it a “textbook correction” in a March 10 note, adding that with Bitcoin’s dip below $80,000, “approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months.” Related: Bitcoin slides another 3% — Is BTC price headed for $69K next? On the same day, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin may retest the $78,000 price level and, if that fails, may head to $75,000 next. Glassnode explained that a similar sell-off Bitcoin pattern was seen in August when Bitcoin fell from $68,000 to around $49,000 amid fears of a recession, poor employment data in the United States, and sluggish growth among leading tech stocks . However, Bitcoin has spiked 7.5% over the past 24 hours as the US market steaded on March 11 after plunging a day earlier after US President Donald Trump refused to rule out that a recession was on the cards.

Over the past 24 hours, BTC has fallen by 2.6%, while ETH has dropped by 7.9%, reflecting the broader market correction. This decline aligns with the overall downturn in the crypto market, which currently stands at $2.7 trillion. This marks a considerable 20.5% drop from its peak of $3.4 trillion at the end of Q4 2024. Despite these setbacks, numerous market analysts remain optimistic, suggesting that the recent dip presents a strategic buying opportunity. In this article, we analyze the current state of Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with key predictions from analysts, while also exploring two promising presale projects that have been attracting significant investments even amid market uncertainty. Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Market Dip That Signals Opportunity The latest crypto market correction has been fueled by concerns over a potential U.S. recession, with President Trump’s unpredictable tariff trade war leading to a broader market sell-off. In contrast to the bearish sentiment in Q1 2025, Q4 2024 was a period of explosive growth for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin surged past the $100K milestone for the first time, and Ethereum gained 60% over the quarter. However, since the start of 2025, Bitcoin has fallen by 14.29%, while Ethereum has dropped by a more significant 42.4%. Despite this downturn, many crypto analysts argue that now could be the perfect time to enter the market, anticipating a strong recovery in Q2. Bitcoin Price Prediction Many experts continue to have a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. One such expert is Jacob Crypto Bury, a well-followed crypto analyst with over 11,000 followers on X. He recently highlighted that despite the correction, a $2.7 trillion crypto market cap is still extremely bullish, especially considering that the market was valued at just $1.7 trillion at the start of 2024. https://twitter.com/BuryCrypto/status/1899040540630593789 Bury also pointed out that Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $80K even after a sharp correction is a positive sign, reinforcing the importance of a long-term perspective. Meanwhile, LordPlebDrake , another notable analyst, emphasized that the time to short sell BTC has passed, warning investors not to panic sell now that Bitcoin has already corrected. Overall, many experts remain bullish on BTC, especially in the long term. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum has also captured bullish interest from technical analysts. One notable prediction comes from CryptoELITES, an analyst with over 250,000 X followers. In a recent tweet , CryptoELITES highlighted a strong resemblance between Ethereum’s current price action and its 2017 price cycle, which ultimately led to a massive 50x rally. https://twitter.com/CryptooELITES/status/1899196058653348251 The analysis suggests that Ethereum is currently forming a five-wave correction, similar to what was seen in 2017 before a breakout. If this pattern holds, Ethereum could be on the verge of a major price surge in 2025. However, while historical trends can provide valuable insights, they should not be taken as a certainty. That said, Ethereum remains one of the best-performing crypto assets in history, up by more than 439,000% since its launch. Top New Altcoins to Buy Before Q2 While established cryptos remain attractive long-term investments, many investors are also looking at emerging projects that are currently in their presale phase. Below, we review two standout presales – BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) and Solaxy (SOLX) . BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has gained significant attention for its unique approach of rewarding token holders as Bitcoin’s price rises. This sets it apart from traditional meme coins that rely purely on hype. The presale has been incredibly strong, with BTCBULL raising $3.4 million in a couple of months. Trump Has Amazing Bitcoin News That Could Drive Prices Much Higher! BTC Bull Token has also implemented an innovative milestone-based reward system. When Bitcoin reaches certain price levels, BTC Bull Token will either burn tokens or distribute BTC rewards to holders. These milestones include: BTC at $125K, $175K, $225K – Token burns to reduce supply BTC at $150K, $200K – Bitcoin airdrops to BTCBULL holders BTC at $250K – A massive 10% airdrop of the total BTCBULL supply Additionally, the project offers 123% APY staking rewards, making it an attractive option for long-term holders. Given its solid presale performance, strong link to BTC’s success, and structured rewards system, BTC Bull Token could be a major contender in the next crypto bull run. Visit BTC Bull Token Solaxy (SOLX) Despite broader market corrections, Solaxy (SOLX) has emerged as one of the top-performing presales, raising an impressive $25.8 million in just a few weeks. As an upcoming Layer 2 scaling solution for Solana, Solaxy aims to address Solana’s network congestion and failed transaction issues, positioning itself as a crucial addition to the ecosystem. ​​ Honest Review: BUY SOLAXY OR NOT? (SOLAXY PRESALE REVIEW) Solaxy plans to introduce off-chain processing and transaction bundling to enhance Solana’s scalability. By handling transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Solana’s mainnet, Solaxy is expected to provide faster processing speeds and significantly reduce network congestion. This will be particularly valuable during peak demand periods when Solana has historically faced slow transaction times and frequent failures. The network is being designed to remain operational at all times, eliminating downtime and ensuring seamless transaction execution. Additionally, its staking program, which is already live, offers a competitive 158% APY, attracting investors seeking passive income opportunities. With its strong presale momentum and a clear focus on solving Solana’s scalability challenges, SOLX has the potential to be a valuable long-term investment as blockchain adoption continues to expand.

The Starknet Foundation’s Bitcoin roadmap , published on Mar. 11, outlined how the network could scale Bitcoin ( BTC ) from its current 13 transactions per second to thousands of tramsactions. Although Bitcoin provides deep liquidity and security, decentralized finance development has been difficult due to its limited programmability. Starknet ( STRK ) wants to change that. To achieve this, Starknet is pushing for OP_CAT, a proposed Bitcoin update that would allow users to set spending conditions for BTC and enable zero-knowledge proofs , which are cryptographic techniques for verifying transactions without revealing personal data. This would allow a fully trustless bridge between Bitcoin and Starknet. Until OP_CAT is adopted, Starknet will use alternatives like BitVM, a verification method that lets Bitcoin execute smart contract logic without changing its base layer.

It has also partnered with Bitcoin wallet Xverse. Xverse has been pushing to integrate Bitcoin DeFi into its wallet. Meanwhile, StarkWare, Starknet’s core technology provider, has moved part of its treasury into Bitcoin, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In a Mar. 11 X space , Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin backed the idea of a highly secure Bitcoin layer 2 with strong security. Buterin noted that it might “make crypto payments great again.” He pointed out that scaling problems have slowed down Bitcoin’s initial objective of acting as a peer-to-peer cash system and that current solutions, such as the Lightning Network, have limitations. The Lightning Network, for example, has faced issues with liquidity constraints, routing failures, and the need for always-online nodes, which limit its efficiency for large-scale payments.
