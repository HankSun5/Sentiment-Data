Bahrain-based ATME exchange has just turned this dream into reality with the launch of their gold-backed token . This groundbreaking move is injecting a fresh wave of innovation into the real world assets (RWA) market, promising to democratize access to precious metals and reshape how we perceive digital gold . Are you ready to dive into the future of finance? Why a Gold-Backed Token? The Power of Tokenized Gold For centuries, gold has been synonymous with wealth preservation and stability. However, physical gold comes with its own set of challenges: storage, security, transportation, and divisibility. Enter the gold-backed token – a revolutionary solution that merges the timeless appeal of gold with the cutting-edge efficiency of blockchain technology. ATME’s initiative directly addresses these pain points, offering a modern, streamlined approach to gold ownership. Key Advantages of Tokenized Gold: Accessibility: Tokenization lowers the barrier to entry for gold investment. You no longer need to buy large bars; you can own fractions of gold represented by tokens. Liquidity: Trading gold-backed tokens on exchanges like ATME offers significantly higher liquidity compared to physical gold markets. Buy and sell with ease, 24/7. Security: Blockchain’s inherent security features protect your digital gold holdings. Transactions are transparent and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud. Efficiency: Say goodbye to cumbersome paperwork and lengthy settlement times. Tokenized gold transactions are fast, efficient, and cost-effective. Portability: Carry your gold wealth digitally, without worrying about physical storage or transportation risks. ATME’s Gold-Backed Token: A Deep Dive into Tokenized Real World Assets ATME’s newly launched token is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a representation of a tangible asset – 1 kilogram of physical gold for each token. This places it firmly within the realm of tokenized real world assets (RWAs), a rapidly growing segment in the crypto space. RWAs bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain, bringing real-world value on-chain. How ATME’s Gold-Backed Token Works: 1 Token = 1 KG Gold: Each token issued by ATME is backed by 1 kilogram of physical gold, stored securely. Secondary Market Trading: Tokens can be traded on ATME’s secondary market, offering price discovery and liquidity. Redemption for Physical Gold: Token holders have the option to exchange their tokens for physical gold directly through the ATME platform. Expansion Plans: ATME isn’t stopping at gold. They plan to expand their tokenization efforts to other asset classes, further diversifying their RWA offerings. Blockchain Technology: The Backbone of Digital Gold and RWAs The magic behind digital gold and RWAs lies in blockchain technology . Blockchain provides the secure, transparent, and immutable infrastructure necessary for tokenization to thrive. It ensures the provenance and authenticity of the underlying asset, in this case, gold, and facilitates seamless transactions. Blockchain Benefits for Gold Tokenization: Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent audit trail. Immutability: Once recorded, blockchain data is virtually tamper-proof, enhancing security and trust. Decentralization: Blockchain’s decentralized nature reduces reliance on intermediaries, potentially lowering costs and increasing efficiency. Smart Contracts: Blockchain enables the use of smart contracts to automate processes like redemption and ownership transfer, streamlining operations. Benefits of Investing in Gold-Backed Tokens and Digital Gold Investing in gold-backed tokens and embracing digital gold presents a compelling proposition for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto space. Beyond the inherent advantages of tokenization, gold itself has historically served as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Combining these factors creates a potentially powerful investment vehicle. Investor Advantages: Diversification: Gold-backed tokens offer portfolio diversification, especially in volatile market conditions. Inflation Hedge: Gold has traditionally acted as a safe haven asset during inflationary periods, potentially preserving wealth. Accessibility to Gold: Tokenization democratizes gold investment, making it accessible to a wider range of investors. Potential for Appreciation: Like any asset, the value of gold and consequently, gold-backed tokens, can appreciate over time. Modern Investment: Embracing digital gold positions investors at the forefront of financial innovation. Navigating the Landscape of Tokenized Gold and Real World Assets While the future of tokenized gold and real world assets is bright, it’s crucial to approach this evolving landscape with informed awareness. Like any investment, there are factors to consider and potential challenges to navigate. Considerations for Investors: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory framework for RWAs and digital assets is still developing globally. Stay informed about relevant regulations in your jurisdiction. Platform Risk: The security and reliability of the exchange or platform issuing and managing the tokens are crucial. Research and choose reputable platforms like ATME. Market Volatility: While gold is generally considered stable, the price of gold-backed tokens can still be influenced by market fluctuations and crypto market sentiment. Custodial vs. Non-Custodial: Understand whether you are holding the tokens in a custodial wallet (managed by the platform) or a non-custodial wallet (where you control your private keys). Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any crypto asset, including gold-backed tokens. Understand the project, the platform, and the risks involved. ATME’s launch of their gold-backed token marks a significant step forward in the tokenization of real-world assets. By leveraging blockchain technology to modernize gold ownership, they are not only solving practical challenges but also paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and secure financial future. As the RWA market continues to expand, initiatives like this will be instrumental in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the exciting world of crypto.

Watch This Key Level,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-set-for-a-50-crash-watch-this-key-level/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is staging a much needed rebound after being slaughtered over the course of the last week, as the broader crypto market rebounds from lows. ADA was last changing hands around $0.7250, a more than 11% rebound from the lows it hit earlier in the day around $0.65. But that leaves the crypto still down close to 40% from the highs it hit 9 days ago when President Trump announced a crypto reserve including ADA in a tweet on X. In the end, Cardano only made it into a national US crypto stockpile, which was set up by US President Trump last Thursday. And unlike the strategic Bitcoin reserve that Trump signed into law at the same time, there are currently no plans to increase the size of the stockpile via additional Cardano purchases. Worse yet for Cardano , its co-founder and figurehead head Charles Hoskinson wasn’t invited to the White House summit on crypto last week. Charles Hoskinson confirms no White House invite for Cardano?. #Cardano #crypto pic.twitter.com/W49FbqyT49 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) March 6, 2025 The snub is a gut punch for ADA investors who had been hoping for bullish outcomes like Cardano being included in the strategic reserve (not stockpile) and for Charles Hoskinson to work his way into Trump’s inner circle as a crypto advisor that could bolster the crypto’s US adoption. That leaves the Cardano price vulnerable to a breakout to fresh multi-month lows under $0.55 in the coming weeks as the broader macro backdrop sours. How Low Could the Cardano Price Go? Bullish Cardano narratives have lost a great deal of traction over the last week and as the broader crypto market faces a difficult period, ADA could be destined for some underperformance. Rising concerns that the Trump administration is knowingly pursuing policies that will create short-term economic pain ( D.O.G.E austerity and trade wars) have battered risk appetite in recent weeks. If we are having a recession over a decline in govt spending, then the GDP wasn't real to begin with. The US govt has a $2 trillion annual budget deficit. That is basically $2 trillion of artificial GDP that is funded by more debt. Removing $2 trillion of GDP is where the… — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) March 10, 2025 US stocks have seen a substantial slide from their yearly peaks and this has weighed heavily on crypto. With things likely to worsen for the US economy in the coming weeks and months, this is a trend in financial markets that is unlikely to let up anytime soon. That means risks are tilted to the downside for major cryptos like Cardano, which are very sensitive to the market’s broader sentiment. The Cardano price is currently testing its 200DMA for the third time in just over one month, with a convincing breakout to the downside looking increasingly likely, which could then cascade into a breakout below the February lows. That could open the door to a prolonged move lower back to the late-2024 $0.27-41 range. That would mark a drop of potentially as much as 50% from current levels. Buy the Cardano Dip? Should Cardano drop back to these depressed levels, that could offer a compelling risk-reward bet for the coming years. That’s because the current macro pain weighing on the market will almost certainly be temporary. Sure, it could last for a few months or even a year. But once macro conditions improve and the liquidity flood comes, it’s likely to be off to the races for the crypto market. That’s because the narratives behind the industry and markets are just so bullish right now – accelerating global adoption, particularly of Bitcoin, but also a now very friendly regulatory environment in the USA. Cardano could easily 10x from its lows in the $0.40 area back to record highs around $4 by the end of Trump’s four-year term. However, investors would be wise not to put all their eggs in one basket, Cardano remains a highly speculative crypto owing to its lack of real world adoption and reliance on community and hype. Investors might want to consider allocating a bigger percentage of their portfolios to better-established cryptos like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana. The post Cardano Price Set for a 50% Crash?

On-Chain Signals You Need to See,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-recovery-near-on-chain-signals-you-need-to-see/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest dump has market participants speculating whether there will be more bloodshed in the coming weeks or if the asset’s value will record a significant recovery. Market analytics firm Santiment has identified some on-chain indicators that can offer insight into bitcoin’s movement in the short term. According to Santiment, several on-chain metrics signal that the market still has rocky times ahead, with turbulence triggered by macroeconomic and global concerns. However, BTC reaccumulation by whales and the increasing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) indicate that positive signs are beginning to emerge. “The Sky is Not Falling in Crypto” Since BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $109,000 the day before U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the cryptocurrency has been on a seven-week slump. Santiment said the fear of missing out (FOMO) did not slow down the rally, as it has often done – this was due to large BTC accumulation by whales and sharks. This accumulation continued until Trump’s inauguration in mid-January, but it began to slow down after the event and stopped in mid-February. Bitcoin’s price began to record deeper corrections when sharks and whales started taking profit. Prices have continued to plunge even after high capital BTC wallets resumed accumulation on March 3. Despite the reaccumulation, the amount of BTC moving to exchanges has been high. Santiment found that a combined 22,702 BTC (approximately 0.11% of Bitcoin’s entire supply) moved from non-exchange wallets to exchange addresses between February 20 to March 8. This is a cause for concern because the primary purpose of moving coins to exchanges is often selling. However, Santiment sees whale accumulation and exchange supply as long-term indicators, so short-term traders ought to focus more on the level of FOMO and FUD the retail crowd demonstrates daily on social media. An Incoming Bounce? Examining social media content, mentions of BTC predictions related to lower prices ($50,000 to $69,000) are currently higher than mentions for prices ranging from $100,000 to $119,000. Santiment says this is a good sign because the crypto market often moves in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. The analytics firm is rooting for the social media mentions to spam lower price predictions because it shows that they are still bearish. Another metric to consider is the average rate of gains or losses from short and long term traders. Bitcoin traders active in the last 30 days have lost 11%, while those active in the past 365 days are down 5%, suggesting that the market is not in historically negative zones yet. “Don’t be surprised if there is a bit more pain in store first, though. It’s always darkest before the dawn,” the firm added. The post Is Bitcoin’s Recovery Near?

Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of content creation and the broader implications for the generative AI landscape. Is This the Dawn of AI Fiction Writers? Sam Altman’s recent post on X (formerly Twitter) has ignited a firestorm of discussion. He showcased a sample of creative writing produced by this new OpenAI model , prompted with a request for a ‘metafictional literary short story about AI and grief’. Altman expressed genuine surprise and admiration, stating it was the ‘first time I have been really struck by something written by AI,’ particularly noting its grasp of metafiction. This isn’t just about AI generating text; it’s about AI understanding and executing nuanced literary concepts, suggesting a leap in AI’s creative capabilities. But what exactly makes this announcement so significant? Beyond Logic and Code: OpenAI has primarily focused on AI applications in logical and structured domains like math and programming. Venturing into AI creative writing signals a significant shift towards understanding and replicating human creativity, a domain long considered uniquely human. Wordsmithing Upgrade: This move suggests that OpenAI believes its latest generation of models represents a substantial improvement in natural language processing and generation, moving beyond basic essay writing to sophisticated storytelling. Industry Disruption?: While the release timeline remains uncertain, this development has profound implications for writers, publishers, and the entertainment industry. Could AI become a collaborator, a tool, or even a competitor in the realm of creative content? The Power of Generative AI in Storytelling Generative AI , in its essence, is about creating something new from existing data. In the context of writing, this means AI models learn from vast datasets of text and code to understand language patterns, styles, and narrative structures. The potential benefits of such advanced writing AI are vast and varied: Benefit Description Content Creation at Scale Imagine generating diverse and engaging content for marketing, education, or entertainment at unprecedented speed and volume. Personalized Storytelling AI could tailor stories to individual preferences, creating hyper-personalized reading experiences. Overcoming Writer’s Block Writers could use AI as a brainstorming partner, generating ideas, plot points, or even initial drafts to overcome creative hurdles. Accessibility and Inclusivity AI writing tools could empower individuals with writing difficulties or language barriers to express themselves creatively. Challenges and Considerations for AI Fiction While the prospect of sophisticated AI fiction is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and ethical considerations that come with it: Originality and Creativity: Can AI truly be original, or is it merely remixing existing human creativity? The question of AI’s capacity for genuine creative thought remains a philosophical and practical debate. Copyright and Authorship: Who owns the copyright of AI-generated content? Establishing clear legal frameworks for AI authorship is essential. Emotional Depth and Human Experience: Can AI truly capture the nuances of human emotion, experience, and the complexities of the human condition that often form the heart of compelling stories? Job Displacement Concerns: The rise of advanced writing AI raises concerns about potential job displacement for human writers and creative professionals. Examples of AI’s Creative Spark While OpenAI’s announcement is generating buzz, it’s important to remember that AI has been making inroads into creative fields for some time. We’ve seen examples of generative AI being used for: Poetry and Songwriting: AI models can generate poems and song lyrics, sometimes with surprising artistic merit. Scriptwriting: AI is being explored for generating scripts for movies, TV shows, and even video games. Interactive Narratives: AI can power dynamic and branching storylines in games and interactive fiction, creating more immersive experiences. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the AI Creative Revolution The development of powerful AI creative writing tools is not a distant future; it’s happening now. Here’s how to prepare: Embrace AI as a Tool: Instead of fearing AI as a replacement, explore its potential as a powerful tool to augment human creativity and productivity. Develop AI Literacy: Understand how OpenAI models and other AI writing tools work, their capabilities, and limitations. Focus on Human Strengths: Hone uniquely human skills like emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and nuanced storytelling that AI may struggle to replicate fully. Engage in the Ethical Conversation: Participate in discussions about the ethical implications of AI in creative fields and help shape responsible development and usage. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Storytelling OpenAI’s announcement is a clear signal that generative AI is rapidly advancing into the realm of creative arts. While the full impact of these OpenAI models on AI fiction and content creation is yet to unfold, one thing is certain: we are on the cusp of a significant shift in how stories are created and consumed. The future of writing will likely be a collaborative dance between human ingenuity and the astonishing capabilities of artificial intelligence. It’s a time of both excitement and careful consideration as we navigate this new frontier of creative expression.

Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act,https://cryptonews.com/news/rep-nick-begich-introduces-companion-legislation-to-sen-cynthia-lummis-bitcoin-act/,"Key Takeaways: The companion bill seeks to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic, long‑term reserve asset in the national financial framework. Lawmakers look to bolster economic independence by integrating digital assets into government holdings. The proposal mandates secure, decentralized storage and enshrines permanent, not temporary, asset management. It also emphasizes protecting individual self‑custody rights while driving innovation in fiscal policy. Congressman Nick Begich (R-AK) introduced companion legislation to Senator Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, March 11, at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin For America forum. Cynthia Lummis, Nick Begich Re-introduce BITCOIN Act Speaking at the March 11 event, Begich said that he would introduce same-day legislation that would see the United States develop a strategic bitcoin reserve.

The war on innovation is over and the golden age of digital currency has arrived. pic.twitter.com/5GvbP0nH4y — Congressman Nick Begich (@RepNickBegich) March 11, 2025 Representatives Addison McDowell (R-NC), Pat Harrigan (R-NC), Michael Rulli (R-OH), Troy Nehls (R-TX), Dave Taylor (R-OH), and Mike Collins (R-GA) are co-sponsoring the bill . “This legislative initiative aims to ensure the United States maintains financial independence and leadership in the global digital economy,” Begich said. “This bill recognizes bitcoin’s potential to complement our gold reserves, fortify national security, and provide economic stability in an increasingly volatile financial world,” he added. What Does The BITCOIN Act Entail? Begich’s announcement comes the same day that Lummis unveiled she would reintroduce the BITCOIN Act after her initial proposal in July 2024. If passed, the bill would establish a program to purchase 1 million Bitcoin units—representing 5% of the total Bitcoin supply—create a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin vaults for government holdings, and affirm the self-custody rights of private Bitcoin holders. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Justice (R-WV), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) have signed on as co-sponsors for the Senate version of the legislation. “Bitcoin is not simply a technological opportunity, but a national imperative for America’s continued financial leadership in the 21st century,” Lummis said in a statement. “Together, we are not just adapting to the future—we are actively shaping it, writing the next chapter in America’s proud history of financial innovation and securing lasting prosperity for all our citizens,” she added. As lawmakers like Begich and Lummis push for the integration of Bitcoin into America’s financial framework, important questions emerge: How will such an unprecedented reserve affect global financial dynamics, and will other nations follow suit? The BITCOIN Act signals a major shift—not only in how the U.S. views digital assets but also how it approaches economic sovereignty in an era defined by technological innovation. Only time will tell if this move cements America’s position in the evolving digital economy or sets the stage for intense debate about government’s role in cryptocurrency . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might a Bitcoin reserve enhance the nation’s financial posture? Integrating Bitcoin into national reserves aims to diversify government assets and provide an inflation hedge, reinforcing fiscal stability while significantly enhancing the dollar’s global standing. What risks does the proposed reserve introduce for asset management? Risks center on Bitcoin’s volatility and shifting policies that may undermine long‑term reserve strategies. Robust asset management will require strict oversight and adaptable regulations to counter market moves. How does this legislation differ from prior executive measures on digital assets? Unlike past executive orders, the bill creates a permanent legal structure for Bitcoin acquisition and storage. It enshrines long‑term holding with decentralized vaults, marking a shift from temporary measures. The post Rep. Nick Begich Introduces Companion Legislation to Sen.

The event occurred in the wake of President Trump’s signing an executive order (EO) to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and the White House’s hosting its first-ever Crypto Summit . One might have expected jingoistic overtones from an event with such a title. However, many of the speakers acknowledged that Bitcoin is something that will benefit the whole world, and that, partially because of this, the U.S. should lead the way in adoption. David Zell, Director of BPI, set the tone for the event in his opening remarks. “Our goal for today is to continue this process, to help people understand how Bitcoin benefits America — and the world writ large,” he declared. Zell was followed by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time Bitcoin advocate, who made the case that it’s only natural for America to set the pace when it comes to Bitcoin adoption. “This really is freedom money,” said Senator Lummis. “And America should lead when it comes to freedom money.” Michael Saylor: Bitcoin And American Digital Supremacy Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor agreed with the Senator, making the case for why the U.S. should lead in this arena. “I’m here today to show you how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents a strategy for United States digital supremacy in the 21st century,” he began. He went on to argue in favor of bitcoin as digital property, asserting that the United States should acquire as much of it as possible so that it can “rent and finance” on top of that property. He also posited that trillions of dollars in commerce will flow over the Bitcoin network, which is another reason why the U.S. should prioritize acquiring its share of the network. Moreover, he asserted that Bitcoin embodies American values and that owning it is the next best thing to living in the U.S. “Everybody who is living in Asia, in Africa would move to the U.S. if they could,” said Saylor. “They’d move their money to the U.S. if they could. They want the currency of the U.S. They want the security of the U.S. They want the values of the U.S., but they can’t have it,” he added. “So, the second best thing they can have is to move their money into the Bitcoin network, which has all of the values, protection, and security of the U.S.” Vivek Ramaswamy: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Return Is The New High-Risk Hurdle Rate Ohio gubernatorial candidate and American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy followed Saylor, putting forward the motion that the rate of return on holding bitcoin for a decade or more is now the new high-risk hurdle rate. He set the stage for this claim by making the case that we’re moving back into an “era of scarce capital.” He shared that this will be the inverse of the past 15 years, during which the Fed printed money en masse , in a manner similar to a cocaine dealer doling out cocaine to hungry users, as he put it. He explained that institutions are going to once again have to consider the question “What is my opportunity cost of capital?” and, in doing so, they’ll have to define a hurdle rate for both low- and high-risk investments. Ramaswamy argued that the hurdle rate for low-risk investments is the 10-year U.S. Treasury, while the hurdle rate for a high-risk investment will be the rate of return on bitcoin over a 10-to-15-year period. He then closed out his talk by pointing out how the American ethos and the Bitcoin ethos overlap, and that, like the American flag, Bitcoin is a symbol of hope. “I think Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps to fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” said Ramaswamy. “And I think it makes it, in the national context, an even more fitting asset to fill our national Strategic Reserve.” Matthew Pines: The World Is Paying Attention To Bitcoin After SBR EO Matthew Pines, Executive Director of BPI, pointed out that bitcoin is beginning to take center stage in the eyes of world leaders for two reasons. The first, he claimed, is because U.S. debt markets have become increasingly fragile, prompting global leaders to start looking to invest in a global reserve asset aside from U.S. Treasuries. The second reason is that President Trump’s SBR EO clearly stated that the United States sees bitcoin as “digital gold,” and that it will only be a matter of time before other leaders view it as the same. “Last Thursday’s executive order landed on the desk of every major president, central bank [chair] and finance minister in the world,” said Pines. “There are now discussions happening about how to interpret that. What does that mean for their own country’s relationship to bitcoin? Governments don’t move too fast, but when they do, they move in size, they move in scale and they can deploy trillions of dollars in capital that can have geopolitical effects,” he added. “And I think we’re at this inflection point where the geopolitical aspects of bitcoin start to become extremely important, and can shape the next several years of Bitcoin’s future. The Bitcoin race is now on, and the ball is in our court to maintain our advantage.” Congressman Nick Begich Reintroduces The Bitcoin Act After Pines concluded his talk, he introduced Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) to the stage, where the Congressman made a major announcement . “Today, I will be announcing the Bitcoin Act of 2025 in the United States House,” said Rep. Begich. The bill, which is an updated version of the bill Sen. Lummis proposed last year , proposes that the U.S. acquire 1 million bitcoin (at no expense to taxpayers) and protects U.S. citizens’ right to self-custody to their bitcoin. “[The bill] explicitly protects the rights of individuals to own, hold and transact with bitcoin freely,” said Rep. Begich. “It recognizes self-custody as a fundamental right.” Congressman Ro Khanna: Democrats Should Support Bitcoin After a brief talk from Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at BPI, on why U.S. states should hold bitcoin in their reserves, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) made the case for why Democrats should embrace Bitcoin. “Bitcoin should be bipartisan,” said Rep. Khanna, the only Democratic politician to speak at the event. “Now, people are going to be able to get bitcoin. That is transformational for so many people around the world, and that is why the Democratic Party should be embracing this as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world,” he added. Jack Mallers: Bitcoin Is A Return To American Values After a handful of talks and panels including the likes of Casa CEO Nick Neuman , Newmarket Capital CEO Andrew Hohns and Lightspark CSO Christian Catalini, Strike CEO Jack Mallers took the stage as the final speaker of the summit. In his talk, entitled “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: The American Monetary Revolution”, Mallers made the case that the establishment of the SBR was “a return to American values — including life, liberty and property.” “The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order and the Bitcoin Act proposed by Senator Lummis is the most significant economic shift and announcement and the only positive economic announcement that’s come out of this nation’s capitol in the last 100 years,” said Mallers. He went on to say that American economic policy has been working against the principles the country was founded on and cited Executive Order 6102 (gold confiscation under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933), the Nixon Shock (President Nixon’s depegging the U.S. dollar from gold in 1971) and the 2008 bank bailouts as evidence. However, he ended on a high note. “[This is a] pivotal moment in American history and a turning point in economic policy for this country,” said Mallers. “The story of humanity is [people] engineering a better world — that’s America, that’s Bitcoin.” This post The United States Must Embrace Bitcoin Now: A Recap Of Bitcoin For America first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",NEWS|FEATURED|Bitcoin Policy|Bitcoin Policy Institute|Events|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|washington dc,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-11 22:58:28

This breakdown has pushed the market to its lowest levels since November 2024, increasing fear and uncertainty among investors. The entire crypto market has been struggling, weighed down by negative macroeconomic conditions and an overall shift in risk-off sentiment. Related Reading: Charts Reveal Cardano Holds Key Support Zone – Staying Above Could ‘Set The Next Move’ U.S. President Trump’s policies have added to the volatility and instability, as rising global trade war fears and erratic economic decisions continue to rattle investors. The U.S. stock market has dropped to its lowest point since September 2024, further fueling concerns that broader financial markets are weakening, dragging Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies down with them. According to Glassnode data, the Mayer Multiplier suggests that the next key support level for Bitcoin sits at $66,000. If the current sell-off continues, BTC could test this level in the coming weeks, marking a significant correction from its recent highs. With Bitcoin at a crucial point, traders and investors are closely watching whether BTC can stabilize and reclaim key levels or if further downside is ahead. The coming days will be critical for Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Bitcoin Struggles Below 200-Day MA Bitcoin has been in a consistent downtrend since late January, with fear dominating investor sentiment. Many now believe that the bull cycle is over, as BTC continues to set lower highs and break key support levels. With selling pressure mounting, the market remains under bearish control, and lower targets are being set by cautious investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Rally Above ATH To $128K – On-Chain Indicator Signals Potential Recovery Since the U.S. elections in November 2024, macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility have been major drivers of the market. The rise in global trade tensions, erratic economic policies, and shaken investor confidence have all contributed to Bitcoin’s extended correction. With U.S. stock markets also struggling, Bitcoin has failed to find the momentum needed for a recovery. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting that Bitcoin is now trading below the 200-day moving average, a key technical indicator that often signals long-term trend direction. According to the Mayer Multiple, the next major support level sits at $66,000. If BTC fails to stabilize above current levels, further selling pressure could send Bitcoin toward this lower support zone in the coming weeks. For Bitcoin to reverse its downward trend, bulls must reclaim the 200-day MA around $83,500. A break and hold above this level would indicate strength returning to the market and could prevent further downside. However, if BTC fails to regain momentum, fear and uncertainty will continue to drive prices lower, making the next few weeks crucial for Bitcoin’s market structure. Investors are closely watching price action as Bitcoin remains at a critical point that could define its mid-term trend. BTC Eyes $85K For Recovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $81,700 after losing the 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $83,450, a key technical level that previously supported its bullish momentum. With BTC now trading below this critical indicator, the market remains under bearish pressure, and traders are closely watching for signs of a potential reversal. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the $85,000 mark in the coming days. A strong push above this level would indicate renewed buying interest, potentially setting the stage for a recovery rally. However, if BTC fails to break above $85K, the market could see further downside pressure. Related Reading: Cardano Bulls Eye $10 Target – Analyst Reveals Key Levels To Break If BTC drops below the $80,000–$78,000 range, it will increase the likelihood of a decline toward the next major support levels at $75,000–$72,000. Such a move would reinforce bearish sentiment, delaying any chances of a meaningful recovery in the near term. The next few trading sessions will be critical, as Bitcoin remains in a vulnerable position where either a reclaim of key levels or a deeper correction is imminent.

This important achievement helps Kraken improve its services in the UK and strengthens its role in the fast-changing cryptocurrency market. Kraken to Offer More Financial Products According to the announcement , Kraken is now officially allowed to issue electronic money (e-money) in the UK. This approval will also help the company make it easier and faster for UK users to deposit and withdraw their funds. By issuing e-money, Kraken can manage users’ money directly, which reduces the need for third-party financial institutions and speeds up transaction times. Notably, the FCA’s endorsement allows Kraken to offer more financial products for the UK market. As more people adopt cryptocurrency worldwide, Kraken is now in a better position to launch new crypto-related financial services that meet the needs of its growing UK customer base. These services may include options like crypto-backed lending, payment processing, and It is worth noting that regulatory approval is important for protecting consumers. With the FCA monitoring Kraken’s activities, UK customers can feel safer about their funds and the rules the company follows. This will likely help build trust in Kraken’s services, especially for new users or those who are careful about using digital assets. Kraken Exchange Bows to MiCA Recall that Kraken announced plans to fully delist five stablecoins, including Tether’s USDT , across the European Economic Area (EEA). The exchange is trying to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) to retain its relevance in the EU region. Additionally, this decision comes as part of a broader regulatory change enforced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). As reported, Kraken will remove support for Tether USDt (USDT), PayPal USD (PYUSD), Tether EURt (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and TerraClassicUSD (UST) in Europe. However, the delisting will take place in multiple stages. The exchange also assured users that the delisting strategy is strictly for its EEA clients, spanning 30 countries, including Spain, Sweden, Austria, Portugal, and Malta. Exchanges Expands Crypto Services in the UK Like Kraken, Austrian cryptocurrency platform Bitpanda expanded its footprint in the United Kingdom in February. This expansion came after Bitpanda received regulatory approval from the FCA. With this green light, Bitpanda is set to offer UK investors access to over 500 crypto assets, marking one of the broadest selections available in the country. Furthermore, this approval is a significant milestone for Bitpanda, which had previously paused new user onboarding in the UK. The pause was due to FCA’s tightened Financial Promotions (FinProm) regime in late 2023 . Similarly, Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange secured a spot on the FCA register , permitting Coinbase to offer crypto services in the U.K. from now on, Coinbase can offer crypto and cash services to U.K. investors and traders.

41505578,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139290,1741734049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: SEC Delays VanEck’s Spot Solana ETF Approval – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-vaneck-solana-etf/,"Exciting times in the crypto world, or so we thought! Just when Solana enthusiasts were gearing up for a potential spot Solana ETF, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. The regulatory body announced a postponement on its decision regarding VanEck’s proposal for a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Let’s unpack what this significant development means for you, the crypto community, and the future of Solana ETFs. Why the SEC Postpones Decision on Solana ETF? The SEC’s move to postpone the decision isn’t entirely unexpected in the world of crypto regulation. The agency has a track record of taking its time, often citing the need for investor protection and market integrity. While the official announcement doesn’t explicitly detail the reasons for the delay, we can infer some likely factors: Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market, including Solana, is known for its price swings. The SEC may be taking extra time to assess the potential risks associated with a spot Solana ETF, especially considering past market events. Regulatory Scrutiny: Spot crypto ETFs are still relatively new territory for the SEC. Each application undergoes rigorous examination to ensure compliance with existing securities laws and to address potential manipulation and fraud risks. Custody and Security: A crucial aspect of any crypto ETF approval is the secure custody of the underlying assets. The SEC needs to be satisfied that VanEck’s proposed custody solutions for Solana are robust and secure enough to protect investors’ holdings. Precedent Setting: Approving a spot Solana ETF would set a precedent for other altcoins. The SEC is likely considering the broader implications of such a decision and its potential impact on the wider crypto ecosystem. It’s important to remember that a postponement is not a rejection. It simply means the SEC needs more time to conduct its due diligence. Think of it as a regulatory pause button rather than a stop sign. Spot Solana ETF: What Exactly Is It? For those new to the ETF world, let’s quickly break down what a spot Solana ETF is and why it’s generating so much buzz: Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF): An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. It holds a basket of assets, in this case, Solana. Spot ETF vs. Futures ETF: A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, actual SOL tokens. This is different from a futures ETF, which invests in futures contracts that predict the future price of Solana, rather than holding the asset itself. Accessibility and Convenience: A spot Solana ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Solana without directly buying and managing SOL tokens themselves. This makes investing in Solana more accessible through brokerage accounts they already use. Potential for Increased Adoption: Approval of a spot Solana ETF could significantly boost Solana’s mainstream adoption by opening the doors to institutional investors and retail investors who prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Essentially, a spot Solana ETF could be a game-changer for Solana, bringing in new capital and potentially driving up demand for SOL tokens. VanEck Solana ETF: Who is VanEck and Why Does It Matter? VanEck is a well-established global investment manager with a strong track record in ETFs, including in the digital assets space. They were among the first to launch a Bitcoin futures ETF and have been vocal advocates for crypto adoption. Their proposal for a spot Solana ETF carries weight for several reasons: Aspect Significance of VanEck Reputation and Experience VanEck’s established reputation in the ETF market lends credibility to the Solana ETF proposal. Their experience navigating regulatory processes increases the likelihood of a well-structured and compliant application. First Mover Advantage If approved, VanEck’s Solana ETF would be the first of its kind in the U.S., giving them a significant first-mover advantage in capturing market share. Commitment to Crypto VanEck’s ongoing commitment to digital assets signals their belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Solana. Their investment in developing a Solana ETF further validates Solana’s position in the market. VanEck’s involvement is a positive signal for the Solana ETF’s prospects, although SEC approval is still the ultimate hurdle. Crypto ETF Approval: A Broader Regulatory Landscape The SEC’s decision on the VanEck Solana ETF is happening within a broader context of evolving crypto regulation and ETF approvals. Here’s a look at the bigger picture: Bitcoin ETF Approval: The SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was a watershed moment for the crypto industry. It demonstrated a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto as an investment asset class. Ethereum ETF Race: Following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, the focus shifted to Ethereum ETFs. Several applications are currently under review, and the market is eagerly anticipating a decision. Altcoin ETFs on the Horizon?: With Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum ETFs gaining traction, the possibility of ETFs for other established cryptocurrencies like Solana is becoming a more realistic prospect. However, the SEC is likely to proceed cautiously and evaluate each case individually. Regulatory Uncertainty Remains: Despite progress, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a major factor in the crypto space. The SEC’s approach to crypto ETFs and digital asset regulation is still evolving, leading to delays and cautious decision-making. The journey towards broader crypto ETF adoption is a marathon, not a sprint. The SEC’s postponement on the Solana ETF underscores the ongoing regulatory hurdles and the need for patience. What Does the SEC Postpones Decision Mean for Solana Investors? So, what should Solana investors make of this news? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Expect Continued Volatility: The delay introduces uncertainty, which could lead to continued price volatility for SOL. Be prepared for potential price swings in response to regulatory news. Long-Term Perspective is Key: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Solana and its ecosystem. ETF approval is a potential catalyst, but Solana’s value proposition extends beyond just ETFs. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and SEC announcements regarding crypto ETFs. News and updates can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. Don’t Panic Sell: A postponement is not a rejection. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Consider this a temporary delay in the broader adoption narrative. Diversification is Crucial: As always, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if you are bullish on Solana. While the delay might be disappointing for some, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective and focus on the bigger picture. The crypto market is known for its resilience and innovation, and regulatory developments are part of the maturation process. Future Outlook: When Might We See a Solana ETF? Predicting the SEC’s timeline is always challenging, but we can look at historical patterns and current trends to speculate on the future outlook for a spot Solana ETF: Extended Review Period: SEC reviews can take months, sometimes even years. Expect the review period for the Solana ETF to be extended beyond the initial deadline. Further Information Requests: The SEC may issue further requests for information to VanEck, seeking more details on custody, security, market surveillance, and other aspects of the ETF proposal. Potential for Approval (Eventually): While there are no guarantees, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs suggests a potential pathway for other crypto ETFs, including Solana. The key will be addressing the SEC’s concerns and demonstrating compliance. Timeline Uncertainty: It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline, but realistically, a decision on the VanEck Solana ETF might not come until late 2024 or even into 2025. Patience will be paramount for those anticipating a spot Solana ETF. The regulatory process is deliberate and thorough, and approvals are not guaranteed. However, the direction of travel in the crypto ETF space suggests that Solana ETFs, along with other altcoin ETFs, are a matter of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. Conclusion: The Solana ETF Journey Continues The SEC’s postponement of the decision on VanEck’s spot Solana ETF is a temporary setback, not a dead end. It reflects the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and cautious approach to crypto ETFs. For Solana and the broader crypto market, this means the wait for a spot Solana ETF continues. While the delay introduces short-term uncertainty, the long-term potential of Solana and the increasing acceptance of crypto as an asset class remain powerful drivers. Investors should stay informed, maintain a long-term perspective, and prepare for continued developments in the evolving landscape of crypto regulation and ETFs. The journey to a Solana ETF may be taking longer than anticipated, but the destination remains a compelling prospect for the future of crypto investment.

This rebound is encompassing, as altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also seen their prices clear immediate resistance levels. When writing, the combined crypto market cap jumped by 4.51% in 24 hours to $2.69 trillion. With Bitcoin price leading the charge, the market may be set to recover the over $1 trillion lost thus far this year. Bitcoin Price and Altcoin Outlook Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin is up by 4.68% in 24 hours and trading for $83,014. From a low of $76,624.25 in 24 hours, BTC price rallied as high as $83,577.75 before settling at its current level. Beyond the coin’s price uptick, the trading volume has also jumped by 3%, reaching $57 billion. BTC 1D Price Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price also joined the rally, soaring 7.42% to $2.193. After dropping as low as $0.1453, its lowest in over 90 days, the Dogecoin price also jumped by 7.67% in 24 hours to $0.1669. Cardano followed a similar path, staging a recovery after ADA bears took control around the $0.76 level. The price actions of this altcoin have also been showcased in the crypto liquidation trend. With short sellers roped in, the market has now recorded over $599 million in 24 hours. Why are BTC, XRP, and ADA Prices Soaring? Despite the drawdown in the market over the past few weeks, key ecosystem catalyst have remained a constant. Earlier on March 11, Senator Cynthia Lummis re-introduced the Bitcoin Bill that will aid the delivery of President Donald Trump’s promise. Shortly before the White House Crypto Summit, the strategic Bitcoin reserve Executive Order had already been signed. However, BTC investors are just pricing in this positive shift with the introduction of the Bill. Other altcoins have also seen impressive ecosystem shifts in the past few hours. An increase in active addresses on the Ethereum network has boosted social sentiment for XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin. XRP and altcoin price growth also benefitted from their correlation with BTC. What Next for the Market? The trend in the market that has seen a massive recovery does not mean most coins have seen their prices bottom out. Market analysts are still calling for steeper corrections in the coming weeks, a trend considered normal in a bull market cycle. BitMEX co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes has called a $70,000 BTC price bottom in this cycle. However, one underlying agreement is that the market will hit a new top, which many say will be a selective rally moving forward.

Immutable X (IMX) has seen a 19.03% drop in the past seven days, with its price sinking to $0.4945 after hitting $0.5771 on March 9, 2025. Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential 300% breakout, but a new altcoin might outshine it with projected 3000% gains. Both projects are facing critical moments, and traders are on edge, waiting to see if IMX can recover or if NEAR will truly deliver on its hype. Amidst all this, a new powerhouse is emerging— Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike IMX and NEAR, which rely on market trends and speculation, Qubetics is solving a real-world problem: blockchain development complexity. With its QubeQode IDE, Qubetics makes building Web3 applications as simple as drag-and-drop, something even the biggest blockchain platforms haven’t fully mastered. And the best part? Its presale is exploding, with over $14.9 million already raised, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Qubetics: QubeQode IDE is Changing the Web3 Game Developing on blockchain has always been a nightmare for non-technical users. Most platforms require complex coding, smart contract audits, and deep knowledge of multiple blockchains. That’s where Qubetics comes in with QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment that simplifies blockchain application building. Imagine a startup that wants to launch a tokenized loyalty program without hiring an expensive blockchain developer. With QubeQode’s drag-and-drop components, they can integrate user authentication, token management, and data storage effortlessly. Or think about a gaming company looking to build a play-to-earn model—instead of coding smart contracts from scratch, they can use pre-written code snippets to integrate NFT rewards in minutes. For businesses, this means faster deployment, lower costs, and reduced risk of errors. And for individual creators, it means building Web3 applications without writing a single line of code. With QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is making blockchain accessible to everyone, which is why it’s being called one of the best crypto investments of the year. Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto Investment for Massive ROI The Qubetics presale is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about events in crypto. Every Sunday at 12 AM, the presale price increases by 10%, meaning early buyers secure the best deals. Currently, in Stage 25, $TICS is priced at $0.1074, with over 22,800 token holders and nearly 500 million tokens sold. As demand surges, those getting in now could be locking in life-changing gains in the best crypto investment of 2025. A $100 investment today gets you 930 $TICS at the current price. If $TICS climbs to $0.25 by the presale’s end, that turns into $232.50 (132.66% ROI). But that’s just the beginning. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that $100 turns into $930 (830.65% ROI). At $5, it skyrockets to $4,650 (4,553.26% ROI), and at $10, it becomes $9,300 (9,206.51% ROI). The most bullish predictions put $TICS at $15, which would turn that $100 investment into $13,950 (13,859.77% ROI). With the Qubetics presale gaining momentum and the Q2 2025 mainnet launch set to bring full functionality, this is shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments before the price jumps again. Those waiting on the sidelines might regret not locking in their tokens before the next price increase. Immutable X (IMX) Sees a Sharp Decline—What’s Next? Immutable X (IMX) has faced a rough week, dropping 19.03% over the past seven days. The token is now trading at $0.4945, down from $0.5771 on March 9, 2025. This decline has also hit its market cap, which fell 8.44% to $874.44 million, despite a 32.20% surge in 24-hour trading volume to $48.07 million. With IMX’s total supply capped at 2 billion tokens and a circulating supply of 1.76 billion, some traders see this dip as a potential buy opportunity, while others worry about continued downward momentum. If IMX can reclaim the $0.55–$0.60 range, it could signal a reversal, but failure to do so might lead to further declines. While Immutable X remains a leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs and gaming, short-term volatility is keeping traders on edge. Whether it can recover depends largely on market sentiment and upcoming ecosystem developments. NEAR Protocol: Promising Price Projections NEAR Protocol has been making waves with its focus on scalability, usability, and developer-friendly features for dApps and smart contracts. As of early 2025, NEAR is trading at $3.08, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.92 billion. Price predictions suggest that by the end of 2025, NEAR could reach a maximum price of $6.71, with an average price of $4.99. This anticipated growth is attributed to increasing adoption of NEAR’s technology, especially as decentralized applications gain traction in sectors like finance and gaming. The platform’s emphasis on improving scalability and reducing transaction costs positions it favorably in the blockchain space. Looking further ahead, projections indicate that NEAR could break the $10 barrier by 2027, driven by the expanding DeFi sector and the growing demand for scalable blockchain solutions Final Verdict: Which Crypto Has the Best Upside? Immutable X is struggling to hold its price, and Near Protocol is waiting for a breakout. But Qubetics ($TICS) is offering something neither IMX nor NEAR can match—true accessibility for blockchain development. By making Web3 application building as easy as drag-and-drop, Qubetics is removing barriers that have kept blockchain adoption limited to developers and tech experts. And with the Qubetics presale still open, there’s a limited-time opportunity to buy in before the next price increase. With over $14.9 million raised, a mainnet launch in Q2 2025, and ROI projections reaching 13,859.77%, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being called one of the best crypto investments of the year. Those looking to join this crypto presale might not want to wait much longer—before prices rise again.

Qubetics simplifies blockchain development with QubeQode IDE, making it easy for businesses and individuals to build Web3 applications without coding. How does the Qubetics presale work? The Qubetics presale price increases by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring that early participants secure the best prices before the Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Can Immutable X (IMX) and Near Protocol (NEAR) recover? IMX needs to reclaim $0.55–$0.60 to regain strength, while NEAR is positioned for a potential 300% breakout if market conditions stay favorable.

According to the analyst firm, Bitcoin remains on a downward trajectory, forming lower highs and lower lows, despite a short-term reaction at the critical $79,300 Fibonacci level (0.5 Fib). Selling pressure remains dominant, with analysts pointing to a potential bottom if key resistance levels are reclaimed. Here are the critical price levels ahead of BTC, according to the analytics firm: $87,500-$89,900: A break above this zone could signal short-term bullish momentum. $91,700 – $95,900: A stronger resistance area with significant liquidity. Only a sustainable break above this range would confirm a possible trend reversal. $79,300 (0.5 Fib): This level has held so far, but repeated tests increase the chances of a breakdown. $70,900-$72,800: If the $79,300 support fails, Bitcoin could target this lower liquidity zone that lines up with the trendline support. Related News: White House Makes Statement on Recent Market Declines According to MakroVision, Bitcoin is struggling with a downtrend and holding the $79,300 area could lead to a relief rally. However, a break above $91,700 is needed for bullish confirmation. *This is not investment advice.

However, the wait just got a bit longer. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just dropped news that has sent ripples through the crypto market: the decision on Canary Capital’s proposed spot LTC ETF has been postponed. Let’s dive into what this means, why it matters, and what could be next. What’s the Latest on the SEC and the Litecoin ETF? In a recent filing, the SEC officially announced that it needs more time to evaluate Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin ETF . This isn’t a rejection, but rather a pause – a regulatory deep breath before potentially giving the green light. The initial proposal aimed to list and trade shares of an ETF that directly holds Litecoin, offering investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to LTC without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This postponement means the SEC requires additional scrutiny before making a final verdict on this novel financial product. Why the SEC Delay on ETF Approval? The SEC’s cautious approach to crypto-related investment products is no secret. When it comes to ETF approval , particularly for spot crypto ETFs, the regulator has consistently emphasized investor protection and market integrity. Here are a few key reasons likely contributing to this delay: Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its price swings. The SEC needs to ensure that the underlying Litecoin market is robust enough to support an ETF and prevent manipulation. Regulatory Framework Evolution: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still developing. The SEC might be waiting for further clarity or establishing precedents before approving a spot Litecoin ETF . Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Litecoin assets within the ETF structure is paramount. The SEC will meticulously examine Canary Capital’s custody solutions. Market Surveillance: The SEC needs confidence in the surveillance mechanisms in place to detect and prevent fraud and manipulation in the Litecoin trading markets that would underpin the ETF. Canary Capital’s Spot Litecoin ETF Proposal: A Closer Look Canary Capital, the firm behind this LTC ETF proposal, is aiming to provide investors with a straightforward way to invest in Litecoin through a traditional exchange. Here’s what we know about their proposition: Aspect Details Type of ETF Spot Litecoin ETF – directly holds Litecoin Proposer Canary Capital Objective Provide accessible and regulated Litecoin exposure Current Status Decision postponed by the SEC The ETF, if approved, would trade on a major exchange, making it easily accessible to both institutional and retail investors. This accessibility is a key benefit, potentially opening up Litecoin investment to a wider audience who may be hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges directly. The Potential Impact of a Spot Litecoin ETF The approval of a spot Litecoin ETF could be a significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Here’s a glimpse at the potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar and regulated investment vehicle, potentially attracting substantial institutional capital into Litecoin. Enhanced Liquidity: ETF trading could boost liquidity in the Litecoin market, making it easier for larger trades to be executed without significant price slippage. Mainstream Adoption: An ETF can simplify Litecoin investment for retail investors, driving broader adoption and awareness of the cryptocurrency. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF inflows could exert upward pressure on Litecoin’s price. What Does This Delay Mean for Litecoin and Crypto Investors? While a postponement can be disappointing, it’s crucial to remember that it’s not a rejection. The SEC is conducting its due diligence, which is ultimately aimed at creating a safer and more regulated crypto investment environment. For crypto investors , this means: Continued Patience: The path to spot crypto ETFs is likely to be gradual. Delays are part of the regulatory process. Focus on Fundamentals: This postponement underscores the importance of focusing on the long-term fundamentals of crypto projects like Litecoin, rather than relying solely on ETF approvals for price appreciation. Monitoring Regulatory Developments: Keeping an eye on SEC announcements and regulatory updates will be crucial to understanding the timeline for potential ETF approvals. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto ETFs The demand for spot crypto ETFs is undeniable. While the SEC has been cautious, the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US signals a potential shift in attitude. This delay for the LTC ETF might simply be part of a phased approach, with regulators carefully assessing each asset class. The industry is closely watching to see if this postponement is a temporary setback or a sign of continued regulatory hurdles for spot crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. In conclusion, the SEC’s decision to postpone the verdict on Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF is a reminder of the ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. While the delay might temper immediate enthusiasm, it also highlights the SEC’s commitment to investor protection and market integrity. The journey towards mainstream crypto investment through ETFs continues, and while the road may have a few bumps, the direction appears to be forward. Investors should remain informed, patient, and focused on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency market.

MiCA has reportedly “opened the door for banks to start offering the custody and the sale of crypto,” the outlet wrote. CaixaBank Confirms Crypto Plans, Report Claims BBVA announced its own plans to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading services earlier this week. However, El Español claimed that a number of other major Spanish banking players, including Bankinter, Sabadell, Unicaja, and MyInvestor said they were “not working on” launching crypto-related services.

BBVA will begin offering custody and sales for BTC and ETH via its mobile application later this year. The bank has completed authorization protocols with the Spanish regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The new regulations provided companies that already offer crypto trading with a year to complete their own registration protocols. The media outlet added that the CNMV “is now working” on the applications from three other financial services operators. While the four firms’ foray into the Spanish crypto scene represents an adoption milestone, the same newspaper noted: “We are not seeing an avalanche of applications from banks. The supervisor is only currently working to process four applications.” The media outlet said it had been able to “confirm” that one of the applications was from Renta 4. The other two, however, come from “non-banking platforms,” El Español wrote. CaixaBank and Kutxabank Have Not Yet Filed Applications Spokespeople from CaixaBank and Kutxabank told the media outlet they were still “working” on plans to offer crypto trading. But the spokespeople confirmed the two banks are yet to file their CNMV applications. CaixaBank said that it was “studying the idea” of “launching cryptoasset services in Spain this year.” The CaixaBank offices in Barcelona, Spain.

It confirmed that it was “already working on” its CNMV application. By most estimations, CaixaBank is Spain’s third-largest bank.

Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of XRP and the broader crypto ETF landscape. Why the SEC’s ETF Postponement for Grayscale’s XRP Proposal? The SEC’s decision to delay the verdict on Grayscale’s XRP ETF isn’t entirely unexpected, but it certainly injects more uncertainty into the market. Regulatory bodies like the SEC often take their time to thoroughly assess new financial products, especially those in the volatile cryptocurrency space. Here’s a breakdown of potential reasons behind this ETF Postponement : Market Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrencies, including XRP, are known for their price swings. The SEC might be taking extra time to evaluate the potential risks associated with an XRP ETF, especially concerning investor protection in such a volatile market. Regulatory Clarity Still Evolving: The regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies is still under development. The SEC might be waiting for more clarity on crypto regulations before giving the green light to an XRP ETF. This cautious approach is typical when dealing with novel asset classes. Thorough Due Diligence: ETFs are complex financial instruments. The SEC needs to conduct thorough due diligence to ensure that the proposed XRP ETF meets all regulatory requirements and protects investors from potential fraud and manipulation. This process inherently takes time. Precedent Setting: Approving an XRP ETF would set a significant precedent. The SEC likely wants to carefully consider the implications of such a decision on the broader crypto market and future ETF applications. It’s crucial to remember that a postponement isn’t a rejection. It simply means the SEC requires more time to evaluate all aspects of Grayscale’s proposal. The crypto community now waits with bated breath for further updates and insights into the SEC’s deliberation process. Franklin Templeton Joins the XRP ETF Race: A Glimmer of Hope? While the SEC’s delay might seem like a setback, the entry of Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF race is a significant development that injects optimism into the situation. Franklin Templeton, a global investment management firm with trillions in assets under management, is a heavyweight player in the financial world. Their decision to file for an XRP ETF signals growing institutional interest in XRP and the potential for crypto ETFs. Here’s why Franklin Templeton’s involvement is noteworthy: Institutional Validation: A firm of Franklin Templeton’s stature entering the XRP ETF space provides substantial validation to XRP as an asset class. It demonstrates that institutional investors are taking XRP seriously and see its potential. Increased Competition: Franklin Templeton’s entry creates competition in the XRP ETF application process. This competitive landscape could potentially push the SEC to expedite its review process and ultimately lead to a more favorable outcome for XRP ETFs in general. Market Confidence Boost: Despite the SEC delay, Franklin Templeton’s move can boost market confidence in XRP. It suggests that even amidst regulatory hurdles, major financial institutions believe in the long-term prospects of XRP and crypto ETFs. Wider Investor Access: If both Grayscale and Franklin Templeton (or either of them) succeed in launching an XRP ETF, it will open up XRP investment to a wider range of investors, including those who prefer traditional investment vehicles like ETFs. Franklin Templeton’s participation could be a game-changer, potentially accelerating the path towards an approved XRP ETF despite the current regulatory delays. Decoding the Grayscale XRP ETF Proposal Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, is at the forefront of pushing for crypto ETFs. Their XRP ETF proposal is part of a broader effort to make cryptocurrency investments more accessible through regulated and familiar investment products. Understanding Grayscale’s proposal is key to grasping the significance of the SEC’s delay. Key aspects of Grayscale’s XRP ETF proposal likely include: Aspect Description Objective To provide investors with exposure to XRP through a traditional ETF structure, traded on major stock exchanges. Structure Likely a physically-backed ETF, meaning it would hold actual XRP tokens, similar to how gold ETFs hold physical gold. Custody Secure custody solutions for the underlying XRP assets, likely using institutional-grade custodians experienced in digital asset storage. Trading Shares of the ETF would be traded on stock exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of access for investors. Regulatory Compliance Designed to comply with all relevant SEC regulations and ETF listing requirements. The SEC’s scrutiny of Grayscale’s proposal, and now Franklin Templeton’s, highlights the regulatory hurdles that crypto ETFs face. However, the persistence of major players like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton signals a strong belief in the eventual approval of these products. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Opportunities in XRP ETFs The path to an approved XRP ETF is not without its challenges. The SEC’s cautious approach, coupled with the inherent volatility of the crypto market, presents significant hurdles. However, the potential benefits for investors and the crypto ecosystem are substantial. Challenges: SEC Regulatory Scrutiny: The primary challenge remains the SEC’s rigorous regulatory review process. Gaining SEC approval for any crypto ETF, especially one based on XRP, requires overcoming significant regulatory hurdles. Market Volatility: XRP’s price volatility can be a concern for regulators who prioritize investor protection. Mitigating volatility risks within an ETF structure is crucial. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of XRP assets held by the ETF is paramount. Robust security measures and trusted custodians are essential for SEC approval. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is wary of market manipulation in the crypto space. ETF proposals must demonstrate mechanisms to prevent and detect market manipulation. Opportunities: Increased Investor Access: An XRP ETF would democratize access to XRP investment, allowing retail and institutional investors to participate without directly holding XRP tokens. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on regulated exchanges, providing greater liquidity compared to directly trading XRP on crypto exchanges. Mainstream Adoption: Approval of an XRP ETF would be a major step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, signaling regulatory acceptance and fostering greater institutional involvement. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF investments could potentially lead to price appreciation for XRP. Actionable Insights: What Should XRP Investors Do Now? So, what should investors make of this situation? The SEC’s delay and Franklin Templeton’s entry create a mixed bag of signals. Here are some actionable insights for XRP investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates regarding the SEC’s decision on Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF proposals. Regulatory developments can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is key in the volatile crypto market. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and investment strategies. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are often long-term plays. Focus on the long-term potential of XRP and the broader crypto market rather than short-term price fluctuations driven by regulatory news. Understand ETF Risks: While ETFs offer convenience, they also come with risks. Understand the specific risks associated with crypto ETFs before investing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the volatility, consider using dollar-cost averaging to invest in XRP or other cryptocurrencies. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of price swings. The current situation calls for patience and informed decision-making. The journey to an XRP ETF may be taking longer than anticipated, but the underlying momentum and institutional interest remain strong. Conclusion: The Crypto ETF Saga Continues The SEC’s postponement of the decision on Grayscale’s XRP ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles that the crypto industry still faces. However, the entry of Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF arena injects a powerful dose of optimism and underscores the growing institutional appetite for crypto investment products. The road to an XRP ETF approval might be winding, but the destination – a more accessible and mainstream crypto investment landscape – remains firmly in sight.

Yann LeCun has been vocal about his dislike for the US first buddy and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. Last year, in a lengthy post on X, LeCun slammed Musk for his public positions on sensitive issues like politics, journalism, and the media. He also stated that Musk has no problem spreading “batshit-crazy conspiracy theories as long as they serve his interests.” My opinion of @elonmusk I like his cars (I own a 2015 S, and 2023 S), his rockets, his solar energy systems, and his satellite communication system. I also like his positions on open source and patents. But I very much disagree with him on a number of issues. I disagree with… — Yann LeCun (@ylecun) June 2, 2024 LeCun has also been pretty critical of Trump, going as far as calling the president a pathological liar. Now that Musk and Trump have strengthened their relationship and are essentially running the country together, LeCun is back to openly criticizing their methods and the potential damage their strategies could cause now and in the future. LeCun criticizes Trump’s policies on academia and AI research LeCun has accused the Trump administration of initiating a “witch hunt in academia.” His remarks follow several warnings from leaders in the AI industry that President Donald Trump’s policies could weaken America’s standing in the AI sector. On Monday, a coalition of AI and tech groups sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, stating that the Trump administration’s decision to make cuts to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) budget could negatively impact the US in terms of AI leadership. President Trump initially supported AI research at NIST during his first term, but his current administration is scaling back funding and public-private collaboration. In the letter sent to Lutnick, the group outlined the importance of their work to the US government and stated that they are open to working with the administration to work out a strategy that benefits both parties. “NIST’s work in AI, begun under President Trump’s first term, has proven to be a critical enabler for the U.S. government and U.S. industry to maintain AI leadership globally. As the Administration considers changes to personnel and programs to better align agencies with priorities, we encourage a strategy that leverages NIST’s leadership and expertise on standards development, voluntary frameworks, public-private sector collaboration, and international harmonization,” the letter read. The group went on to acknowledge the administration’s dedication to managing federal funds effectively and how the agency contributes to the economic growth of the US. “We recognize the need to shift priorities toward a security-focused approach that maximizes economic potential and continues to foster innovation. In this context, we emphasize that NIST’s work represents a high value investment that directly contributes to U.S. economic growth, competitiveness, and technological leadership. We caution that downsizing NIST or eliminating these initiatives will have ramifications for the ability of the American AI industry to continue to lead globally.” LeCun drew parallels between Trump’s decision to cut the NIST budget and the Cold War-era Red Scare. At that time, Qian Xuesen, a Chinese scientist was deported from the US in the 1950s and later worked to advance China’s nuclear missile program. Dan A. Kimball, the then-United States Undersecretary of the Navy, remarked that deporting Qian Xuesen was “the stupidest thing this country ever did.” In relation to this situation, LeCun is saying that Trump is making a stupid decision by stifling AI research. The effect of the Trump administration on research The Trump administration is blowing its way through federal agencies and employees, serially issuing executive orders to reduce funding and lay off employees. It announced drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health, not acknowledging that the move would effectively and abruptly cut off billions in federal funding for biomedical research. These cuts in funding have sparked significant concern among the US-based scientific community. Elon Musk’s DOGE , created for the purpose of cost cutting, has also been deployed to federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA. Trump also signed an executive order against the DEIA mandate. The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Talent Sourcing for America initiative was launched in September 2022 to position the federal government as a model of inclusion and equity. With Trump putting an end to it, many are concerned that it could threaten scientific research at universities. “The US seems set on destroying its public research funding system. Many US-based scientists are looking for a Plan B,” LeCun wrote in a post on LinkedIn . Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

CEO Arvind Krishna has weighed in on the burning question: Will AI replace programmers? His answer? Not anytime soon. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where technology evolves at warp speed, understanding the trajectory of AI and its impact on related fields like coding is crucial. Let’s dive into Krishna’s insights and what they mean for the future of tech professionals. Will AI Coding Tools Truly Replace Human Programmers? The fear of automation looms large in many industries, and software development is no exception. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, recently predicted that a staggering 90% of code could be AI-generated within a mere three to six months. However, IBM’s Arvind Krishna offers a more grounded perspective. He estimates that AI might handle around 20-30% of coding tasks, a far cry from a complete takeover. Krishna emphasizes that while AI excels at simple coding tasks, complex scenarios still demand human ingenuity and problem-solving skills. This is particularly relevant in the crypto world, where intricate smart contracts and decentralized applications require nuanced coding expertise. IBM CEO AI Insights on Global Talent and Growth Krishna’s SXSW interview wasn’t solely focused on AI. He also touched upon global trade and talent, issues that indirectly impact the tech landscape, including the cryptocurrency sector. He highlighted the importance of global collaboration for economic growth, stating, “every 10% increase in global trade leads to a 1% increase in local GDP.” This interconnectedness extends to talent acquisition. Krishna advocated for policies that encourage international talent flow into the U.S., arguing that it fosters innovation and mutual learning. In the crypto space, which is inherently global and decentralized, this perspective resonates deeply. Openness to international talent is vital for the continued growth and diversification of blockchain technology. AI Augmentation, Not Replacement: The Future of Programmers Instead of viewing AI as a job-stealing menace, Krishna positions it as a powerful tool to enhance programmer productivity. He argues that AI will augment human capabilities, allowing programmers to achieve more in less time. Think of it like this: Increased Efficiency: AI can automate repetitive coding tasks, freeing up programmers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving. Faster Development Cycles: With AI assistance, software development can become significantly faster, enabling quicker iterations and time-to-market, crucial in the fast-paced crypto industry. Improved Code Quality: AI tools can help identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities, leading to more robust and secure code, especially important for blockchain applications where security is paramount. Krishna draws parallels to the introduction of calculators and Photoshop, tools that initially sparked fears of replacing mathematicians and artists but ultimately amplified their capabilities. He believes AI will follow a similar trajectory, empowering programmers rather than rendering them obsolete. This is good news for the blockchain developer community, suggesting a future where AI assists in building even more sophisticated and innovative crypto solutions. Navigating the Challenges of AI Coding While optimistic about AI’s potential, Krishna acknowledges existing challenges, particularly around intellectual property related to AI training and outputs. These are critical considerations as AI models become more sophisticated and are trained on vast datasets. For the cryptocurrency world, where open-source principles often prevail, navigating IP issues related to AI-generated code will be an evolving discussion. Another point Krishna raises is the energy consumption of current AI models. He notes that while models like OpenAI’s o1 are energy-intensive, advancements like those from DeepSeek indicate a path towards smaller, more efficient models. This is a significant factor for the crypto community, which is increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of technology. The development of energy-efficient AI could align well with the growing focus on sustainable blockchain solutions. Quantum Computing: The Next Frontier Beyond AI Interestingly, Krishna differentiates between AI’s capabilities and those of quantum computing. He argues that while AI excels at learning from existing knowledge, quantum computing holds the key to unlocking new scientific discoveries. IBM is heavily invested in quantum computing, and Krishna sees it as the technology that will truly accelerate innovation, going beyond the limitations of current AI. For the crypto world, quantum computing poses both potential opportunities and threats, particularly in the realm of cryptography and blockchain security. Understanding its trajectory is essential for future-proofing blockchain technologies. In essence, Krishna’s message is one of measured optimism. He sees AI as a powerful tool that will transform the programming landscape but not decimate it. His insights provide a valuable counterpoint to more alarmist predictions and offer a reassuring outlook for those in the tech and cryptocurrency industries. The future of programmers, according to IBM’s CEO, is not about replacement but about evolution and collaboration with AI. Key Takeaways: AI will augment, not replace, programmers: Expect AI to become a powerful tool for developers, increasing productivity and efficiency. Focus on complex problem-solving: Human programmers will continue to be essential for intricate coding tasks and innovative solutions, especially in fields like blockchain. Global talent is crucial: Embrace international collaboration to foster innovation and growth in the tech sector, including cryptocurrency. Energy efficiency in AI is key: Advancements are being made towards more sustainable AI models, aligning with the sustainability goals of the crypto community. Quantum computing holds future potential: Keep an eye on quantum computing as a technology that could revolutionize scientific discovery and impact blockchain security. Ultimately, the future of AI and programming appears to be one of synergy, not substitution. As AI tools become more sophisticated, the role of human programmers will evolve, demanding adaptability and a willingness to leverage these powerful new capabilities. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this means exciting opportunities to build even more innovative and impactful decentralized technologies with the assistance of AI.

41507565,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139309,1741737033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent SEC Delay: Canary Capital’s Solana ETF Approval Faces Postponement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delay-solana-etf/,"In a move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a postponement on its decision regarding the proposed Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Canary Capital. This delay introduces a layer of uncertainty into the highly anticipated crypto ETF space, particularly for Solana enthusiasts and the broader digital asset investment community. Let’s delve into what this SEC ETF delay means and what could be the potential ramifications. What Does the SEC’s Solana ETF Delay Signify? The SEC’s decision to postpone the verdict on Canary Capital’s Solana ETF application isn’t entirely unexpected, but it’s undoubtedly a significant development. For those unfamiliar, an ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot crypto ETF approval , specifically for Solana, would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This is a game-changer because: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, making crypto investments available to a wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges directly. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a sense of security and compliance that some investors find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, meaning they can be bought and sold easily during market hours, providing flexibility to investors. However, the SEC’s postponement injects a dose of reality into the optimistic narrative surrounding crypto ETFs, especially those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It raises questions about the regulatory body’s comfort level with altcoins like Solana and the broader implications for future crypto ETF approval processes. Why Canary Capital’s Solana ETF is a Big Deal? Canary Capital ETF proposing a spot Solana ETF is a noteworthy event for several reasons: First Mover Advantage (Potentially): If approved, this would be the first spot Solana ETF in the U.S. market, giving Canary Capital a significant first-mover advantage. This could attract substantial investment as Solana gains more mainstream acceptance. Validation for Solana: A successful Canary Capital ETF would be a massive validation for Solana as an asset class. It signals institutional interest and growing confidence in SOL’s long-term prospects beyond just retail investment. Diversification in Crypto ETFs: Currently, the ETF market is heavily focused on Bitcoin and, increasingly, Ethereum. A Solana ETF would diversify the crypto ETF landscape, offering investors more choices and opportunities to invest in different blockchain ecosystems. The proposal itself underscores the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the desire from traditional financial players to offer regulated investment products centered around digital assets beyond the giants like Bitcoin. What’s Behind the SEC’s Hesitation on Solana ETF? While the SEC has approved Bitcoin spot ETFs and is seemingly moving towards Ethereum ETFs, the delay in the Solana ETF decision suggests ongoing scrutiny. What could be the potential reasons for this hesitation? Regulatory Uncertainty around Altcoins: The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum remains somewhat ambiguous. There are ongoing debates about whether certain cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. Solana, while a major player, falls into this category of altcoins that face greater regulatory uncertainty compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are often considered commodities. Market Volatility and Maturity of Solana: While Solana has established itself as a prominent blockchain, it’s still relatively newer and potentially more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SEC might be taking a more cautious approach to ensure the market’s maturity and resilience before approving ETFs based on assets like SOL. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators are always concerned about market manipulation. The SEC needs to be convinced that the Solana market is sufficiently robust and surveilled to prevent manipulation in an ETF product. This requires assessing the liquidity and oversight mechanisms in place for Solana trading. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of underlying Solana assets for an ETF is crucial. The SEC needs to be satisfied with the custody solutions proposed by Canary Capital and the overall security framework for holding SOL at an institutional scale. It’s important to remember that the SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Their due diligence process, while frustrating for those eager for a Solana ETF, is a necessary step to ensure responsible innovation in the financial markets. The Impact of the SEC ETF Delay on SOL Price News of the SEC ETF delay can have a noticeable impact on the SOL price impact and broader market sentiment. In the short term, such delays can lead to: Price Volatility: Disappointment surrounding the delayed approval can trigger price volatility for Solana. Some investors might sell off their SOL holdings due to the uncertainty, leading to downward pressure. Conversely, others might see this as a temporary setback and an opportunity to buy at lower prices. Market Sentiment Shift: The delay could dampen overall market sentiment towards Solana and potentially other altcoins seeking ETF approvals. It might reinforce the perception that regulatory hurdles are significant and that widespread ETF adoption for altcoins is still some time away. Reduced Institutional Investment in Short-Term: Institutional investors often wait for regulatory clarity before making significant investments. Delays in ETF approvals can postpone the influx of institutional capital into Solana and similar assets. However, it’s crucial to consider the long-term perspective. While short-term SOL price impact might be negative, the underlying fundamentals of Solana and the broader trend towards crypto adoption remain unchanged. A delay is not a rejection, and the SEC is still in the process of evaluation. What’s Next for the Solana ETF and Crypto ETF Landscape? While this SEC ETF delay is a temporary setback, it doesn’t necessarily derail the prospect of a Solana ETF in the future. Here’s what to watch for: SEC’s Revised Timeline: The SEC will likely announce a new deadline for their decision. Investors should monitor official SEC filings and announcements for updates on the revised timeline. Canary Capital’s Response: How Canary Capital responds to this delay will be crucial. They might need to provide additional information or address specific concerns raised by the SEC. Their engagement with the regulatory body will be key. Broader Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on overall regulatory developments in the crypto space. Any shifts in the SEC’s stance on crypto assets or ETF approvals will impact the future prospects of a Solana ETF. Market Evolution: The continued growth and maturation of the Solana ecosystem, including increased adoption, network upgrades, and developer activity, will strengthen the case for a Solana ETF in the long run. Conclusion: Patience is Key in the Crypto ETF Race The SEC’s postponement of the decision on the Canary Capital Solana ETF is a reminder that regulatory processes take time, especially in the nascent and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. While the delay might bring short-term disappointment and SOL price impact concerns, it’s not an outright rejection. The path to crypto ETF approval , particularly for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, is likely to be gradual and require ongoing dialogue between industry players and regulators. For investors, this situation underscores the importance of patience and a long-term perspective in crypto investments. The demand for crypto ETFs is undeniable, and the eventual approval of a Solana ETF, while delayed, remains a strong possibility. Staying informed, understanding the regulatory landscape, and focusing on the fundamental value of projects like Solana will be crucial navigating this evolving space.

President Donald Trump, who previously threatened to raise the tariffs to 50%, ultimately opted against a higher increase, offering no exemptions or waivers. “Pursuant to previous executive orders, the 25 percent steel and aluminum tariff will go into effect at midnight on March 12, with no exceptions or waivers for Canada and all of our other trading partners,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement announcing the decision. Trump first said today that he would double tariffs on Canadian metals in retaliation for Ontario's decision to impose a 25% tax on electricity exported to U.S. states. The announcement sent markets tumbling, adding to the recent volatility in North American trade sectors. Related News: Will the White House Organize a New Big Cryptocurrency Summit? Senior Official Answers But there was a breakthrough after Ontario Premier Doug Ford and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the Canadian province would suspend a planned tariff on electricity exports. The two officials are set to meet in Washington on Thursday to discuss trade relations. Following the decision, Ford said it was important to reduce tensions, saying: “In every negotiation, there comes a point where the tensions get heated and need to come down. This was the right decision.” Shortly after, Trump indicated that he was open to reconsidering the increased tariffs. Despite the temporary reprieve, trade tensions between the US and Canada remain high. *This is not investment advice.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,400 followers on the social media platform X that he believes SOL will spend the next two years in deep bear territory. While Bluntz is long-term bearish on SOL, he predicts that the altcoin will witness counter-trend rallies in the coming months but notes that the surges will likely set up Solana for an even deeper drawdown. “SOL now down 57% from the highs. Now that it’s cool to hate it again, I can share my thoughts without having to worry about getting roasted by pleb reply guys. The rise/bull market lasted 762 days, the bear, (AT MINIMUM) will likely last about 70% or so in time. Best case, this drags out to mid-2026 and in the worst case, end of 2026. This move so far is likely an A wave and at some point there will probably be a very slow drawn-out complacency shoulder up that most will mistake for a new bull market.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his analysis, which states that an asset will go through an ABC correction after completing a five-wave surge. Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SOL will end its A-wave pullback once it goes below $100. He also predicts that SOL will kick off a counter-trend B-wave rally en route to $200 by early 2026 before crashing to around $80 in 2027 for the C-wave correction. At that point, Bluntz predicts that SOL will launch a new five-wave rally that could see Solana trading above $300 in 2028. At time of writing, SOL is worth $118.10, down nearly 7% on the day. Turning the US Dollar Index (DXY), a benchmark of the value of the US dollar compared to a basket of six major currencies, Bluntz says that 2025 will be a horrible year for the dominant global reserve asset. “DXY getting absolutely murdered this week probably continues throughout the whole of 2025 in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that the DXY is now in the midst of a C-wave correction that could take the index below 100 points. At time of writing, the DXY is trading at 103.84 points.

41507978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139312,1741737687,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Stablecoin Debate: US House Committee Begins Regulatory Talks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-regulation-house-committee/,"The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with anticipation as the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has officially commenced discussions on stablecoins . This marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset landscape, signaling a deeper dive into regulatory frameworks that could shape the future of these increasingly popular digital currencies. For crypto enthusiasts and industry stakeholders alike, this development is something to watch closely. Why are Stablecoins Under the Spotlight? Stablecoins have emerged as a significant component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike their more volatile counterparts like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes them attractive for various use cases, including: Facilitating Trading: Stablecoins provide a less volatile asset for traders to move in and out of positions within the crypto market, acting as a safe haven during market fluctuations. Enabling Payments: Their price stability makes stablecoins suitable for everyday transactions and cross-border payments, offering a digital alternative to traditional currencies. DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the backbone of many Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, used for lending, borrowing, and yield farming due to their predictable value. However, the rapid growth and increasing adoption of stablecoins have also raised concerns among regulators globally. These concerns primarily revolve around: Systemic Risk: The potential for large-scale stablecoin adoption to impact the broader financial system if not properly regulated. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users are protected from potential risks associated with stablecoin issuers, including transparency and reserve management. Money Laundering and Illicit Activities: Addressing concerns about the use of stablecoins for illegal activities due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Inside the House Financial Services Committee Discussions on Crypto Regulations According to a report by Blockworks, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is not starting from scratch. Lawmakers are reportedly considering several bills, indicating a proactive approach to crafting crypto regulations . Key discussion points appear to include: Rep. Tom Emmer’s CBDC Issuance Restriction Law: This proposed law aims to limit the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The implications of a CBDC are far-reaching, and this bill suggests a cautious approach from some lawmakers, potentially favoring private sector innovation in the digital currency space. CFPB Regulations Targeting Tech Companies: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is reportedly looking at regulations targeting technology companies involved in payment apps and digital wallets. This could directly impact how stablecoins are integrated into existing payment infrastructures and consumer-facing applications. These discussions signal a multi-faceted approach to crypto regulations , encompassing both the potential of CBDCs and the existing landscape of private stablecoins and digital payment systems. The committee’s deliberations are crucial as they will likely set the stage for future legislation and regulatory clarity within the U.S. crypto market. Trump’s Stance: Stablecoin Legislation Before August Recess? Adding another layer of intrigue, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed a desire to see stablecoin legislation passed before the August recess. Speaking at the White House Crypto Summit, Trump’s comments highlight the urgency and political attention that stablecoin regulation is now receiving at the highest levels of government. This timeline, while ambitious, underscores the momentum behind establishing a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The push for swift action could be driven by various factors, including: Geopolitical Competition: The U.S. may be keen to establish itself as a leader in blockchain technology and digital asset regulation, particularly as other nations advance their own digital currency initiatives. Economic Stability: Policymakers might be aiming to mitigate potential risks associated with unregulated stablecoin growth to safeguard financial stability. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework could foster innovation and growth within the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency sectors by providing businesses with the necessary legal certainty to operate and invest. What Could These Discussions Mean for the Future of Stablecoins? The ongoing discussions by the House Financial Services Committee are not just procedural; they represent a critical juncture for the future of stablecoins and the broader crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Potential Outcome Impact on Stablecoins Clear Regulatory Framework Could foster wider adoption by institutional investors and mainstream users due to increased trust and legitimacy. May also lead to standardization and interoperability. Strict Regulations Could stifle innovation if overly burdensome, potentially pushing stablecoin activity to other jurisdictions with more lenient rules. May increase compliance costs for issuers. CBDC Development Could compete with private stablecoins, potentially reshaping the market. The extent of competition will depend on the design and accessibility of the CBDC. Consumer Protection Focus Likely to lead to enhanced transparency requirements for stablecoin issuers, potentially requiring regular audits and disclosures of reserves. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead of the Curve For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, whether as investors, developers, or businesses, staying informed about these regulatory developments is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Regulatory News: Keep a close watch on updates from the House Financial Services Committee and other regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC. Engage in Industry Discussions: Participate in industry forums and discussions to understand the potential impacts of upcoming regulations and contribute to shaping responsible regulatory frameworks. Assess Compliance Readiness: If you are involved in issuing or using stablecoins, begin assessing your compliance readiness for potential new regulations. This includes reviewing reserve management practices, KYC/AML procedures, and transparency measures. Diversify and Adapt: Be prepared to adapt your strategies based on the evolving regulatory landscape. Diversification across different types of cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols can help mitigate risks associated with regulatory changes. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Currency The U.S. House Financial Services Committee’s commencement of discussions on stablecoins is undeniably a crucial moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These deliberations will likely pave the way for significant regulatory changes that could define the trajectory of stablecoins and the broader digital currency ecosystem in the United States and potentially globally. As lawmakers grapple with balancing innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability, the crypto world watches with bated breath, anticipating the outcomes that will shape the future of finance.

41508300,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139313,1741738224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking SEC Delay: Canary Spot XRP ETF Decision Postponed – Crypto Investors Brace for Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-xrp-etf-decision/,"Just when crypto enthusiasts were holding their breath, anticipating a potential green light for another groundbreaking investment vehicle, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. In a recent filing that sent ripples through the digital asset space, the SEC announced a delay in its decision regarding the proposed Canary spot XRP ETF. This news has undoubtedly left many wondering – what does this mean for the future of XRP and the broader crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this significant development and explore its potential ramifications. What Exactly is a Spot XRP ETF and Why the Hype? Before we delve into the specifics of the SEC delay, let’s quickly recap what a spot XRP ETF is and why it’s generating so much buzz. In simple terms, a spot XRP ETF is a type of investment fund that directly holds XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the future price of an asset, a spot ETF holds the actual asset itself. This distinction is crucial because many investors, particularly institutional ones, prefer the direct exposure offered by spot ETFs. Here’s why the hype is real: Direct XRP Exposure: For investors keen on XRP, a spot ETF provides a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure without directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. This simplifies the investment process significantly. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: The approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a major catalyst for institutional adoption. Many institutions are hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties and custody concerns. An ETF listed on traditional exchanges alleviates these concerns. Market Maturation Signal: The launch of a spot crypto ETF , especially one tied to a prominent cryptocurrency like XRP, is seen as another step towards the maturation of the crypto market. It signals growing acceptance and integration with traditional financial systems. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and easy accessibility for a broad range of investors, from retail to institutional. Why the SEC Delay on the Canary Spot XRP ETF? Unpacking the Potential Reasons The burning question on everyone’s mind is: why the SEC delay ? While the official filing simply states a postponement, we can speculate on several potential reasons behind this decision. It’s important to remember that the SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Here are some likely factors contributing to the delay: Regulatory Scrutiny of XRP: XRP has had a complex relationship with the SEC, primarily due to the lawsuit filed against Ripple Labs in December 2020. Although there have been positive developments in the case, the SEC might still be exercising caution until there is complete clarity on XRP’s regulatory status. Market Volatility and Risk Assessment: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. The SEC may be taking extra time to thoroughly assess the risks associated with a spot XRP ETF, particularly in light of recent market fluctuations and concerns about investor protection. Novelty of Spot Crypto ETFs: Spot crypto ETFs are relatively new investment products, especially in the US. The SEC is likely treading carefully to establish a robust regulatory framework before approving more spot ETFs, including those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Internal Review Processes: The SEC has internal processes and timelines for reviewing complex financial products like ETFs. These processes can be lengthy and may involve multiple rounds of review and feedback, naturally leading to delays. Political and External Pressures: Regulatory bodies often operate under political and external pressures. There might be ongoing discussions and debates within the SEC or with other government agencies regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto ETFs, contributing to the delay. Impact of the SEC Delay on XRP and the Crypto Market The news of the SEC delay on the Canary spot XRP ETF has immediate and potential long-term implications for both XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Let’s examine some key impacts: Impact Area Short-Term Effects Long-Term Effects XRP Price Potential price dip due to dampened investor enthusiasm and uncertainty. Continued price volatility influenced by regulatory developments and overall market sentiment. Investor Sentiment Disappointment and frustration among XRP holders and crypto ETF hopefuls. Potential shift in investor strategies, with some becoming more cautious while others remain optimistic about eventual approval. Crypto ETF Market Slowdown in the expansion of spot crypto ETF offerings in the US. Delayed but not necessarily derailed progress towards broader acceptance of crypto ETFs as mainstream investment products. Regulatory Landscape Reinforces the cautious approach of the SEC towards crypto regulation. May prompt further dialogue and clarification on regulatory frameworks for digital assets and ETFs. While the delay is undoubtedly a setback for those anticipating a spot XRP ETF, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The SEC’s decision is not a rejection, but rather a postponement. This indicates that the application is still under consideration, and the SEC is likely seeking more time to conduct thorough due diligence. What’s Next for the Canary Spot XRP ETF and Crypto ETFs in General? So, what can we expect moving forward? Here are some key points to consider regarding the future of the Canary spot XRP ETF and the broader landscape of crypto ETFs: Continued SEC Review: The SEC will continue its review process. The timeframe for a final decision remains uncertain, but investors should monitor SEC filings and announcements for updates. Industry Engagement: ETF issuers and crypto industry players will likely engage in further dialogue with the SEC to address concerns and provide additional information to support the approval of spot crypto ETFs. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: The delay underscores the ongoing need for greater regulatory clarity in the crypto space. Industry participants and regulators need to work collaboratively to establish clear rules and guidelines that foster innovation while protecting investors. Global Developments: It’s worth noting that other jurisdictions have already approved spot crypto ETFs. The US may eventually follow suit, but the timeline remains subject to regulatory considerations. Diversification and Innovation: Despite the delay, the demand for crypto investment products is likely to persist. The industry will continue to innovate and explore various avenues to offer investors regulated and accessible exposure to digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty of Crypto ETF Approvals The SEC’s decision to delay the Canary spot XRP ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles and complexities inherent in the cryptocurrency market. While disappointing for those eager to see XRP ETFs become a reality, this delay is not necessarily a dead end. It underscores the SEC’s commitment to careful consideration and investor protection in a rapidly evolving landscape. For crypto investors, patience and vigilance remain key. The journey towards broader crypto ETF adoption may be taking longer than anticipated, but the underlying momentum and demand for these products suggest that it’s still a matter of when, not if, they will become more widely available in the US market. Stay informed, stay resilient, and continue to navigate the exciting, albeit sometimes turbulent, world of crypto investments.

His post included a tweet and a video of himself explaining how he would have had to give up running his sports, gambling, and pop-culture media company to fill such a role. Dave Portnoy wants to know Elon Musk’s secret formula Portnoy, who goes by @stoolpresidente on X, shared the post on Tuesday with claims that he had received a call that potentially offered him the opportunity to join the Commerce Department working under Secretary Howard Lutnick. Portnoy conveniently omitted details regarding the nature of the job. However, he said he was told that if he agreed to become a government employee, he would have to relinquish his role as leader of Barstool. It made him question how a person like Elon Musk, who serves as CEO of not one one, not two but a number of companies including Tesla and SpaceX, is able to juggle all his responsibilities while maintaining appearances as the leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Elon Musk poses beside President Trump after delivering his new Tesla. Source: The White House (X/Twitter) “How do you run Tesla when you’re working on DOGE 24-7?” Portnoy wanted to know in the video. “You kind of want your CEO with the eye on the ball, right?” Portnoy also stated that the White House never followed up after the initial outreach. That part did not surprise some of his followers on X. In fact, one user went as far as saying that they most probably had a rethink — most likely after realizing Portnoy has too much baggage to be in any position of government. It is not completely far-fetched for Portnoy to have gotten such an offer, after all, he has been a vocal supporter of Trump since 2020 when he interviewed him at the White House at the tail end of Trump’s first term. In fact, as far back as 2015, Portnoy was already planning to vote for Trump. “I don’t care if he’s a joke. I don’t care if he’s racist. I don’t care if he’s sexist. I don’t care about any of it. I hope he stays in the race and I hope he wins. Why? Because I love the fact that he is making other politicians squirm,” he wrote in a blog post at the time. Dave Portnoy has become a high-profile memecoin investor Dave Portnoy has courted controversy recently with his foray into the world of memecoin trading. Some of the memes he has been involved with include $Jailstool, a meme tied to his Barstool persona, which he personally endorsed and invested in; then $Trump and $Libra, which he promoted and also invested in. Portnoy sees memecoin trading as a game of risk. He attracted criticism for leveraging his fame to manipulate market movements and advertise memes to his less crypto-savvy audience, transforming them into exit liquidity at the push of a button. His involvement has led to accusations of rugs and market manipulation, with accusers claiming Portnoy typically sells his holdings after tweeting about a token. So far, he has had massive wins and incredible losses in the space and while his approach to trading is seen as chaotic, it has been a source of entertainment to his audience whom he often carries along via live.

In 2023, Dave Portnoy became the owner of Barstool again after buying it back from casino and online gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1. The sale came months after Penn Entertainment paid about $550 million to acquire 100% control of Barstool before deciding to drop the company due to regulatory hurdles. It was only after buying back the company that he realized an important fact — “we underestimated just how tough it is for myself and Barstool to operate in a regulated world.” Portnoy claimed they were denied [gambling] licenses because of his affiliation with the company and even conceded that the regulated industry [is] probably not the best place for Barstool Sports or its content. Reasons why his affiliation would cause so much harm to his company can most likely be traced to the many past allegations of racism, sexism and sexual misconduct Portnoy has been linked to over the past several years. Portnoy has publicly denied all the allegations, claiming that the encounters were consensual. That was years ago. More recent scandals involving Portnoy have not had anything to do with his Barstool business. Business owners who received offers of employment from Trump’s government Portnoy’s desire to know how Musk can juggle his roles as CEO and handle his responsibilities at DOGE is valid. When the government reaches out to a person with a post and they accept the position, they usually have to step back from their previous engagements to be able to serve fully. Musk did not have to leave his roles because he is a special government employee, not a Cabinet member. Aside from Elon Musk, four other cabinet members of Trump also have extensive roots in the business world. Howard Lutnick, who, was nominated as Secretary of Commerce is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major financial services firm; Linda McMahon who, was nominated as Secretary of Education, is the former CEO of WWE and a prominent business figure; Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury is a hedge fund manager and CEO of Key Square Group, a major investment firm while Doug Burgum the Secretary of the Interior is a former CEO of Great Plains Software which was sold to Microsoft for $1.1 billion. Lutnick has had to disclose his financial holdings and step back as CEO of Cantor after rivals highlighted how his ties to the company, which is famous for its relationship with the Chinese, could pose a conflict of interest.

Solana Has Just Seen A Breakdown Of The Realized Price According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Solana has slipped around 8% below its Realized Price. The “Realized Price” is an indicator that basically tells us about the cost basis of the average investor or address on a given network. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $2 Could Be Next If DOGE Holds This Level: Analyst When the spot price of the asset is trading above this metric, it means the holders as a whole are carrying a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator suggests the average investor is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Realized Price for Solana over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, SOL broke above its Realized Price back in 2023, putting investors into the green. Throughout 2024 and the first couple of months of this year, the price remained above the line, but recently, it seems another crossover has finally occurred. “Solana just plunged below its Realized Price for the first time in nearly 3 years,” notes Glassnode. At the current exchange rate, the price is around 8% below this metric, which means the average holder of the asset could be assumed to be 8% in the red. From the chart, it’s apparent that the last time the cryptocurrency saw this type of crossover was back in 2022. Losing the level then meant the start of a bear market. Thus, it’s possible that the latest breakdown of the line could prove to be a bad sign for the coin this time as well. Historically, the Realized Price has played the role of a boundary between bear and bull trends for not just SOL, but also other digital assets. In another X post, Glassnode has shared the data for a version of the indicator for Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency. The metric displayed in the chart is the Realized Price of the short-term holders, which only measures the average cost basis of the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Unlike the Realized Price of the entire network, this version of the indicator serves more like a boundary line for short-term momentum shifts.
