Bahrain-based ATME exchange has just turned this dream into reality with the launch of their gold-backed token . This groundbreaking move is injecting a fresh wave of innovation into the real world assets (RWA) market, promising to democratize access to precious metals and reshape how we perceive digital gold . Are you ready to dive into the future of finance? Why a Gold-Backed Token? The Power of Tokenized Gold For centuries, gold has been synonymous with wealth preservation and stability. However, physical gold comes with its own set of challenges: storage, security, transportation, and divisibility. Enter the gold-backed token – a revolutionary solution that merges the timeless appeal of gold with the cutting-edge efficiency of blockchain technology. ATME’s initiative directly addresses these pain points, offering a modern, streamlined approach to gold ownership. Key Advantages of Tokenized Gold: Accessibility: Tokenization lowers the barrier to entry for gold investment. You no longer need to buy large bars; you can own fractions of gold represented by tokens. Liquidity: Trading gold-backed tokens on exchanges like ATME offers significantly higher liquidity compared to physical gold markets. Buy and sell with ease, 24/7. Security: Blockchain’s inherent security features protect your digital gold holdings. Transactions are transparent and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud. Efficiency: Say goodbye to cumbersome paperwork and lengthy settlement times. Tokenized gold transactions are fast, efficient, and cost-effective. Portability: Carry your gold wealth digitally, without worrying about physical storage or transportation risks. ATME’s Gold-Backed Token: A Deep Dive into Tokenized Real World Assets ATME’s newly launched token is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a representation of a tangible asset – 1 kilogram of physical gold for each token. This places it firmly within the realm of tokenized real world assets (RWAs), a rapidly growing segment in the crypto space. RWAs bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain, bringing real-world value on-chain. How ATME’s Gold-Backed Token Works: 1 Token = 1 KG Gold: Each token issued by ATME is backed by 1 kilogram of physical gold, stored securely. Secondary Market Trading: Tokens can be traded on ATME’s secondary market, offering price discovery and liquidity. Redemption for Physical Gold: Token holders have the option to exchange their tokens for physical gold directly through the ATME platform. Expansion Plans: ATME isn’t stopping at gold. They plan to expand their tokenization efforts to other asset classes, further diversifying their RWA offerings. Blockchain Technology: The Backbone of Digital Gold and RWAs The magic behind digital gold and RWAs lies in blockchain technology . Blockchain provides the secure, transparent, and immutable infrastructure necessary for tokenization to thrive. It ensures the provenance and authenticity of the underlying asset, in this case, gold, and facilitates seamless transactions. Blockchain Benefits for Gold Tokenization: Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent audit trail. Immutability: Once recorded, blockchain data is virtually tamper-proof, enhancing security and trust. Decentralization: Blockchain’s decentralized nature reduces reliance on intermediaries, potentially lowering costs and increasing efficiency. Smart Contracts: Blockchain enables the use of smart contracts to automate processes like redemption and ownership transfer, streamlining operations. Benefits of Investing in Gold-Backed Tokens and Digital Gold Investing in gold-backed tokens and embracing digital gold presents a compelling proposition for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto space. Beyond the inherent advantages of tokenization, gold itself has historically served as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Combining these factors creates a potentially powerful investment vehicle. Investor Advantages: Diversification: Gold-backed tokens offer portfolio diversification, especially in volatile market conditions. Inflation Hedge: Gold has traditionally acted as a safe haven asset during inflationary periods, potentially preserving wealth. Accessibility to Gold: Tokenization democratizes gold investment, making it accessible to a wider range of investors. Potential for Appreciation: Like any asset, the value of gold and consequently, gold-backed tokens, can appreciate over time. Modern Investment: Embracing digital gold positions investors at the forefront of financial innovation. Navigating the Landscape of Tokenized Gold and Real World Assets While the future of tokenized gold and real world assets is bright, it’s crucial to approach this evolving landscape with informed awareness. Like any investment, there are factors to consider and potential challenges to navigate. Considerations for Investors: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory framework for RWAs and digital assets is still developing globally. Stay informed about relevant regulations in your jurisdiction. Platform Risk: The security and reliability of the exchange or platform issuing and managing the tokens are crucial. Research and choose reputable platforms like ATME. Market Volatility: While gold is generally considered stable, the price of gold-backed tokens can still be influenced by market fluctuations and crypto market sentiment. Custodial vs. Non-Custodial: Understand whether you are holding the tokens in a custodial wallet (managed by the platform) or a non-custodial wallet (where you control your private keys). Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any crypto asset, including gold-backed tokens. Understand the project, the platform, and the risks involved. ATME’s launch of their gold-backed token marks a significant step forward in the tokenization of real-world assets. By leveraging blockchain technology to modernize gold ownership, they are not only solving practical challenges but also paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and secure financial future. As the RWA market continues to expand, initiatives like this will be instrumental in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the exciting world of crypto.

Watch This Key Level,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-set-for-a-50-crash-watch-this-key-level/,"The Cardano (ADA) price is staging a much needed rebound after being slaughtered over the course of the last week, as the broader crypto market rebounds from lows. ADA was last changing hands around $0.7250, a more than 11% rebound from the lows it hit earlier in the day around $0.65. But that leaves the crypto still down close to 40% from the highs it hit 9 days ago when President Trump announced a crypto reserve including ADA in a tweet on X. In the end, Cardano only made it into a national US crypto stockpile, which was set up by US President Trump last Thursday. And unlike the strategic Bitcoin reserve that Trump signed into law at the same time, there are currently no plans to increase the size of the stockpile via additional Cardano purchases. Worse yet for Cardano , its co-founder and figurehead head Charles Hoskinson wasn’t invited to the White House summit on crypto last week. Charles Hoskinson confirms no White House invite for Cardano?. #Cardano #crypto pic.twitter.com/W49FbqyT49 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) March 6, 2025 The snub is a gut punch for ADA investors who had been hoping for bullish outcomes like Cardano being included in the strategic reserve (not stockpile) and for Charles Hoskinson to work his way into Trump’s inner circle as a crypto advisor that could bolster the crypto’s US adoption. That leaves the Cardano price vulnerable to a breakout to fresh multi-month lows under $0.55 in the coming weeks as the broader macro backdrop sours. How Low Could the Cardano Price Go? Bullish Cardano narratives have lost a great deal of traction over the last week and as the broader crypto market faces a difficult period, ADA could be destined for some underperformance. Rising concerns that the Trump administration is knowingly pursuing policies that will create short-term economic pain ( D.O.G.E austerity and trade wars) have battered risk appetite in recent weeks. If we are having a recession over a decline in govt spending, then the GDP wasn't real to begin with. The US govt has a $2 trillion annual budget deficit. That is basically $2 trillion of artificial GDP that is funded by more debt. Removing $2 trillion of GDP is where the… — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) March 10, 2025 US stocks have seen a substantial slide from their yearly peaks and this has weighed heavily on crypto. With things likely to worsen for the US economy in the coming weeks and months, this is a trend in financial markets that is unlikely to let up anytime soon. That means risks are tilted to the downside for major cryptos like Cardano, which are very sensitive to the market’s broader sentiment. The Cardano price is currently testing its 200DMA for the third time in just over one month, with a convincing breakout to the downside looking increasingly likely, which could then cascade into a breakout below the February lows. That could open the door to a prolonged move lower back to the late-2024 $0.27-41 range. That would mark a drop of potentially as much as 50% from current levels. Buy the Cardano Dip? Should Cardano drop back to these depressed levels, that could offer a compelling risk-reward bet for the coming years. That’s because the current macro pain weighing on the market will almost certainly be temporary. Sure, it could last for a few months or even a year. But once macro conditions improve and the liquidity flood comes, it’s likely to be off to the races for the crypto market. That’s because the narratives behind the industry and markets are just so bullish right now – accelerating global adoption, particularly of Bitcoin, but also a now very friendly regulatory environment in the USA. Cardano could easily 10x from its lows in the $0.40 area back to record highs around $4 by the end of Trump’s four-year term. However, investors would be wise not to put all their eggs in one basket, Cardano remains a highly speculative crypto owing to its lack of real world adoption and reliance on community and hype. Investors might want to consider allocating a bigger percentage of their portfolios to better-established cryptos like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana. The post Cardano Price Set for a 50% Crash?

On-Chain Signals You Need to See,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-recovery-near-on-chain-signals-you-need-to-see/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest dump has market participants speculating whether there will be more bloodshed in the coming weeks or if the asset’s value will record a significant recovery. Market analytics firm Santiment has identified some on-chain indicators that can offer insight into bitcoin’s movement in the short term. According to Santiment, several on-chain metrics signal that the market still has rocky times ahead, with turbulence triggered by macroeconomic and global concerns. However, BTC reaccumulation by whales and the increasing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) indicate that positive signs are beginning to emerge. “The Sky is Not Falling in Crypto” Since BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) of $109,000 the day before U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the cryptocurrency has been on a seven-week slump. Santiment said the fear of missing out (FOMO) did not slow down the rally, as it has often done – this was due to large BTC accumulation by whales and sharks. This accumulation continued until Trump’s inauguration in mid-January, but it began to slow down after the event and stopped in mid-February. Bitcoin’s price began to record deeper corrections when sharks and whales started taking profit. Prices have continued to plunge even after high capital BTC wallets resumed accumulation on March 3. Despite the reaccumulation, the amount of BTC moving to exchanges has been high. Santiment found that a combined 22,702 BTC (approximately 0.11% of Bitcoin’s entire supply) moved from non-exchange wallets to exchange addresses between February 20 to March 8. This is a cause for concern because the primary purpose of moving coins to exchanges is often selling. However, Santiment sees whale accumulation and exchange supply as long-term indicators, so short-term traders ought to focus more on the level of FOMO and FUD the retail crowd demonstrates daily on social media. An Incoming Bounce? Examining social media content, mentions of BTC predictions related to lower prices ($50,000 to $69,000) are currently higher than mentions for prices ranging from $100,000 to $119,000. Santiment says this is a good sign because the crypto market often moves in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. The analytics firm is rooting for the social media mentions to spam lower price predictions because it shows that they are still bearish. Another metric to consider is the average rate of gains or losses from short and long term traders. Bitcoin traders active in the last 30 days have lost 11%, while those active in the past 365 days are down 5%, suggesting that the market is not in historically negative zones yet. “Don’t be surprised if there is a bit more pain in store first, though. It’s always darkest before the dawn,” the firm added. The post Is Bitcoin’s Recovery Near?

Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of content creation and the broader implications for the generative AI landscape. Is This the Dawn of AI Fiction Writers? Sam Altman’s recent post on X (formerly Twitter) has ignited a firestorm of discussion. He showcased a sample of creative writing produced by this new OpenAI model , prompted with a request for a ‘metafictional literary short story about AI and grief’. Altman expressed genuine surprise and admiration, stating it was the ‘first time I have been really struck by something written by AI,’ particularly noting its grasp of metafiction. This isn’t just about AI generating text; it’s about AI understanding and executing nuanced literary concepts, suggesting a leap in AI’s creative capabilities. But what exactly makes this announcement so significant? Beyond Logic and Code: OpenAI has primarily focused on AI applications in logical and structured domains like math and programming. Venturing into AI creative writing signals a significant shift towards understanding and replicating human creativity, a domain long considered uniquely human. Wordsmithing Upgrade: This move suggests that OpenAI believes its latest generation of models represents a substantial improvement in natural language processing and generation, moving beyond basic essay writing to sophisticated storytelling. Industry Disruption?: While the release timeline remains uncertain, this development has profound implications for writers, publishers, and the entertainment industry. Could AI become a collaborator, a tool, or even a competitor in the realm of creative content? The Power of Generative AI in Storytelling Generative AI , in its essence, is about creating something new from existing data. In the context of writing, this means AI models learn from vast datasets of text and code to understand language patterns, styles, and narrative structures. The potential benefits of such advanced writing AI are vast and varied: Benefit Description Content Creation at Scale Imagine generating diverse and engaging content for marketing, education, or entertainment at unprecedented speed and volume. Personalized Storytelling AI could tailor stories to individual preferences, creating hyper-personalized reading experiences. Overcoming Writer’s Block Writers could use AI as a brainstorming partner, generating ideas, plot points, or even initial drafts to overcome creative hurdles. Accessibility and Inclusivity AI writing tools could empower individuals with writing difficulties or language barriers to express themselves creatively. Challenges and Considerations for AI Fiction While the prospect of sophisticated AI fiction is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and ethical considerations that come with it: Originality and Creativity: Can AI truly be original, or is it merely remixing existing human creativity? The question of AI’s capacity for genuine creative thought remains a philosophical and practical debate. Copyright and Authorship: Who owns the copyright of AI-generated content? Establishing clear legal frameworks for AI authorship is essential. Emotional Depth and Human Experience: Can AI truly capture the nuances of human emotion, experience, and the complexities of the human condition that often form the heart of compelling stories? Job Displacement Concerns: The rise of advanced writing AI raises concerns about potential job displacement for human writers and creative professionals. Examples of AI’s Creative Spark While OpenAI’s announcement is generating buzz, it’s important to remember that AI has been making inroads into creative fields for some time. We’ve seen examples of generative AI being used for: Poetry and Songwriting: AI models can generate poems and song lyrics, sometimes with surprising artistic merit. Scriptwriting: AI is being explored for generating scripts for movies, TV shows, and even video games. Interactive Narratives: AI can power dynamic and branching storylines in games and interactive fiction, creating more immersive experiences. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the AI Creative Revolution The development of powerful AI creative writing tools is not a distant future; it’s happening now. Here’s how to prepare: Embrace AI as a Tool: Instead of fearing AI as a replacement, explore its potential as a powerful tool to augment human creativity and productivity. Develop AI Literacy: Understand how OpenAI models and other AI writing tools work, their capabilities, and limitations. Focus on Human Strengths: Hone uniquely human skills like emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and nuanced storytelling that AI may struggle to replicate fully. Engage in the Ethical Conversation: Participate in discussions about the ethical implications of AI in creative fields and help shape responsible development and usage. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Storytelling OpenAI’s announcement is a clear signal that generative AI is rapidly advancing into the realm of creative arts. While the full impact of these OpenAI models on AI fiction and content creation is yet to unfold, one thing is certain: we are on the cusp of a significant shift in how stories are created and consumed. The future of writing will likely be a collaborative dance between human ingenuity and the astonishing capabilities of artificial intelligence. It’s a time of both excitement and careful consideration as we navigate this new frontier of creative expression.

Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act,https://cryptonews.com/news/rep-nick-begich-introduces-companion-legislation-to-sen-cynthia-lummis-bitcoin-act/,"Key Takeaways: The companion bill seeks to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic, long‑term reserve asset in the national financial framework. Lawmakers look to bolster economic independence by integrating digital assets into government holdings. The proposal mandates secure, decentralized storage and enshrines permanent, not temporary, asset management. It also emphasizes protecting individual self‑custody rights while driving innovation in fiscal policy. Congressman Nick Begich (R-AK) introduced companion legislation to Senator Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, March 11, at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin For America forum. Cynthia Lummis, Nick Begich Re-introduce BITCOIN Act Speaking at the March 11 event, Begich said that he would introduce same-day legislation that would see the United States develop a strategic bitcoin reserve.

The war on innovation is over and the golden age of digital currency has arrived. pic.twitter.com/5GvbP0nH4y — Congressman Nick Begich (@RepNickBegich) March 11, 2025 Representatives Addison McDowell (R-NC), Pat Harrigan (R-NC), Michael Rulli (R-OH), Troy Nehls (R-TX), Dave Taylor (R-OH), and Mike Collins (R-GA) are co-sponsoring the bill . “This legislative initiative aims to ensure the United States maintains financial independence and leadership in the global digital economy,” Begich said. “This bill recognizes bitcoin’s potential to complement our gold reserves, fortify national security, and provide economic stability in an increasingly volatile financial world,” he added. What Does The BITCOIN Act Entail? Begich’s announcement comes the same day that Lummis unveiled she would reintroduce the BITCOIN Act after her initial proposal in July 2024. If passed, the bill would establish a program to purchase 1 million Bitcoin units—representing 5% of the total Bitcoin supply—create a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin vaults for government holdings, and affirm the self-custody rights of private Bitcoin holders. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Justice (R-WV), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) have signed on as co-sponsors for the Senate version of the legislation. “Bitcoin is not simply a technological opportunity, but a national imperative for America’s continued financial leadership in the 21st century,” Lummis said in a statement. “Together, we are not just adapting to the future—we are actively shaping it, writing the next chapter in America’s proud history of financial innovation and securing lasting prosperity for all our citizens,” she added. As lawmakers like Begich and Lummis push for the integration of Bitcoin into America’s financial framework, important questions emerge: How will such an unprecedented reserve affect global financial dynamics, and will other nations follow suit? The BITCOIN Act signals a major shift—not only in how the U.S. views digital assets but also how it approaches economic sovereignty in an era defined by technological innovation. Only time will tell if this move cements America’s position in the evolving digital economy or sets the stage for intense debate about government’s role in cryptocurrency . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might a Bitcoin reserve enhance the nation’s financial posture? Integrating Bitcoin into national reserves aims to diversify government assets and provide an inflation hedge, reinforcing fiscal stability while significantly enhancing the dollar’s global standing. What risks does the proposed reserve introduce for asset management? Risks center on Bitcoin’s volatility and shifting policies that may undermine long‑term reserve strategies. Robust asset management will require strict oversight and adaptable regulations to counter market moves. How does this legislation differ from prior executive measures on digital assets? Unlike past executive orders, the bill creates a permanent legal structure for Bitcoin acquisition and storage. It enshrines long‑term holding with decentralized vaults, marking a shift from temporary measures. The post Rep. Nick Begich Introduces Companion Legislation to Sen.

The event occurred in the wake of President Trump’s signing an executive order (EO) to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and the White House’s hosting its first-ever Crypto Summit . One might have expected jingoistic overtones from an event with such a title. However, many of the speakers acknowledged that Bitcoin is something that will benefit the whole world, and that, partially because of this, the U.S. should lead the way in adoption. David Zell, Director of BPI, set the tone for the event in his opening remarks. “Our goal for today is to continue this process, to help people understand how Bitcoin benefits America — and the world writ large,” he declared. Zell was followed by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time Bitcoin advocate, who made the case that it’s only natural for America to set the pace when it comes to Bitcoin adoption. “This really is freedom money,” said Senator Lummis. “And America should lead when it comes to freedom money.” Michael Saylor: Bitcoin And American Digital Supremacy Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor agreed with the Senator, making the case for why the U.S. should lead in this arena. “I’m here today to show you how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents a strategy for United States digital supremacy in the 21st century,” he began. He went on to argue in favor of bitcoin as digital property, asserting that the United States should acquire as much of it as possible so that it can “rent and finance” on top of that property. He also posited that trillions of dollars in commerce will flow over the Bitcoin network, which is another reason why the U.S. should prioritize acquiring its share of the network. Moreover, he asserted that Bitcoin embodies American values and that owning it is the next best thing to living in the U.S. “Everybody who is living in Asia, in Africa would move to the U.S. if they could,” said Saylor. “They’d move their money to the U.S. if they could. They want the currency of the U.S. They want the security of the U.S. They want the values of the U.S., but they can’t have it,” he added. “So, the second best thing they can have is to move their money into the Bitcoin network, which has all of the values, protection, and security of the U.S.” Vivek Ramaswamy: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Return Is The New High-Risk Hurdle Rate Ohio gubernatorial candidate and American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy followed Saylor, putting forward the motion that the rate of return on holding bitcoin for a decade or more is now the new high-risk hurdle rate. He set the stage for this claim by making the case that we’re moving back into an “era of scarce capital.” He shared that this will be the inverse of the past 15 years, during which the Fed printed money en masse , in a manner similar to a cocaine dealer doling out cocaine to hungry users, as he put it. He explained that institutions are going to once again have to consider the question “What is my opportunity cost of capital?” and, in doing so, they’ll have to define a hurdle rate for both low- and high-risk investments. Ramaswamy argued that the hurdle rate for low-risk investments is the 10-year U.S. Treasury, while the hurdle rate for a high-risk investment will be the rate of return on bitcoin over a 10-to-15-year period. He then closed out his talk by pointing out how the American ethos and the Bitcoin ethos overlap, and that, like the American flag, Bitcoin is a symbol of hope. “I think Bitcoin and what it represents, more than as a financial asset, also helps to fill that hunger for a symbol, a reminder of what American greatness was all about,” said Ramaswamy. “And I think it makes it, in the national context, an even more fitting asset to fill our national Strategic Reserve.” Matthew Pines: The World Is Paying Attention To Bitcoin After SBR EO Matthew Pines, Executive Director of BPI, pointed out that bitcoin is beginning to take center stage in the eyes of world leaders for two reasons. The first, he claimed, is because U.S. debt markets have become increasingly fragile, prompting global leaders to start looking to invest in a global reserve asset aside from U.S. Treasuries. The second reason is that President Trump’s SBR EO clearly stated that the United States sees bitcoin as “digital gold,” and that it will only be a matter of time before other leaders view it as the same. “Last Thursday’s executive order landed on the desk of every major president, central bank [chair] and finance minister in the world,” said Pines. “There are now discussions happening about how to interpret that. What does that mean for their own country’s relationship to bitcoin? Governments don’t move too fast, but when they do, they move in size, they move in scale and they can deploy trillions of dollars in capital that can have geopolitical effects,” he added. “And I think we’re at this inflection point where the geopolitical aspects of bitcoin start to become extremely important, and can shape the next several years of Bitcoin’s future. The Bitcoin race is now on, and the ball is in our court to maintain our advantage.” Congressman Nick Begich Reintroduces The Bitcoin Act After Pines concluded his talk, he introduced Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) to the stage, where the Congressman made a major announcement . “Today, I will be announcing the Bitcoin Act of 2025 in the United States House,” said Rep. Begich. The bill, which is an updated version of the bill Sen. Lummis proposed last year , proposes that the U.S. acquire 1 million bitcoin (at no expense to taxpayers) and protects U.S. citizens’ right to self-custody to their bitcoin. “[The bill] explicitly protects the rights of individuals to own, hold and transact with bitcoin freely,” said Rep. Begich. “It recognizes self-custody as a fundamental right.” Congressman Ro Khanna: Democrats Should Support Bitcoin After a brief talk from Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at BPI, on why U.S. states should hold bitcoin in their reserves, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) made the case for why Democrats should embrace Bitcoin. “Bitcoin should be bipartisan,” said Rep. Khanna, the only Democratic politician to speak at the event. “Now, people are going to be able to get bitcoin. That is transformational for so many people around the world, and that is why the Democratic Party should be embracing this as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world,” he added. Jack Mallers: Bitcoin Is A Return To American Values After a handful of talks and panels including the likes of Casa CEO Nick Neuman , Newmarket Capital CEO Andrew Hohns and Lightspark CSO Christian Catalini, Strike CEO Jack Mallers took the stage as the final speaker of the summit. In his talk, entitled “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: The American Monetary Revolution”, Mallers made the case that the establishment of the SBR was “a return to American values — including life, liberty and property.” “The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order and the Bitcoin Act proposed by Senator Lummis is the most significant economic shift and announcement and the only positive economic announcement that’s come out of this nation’s capitol in the last 100 years,” said Mallers. He went on to say that American economic policy has been working against the principles the country was founded on and cited Executive Order 6102 (gold confiscation under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933), the Nixon Shock (President Nixon’s depegging the U.S. dollar from gold in 1971) and the 2008 bank bailouts as evidence. However, he ended on a high note. “[This is a] pivotal moment in American history and a turning point in economic policy for this country,” said Mallers. “The story of humanity is [people] engineering a better world — that’s America, that’s Bitcoin.” This post The United States Must Embrace Bitcoin Now: A Recap Of Bitcoin For America first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",NEWS|FEATURED|Bitcoin Policy|Bitcoin Policy Institute|Events|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|washington dc,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-03-11 22:58:28

This breakdown has pushed the market to its lowest levels since November 2024, increasing fear and uncertainty among investors. The entire crypto market has been struggling, weighed down by negative macroeconomic conditions and an overall shift in risk-off sentiment. Related Reading: Charts Reveal Cardano Holds Key Support Zone – Staying Above Could ‘Set The Next Move’ U.S. President Trump’s policies have added to the volatility and instability, as rising global trade war fears and erratic economic decisions continue to rattle investors. The U.S. stock market has dropped to its lowest point since September 2024, further fueling concerns that broader financial markets are weakening, dragging Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies down with them. According to Glassnode data, the Mayer Multiplier suggests that the next key support level for Bitcoin sits at $66,000. If the current sell-off continues, BTC could test this level in the coming weeks, marking a significant correction from its recent highs. With Bitcoin at a crucial point, traders and investors are closely watching whether BTC can stabilize and reclaim key levels or if further downside is ahead. The coming days will be critical for Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Bitcoin Struggles Below 200-Day MA Bitcoin has been in a consistent downtrend since late January, with fear dominating investor sentiment. Many now believe that the bull cycle is over, as BTC continues to set lower highs and break key support levels. With selling pressure mounting, the market remains under bearish control, and lower targets are being set by cautious investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Rally Above ATH To $128K – On-Chain Indicator Signals Potential Recovery Since the U.S. elections in November 2024, macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility have been major drivers of the market. The rise in global trade tensions, erratic economic policies, and shaken investor confidence have all contributed to Bitcoin’s extended correction. With U.S. stock markets also struggling, Bitcoin has failed to find the momentum needed for a recovery. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting that Bitcoin is now trading below the 200-day moving average, a key technical indicator that often signals long-term trend direction. According to the Mayer Multiple, the next major support level sits at $66,000. If BTC fails to stabilize above current levels, further selling pressure could send Bitcoin toward this lower support zone in the coming weeks. For Bitcoin to reverse its downward trend, bulls must reclaim the 200-day MA around $83,500. A break and hold above this level would indicate strength returning to the market and could prevent further downside. However, if BTC fails to regain momentum, fear and uncertainty will continue to drive prices lower, making the next few weeks crucial for Bitcoin’s market structure. Investors are closely watching price action as Bitcoin remains at a critical point that could define its mid-term trend. BTC Eyes $85K For Recovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $81,700 after losing the 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $83,450, a key technical level that previously supported its bullish momentum. With BTC now trading below this critical indicator, the market remains under bearish pressure, and traders are closely watching for signs of a potential reversal. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the $85,000 mark in the coming days. A strong push above this level would indicate renewed buying interest, potentially setting the stage for a recovery rally. However, if BTC fails to break above $85K, the market could see further downside pressure. Related Reading: Cardano Bulls Eye $10 Target – Analyst Reveals Key Levels To Break If BTC drops below the $80,000–$78,000 range, it will increase the likelihood of a decline toward the next major support levels at $75,000–$72,000. Such a move would reinforce bearish sentiment, delaying any chances of a meaningful recovery in the near term. The next few trading sessions will be critical, as Bitcoin remains in a vulnerable position where either a reclaim of key levels or a deeper correction is imminent.

This important achievement helps Kraken improve its services in the UK and strengthens its role in the fast-changing cryptocurrency market. Kraken to Offer More Financial Products According to the announcement , Kraken is now officially allowed to issue electronic money (e-money) in the UK. This approval will also help the company make it easier and faster for UK users to deposit and withdraw their funds. By issuing e-money, Kraken can manage users’ money directly, which reduces the need for third-party financial institutions and speeds up transaction times. Notably, the FCA’s endorsement allows Kraken to offer more financial products for the UK market. As more people adopt cryptocurrency worldwide, Kraken is now in a better position to launch new crypto-related financial services that meet the needs of its growing UK customer base. These services may include options like crypto-backed lending, payment processing, and It is worth noting that regulatory approval is important for protecting consumers. With the FCA monitoring Kraken’s activities, UK customers can feel safer about their funds and the rules the company follows. This will likely help build trust in Kraken’s services, especially for new users or those who are careful about using digital assets. Kraken Exchange Bows to MiCA Recall that Kraken announced plans to fully delist five stablecoins, including Tether’s USDT , across the European Economic Area (EEA). The exchange is trying to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) to retain its relevance in the EU region. Additionally, this decision comes as part of a broader regulatory change enforced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). As reported, Kraken will remove support for Tether USDt (USDT), PayPal USD (PYUSD), Tether EURt (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and TerraClassicUSD (UST) in Europe. However, the delisting will take place in multiple stages. The exchange also assured users that the delisting strategy is strictly for its EEA clients, spanning 30 countries, including Spain, Sweden, Austria, Portugal, and Malta. Exchanges Expands Crypto Services in the UK Like Kraken, Austrian cryptocurrency platform Bitpanda expanded its footprint in the United Kingdom in February. This expansion came after Bitpanda received regulatory approval from the FCA. With this green light, Bitpanda is set to offer UK investors access to over 500 crypto assets, marking one of the broadest selections available in the country. Furthermore, this approval is a significant milestone for Bitpanda, which had previously paused new user onboarding in the UK. The pause was due to FCA’s tightened Financial Promotions (FinProm) regime in late 2023 . Similarly, Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange secured a spot on the FCA register , permitting Coinbase to offer crypto services in the U.K. from now on, Coinbase can offer crypto and cash services to U.K. investors and traders.

41505578,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139290,1741734049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: SEC Delays VanEck’s Spot Solana ETF Approval – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-vaneck-solana-etf/,"Exciting times in the crypto world, or so we thought! Just when Solana enthusiasts were gearing up for a potential spot Solana ETF, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. The regulatory body announced a postponement on its decision regarding VanEck’s proposal for a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Let’s unpack what this significant development means for you, the crypto community, and the future of Solana ETFs. Why the SEC Postpones Decision on Solana ETF? The SEC’s move to postpone the decision isn’t entirely unexpected in the world of crypto regulation. The agency has a track record of taking its time, often citing the need for investor protection and market integrity. While the official announcement doesn’t explicitly detail the reasons for the delay, we can infer some likely factors: Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market, including Solana, is known for its price swings. The SEC may be taking extra time to assess the potential risks associated with a spot Solana ETF, especially considering past market events. Regulatory Scrutiny: Spot crypto ETFs are still relatively new territory for the SEC. Each application undergoes rigorous examination to ensure compliance with existing securities laws and to address potential manipulation and fraud risks. Custody and Security: A crucial aspect of any crypto ETF approval is the secure custody of the underlying assets. The SEC needs to be satisfied that VanEck’s proposed custody solutions for Solana are robust and secure enough to protect investors’ holdings. Precedent Setting: Approving a spot Solana ETF would set a precedent for other altcoins. The SEC is likely considering the broader implications of such a decision and its potential impact on the wider crypto ecosystem. It’s important to remember that a postponement is not a rejection. It simply means the SEC needs more time to conduct its due diligence. Think of it as a regulatory pause button rather than a stop sign. Spot Solana ETF: What Exactly Is It? For those new to the ETF world, let’s quickly break down what a spot Solana ETF is and why it’s generating so much buzz: Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF): An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. It holds a basket of assets, in this case, Solana. Spot ETF vs. Futures ETF: A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, actual SOL tokens. This is different from a futures ETF, which invests in futures contracts that predict the future price of Solana, rather than holding the asset itself. Accessibility and Convenience: A spot Solana ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Solana without directly buying and managing SOL tokens themselves. This makes investing in Solana more accessible through brokerage accounts they already use. Potential for Increased Adoption: Approval of a spot Solana ETF could significantly boost Solana’s mainstream adoption by opening the doors to institutional investors and retail investors who prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Essentially, a spot Solana ETF could be a game-changer for Solana, bringing in new capital and potentially driving up demand for SOL tokens. VanEck Solana ETF: Who is VanEck and Why Does It Matter? VanEck is a well-established global investment manager with a strong track record in ETFs, including in the digital assets space. They were among the first to launch a Bitcoin futures ETF and have been vocal advocates for crypto adoption. Their proposal for a spot Solana ETF carries weight for several reasons: Aspect Significance of VanEck Reputation and Experience VanEck’s established reputation in the ETF market lends credibility to the Solana ETF proposal. Their experience navigating regulatory processes increases the likelihood of a well-structured and compliant application. First Mover Advantage If approved, VanEck’s Solana ETF would be the first of its kind in the U.S., giving them a significant first-mover advantage in capturing market share. Commitment to Crypto VanEck’s ongoing commitment to digital assets signals their belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Solana. Their investment in developing a Solana ETF further validates Solana’s position in the market. VanEck’s involvement is a positive signal for the Solana ETF’s prospects, although SEC approval is still the ultimate hurdle. Crypto ETF Approval: A Broader Regulatory Landscape The SEC’s decision on the VanEck Solana ETF is happening within a broader context of evolving crypto regulation and ETF approvals. Here’s a look at the bigger picture: Bitcoin ETF Approval: The SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was a watershed moment for the crypto industry. It demonstrated a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto as an investment asset class. Ethereum ETF Race: Following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, the focus shifted to Ethereum ETFs. Several applications are currently under review, and the market is eagerly anticipating a decision. Altcoin ETFs on the Horizon?: With Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum ETFs gaining traction, the possibility of ETFs for other established cryptocurrencies like Solana is becoming a more realistic prospect. However, the SEC is likely to proceed cautiously and evaluate each case individually. Regulatory Uncertainty Remains: Despite progress, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a major factor in the crypto space. The SEC’s approach to crypto ETFs and digital asset regulation is still evolving, leading to delays and cautious decision-making. The journey towards broader crypto ETF adoption is a marathon, not a sprint. The SEC’s postponement on the Solana ETF underscores the ongoing regulatory hurdles and the need for patience. What Does the SEC Postpones Decision Mean for Solana Investors? So, what should Solana investors make of this news? Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Expect Continued Volatility: The delay introduces uncertainty, which could lead to continued price volatility for SOL. Be prepared for potential price swings in response to regulatory news. Long-Term Perspective is Key: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Solana and its ecosystem. ETF approval is a potential catalyst, but Solana’s value proposition extends beyond just ETFs. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and SEC announcements regarding crypto ETFs. News and updates can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. Don’t Panic Sell: A postponement is not a rejection. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Consider this a temporary delay in the broader adoption narrative. Diversification is Crucial: As always, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if you are bullish on Solana. While the delay might be disappointing for some, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective and focus on the bigger picture. The crypto market is known for its resilience and innovation, and regulatory developments are part of the maturation process. Future Outlook: When Might We See a Solana ETF? Predicting the SEC’s timeline is always challenging, but we can look at historical patterns and current trends to speculate on the future outlook for a spot Solana ETF: Extended Review Period: SEC reviews can take months, sometimes even years. Expect the review period for the Solana ETF to be extended beyond the initial deadline. Further Information Requests: The SEC may issue further requests for information to VanEck, seeking more details on custody, security, market surveillance, and other aspects of the ETF proposal. Potential for Approval (Eventually): While there are no guarantees, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs suggests a potential pathway for other crypto ETFs, including Solana. The key will be addressing the SEC’s concerns and demonstrating compliance. Timeline Uncertainty: It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline, but realistically, a decision on the VanEck Solana ETF might not come until late 2024 or even into 2025. Patience will be paramount for those anticipating a spot Solana ETF. The regulatory process is deliberate and thorough, and approvals are not guaranteed. However, the direction of travel in the crypto ETF space suggests that Solana ETFs, along with other altcoin ETFs, are a matter of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. Conclusion: The Solana ETF Journey Continues The SEC’s postponement of the decision on VanEck’s spot Solana ETF is a temporary setback, not a dead end. It reflects the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and cautious approach to crypto ETFs. For Solana and the broader crypto market, this means the wait for a spot Solana ETF continues. While the delay introduces short-term uncertainty, the long-term potential of Solana and the increasing acceptance of crypto as an asset class remain powerful drivers. Investors should stay informed, maintain a long-term perspective, and prepare for continued developments in the evolving landscape of crypto regulation and ETFs. The journey to a Solana ETF may be taking longer than anticipated, but the destination remains a compelling prospect for the future of crypto investment.

This rebound is encompassing, as altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also seen their prices clear immediate resistance levels. When writing, the combined crypto market cap jumped by 4.51% in 24 hours to $2.69 trillion. With Bitcoin price leading the charge, the market may be set to recover the over $1 trillion lost thus far this year. Bitcoin Price and Altcoin Outlook Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin is up by 4.68% in 24 hours and trading for $83,014. From a low of $76,624.25 in 24 hours, BTC price rallied as high as $83,577.75 before settling at its current level. Beyond the coin’s price uptick, the trading volume has also jumped by 3%, reaching $57 billion. BTC 1D Price Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price also joined the rally, soaring 7.42% to $2.193. After dropping as low as $0.1453, its lowest in over 90 days, the Dogecoin price also jumped by 7.67% in 24 hours to $0.1669. Cardano followed a similar path, staging a recovery after ADA bears took control around the $0.76 level. The price actions of this altcoin have also been showcased in the crypto liquidation trend. With short sellers roped in, the market has now recorded over $599 million in 24 hours. Why are BTC, XRP, and ADA Prices Soaring? Despite the drawdown in the market over the past few weeks, key ecosystem catalyst have remained a constant. Earlier on March 11, Senator Cynthia Lummis re-introduced the Bitcoin Bill that will aid the delivery of President Donald Trump’s promise. Shortly before the White House Crypto Summit, the strategic Bitcoin reserve Executive Order had already been signed. However, BTC investors are just pricing in this positive shift with the introduction of the Bill. Other altcoins have also seen impressive ecosystem shifts in the past few hours. An increase in active addresses on the Ethereum network has boosted social sentiment for XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin. XRP and altcoin price growth also benefitted from their correlation with BTC. What Next for the Market? The trend in the market that has seen a massive recovery does not mean most coins have seen their prices bottom out. Market analysts are still calling for steeper corrections in the coming weeks, a trend considered normal in a bull market cycle. BitMEX co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes has called a $70,000 BTC price bottom in this cycle. However, one underlying agreement is that the market will hit a new top, which many say will be a selective rally moving forward.

Immutable X (IMX) has seen a 19.03% drop in the past seven days, with its price sinking to $0.4945 after hitting $0.5771 on March 9, 2025. Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential 300% breakout, but a new altcoin might outshine it with projected 3000% gains. Both projects are facing critical moments, and traders are on edge, waiting to see if IMX can recover or if NEAR will truly deliver on its hype. Amidst all this, a new powerhouse is emerging— Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike IMX and NEAR, which rely on market trends and speculation, Qubetics is solving a real-world problem: blockchain development complexity. With its QubeQode IDE, Qubetics makes building Web3 applications as simple as drag-and-drop, something even the biggest blockchain platforms haven’t fully mastered. And the best part? Its presale is exploding, with over $14.9 million already raised, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Qubetics: QubeQode IDE is Changing the Web3 Game Developing on blockchain has always been a nightmare for non-technical users. Most platforms require complex coding, smart contract audits, and deep knowledge of multiple blockchains. That’s where Qubetics comes in with QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment that simplifies blockchain application building. Imagine a startup that wants to launch a tokenized loyalty program without hiring an expensive blockchain developer. With QubeQode’s drag-and-drop components, they can integrate user authentication, token management, and data storage effortlessly. Or think about a gaming company looking to build a play-to-earn model—instead of coding smart contracts from scratch, they can use pre-written code snippets to integrate NFT rewards in minutes. For businesses, this means faster deployment, lower costs, and reduced risk of errors. And for individual creators, it means building Web3 applications without writing a single line of code. With QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is making blockchain accessible to everyone, which is why it’s being called one of the best crypto investments of the year. Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto Investment for Massive ROI The Qubetics presale is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about events in crypto. Every Sunday at 12 AM, the presale price increases by 10%, meaning early buyers secure the best deals. Currently, in Stage 25, $TICS is priced at $0.1074, with over 22,800 token holders and nearly 500 million tokens sold. As demand surges, those getting in now could be locking in life-changing gains in the best crypto investment of 2025. A $100 investment today gets you 930 $TICS at the current price. If $TICS climbs to $0.25 by the presale’s end, that turns into $232.50 (132.66% ROI). But that’s just the beginning. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that $100 turns into $930 (830.65% ROI). At $5, it skyrockets to $4,650 (4,553.26% ROI), and at $10, it becomes $9,300 (9,206.51% ROI). The most bullish predictions put $TICS at $15, which would turn that $100 investment into $13,950 (13,859.77% ROI). With the Qubetics presale gaining momentum and the Q2 2025 mainnet launch set to bring full functionality, this is shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments before the price jumps again. Those waiting on the sidelines might regret not locking in their tokens before the next price increase. Immutable X (IMX) Sees a Sharp Decline—What’s Next? Immutable X (IMX) has faced a rough week, dropping 19.03% over the past seven days. The token is now trading at $0.4945, down from $0.5771 on March 9, 2025. This decline has also hit its market cap, which fell 8.44% to $874.44 million, despite a 32.20% surge in 24-hour trading volume to $48.07 million. With IMX’s total supply capped at 2 billion tokens and a circulating supply of 1.76 billion, some traders see this dip as a potential buy opportunity, while others worry about continued downward momentum. If IMX can reclaim the $0.55–$0.60 range, it could signal a reversal, but failure to do so might lead to further declines. While Immutable X remains a leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs and gaming, short-term volatility is keeping traders on edge. Whether it can recover depends largely on market sentiment and upcoming ecosystem developments. NEAR Protocol: Promising Price Projections NEAR Protocol has been making waves with its focus on scalability, usability, and developer-friendly features for dApps and smart contracts. As of early 2025, NEAR is trading at $3.08, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.92 billion. Price predictions suggest that by the end of 2025, NEAR could reach a maximum price of $6.71, with an average price of $4.99. This anticipated growth is attributed to increasing adoption of NEAR’s technology, especially as decentralized applications gain traction in sectors like finance and gaming. The platform’s emphasis on improving scalability and reducing transaction costs positions it favorably in the blockchain space. Looking further ahead, projections indicate that NEAR could break the $10 barrier by 2027, driven by the expanding DeFi sector and the growing demand for scalable blockchain solutions Final Verdict: Which Crypto Has the Best Upside? Immutable X is struggling to hold its price, and Near Protocol is waiting for a breakout. But Qubetics ($TICS) is offering something neither IMX nor NEAR can match—true accessibility for blockchain development. By making Web3 application building as easy as drag-and-drop, Qubetics is removing barriers that have kept blockchain adoption limited to developers and tech experts. And with the Qubetics presale still open, there’s a limited-time opportunity to buy in before the next price increase. With over $14.9 million raised, a mainnet launch in Q2 2025, and ROI projections reaching 13,859.77%, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being called one of the best crypto investments of the year. Those looking to join this crypto presale might not want to wait much longer—before prices rise again.

Qubetics simplifies blockchain development with QubeQode IDE, making it easy for businesses and individuals to build Web3 applications without coding. How does the Qubetics presale work? The Qubetics presale price increases by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring that early participants secure the best prices before the Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Can Immutable X (IMX) and Near Protocol (NEAR) recover? IMX needs to reclaim $0.55–$0.60 to regain strength, while NEAR is positioned for a potential 300% breakout if market conditions stay favorable.

According to the analyst firm, Bitcoin remains on a downward trajectory, forming lower highs and lower lows, despite a short-term reaction at the critical $79,300 Fibonacci level (0.5 Fib). Selling pressure remains dominant, with analysts pointing to a potential bottom if key resistance levels are reclaimed. Here are the critical price levels ahead of BTC, according to the analytics firm: $87,500-$89,900: A break above this zone could signal short-term bullish momentum. $91,700 – $95,900: A stronger resistance area with significant liquidity. Only a sustainable break above this range would confirm a possible trend reversal. $79,300 (0.5 Fib): This level has held so far, but repeated tests increase the chances of a breakdown. $70,900-$72,800: If the $79,300 support fails, Bitcoin could target this lower liquidity zone that lines up with the trendline support. Related News: White House Makes Statement on Recent Market Declines According to MakroVision, Bitcoin is struggling with a downtrend and holding the $79,300 area could lead to a relief rally. However, a break above $91,700 is needed for bullish confirmation. *This is not investment advice.

However, the wait just got a bit longer. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just dropped news that has sent ripples through the crypto market: the decision on Canary Capital’s proposed spot LTC ETF has been postponed. Let’s dive into what this means, why it matters, and what could be next. What’s the Latest on the SEC and the Litecoin ETF? In a recent filing, the SEC officially announced that it needs more time to evaluate Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin ETF . This isn’t a rejection, but rather a pause – a regulatory deep breath before potentially giving the green light. The initial proposal aimed to list and trade shares of an ETF that directly holds Litecoin, offering investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to LTC without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This postponement means the SEC requires additional scrutiny before making a final verdict on this novel financial product. Why the SEC Delay on ETF Approval? The SEC’s cautious approach to crypto-related investment products is no secret. When it comes to ETF approval , particularly for spot crypto ETFs, the regulator has consistently emphasized investor protection and market integrity. Here are a few key reasons likely contributing to this delay: Market Volatility Concerns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its price swings. The SEC needs to ensure that the underlying Litecoin market is robust enough to support an ETF and prevent manipulation. Regulatory Framework Evolution: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still developing. The SEC might be waiting for further clarity or establishing precedents before approving a spot Litecoin ETF . Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying Litecoin assets within the ETF structure is paramount. The SEC will meticulously examine Canary Capital’s custody solutions. Market Surveillance: The SEC needs confidence in the surveillance mechanisms in place to detect and prevent fraud and manipulation in the Litecoin trading markets that would underpin the ETF. Canary Capital’s Spot Litecoin ETF Proposal: A Closer Look Canary Capital, the firm behind this LTC ETF proposal, is aiming to provide investors with a straightforward way to invest in Litecoin through a traditional exchange. Here’s what we know about their proposition: Aspect Details Type of ETF Spot Litecoin ETF – directly holds Litecoin Proposer Canary Capital Objective Provide accessible and regulated Litecoin exposure Current Status Decision postponed by the SEC The ETF, if approved, would trade on a major exchange, making it easily accessible to both institutional and retail investors. This accessibility is a key benefit, potentially opening up Litecoin investment to a wider audience who may be hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges directly. The Potential Impact of a Spot Litecoin ETF The approval of a spot Litecoin ETF could be a significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Here’s a glimpse at the potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar and regulated investment vehicle, potentially attracting substantial institutional capital into Litecoin. Enhanced Liquidity: ETF trading could boost liquidity in the Litecoin market, making it easier for larger trades to be executed without significant price slippage. Mainstream Adoption: An ETF can simplify Litecoin investment for retail investors, driving broader adoption and awareness of the cryptocurrency. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF inflows could exert upward pressure on Litecoin’s price. What Does This Delay Mean for Litecoin and Crypto Investors? While a postponement can be disappointing, it’s crucial to remember that it’s not a rejection. The SEC is conducting its due diligence, which is ultimately aimed at creating a safer and more regulated crypto investment environment. For crypto investors , this means: Continued Patience: The path to spot crypto ETFs is likely to be gradual. Delays are part of the regulatory process. Focus on Fundamentals: This postponement underscores the importance of focusing on the long-term fundamentals of crypto projects like Litecoin, rather than relying solely on ETF approvals for price appreciation. Monitoring Regulatory Developments: Keeping an eye on SEC announcements and regulatory updates will be crucial to understanding the timeline for potential ETF approvals. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto ETFs The demand for spot crypto ETFs is undeniable. While the SEC has been cautious, the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US signals a potential shift in attitude. This delay for the LTC ETF might simply be part of a phased approach, with regulators carefully assessing each asset class. The industry is closely watching to see if this postponement is a temporary setback or a sign of continued regulatory hurdles for spot crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. In conclusion, the SEC’s decision to postpone the verdict on Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF is a reminder of the ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. While the delay might temper immediate enthusiasm, it also highlights the SEC’s commitment to investor protection and market integrity. The journey towards mainstream crypto investment through ETFs continues, and while the road may have a few bumps, the direction appears to be forward. Investors should remain informed, patient, and focused on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency market.

MiCA has reportedly “opened the door for banks to start offering the custody and the sale of crypto,” the outlet wrote. CaixaBank Confirms Crypto Plans, Report Claims BBVA announced its own plans to launch Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading services earlier this week. However, El Español claimed that a number of other major Spanish banking players, including Bankinter, Sabadell, Unicaja, and MyInvestor said they were “not working on” launching crypto-related services.

BBVA will begin offering custody and sales for BTC and ETH via its mobile application later this year. The bank has completed authorization protocols with the Spanish regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The new regulations provided companies that already offer crypto trading with a year to complete their own registration protocols. The media outlet added that the CNMV “is now working” on the applications from three other financial services operators. While the four firms’ foray into the Spanish crypto scene represents an adoption milestone, the same newspaper noted: “We are not seeing an avalanche of applications from banks. The supervisor is only currently working to process four applications.” The media outlet said it had been able to “confirm” that one of the applications was from Renta 4. The other two, however, come from “non-banking platforms,” El Español wrote. CaixaBank and Kutxabank Have Not Yet Filed Applications Spokespeople from CaixaBank and Kutxabank told the media outlet they were still “working” on plans to offer crypto trading. But the spokespeople confirmed the two banks are yet to file their CNMV applications. CaixaBank said that it was “studying the idea” of “launching cryptoasset services in Spain this year.” The CaixaBank offices in Barcelona, Spain.

It confirmed that it was “already working on” its CNMV application. By most estimations, CaixaBank is Spain’s third-largest bank.

Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of XRP and the broader crypto ETF landscape. Why the SEC’s ETF Postponement for Grayscale’s XRP Proposal? The SEC’s decision to delay the verdict on Grayscale’s XRP ETF isn’t entirely unexpected, but it certainly injects more uncertainty into the market. Regulatory bodies like the SEC often take their time to thoroughly assess new financial products, especially those in the volatile cryptocurrency space. Here’s a breakdown of potential reasons behind this ETF Postponement : Market Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrencies, including XRP, are known for their price swings. The SEC might be taking extra time to evaluate the potential risks associated with an XRP ETF, especially concerning investor protection in such a volatile market. Regulatory Clarity Still Evolving: The regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies is still under development. The SEC might be waiting for more clarity on crypto regulations before giving the green light to an XRP ETF. This cautious approach is typical when dealing with novel asset classes. Thorough Due Diligence: ETFs are complex financial instruments. The SEC needs to conduct thorough due diligence to ensure that the proposed XRP ETF meets all regulatory requirements and protects investors from potential fraud and manipulation. This process inherently takes time. Precedent Setting: Approving an XRP ETF would set a significant precedent. The SEC likely wants to carefully consider the implications of such a decision on the broader crypto market and future ETF applications. It’s crucial to remember that a postponement isn’t a rejection. It simply means the SEC requires more time to evaluate all aspects of Grayscale’s proposal. The crypto community now waits with bated breath for further updates and insights into the SEC’s deliberation process. Franklin Templeton Joins the XRP ETF Race: A Glimmer of Hope? While the SEC’s delay might seem like a setback, the entry of Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF race is a significant development that injects optimism into the situation. Franklin Templeton, a global investment management firm with trillions in assets under management, is a heavyweight player in the financial world. Their decision to file for an XRP ETF signals growing institutional interest in XRP and the potential for crypto ETFs. Here’s why Franklin Templeton’s involvement is noteworthy: Institutional Validation: A firm of Franklin Templeton’s stature entering the XRP ETF space provides substantial validation to XRP as an asset class. It demonstrates that institutional investors are taking XRP seriously and see its potential. Increased Competition: Franklin Templeton’s entry creates competition in the XRP ETF application process. This competitive landscape could potentially push the SEC to expedite its review process and ultimately lead to a more favorable outcome for XRP ETFs in general. Market Confidence Boost: Despite the SEC delay, Franklin Templeton’s move can boost market confidence in XRP. It suggests that even amidst regulatory hurdles, major financial institutions believe in the long-term prospects of XRP and crypto ETFs. Wider Investor Access: If both Grayscale and Franklin Templeton (or either of them) succeed in launching an XRP ETF, it will open up XRP investment to a wider range of investors, including those who prefer traditional investment vehicles like ETFs. Franklin Templeton’s participation could be a game-changer, potentially accelerating the path towards an approved XRP ETF despite the current regulatory delays. Decoding the Grayscale XRP ETF Proposal Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, is at the forefront of pushing for crypto ETFs. Their XRP ETF proposal is part of a broader effort to make cryptocurrency investments more accessible through regulated and familiar investment products. Understanding Grayscale’s proposal is key to grasping the significance of the SEC’s delay. Key aspects of Grayscale’s XRP ETF proposal likely include: Aspect Description Objective To provide investors with exposure to XRP through a traditional ETF structure, traded on major stock exchanges. Structure Likely a physically-backed ETF, meaning it would hold actual XRP tokens, similar to how gold ETFs hold physical gold. Custody Secure custody solutions for the underlying XRP assets, likely using institutional-grade custodians experienced in digital asset storage. Trading Shares of the ETF would be traded on stock exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of access for investors. Regulatory Compliance Designed to comply with all relevant SEC regulations and ETF listing requirements. The SEC’s scrutiny of Grayscale’s proposal, and now Franklin Templeton’s, highlights the regulatory hurdles that crypto ETFs face. However, the persistence of major players like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton signals a strong belief in the eventual approval of these products. Navigating the Challenges and Seizing the Opportunities in XRP ETFs The path to an approved XRP ETF is not without its challenges. The SEC’s cautious approach, coupled with the inherent volatility of the crypto market, presents significant hurdles. However, the potential benefits for investors and the crypto ecosystem are substantial. Challenges: SEC Regulatory Scrutiny: The primary challenge remains the SEC’s rigorous regulatory review process. Gaining SEC approval for any crypto ETF, especially one based on XRP, requires overcoming significant regulatory hurdles. Market Volatility: XRP’s price volatility can be a concern for regulators who prioritize investor protection. Mitigating volatility risks within an ETF structure is crucial. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of XRP assets held by the ETF is paramount. Robust security measures and trusted custodians are essential for SEC approval. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC is wary of market manipulation in the crypto space. ETF proposals must demonstrate mechanisms to prevent and detect market manipulation. Opportunities: Increased Investor Access: An XRP ETF would democratize access to XRP investment, allowing retail and institutional investors to participate without directly holding XRP tokens. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs are traded on regulated exchanges, providing greater liquidity compared to directly trading XRP on crypto exchanges. Mainstream Adoption: Approval of an XRP ETF would be a major step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, signaling regulatory acceptance and fostering greater institutional involvement. Price Appreciation Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF investments could potentially lead to price appreciation for XRP. Actionable Insights: What Should XRP Investors Do Now? So, what should investors make of this situation? The SEC’s delay and Franklin Templeton’s entry create a mixed bag of signals. Here are some actionable insights for XRP investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates regarding the SEC’s decision on Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF proposals. Regulatory developments can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is key in the volatile crypto market. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and investment strategies. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are often long-term plays. Focus on the long-term potential of XRP and the broader crypto market rather than short-term price fluctuations driven by regulatory news. Understand ETF Risks: While ETFs offer convenience, they also come with risks. Understand the specific risks associated with crypto ETFs before investing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the volatility, consider using dollar-cost averaging to invest in XRP or other cryptocurrencies. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of price swings. The current situation calls for patience and informed decision-making. The journey to an XRP ETF may be taking longer than anticipated, but the underlying momentum and institutional interest remain strong. Conclusion: The Crypto ETF Saga Continues The SEC’s postponement of the decision on Grayscale’s XRP ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles that the crypto industry still faces. However, the entry of Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF arena injects a powerful dose of optimism and underscores the growing institutional appetite for crypto investment products. The road to an XRP ETF approval might be winding, but the destination – a more accessible and mainstream crypto investment landscape – remains firmly in sight.

Yann LeCun has been vocal about his dislike for the US first buddy and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. Last year, in a lengthy post on X, LeCun slammed Musk for his public positions on sensitive issues like politics, journalism, and the media. He also stated that Musk has no problem spreading “batshit-crazy conspiracy theories as long as they serve his interests.” My opinion of @elonmusk I like his cars (I own a 2015 S, and 2023 S), his rockets, his solar energy systems, and his satellite communication system. I also like his positions on open source and patents. But I very much disagree with him on a number of issues. I disagree with… — Yann LeCun (@ylecun) June 2, 2024 LeCun has also been pretty critical of Trump, going as far as calling the president a pathological liar. Now that Musk and Trump have strengthened their relationship and are essentially running the country together, LeCun is back to openly criticizing their methods and the potential damage their strategies could cause now and in the future. LeCun criticizes Trump’s policies on academia and AI research LeCun has accused the Trump administration of initiating a “witch hunt in academia.” His remarks follow several warnings from leaders in the AI industry that President Donald Trump’s policies could weaken America’s standing in the AI sector. On Monday, a coalition of AI and tech groups sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, stating that the Trump administration’s decision to make cuts to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) budget could negatively impact the US in terms of AI leadership. President Trump initially supported AI research at NIST during his first term, but his current administration is scaling back funding and public-private collaboration. In the letter sent to Lutnick, the group outlined the importance of their work to the US government and stated that they are open to working with the administration to work out a strategy that benefits both parties. “NIST’s work in AI, begun under President Trump’s first term, has proven to be a critical enabler for the U.S. government and U.S. industry to maintain AI leadership globally. As the Administration considers changes to personnel and programs to better align agencies with priorities, we encourage a strategy that leverages NIST’s leadership and expertise on standards development, voluntary frameworks, public-private sector collaboration, and international harmonization,” the letter read. The group went on to acknowledge the administration’s dedication to managing federal funds effectively and how the agency contributes to the economic growth of the US. “We recognize the need to shift priorities toward a security-focused approach that maximizes economic potential and continues to foster innovation. In this context, we emphasize that NIST’s work represents a high value investment that directly contributes to U.S. economic growth, competitiveness, and technological leadership. We caution that downsizing NIST or eliminating these initiatives will have ramifications for the ability of the American AI industry to continue to lead globally.” LeCun drew parallels between Trump’s decision to cut the NIST budget and the Cold War-era Red Scare. At that time, Qian Xuesen, a Chinese scientist was deported from the US in the 1950s and later worked to advance China’s nuclear missile program. Dan A. Kimball, the then-United States Undersecretary of the Navy, remarked that deporting Qian Xuesen was “the stupidest thing this country ever did.” In relation to this situation, LeCun is saying that Trump is making a stupid decision by stifling AI research. The effect of the Trump administration on research The Trump administration is blowing its way through federal agencies and employees, serially issuing executive orders to reduce funding and lay off employees. It announced drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health, not acknowledging that the move would effectively and abruptly cut off billions in federal funding for biomedical research. These cuts in funding have sparked significant concern among the US-based scientific community. Elon Musk’s DOGE , created for the purpose of cost cutting, has also been deployed to federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA. Trump also signed an executive order against the DEIA mandate. The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Talent Sourcing for America initiative was launched in September 2022 to position the federal government as a model of inclusion and equity. With Trump putting an end to it, many are concerned that it could threaten scientific research at universities. “The US seems set on destroying its public research funding system. Many US-based scientists are looking for a Plan B,” LeCun wrote in a post on LinkedIn . Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

CEO Arvind Krishna has weighed in on the burning question: Will AI replace programmers? His answer? Not anytime soon. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where technology evolves at warp speed, understanding the trajectory of AI and its impact on related fields like coding is crucial. Let’s dive into Krishna’s insights and what they mean for the future of tech professionals. Will AI Coding Tools Truly Replace Human Programmers? The fear of automation looms large in many industries, and software development is no exception. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, recently predicted that a staggering 90% of code could be AI-generated within a mere three to six months. However, IBM’s Arvind Krishna offers a more grounded perspective. He estimates that AI might handle around 20-30% of coding tasks, a far cry from a complete takeover. Krishna emphasizes that while AI excels at simple coding tasks, complex scenarios still demand human ingenuity and problem-solving skills. This is particularly relevant in the crypto world, where intricate smart contracts and decentralized applications require nuanced coding expertise. IBM CEO AI Insights on Global Talent and Growth Krishna’s SXSW interview wasn’t solely focused on AI. He also touched upon global trade and talent, issues that indirectly impact the tech landscape, including the cryptocurrency sector. He highlighted the importance of global collaboration for economic growth, stating, “every 10% increase in global trade leads to a 1% increase in local GDP.” This interconnectedness extends to talent acquisition. Krishna advocated for policies that encourage international talent flow into the U.S., arguing that it fosters innovation and mutual learning. In the crypto space, which is inherently global and decentralized, this perspective resonates deeply. Openness to international talent is vital for the continued growth and diversification of blockchain technology. AI Augmentation, Not Replacement: The Future of Programmers Instead of viewing AI as a job-stealing menace, Krishna positions it as a powerful tool to enhance programmer productivity. He argues that AI will augment human capabilities, allowing programmers to achieve more in less time. Think of it like this: Increased Efficiency: AI can automate repetitive coding tasks, freeing up programmers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving. Faster Development Cycles: With AI assistance, software development can become significantly faster, enabling quicker iterations and time-to-market, crucial in the fast-paced crypto industry. Improved Code Quality: AI tools can help identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities, leading to more robust and secure code, especially important for blockchain applications where security is paramount. Krishna draws parallels to the introduction of calculators and Photoshop, tools that initially sparked fears of replacing mathematicians and artists but ultimately amplified their capabilities. He believes AI will follow a similar trajectory, empowering programmers rather than rendering them obsolete. This is good news for the blockchain developer community, suggesting a future where AI assists in building even more sophisticated and innovative crypto solutions. Navigating the Challenges of AI Coding While optimistic about AI’s potential, Krishna acknowledges existing challenges, particularly around intellectual property related to AI training and outputs. These are critical considerations as AI models become more sophisticated and are trained on vast datasets. For the cryptocurrency world, where open-source principles often prevail, navigating IP issues related to AI-generated code will be an evolving discussion. Another point Krishna raises is the energy consumption of current AI models. He notes that while models like OpenAI’s o1 are energy-intensive, advancements like those from DeepSeek indicate a path towards smaller, more efficient models. This is a significant factor for the crypto community, which is increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of technology. The development of energy-efficient AI could align well with the growing focus on sustainable blockchain solutions. Quantum Computing: The Next Frontier Beyond AI Interestingly, Krishna differentiates between AI’s capabilities and those of quantum computing. He argues that while AI excels at learning from existing knowledge, quantum computing holds the key to unlocking new scientific discoveries. IBM is heavily invested in quantum computing, and Krishna sees it as the technology that will truly accelerate innovation, going beyond the limitations of current AI. For the crypto world, quantum computing poses both potential opportunities and threats, particularly in the realm of cryptography and blockchain security. Understanding its trajectory is essential for future-proofing blockchain technologies. In essence, Krishna’s message is one of measured optimism. He sees AI as a powerful tool that will transform the programming landscape but not decimate it. His insights provide a valuable counterpoint to more alarmist predictions and offer a reassuring outlook for those in the tech and cryptocurrency industries. The future of programmers, according to IBM’s CEO, is not about replacement but about evolution and collaboration with AI. Key Takeaways: AI will augment, not replace, programmers: Expect AI to become a powerful tool for developers, increasing productivity and efficiency. Focus on complex problem-solving: Human programmers will continue to be essential for intricate coding tasks and innovative solutions, especially in fields like blockchain. Global talent is crucial: Embrace international collaboration to foster innovation and growth in the tech sector, including cryptocurrency. Energy efficiency in AI is key: Advancements are being made towards more sustainable AI models, aligning with the sustainability goals of the crypto community. Quantum computing holds future potential: Keep an eye on quantum computing as a technology that could revolutionize scientific discovery and impact blockchain security. Ultimately, the future of AI and programming appears to be one of synergy, not substitution. As AI tools become more sophisticated, the role of human programmers will evolve, demanding adaptability and a willingness to leverage these powerful new capabilities. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this means exciting opportunities to build even more innovative and impactful decentralized technologies with the assistance of AI.

41507565,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139309,1741737033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent SEC Delay: Canary Capital’s Solana ETF Approval Faces Postponement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delay-solana-etf/,"In a move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a postponement on its decision regarding the proposed Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Canary Capital. This delay introduces a layer of uncertainty into the highly anticipated crypto ETF space, particularly for Solana enthusiasts and the broader digital asset investment community. Let’s delve into what this SEC ETF delay means and what could be the potential ramifications. What Does the SEC’s Solana ETF Delay Signify? The SEC’s decision to postpone the verdict on Canary Capital’s Solana ETF application isn’t entirely unexpected, but it’s undoubtedly a significant development. For those unfamiliar, an ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot crypto ETF approval , specifically for Solana, would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This is a game-changer because: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, making crypto investments available to a wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges directly. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a sense of security and compliance that some investors find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto space. Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, meaning they can be bought and sold easily during market hours, providing flexibility to investors. However, the SEC’s postponement injects a dose of reality into the optimistic narrative surrounding crypto ETFs, especially those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It raises questions about the regulatory body’s comfort level with altcoins like Solana and the broader implications for future crypto ETF approval processes. Why Canary Capital’s Solana ETF is a Big Deal? Canary Capital ETF proposing a spot Solana ETF is a noteworthy event for several reasons: First Mover Advantage (Potentially): If approved, this would be the first spot Solana ETF in the U.S. market, giving Canary Capital a significant first-mover advantage. This could attract substantial investment as Solana gains more mainstream acceptance. Validation for Solana: A successful Canary Capital ETF would be a massive validation for Solana as an asset class. It signals institutional interest and growing confidence in SOL’s long-term prospects beyond just retail investment. Diversification in Crypto ETFs: Currently, the ETF market is heavily focused on Bitcoin and, increasingly, Ethereum. A Solana ETF would diversify the crypto ETF landscape, offering investors more choices and opportunities to invest in different blockchain ecosystems. The proposal itself underscores the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the desire from traditional financial players to offer regulated investment products centered around digital assets beyond the giants like Bitcoin. What’s Behind the SEC’s Hesitation on Solana ETF? While the SEC has approved Bitcoin spot ETFs and is seemingly moving towards Ethereum ETFs, the delay in the Solana ETF decision suggests ongoing scrutiny. What could be the potential reasons for this hesitation? Regulatory Uncertainty around Altcoins: The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum remains somewhat ambiguous. There are ongoing debates about whether certain cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. Solana, while a major player, falls into this category of altcoins that face greater regulatory uncertainty compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are often considered commodities. Market Volatility and Maturity of Solana: While Solana has established itself as a prominent blockchain, it’s still relatively newer and potentially more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SEC might be taking a more cautious approach to ensure the market’s maturity and resilience before approving ETFs based on assets like SOL. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators are always concerned about market manipulation. The SEC needs to be convinced that the Solana market is sufficiently robust and surveilled to prevent manipulation in an ETF product. This requires assessing the liquidity and oversight mechanisms in place for Solana trading. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of underlying Solana assets for an ETF is crucial. The SEC needs to be satisfied with the custody solutions proposed by Canary Capital and the overall security framework for holding SOL at an institutional scale. It’s important to remember that the SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Their due diligence process, while frustrating for those eager for a Solana ETF, is a necessary step to ensure responsible innovation in the financial markets. The Impact of the SEC ETF Delay on SOL Price News of the SEC ETF delay can have a noticeable impact on the SOL price impact and broader market sentiment. In the short term, such delays can lead to: Price Volatility: Disappointment surrounding the delayed approval can trigger price volatility for Solana. Some investors might sell off their SOL holdings due to the uncertainty, leading to downward pressure. Conversely, others might see this as a temporary setback and an opportunity to buy at lower prices. Market Sentiment Shift: The delay could dampen overall market sentiment towards Solana and potentially other altcoins seeking ETF approvals. It might reinforce the perception that regulatory hurdles are significant and that widespread ETF adoption for altcoins is still some time away. Reduced Institutional Investment in Short-Term: Institutional investors often wait for regulatory clarity before making significant investments. Delays in ETF approvals can postpone the influx of institutional capital into Solana and similar assets. However, it’s crucial to consider the long-term perspective. While short-term SOL price impact might be negative, the underlying fundamentals of Solana and the broader trend towards crypto adoption remain unchanged. A delay is not a rejection, and the SEC is still in the process of evaluation. What’s Next for the Solana ETF and Crypto ETF Landscape? While this SEC ETF delay is a temporary setback, it doesn’t necessarily derail the prospect of a Solana ETF in the future. Here’s what to watch for: SEC’s Revised Timeline: The SEC will likely announce a new deadline for their decision. Investors should monitor official SEC filings and announcements for updates on the revised timeline. Canary Capital’s Response: How Canary Capital responds to this delay will be crucial. They might need to provide additional information or address specific concerns raised by the SEC. Their engagement with the regulatory body will be key. Broader Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on overall regulatory developments in the crypto space. Any shifts in the SEC’s stance on crypto assets or ETF approvals will impact the future prospects of a Solana ETF. Market Evolution: The continued growth and maturation of the Solana ecosystem, including increased adoption, network upgrades, and developer activity, will strengthen the case for a Solana ETF in the long run. Conclusion: Patience is Key in the Crypto ETF Race The SEC’s postponement of the decision on the Canary Capital Solana ETF is a reminder that regulatory processes take time, especially in the nascent and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. While the delay might bring short-term disappointment and SOL price impact concerns, it’s not an outright rejection. The path to crypto ETF approval , particularly for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, is likely to be gradual and require ongoing dialogue between industry players and regulators. For investors, this situation underscores the importance of patience and a long-term perspective in crypto investments. The demand for crypto ETFs is undeniable, and the eventual approval of a Solana ETF, while delayed, remains a strong possibility. Staying informed, understanding the regulatory landscape, and focusing on the fundamental value of projects like Solana will be crucial navigating this evolving space.

President Donald Trump, who previously threatened to raise the tariffs to 50%, ultimately opted against a higher increase, offering no exemptions or waivers. “Pursuant to previous executive orders, the 25 percent steel and aluminum tariff will go into effect at midnight on March 12, with no exceptions or waivers for Canada and all of our other trading partners,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement announcing the decision. Trump first said today that he would double tariffs on Canadian metals in retaliation for Ontario's decision to impose a 25% tax on electricity exported to U.S. states. The announcement sent markets tumbling, adding to the recent volatility in North American trade sectors. Related News: Will the White House Organize a New Big Cryptocurrency Summit? Senior Official Answers But there was a breakthrough after Ontario Premier Doug Ford and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the Canadian province would suspend a planned tariff on electricity exports. The two officials are set to meet in Washington on Thursday to discuss trade relations. Following the decision, Ford said it was important to reduce tensions, saying: “In every negotiation, there comes a point where the tensions get heated and need to come down. This was the right decision.” Shortly after, Trump indicated that he was open to reconsidering the increased tariffs. Despite the temporary reprieve, trade tensions between the US and Canada remain high. *This is not investment advice.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,400 followers on the social media platform X that he believes SOL will spend the next two years in deep bear territory. While Bluntz is long-term bearish on SOL, he predicts that the altcoin will witness counter-trend rallies in the coming months but notes that the surges will likely set up Solana for an even deeper drawdown. “SOL now down 57% from the highs. Now that it’s cool to hate it again, I can share my thoughts without having to worry about getting roasted by pleb reply guys. The rise/bull market lasted 762 days, the bear, (AT MINIMUM) will likely last about 70% or so in time. Best case, this drags out to mid-2026 and in the worst case, end of 2026. This move so far is likely an A wave and at some point there will probably be a very slow drawn-out complacency shoulder up that most will mistake for a new bull market.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his analysis, which states that an asset will go through an ABC correction after completing a five-wave surge. Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SOL will end its A-wave pullback once it goes below $100. He also predicts that SOL will kick off a counter-trend B-wave rally en route to $200 by early 2026 before crashing to around $80 in 2027 for the C-wave correction. At that point, Bluntz predicts that SOL will launch a new five-wave rally that could see Solana trading above $300 in 2028. At time of writing, SOL is worth $118.10, down nearly 7% on the day. Turning the US Dollar Index (DXY), a benchmark of the value of the US dollar compared to a basket of six major currencies, Bluntz says that 2025 will be a horrible year for the dominant global reserve asset. “DXY getting absolutely murdered this week probably continues throughout the whole of 2025 in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that the DXY is now in the midst of a C-wave correction that could take the index below 100 points. At time of writing, the DXY is trading at 103.84 points.

41507978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139312,1741737687,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Stablecoin Debate: US House Committee Begins Regulatory Talks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoin-regulation-house-committee/,"The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with anticipation as the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has officially commenced discussions on stablecoins . This marks a potentially pivotal moment for the digital asset landscape, signaling a deeper dive into regulatory frameworks that could shape the future of these increasingly popular digital currencies. For crypto enthusiasts and industry stakeholders alike, this development is something to watch closely. Why are Stablecoins Under the Spotlight? Stablecoins have emerged as a significant component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike their more volatile counterparts like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes them attractive for various use cases, including: Facilitating Trading: Stablecoins provide a less volatile asset for traders to move in and out of positions within the crypto market, acting as a safe haven during market fluctuations. Enabling Payments: Their price stability makes stablecoins suitable for everyday transactions and cross-border payments, offering a digital alternative to traditional currencies. DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the backbone of many Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, used for lending, borrowing, and yield farming due to their predictable value. However, the rapid growth and increasing adoption of stablecoins have also raised concerns among regulators globally. These concerns primarily revolve around: Systemic Risk: The potential for large-scale stablecoin adoption to impact the broader financial system if not properly regulated. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users are protected from potential risks associated with stablecoin issuers, including transparency and reserve management. Money Laundering and Illicit Activities: Addressing concerns about the use of stablecoins for illegal activities due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Inside the House Financial Services Committee Discussions on Crypto Regulations According to a report by Blockworks, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is not starting from scratch. Lawmakers are reportedly considering several bills, indicating a proactive approach to crafting crypto regulations . Key discussion points appear to include: Rep. Tom Emmer’s CBDC Issuance Restriction Law: This proposed law aims to limit the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The implications of a CBDC are far-reaching, and this bill suggests a cautious approach from some lawmakers, potentially favoring private sector innovation in the digital currency space. CFPB Regulations Targeting Tech Companies: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is reportedly looking at regulations targeting technology companies involved in payment apps and digital wallets. This could directly impact how stablecoins are integrated into existing payment infrastructures and consumer-facing applications. These discussions signal a multi-faceted approach to crypto regulations , encompassing both the potential of CBDCs and the existing landscape of private stablecoins and digital payment systems. The committee’s deliberations are crucial as they will likely set the stage for future legislation and regulatory clarity within the U.S. crypto market. Trump’s Stance: Stablecoin Legislation Before August Recess? Adding another layer of intrigue, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed a desire to see stablecoin legislation passed before the August recess. Speaking at the White House Crypto Summit, Trump’s comments highlight the urgency and political attention that stablecoin regulation is now receiving at the highest levels of government. This timeline, while ambitious, underscores the momentum behind establishing a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The push for swift action could be driven by various factors, including: Geopolitical Competition: The U.S. may be keen to establish itself as a leader in blockchain technology and digital asset regulation, particularly as other nations advance their own digital currency initiatives. Economic Stability: Policymakers might be aiming to mitigate potential risks associated with unregulated stablecoin growth to safeguard financial stability. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework could foster innovation and growth within the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency sectors by providing businesses with the necessary legal certainty to operate and invest. What Could These Discussions Mean for the Future of Stablecoins? The ongoing discussions by the House Financial Services Committee are not just procedural; they represent a critical juncture for the future of stablecoins and the broader crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Potential Outcome Impact on Stablecoins Clear Regulatory Framework Could foster wider adoption by institutional investors and mainstream users due to increased trust and legitimacy. May also lead to standardization and interoperability. Strict Regulations Could stifle innovation if overly burdensome, potentially pushing stablecoin activity to other jurisdictions with more lenient rules. May increase compliance costs for issuers. CBDC Development Could compete with private stablecoins, potentially reshaping the market. The extent of competition will depend on the design and accessibility of the CBDC. Consumer Protection Focus Likely to lead to enhanced transparency requirements for stablecoin issuers, potentially requiring regular audits and disclosures of reserves. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead of the Curve For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, whether as investors, developers, or businesses, staying informed about these regulatory developments is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Regulatory News: Keep a close watch on updates from the House Financial Services Committee and other regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC. Engage in Industry Discussions: Participate in industry forums and discussions to understand the potential impacts of upcoming regulations and contribute to shaping responsible regulatory frameworks. Assess Compliance Readiness: If you are involved in issuing or using stablecoins, begin assessing your compliance readiness for potential new regulations. This includes reviewing reserve management practices, KYC/AML procedures, and transparency measures. Diversify and Adapt: Be prepared to adapt your strategies based on the evolving regulatory landscape. Diversification across different types of cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols can help mitigate risks associated with regulatory changes. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Currency The U.S. House Financial Services Committee’s commencement of discussions on stablecoins is undeniably a crucial moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These deliberations will likely pave the way for significant regulatory changes that could define the trajectory of stablecoins and the broader digital currency ecosystem in the United States and potentially globally. As lawmakers grapple with balancing innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability, the crypto world watches with bated breath, anticipating the outcomes that will shape the future of finance.

41508300,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139313,1741738224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking SEC Delay: Canary Spot XRP ETF Decision Postponed – Crypto Investors Brace for Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-xrp-etf-decision/,"Just when crypto enthusiasts were holding their breath, anticipating a potential green light for another groundbreaking investment vehicle, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. In a recent filing that sent ripples through the digital asset space, the SEC announced a delay in its decision regarding the proposed Canary spot XRP ETF. This news has undoubtedly left many wondering – what does this mean for the future of XRP and the broader crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this significant development and explore its potential ramifications. What Exactly is a Spot XRP ETF and Why the Hype? Before we delve into the specifics of the SEC delay, let’s quickly recap what a spot XRP ETF is and why it’s generating so much buzz. In simple terms, a spot XRP ETF is a type of investment fund that directly holds XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the future price of an asset, a spot ETF holds the actual asset itself. This distinction is crucial because many investors, particularly institutional ones, prefer the direct exposure offered by spot ETFs. Here’s why the hype is real: Direct XRP Exposure: For investors keen on XRP, a spot ETF provides a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure without directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. This simplifies the investment process significantly. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: The approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a major catalyst for institutional adoption. Many institutions are hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties and custody concerns. An ETF listed on traditional exchanges alleviates these concerns. Market Maturation Signal: The launch of a spot crypto ETF , especially one tied to a prominent cryptocurrency like XRP, is seen as another step towards the maturation of the crypto market. It signals growing acceptance and integration with traditional financial systems. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and easy accessibility for a broad range of investors, from retail to institutional. Why the SEC Delay on the Canary Spot XRP ETF? Unpacking the Potential Reasons The burning question on everyone’s mind is: why the SEC delay ? While the official filing simply states a postponement, we can speculate on several potential reasons behind this decision. It’s important to remember that the SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Here are some likely factors contributing to the delay: Regulatory Scrutiny of XRP: XRP has had a complex relationship with the SEC, primarily due to the lawsuit filed against Ripple Labs in December 2020. Although there have been positive developments in the case, the SEC might still be exercising caution until there is complete clarity on XRP’s regulatory status. Market Volatility and Risk Assessment: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. The SEC may be taking extra time to thoroughly assess the risks associated with a spot XRP ETF, particularly in light of recent market fluctuations and concerns about investor protection. Novelty of Spot Crypto ETFs: Spot crypto ETFs are relatively new investment products, especially in the US. The SEC is likely treading carefully to establish a robust regulatory framework before approving more spot ETFs, including those beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Internal Review Processes: The SEC has internal processes and timelines for reviewing complex financial products like ETFs. These processes can be lengthy and may involve multiple rounds of review and feedback, naturally leading to delays. Political and External Pressures: Regulatory bodies often operate under political and external pressures. There might be ongoing discussions and debates within the SEC or with other government agencies regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto ETFs, contributing to the delay. Impact of the SEC Delay on XRP and the Crypto Market The news of the SEC delay on the Canary spot XRP ETF has immediate and potential long-term implications for both XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market. Let’s examine some key impacts: Impact Area Short-Term Effects Long-Term Effects XRP Price Potential price dip due to dampened investor enthusiasm and uncertainty. Continued price volatility influenced by regulatory developments and overall market sentiment. Investor Sentiment Disappointment and frustration among XRP holders and crypto ETF hopefuls. Potential shift in investor strategies, with some becoming more cautious while others remain optimistic about eventual approval. Crypto ETF Market Slowdown in the expansion of spot crypto ETF offerings in the US. Delayed but not necessarily derailed progress towards broader acceptance of crypto ETFs as mainstream investment products. Regulatory Landscape Reinforces the cautious approach of the SEC towards crypto regulation. May prompt further dialogue and clarification on regulatory frameworks for digital assets and ETFs. While the delay is undoubtedly a setback for those anticipating a spot XRP ETF, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The SEC’s decision is not a rejection, but rather a postponement. This indicates that the application is still under consideration, and the SEC is likely seeking more time to conduct thorough due diligence. What’s Next for the Canary Spot XRP ETF and Crypto ETFs in General? So, what can we expect moving forward? Here are some key points to consider regarding the future of the Canary spot XRP ETF and the broader landscape of crypto ETFs: Continued SEC Review: The SEC will continue its review process. The timeframe for a final decision remains uncertain, but investors should monitor SEC filings and announcements for updates. Industry Engagement: ETF issuers and crypto industry players will likely engage in further dialogue with the SEC to address concerns and provide additional information to support the approval of spot crypto ETFs. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: The delay underscores the ongoing need for greater regulatory clarity in the crypto space. Industry participants and regulators need to work collaboratively to establish clear rules and guidelines that foster innovation while protecting investors. Global Developments: It’s worth noting that other jurisdictions have already approved spot crypto ETFs. The US may eventually follow suit, but the timeline remains subject to regulatory considerations. Diversification and Innovation: Despite the delay, the demand for crypto investment products is likely to persist. The industry will continue to innovate and explore various avenues to offer investors regulated and accessible exposure to digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty of Crypto ETF Approvals The SEC’s decision to delay the Canary spot XRP ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles and complexities inherent in the cryptocurrency market. While disappointing for those eager to see XRP ETFs become a reality, this delay is not necessarily a dead end. It underscores the SEC’s commitment to careful consideration and investor protection in a rapidly evolving landscape. For crypto investors, patience and vigilance remain key. The journey towards broader crypto ETF adoption may be taking longer than anticipated, but the underlying momentum and demand for these products suggest that it’s still a matter of when, not if, they will become more widely available in the US market. Stay informed, stay resilient, and continue to navigate the exciting, albeit sometimes turbulent, world of crypto investments.

His post included a tweet and a video of himself explaining how he would have had to give up running his sports, gambling, and pop-culture media company to fill such a role. Dave Portnoy wants to know Elon Musk’s secret formula Portnoy, who goes by @stoolpresidente on X, shared the post on Tuesday with claims that he had received a call that potentially offered him the opportunity to join the Commerce Department working under Secretary Howard Lutnick. Portnoy conveniently omitted details regarding the nature of the job. However, he said he was told that if he agreed to become a government employee, he would have to relinquish his role as leader of Barstool. It made him question how a person like Elon Musk, who serves as CEO of not one one, not two but a number of companies including Tesla and SpaceX, is able to juggle all his responsibilities while maintaining appearances as the leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Elon Musk poses beside President Trump after delivering his new Tesla. Source: The White House (X/Twitter) “How do you run Tesla when you’re working on DOGE 24-7?” Portnoy wanted to know in the video. “You kind of want your CEO with the eye on the ball, right?” Portnoy also stated that the White House never followed up after the initial outreach. That part did not surprise some of his followers on X. In fact, one user went as far as saying that they most probably had a rethink — most likely after realizing Portnoy has too much baggage to be in any position of government. It is not completely far-fetched for Portnoy to have gotten such an offer, after all, he has been a vocal supporter of Trump since 2020 when he interviewed him at the White House at the tail end of Trump’s first term. In fact, as far back as 2015, Portnoy was already planning to vote for Trump. “I don’t care if he’s a joke. I don’t care if he’s racist. I don’t care if he’s sexist. I don’t care about any of it. I hope he stays in the race and I hope he wins. Why? Because I love the fact that he is making other politicians squirm,” he wrote in a blog post at the time. Dave Portnoy has become a high-profile memecoin investor Dave Portnoy has courted controversy recently with his foray into the world of memecoin trading. Some of the memes he has been involved with include $Jailstool, a meme tied to his Barstool persona, which he personally endorsed and invested in; then $Trump and $Libra, which he promoted and also invested in. Portnoy sees memecoin trading as a game of risk. He attracted criticism for leveraging his fame to manipulate market movements and advertise memes to his less crypto-savvy audience, transforming them into exit liquidity at the push of a button. His involvement has led to accusations of rugs and market manipulation, with accusers claiming Portnoy typically sells his holdings after tweeting about a token. So far, he has had massive wins and incredible losses in the space and while his approach to trading is seen as chaotic, it has been a source of entertainment to his audience whom he often carries along via live. Dave Portnoy poses for a selfie on a street. Source: Dave Portnoy (X/Twitter) Dave Portnoy is most popular for being the founder of Barstool Sports, which he established as a print publication. In 2023, Dave Portnoy became the owner of Barstool again after buying it back from casino and online gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1. The sale came months after Penn Entertainment paid about $550 million to acquire 100% control of Barstool before deciding to drop the company due to regulatory hurdles. It was only after buying back the company that he realized an important fact — “we underestimated just how tough it is for myself and Barstool to operate in a regulated world.” Portnoy claimed they were denied [gambling] licenses because of his affiliation with the company and even conceded that the regulated industry [is] probably not the best place for Barstool Sports or its content. Reasons why his affiliation would cause so much harm to his company can most likely be traced to the many past allegations of racism, sexism and sexual misconduct Portnoy has been linked to over the past several years. Portnoy has publicly denied all the allegations, claiming that the encounters were consensual. That was years ago. More recent scandals involving Portnoy have not had anything to do with his Barstool business. Business owners who received offers of employment from Trump’s government Portnoy’s desire to know how Musk can juggle his roles as CEO and handle his responsibilities at DOGE is valid. When the government reaches out to a person with a post and they accept the position, they usually have to step back from their previous engagements to be able to serve fully. Musk did not have to leave his roles because he is a special government employee, not a Cabinet member. Aside from Elon Musk, four other cabinet members of Trump also have extensive roots in the business world. Howard Lutnick, who, was nominated as Secretary of Commerce is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major financial services firm; Linda McMahon who, was nominated as Secretary of Education, is the former CEO of WWE and a prominent business figure; Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury is a hedge fund manager and CEO of Key Square Group, a major investment firm while Doug Burgum the Secretary of the Interior is a former CEO of Great Plains Software which was sold to Microsoft for $1.1 billion. Lutnick has had to disclose his financial holdings and step back as CEO of Cantor after rivals highlighted how his ties to the company, which is famous for its relationship with the Chinese, could pose a conflict of interest.

41509134,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710083,1741739458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/41509134.jpeg,Solana Falls Under Realized Price: Here’s What Happened Last Time,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-falls-realized-price-happened-last-time/,"On-chain data shows Solana (SOL) has seen its spot value drop under the Realized Price for the first time in three years following the recent bearish action. Solana Has Just Seen A Breakdown Of The Realized Price According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Solana has slipped around 8% below its Realized Price. The “Realized Price” is an indicator that basically tells us about the cost basis of the average investor or address on a given network. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $2 Could Be Next If DOGE Holds This Level: Analyst When the spot price of the asset is trading above this metric, it means the holders as a whole are carrying a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the indicator suggests the average investor is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Realized Price for Solana over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, SOL broke above its Realized Price back in 2023, putting investors into the green. Throughout 2024 and the first couple of months of this year, the price remained above the line, but recently, it seems another crossover has finally occurred. “Solana just plunged below its Realized Price for the first time in nearly 3 years,” notes Glassnode. At the current exchange rate, the price is around 8% below this metric, which means the average holder of the asset could be assumed to be 8% in the red. From the chart, it’s apparent that the last time the cryptocurrency saw this type of crossover was back in 2022. Losing the level then meant the start of a bear market. Thus, it’s possible that the latest breakdown of the line could prove to be a bad sign for the coin this time as well. Historically, the Realized Price has played the role of a boundary between bear and bull trends for not just SOL, but also other digital assets. In another X post, Glassnode has shared the data for a version of the indicator for Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency. The metric displayed in the chart is the Realized Price of the short-term holders, which only measures the average cost basis of the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Unlike the Realized Price of the entire network, this version of the indicator serves more like a boundary line for short-term momentum shifts.

Market indicators suggest weakening strength, while large whale transactions to exchanges raise concerns about increased selling pressure. Therefore, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether ETH can recover or extend its downtrend below $1500. Ethereum Price Testing Key Levels Notably, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) pricing bands indicate Ethereum has reached essential price thresholds. Analyst Ali Martinez has determined the Realized Price to be $2,060 at present. The next significant support point for Ethereum price exists at $1,440 when its price fails to stay above the Realized Value threshold of $2,060. Source: X According to MVRV pricing bands, Ethereum price shows reduced market strength while existing closer to its lower boundary deviation point. These bands indicate the price levels the top altcoin must surpass to trigger a market recovery or extend its downward trend. More so, recent analysis suggests that the upcoming Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse could play a role in Ethereum’s price action, potentially triggering heightened volatility. While some analysts predict a bullish reversal due to historical lunar cycle trends, others warn of another wave of panic selling. With Ethereum already in oversold territory, the market’s reaction to this event could be a decisive moment Amber Group’s ETH Transfers Additionally, in recent hours, the crypto trading platform Amber Group moved a substantial amount of 20,000 ETH worth $37.34 million to Binance, OKX and Gate.io. Such large Ethereum moves have sparked doubts about the companies’ intentions for moving ETH to exchanges during market decline. Such whale transactions into top exchanges normally attract attention and could increase selling pressure. Amber Group deposited 20,000 $ETH ($37.34M) to #Binance , #OKX and #Gateio ~40 mins ago. https://t.co/GMZTZP3SjZ pic.twitter.com/CzUOZj9CrF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 11, 2025 Market activity shows strong signals from the large movement of ETH. The rising availability of ETH on exchanges during trading periods causes market prices to decrease. Ethereum Price Action And Predictions However, despite the bearish outlook, the top altcoin has formed a bullish diamond pattern that signals a potential breakout. This technical setup suggests that the asset is approaching a pivotal moment, where a surge could follow if resistance levels are breached. If buyers gain control, Ethereum may see accelerated upward momentum in the coming sessions. Similarly, a recent ETH price prediction projected that the altcoin would fall further below $1,500, possibly reaching $1,250 if key support levels continue to break. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is slipping out of a parallel channel, a technical pattern often associated with bearish price action. Despite the bearish sentiments, ETH price has shown resilience, rising from $1,814.5 to $1,915.13 in the last 24 hours. This 6% increase reflects renewed buying pressure, despite a significant drop in trading volume.

Many experienced connectivity problems early in the day, with error messages appearing on their screens. Downdetector tracked a peak of 40,000 complaints as the service remained unstable for several hours. A hacker group with alleged Russian ties, known as Dark Storm, has now claimed responsibility for the cyberattack that temporarily crippled the social media platform. Hackers’ IPs Traced to Ukraine Region The attack, identified as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assault, left thousands unable to access the platform before functionality was swiftly restored. Cybersecurity firm SpyoSecure reported that Dark Storm’s leader had announced the attack in a now-deleted Telegram post. Before its removal, the message boasted about taking X offline, with screenshots showing widespread connection failures across multiple locations. While the group’s Telegram channel has been shut down for violating the platform’s policies, evidence of the attack continues circulating online. For instance, Ed Krassenstein, an entrepreneur, and a social media commentator who also happens to be the co-founder of NFT marketplace NFTz.me, weighed in and claimed direct communication with Dark Storm’s leader. According to Krassenstein’s tweet, the hackers described their actions as a show of force rather than an operation driven by political motives. However, Dark Storm’s history suggests otherwise. The group, which has been active since 2023, has a track record of targeting NATO countries and is known for its pro-Palestinian stance. Meanwhile, Elon Musk confirmed the attack in an interview and noted that his team traced the origin of the hackers’ IP addresses to the “Ukraine area” without elaborating any further. Political Firestorm The latest development comes amidst the “Take Down Tesla” movement, as Tesla facilities nationwide have become hotspots for protests and vandalism, fueled by opposition to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been eliminating government agencies. Demonstrators are reacting to Musk’s political influence within the Trump administration. He has publicly accused five activist groups – Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project, and Democratic Socialists of America – of orchestrating the growing wave of demonstrations.

Investors hoping for a quick green light will now have to wait until May 2025 to find out if these applications will be approved, rejected, or kicked further down the road. The SEC says it needs more time to review the proposals. Each ETF now has a new deadline where the SEC will either approve, reject, or delay the process again if it so wishes. No approvals, no denials—just another delay. SEC pushes back deadlines for multiple ETFs For ADA, the SEC has officially designated May 29, 2025, as the new deadline for deciding on the Canary Spot ADA ETF. In its filing, the commission said the extension gives it “sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” For XRP, the new deadline is May 22, 2025. This affects both the Canary Spot XRP ETF, Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF and the Grayscale Spot XRP ETF, both of which have been waiting for approval. According to the filing, the SEC is using Section 19(b)(2) of the Act to justify the delay, which allows the agency to extend deadlines if additional review is required. Litecoin (LTC) was originally scheduled for a decision by March 29, 2025, but the SEC invoked its right to push that deadline to May 13, 2025. The filing says the SEC needed extra time to “evaluate the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1.” Dogecoin (DOGE) is in the same boat. The SEC has now designated May 21, 2025, as the date for its ruling on the Grayscale Spot Dogecoin ETF. Like the others, this delay is being handled under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, which allows the SEC to push back decisions when further analysis is needed. For Solana (SOL), the commission has set May 19, 2025, as the new deadline for deciding on the VanEck Spot Solana ETF and the Canary Spot Solana ETF. The SEC’s filing confirms that, like the other cases, this delay is being used to allow for “further review of the proposed rule change.” SEC sets roundtables to discuss crypto regulation Meanwhile on March 3rd, the SEC announced that it is moving forward with a series of crypto regulation roundtables as part of its Crypto Task Force. The first event, “How We Got Here and How We Get Out – Defining Security Status,” is scheduled for March 21, at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The event will be open to the public, running from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., with a live stream available on SEC.gov and a recording posted afterward. Discussion topics will include how crypto assets are classified, what regulatory standards should be applied, and how the SEC plans to enforce compliance. Hester Peirce, the SEC Commissioner leading the Crypto Task Force, commented on the importance of the event, saying, “I am looking forward to drawing on the expertise of the public in developing a workable regulatory framework for crypto. The roundtables are an important part of our engagement with the public.” The Crypto Task Force was officially launched on January 21 by Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda. Its goal is to create clearer rules for crypto, provide realistic compliance pathways, and refine the SEC’s approach to enforcement. The public will have opportunities to contribute to discussions, either by attending the roundtables or requesting direct meetings with the task force. Trump’s permanent pick for SEC Chairman, Paul Atkins, is still waiting for Senate confirmation.

The legislation, which builds on President Trump’s executive order, is designed to make Bitcoin a core financial asset for the federal government. Cynthia, along with several Republican senators, wants to use Bitcoin to help tackle the country’s $36 trillion national debt while securing America’s role in global finance. “Today, I am proud to reintroduce landmark legislation that will codify President Trump’s bold vision to establish the United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and strengthen our nation’s economic foundation for generations to come,” Cynthia said. She called Bitcoin a “national imperative” and said the BITCOIN Act would allow the U.S. to “harness the full potential of digital innovation” while keeping its competitive edge. Lawmakers push for Bitcoin to strengthen the U.S. economy The BITCOIN Act has strong backing from Republican senators, who see Bitcoin as an opportunity to stabilize the country’s financial future. Jim Justice, one of the original cosponsors, said he supports the bill because it “makes sense” from a business perspective. “This bill represents America’s continued leadership in financial innovation, bolsters both our economic security, and gives us an opportunity to wrangle in our soaring national debt,” Jim said. Senator Tommy Tuberville also threw his support behind the bill, arguing that Bitcoin should be used to pay off the national debt. “Like President Trump, Bitcoin has shaken up the status quo in Washington D.C. and is completely revolutionizing the way Americans invest in their futures,” Tommy said. “Creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is an important step in making sure the United States remains the strongest economy in the world.” The bill also has backing from Bernie Moreno, who pointed to the $36 trillion national debt as the driving force behind his support. “Decades of out-of-control spending has led to a $36 trillion national debt, and developing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a critical step to improving our nation’s balance sheet,” Bernie said. He added that the BITCOIN Act would “strengthen the U.S. dollar, help Americans hedge against inflation, and improve our financial security.” Senator Roger Marshall emphasized that Bitcoin would help protect the country’s financial position. “The world’s economic landscape is ever-evolving, and America must adapt to remain the world’s foremost finance superpower,” Roger said. He argued that the BITCOIN Act would “diversify, strengthen, and decentralize the critically important assets that back our currency.” In the House of Representatives, Nick Begich has introduced a companion bill to ensure Bitcoin is recognized as a strategic asset on both legislative fronts. “Bitcoin is the future of financial sovereignty, and the United States has a unique moment in time to secure its leadership in the global digital economy,” Nick said. He called Cynthia a “trailblazer” for pushing Bitcoin legislation in Congress and said the BITCOIN Act would help solidify Bitcoin’s role in America’s financial future. What the BITCOIN Act actually does The BITCOIN Act lays out a plan for the United States to acquire a massive Bitcoin reserve, similar in scale to its gold holdings. Under the bill, the government would launch a 1-million-unit Bitcoin purchase program, giving the U.S. control over roughly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. This would be funded by reallocating resources from the Federal Reserve System and Treasury Department without additional taxpayer spending. The bill also proposes creating a network of secure Bitcoin vaults under the control of the U.S. Treasury, with strict physical and cybersecurity measures in place. Cynthia made it clear that private Bitcoin holders would not be affected, emphasizing that the reserve would not infringe on self-custody rights. Following President Trump’s executive order, Cynthia said the administration is staying true to its promise to support crypto. “President Trump promised to lead the most pro-crypto administration in U.S. history, and today he is fulfilling that promise,” Cynthia said. “By embracing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, President Trump has charted a path to addressing our national debt and securing America’s position as the world leader in financial innovation.” Cynthia said she was confident the BITCOIN Act would pass. “The American people will look back on this decision as the moment we reclaimed our financial future, and I look forward to partnering with President Trump to get this across the finish line.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

All You Should Know About This DeFi Powerhouse,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-real-deal-all-you-should-know-about-this-defi-powerhouse/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has experienced rapid investor demand because it raised $3 million through its presale while acquiring more than 5,000 token holders since its launch. The third phase of MUTM demonstrates high market interest since most available tokens have already been purchased before reaching this price point at $0.02. Those who acquire MUTM tokens in the current third phase will experience a 25% value increase until the next stage begins at $0.025 while the exchange listing at $0.06 will yield 200% profit for immediate token holders. Presale Momentum and Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) receives exceptional market attention because its pre-sale continues to gain momentum rapidly. The second phase of presale proved extremely popular while current third stage sales keep growing at an equally rapid rate. The third phase will increase MUTM from its present price of $0.02 to $0.025 thus granting investors a 25% return on their early investment. Mutuum Finance will offer investors a 200% return opportunity because its structured pricing system starts at $0.06 and ends at a $0.06 listing price. The platform has gained over 5000 holders because of its distinct lending protocols along with the $100,000 giveaway program for early participants. The tokenomics system strengthens investor confidence at the platform. The predicted trading value of $3.50 after launch substantiates that the presale investors may achieve a return of 23000% according to adoption and exchange forecasts. The highly elevated values exceed what the average DeFi project can achieve given they depend on speculative predictions instead of practical business applications. The main advantage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies in its focus on practical financial functions which support decentralized loan lending as well as collateral-based transactions while sustaining market demand for their token. Tokenomics and Profit Potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generates its popularity through a carefully structured economic system. The presale program has a progressive pricing model which gives increased value to the investors who join early before each milestone completion. The current $0.02 price for tokens has the potential to grow four times its value when listed on exchanges while showing future market potential with a $3.50 estimation. The $3.50 prediction comes from the revenue-sharing model of the platform that dedicates earnings to MUTM token buyback operations. The system gives stakers tokens which create ongoing market purchase pressure thus lowering price fluctuations in the market. The platform enhances its utility by introducing the mtTokens which operate as interest-bearing user-deposit representative assets. The mtETH and mtDAI tokens received by depositors gain value as interest flows through while holding money safely without the need to sell holdings. Through this system Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with greater liquidity accessibility as well as integration capabilities with other DeFi external platforms to expand its ecosystem. The protocol appeals to yield-seeking participants along with conservative investors through its volatile interest rate adjustments based on market conditions which creates an active community of multiple dynamics. Strategic Mechanisms Driving Growth Supply-security functions as a critical aspect and third-party auditors perform tests to ensure smart contracts stay secure. The practice of full disclosure promotes trust because most DeFi sectors face serious exploit issues. The buy-and-distribute system maintains constant demand capability which opens up long-term growth opportunities for MUTM. Investors who seek anticipated returns from MUTM tokens have growing urgency because the time available to purchase at $0.02 during the presale Phase three is running out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines financial principles of DeFi innovation to offer more than speculative hype. The presale results together with ongoing demand stimulation protocols demonstrate MUTM’s aptness to dominate the market. The project stands out because it approaches profitability through both short-term gains during phase three subscription completion and long-term viability leading to its $3.50 target price. Potential investors should consider purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its presale token campaign since token availability expires at some point.

The leading cryptocurrency has been in the spotlight throughout this market cycle, but a technical outlook suggests that it needs to give way. Particularly, a crypto analyst known as Seth on social media platform X pointed to Bitcoin’s dominance relative strength index (RSI) as a crucial factor that must change before Bitcoin and the broader market can kick off another leg upward. Bitcoin Dominance RSI Hits New Level Seth’s latest analysis, shared on social media platform X, highlights a critical observation regarding Bitcoin’s market dominance. He noted that Bitcoin’s monthly dominance RSI recently surged to 70, a level that has never been reached before in Bitcoin’s history. While this might seem like a bullish signal at first glance, the analyst suggests otherwise, warning that the dominance RSI must cool down for the final phase of the bull run to take place. This perspective comes as the crypto market experiences a downturn, leaving investors questioning when the next bullish wave will begin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? RSI, or relative strength index, tracks the speed and change of price movements and is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. With Bitcoin’s RSI dominance at such an extreme level, even with the recent price decline, it suggests that BTC’s control over the market is at an unsustainable peak, which could slow down the broader market rally. According to Seth, those who fail to grasp this concept do not understand the fundamental mechanics of financial markets, as this principle applies beyond just Bitcoin and altcoins. Given this, the healthiest path forward would be a reduction in Bitcoin’s dominance over the next few weeks, with the analyst projecting a fall to 44% dominance. Why BTC’s RSI Dominance Decline Matters A decline in Bitcoin’s RSI dominance would mean that the market is shifting toward more balanced conditions, allowing capital to flow into altcoins and drive up their prices. Throughout past bull cycles, particularly in 2021, Bitcoin’s rise to a peak was often followed by a surge in altcoin investments, triggering widespread rallies across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Consolidates In Tight Zone: Why A Crash To $84,000 Is Likely This pattern has historically marked the final phase of a bull run, where capital flows away from Bitcoin and into altcoins with a higher potential for short-term gains. Until Bitcoin’s dominance cools off, the altcoin sector may struggle to gain momentum and continue to derail the final phase of the BTC bull run. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $81,500, reflecting a 2.5% decline in the last 24 hours. Market data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Bitcoin’s dominance currently stands at 61.0%, having risen by 0.65% within the same period. This growing dominance suggests that capital remains concentrated in BTC.

The House passed the vote 292-132, following the Senate’s decision to reject the rule that was finalized during the final days of former President Biden’s administration. This could change how crypto businesses are regulated. Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that due to a rule that budget-related bills must start in the House, the Senate will need to vote on the resolution one more time. Once that vote passes, it will go to President Trump’s desk as the first crypto-related bill to become law.

He added that the rule might be impossible to enforce, as DeFi platforms are different from centralized crypto exchanges or banks and cannot gather the required user information to comply with the rule. Last week, 70 Senators voted to overturn the IRS rule, with Trump’s advisers urging him to sign it. Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) noted the Senate must approve it again due to budget rules. If signed, the IRS would be blocked from enforcing similar rules in the future. Illinois Democrat Danny Davis argued the rule was part of the 2021 Infrastructure Act, comparing crypto to stocks and saying crypto platforms should report like stock brokers. Meanwhile, North Carolina Republican Tim Moore claimed the rule overstepped and could harm U.S. innovation in digital assets. Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett called the resolution “special interest legislation,” saying that it could help tax cheats, criminals, and terrorist financiers, and add $4 billion to the national debt, going against President Trump’s goal to cut the debt.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 02:02:14

The bill, first introduced in July, directs the US government to buy 200,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) a year over five years for a total acquisition of 1 million Bitcoin, which would be paid for by diversifying existing funds within the Federal Reserve system and the Treasury department. However, the reintroduced act, the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act of 2025, opens the door for the US to acquire and hold in excess of 1 million BTC as long as it is acquired through lawful means other than direct purchase, such as civil or criminal forfeitures, gifts made to the US or transfers from federal agencies. Proud to re-introduce the BITCOIN Act. Let’s secure America’s financial future. pic.twitter.com/jJFmMopP7h — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) March 11, 2025 The extra Bitcoin can also come from US states that voluntarily store their Bitcoin holdings in the strategic Bitcoin reserve, though it’ll be stored in a segregated account. “By transforming the president’s visionary executive action into enduring law, we can ensure that our nation will harness the full potential of digital innovation to address our national debt while maintaining our competitive edge in the global economy,” said Lummis, who announced the revamped bill during a March 11 conference hosted by The Bitcoin Policy Institute. Lummis taps new bill co-sponsors The BITCOIN Act also has a number of new co-sponsors, including Republican Senators Jim Justice, Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall, Marsha Blackburn and Bernie Moreno. “I’m proud to join Senator Lummis on this common-sense bill to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and codify President Trump’s executive order,” Justice said in a statement. “This bill represents America’s continued leadership in financial innovation, bolsters both our economic security, and gives us an opportunity to wrangle in our soaring national debt,” he added. Other changes The bill also now sets a formal evaluation process for Bitcoin forked assets and airdropped assets in the reserve. Initially, the bill required all forked assets to be stored in the reserve and couldn’t be sold or disposed of for five years unless authorized by law. Related: Texas Senate passes Bitcoin reserve bill, New York targets memecoin rug pulls: Law Decoded The new bill now directs the Secretary after the mandatory holding period to evaluate and retain the most valuable asset based on market capitalization while retaining the “dominant asset.” Bitcoin has hard forked a number of times in the past to create new cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), which forked on Aug. 1, 2017, and Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ), which forked on Oct. 24, 2017. Lummis’ reintroduced bill comes just days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” The reserve and stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal and civil cases, but the reserve won’t sell the stashed Bitcoin and will use “budget-neutral” ways to increase its size, while tokens from the stockpile could be sold.

According to industry insiders, the increasing number of ETF registrations is a result of a larger trend to offer investors regulated substitutes for conventional digital asset investments. Many believe that these ETFs are an essential step in improving market transparency and protecting investors. The SEC is still wary despite the spike in filings. In the past, the SEC has been hesitant to approve crypto-based ETFs, citing worries about regulatory uncertainty and market manipulation. However, according to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, XRP ETFs have a 65–75% chance of being approved in 2025. Market sentiment also remains optimistic. In the cryptocurrency betting platform Polymarket, bettors have currently placed the odds of approval at around 72%, indicating confidence in a positive result. Investors are now awaiting further information, with many expecting that a more transparent regulatory environment will open up new avenues for investment in the digital asset space.

Strong whale selling activity is indicated by a high ratio, which frequently causes brief corrections. This metric’s recent downward trend, however, indicates that big holders are reducing their sell orders, which is typically an indication of an impending market recovery. 📊Is Binance's whale selling pressure ending ?

The recent announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve by the U.S. government appeared optimistic at first. Later on, though, it became evident that these holdings would primarily come from seized assets rather than aggressive acquisitions. This has increased investor uncertainty, as have record outflows from Bitcoin ETFs and macroeconomic worries like possible tariffs. Traditional markets, especially the NASDAQ, continue to have a strong influence on the price of bitcoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes offered his take on the market in a Mar.11 post on X. He predicts that Bitcoin could bottom around $70,000, a 36% drop from its all-time high, before beginning its next rally. However, he argues that a true recovery will require more than just crypto market dynamics. According to Hayes, a downturn in the stock market is part of a larger financial shift that is required. As of now, the continuous accumulation by large investors and the declining whale ratio indicate that selling pressure is abating. Bitcoin, which is trading at $83,234 at the time of press, might be headed for a recovery if this pattern holds.

Trump has yet to make an official announcement, but advisers have indicated to allies that Michelle is the leading candidate. Michelle, who has been on the Fed’s Board of Governors since 2018, was originally appointed by Trump and has a history in community banking and bank regulation. She worked at her family’s Kansas bank before becoming Kansas banking commissioner. The seat she currently holds at the Fed is specifically designated for someone with experience in community banking. Some Republican lawmakers are frustrated by Jerome Powell’s suggestions that the vice chair position remain vacant. Powell, who testified before Congress last month, called the position a “liability”, arguing that it made regulatory decisions vulnerable to political cycles. Trump, speaking in an interview on Fox News last Sunday, said he would make a decision “fairly soon.” Lawmakers don’t want any delays, seeing the vacancy as an opportunity to move regulatory power away from Powell before Trump picks a new Fed chair next year. Barr stepped down last month to avoid legal battles that could have arisen if Trump had followed through on calls to strip him of his position. He remains a Fed governor until 2032 but no longer has the regulatory authority he once did. Michelle was always against Michael Barr’s regulatory agenda During his tenure, Barr pushed for strict banking regulations, often facing resistance from the industry and even from some of his own colleagues inside the Fed. Michelle repeatedly opposed his policies, aligning with the view that excessive regulation could hurt banks and slow economic growth. One of the biggest fights under Barr’s leadership was over capital requirements for large banks. His efforts to increase those requirements failed twice, with other banking agencies refusing to reach a consensus. With Michelle expected to step in, a third attempt at rewriting the capital rules could play out very differently. Republicans have also expressed concerns over Powell’s role in setting regulatory policy. Tim Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said last week on Fox Business: “It is not in America’s best interest to let Jay Powell continue having dual roles. We need a vice chair of supervision that President Trump has complete confidence in to rightsize the regulatory environment.” There is no open seat on the Fed board, which is why Michelle has been seen as the likeliest pick. Unless a current governor steps down, a nominee outside the board would have to wait until next year to fill a vacancy. Michelle has told associates she is not planning to leave the Fed, which makes her the most logical choice if Republicans want to fill the role quickly. Last week, over two dozen Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging a fast appointment. The power of the Fed’s vice chair for supervision The vice chair for supervision has a significant role at the Fed, overseeing hundreds of bank examiners and shaping the day-to-day approach to regulation. However, major regulatory changes require a majority vote from the seven-member board, and the Fed chair ultimately controls the agenda for board meetings. Despite this, the vice chair for supervision has the ability to influence how regulations are enforced. This makes Michelle’s stance on banking regulation critical, especially given the banking industry’s ongoing legal battles over the Fed’s stress tests and other regulatory rules. Many trade groups representing community banks had previously encouraged Scott to select Michelle for the role, because they see her as someone who understands small and mid-sized banks and can push back against what they see as excessive oversight, said the WSJ report . Beyond banking regulation, Michelle has taken a hawkish stance on interest rates. She has repeatedly warned that the Fed is not doing enough to combat inflation. She was the only Fed official to vote against the half-point rate cut in September—the first time the Fed had lowered rates in four years. Her reasoning? She believed that cutting rates too soon would fail to control inflation. Just last Friday, Michelle spoke at a Fed event, saying that while inflation had been the Fed’s primary concern, she expected the focus to change toward labor markets and the broader economy in the coming months.

The Starknet Foundation said in its March 11 Bitcoin roadmap that it’s aiming for Starknet to become Bitcoin’s execution layer , scaling it from 13 transactions per second to thousands, reducing blocks and gas fees, and creating a better user experience. “Most Bitcoin today sits static in wallets and exchanges, constrained by the limitations of the network’s original design: a lack of scalability and an inability to natively support applications beyond simple buying, selling, and transferring,” the foundation said. It added that while some investors view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” it believes “there is a demand for utilizing Bitcoin for purposes beyond that.” Source: Starknet Previously, StarkWare CEO Eli Ben Sasson, the company behind the STARK proof that contributes to the development of Starknet, said OP_CAT , a Satoshi-era opcode for unlocking programmability on Bitcoin that was disabled over security concerns, would allow Starknet to settle on the Bitcoin blockchain. If successful, Starknet said the move would allow developers to build applications on the Bitcoin network through smart contracts and enable applications such as staking, borrowing, lending, leveraged trading, and yield farming. As part of the announcement, StarkWare said it has joined the growing number of firms in creating a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, holding a growing portion of its treasury in crypto. Source: Ameen Soleimani Starknet will also team up with Bitcoin Web3 wallet Xverse, whose founder and CEO Ken Liao said the integration, slated for the second quarter of 2025, will achieve Bitcoin’s “DeFi take-off moment.” Xverse said wallets need to be more than just storage solutions; and allow easy access to Bitcoin’s growing utility. Liao said in a statement that the endgame is trustless DeFi on Bitcoin. Related: Unknown attacker causes headaches during Pectra upgrade on Sepolia “In today’s environment, there is a temptation for wallet teams to say, ‘yeah, let’s just focus on making it easier for people to use Bitcoin as a store of value,’” Liao said. “But the long-term future of Bitcoin also includes utility, and that’s why layer 2 solutions must reach the public via the wallets they actually use,” he added. Meanwhile, in a March 11 X space discussing Starknet’s plan, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said a proper Bitcoin L2 that can satisfy the needed security properties would “make crypto payments great again, and all those use cases can work.” Starknet on Bitcoin and Ethereum https://t.co/tCyQDHY7Yr — StarkWare 🐺🐱 (@StarkWareLtd) March 11, 2025 Buterin said there is a “lot of value” in enabling the trustless flow of assets between the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems, such as easier paths for decentralized exchange. “If you go back to the white paper, Bitcoin was meant to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and obviously, layer 1 is not nearly scalable enough for that,” Buterin said. “I think we’ve also seen some of the limits of the Lightning Network and that kind of approach.“ Magazine: MegaETH launch could save Ethereum… but at what cost?",,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|STRK|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 02:57:41

Similarly, Senator Cynthia Lummis echoed the same sentiment on X, stating that ‘Big Things are coming every day’ and that she is ‘for real this time.'” Some speculate that this could suggest the U.S. is preparing to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. While some humorously hope that it’s not another round of higher interest rates or more tariffs. Senator Lummis Reintroduces Bitcoin Act! Recently, Senator Lummis revealed that she has reintroduced the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act to Trump, proposing the purchase of $81 billion worth of Bitcoin by 2025. The BITCOIN Act is back. pic.twitter.com/WNeU6SWPj3 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) March 11, 2025 The bill, originally introduced by Lummis last year, proposes that the government purchase 1 million bitcoins over five years. These bitcoins would then be stored in a “decentralized network” of storage facilities. According to a press release, the funds for purchasing bitcoins would come from “diversifying existing funds” in the Federal Reserve system. The first $6 billion in remittances from reserve banks would be set aside each year from 2025 to 2029 to build the reserve. The plan would also use the Fed’s gold certificates. Lummis stated that Bitcoin is not just a tech opportunity but a national necessity for America’s financial leadership in the 21st century. She added, “By turning the president’s executive action into law, we can use digital innovation to address the national debt and maintain our global competitiveness.” This move could boost the legitimacy of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This reserve was recently created by President Donald Trump with an Executive Order, making this bill a key step in strengthening the U.S.’s position on Bitcoin. A Slight Difference In Plan Lummis’s new legislation, backed by several Republican Senators, is slightly different from Trump’s plan. While Lummis wants the government to buy 1 million bitcoins over five years, Trump’s executive order focuses on using bitcoin seized by law enforcement, alongside other digital assets from forfeitures, to create a strategic reserve. David Sacks, Trump’s crypto and AI advisor, reassured that this plan won’t cost taxpayers a penny. The government will only use assets already seized through legal proceedings. The order also asks the Treasury and Commerce departments to find ways to acquire more bitcoin without impacting the budget. However, Trump’s push for a crypto reserve has sparked mixed reactions across the industry.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 03:07:00

41516051,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710572,1741750235,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Suppressed? Bitwise CIO Predicts Market Shock Post-Lawsuit,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bitwise-cio-predicts-market-shock-post-lawsuit/,"In an interview with the Paul Barron Network, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan expressed his perspective on the long-debated regulatory battle surrounding XRP and its potential market reaction once legal uncertainties are resolved. According to Hougan, the crypto asset—long restrained by litigation—may be significantly undervalued, with the potential for a sharp market correction following a favorable resolution to its legal entanglements. Since 2020, XRP has been entangled in a legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which accused Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering. The lawsuit has cast a long shadow over the token, restricting its growth within the US market and leading to its delisting from several major exchanges in the past. Related Reading: Analyst Says Only Buy XRP If It Reaches This Level Now, with the lawsuit potentially reaching its final ruling by April 16, according to Barron, market participants are speculating on XRP’s future trajectory. Hougan weighed in on the matter, pointing out that a resolution could unlock significant latent demand and shift the narrative around the asset. “From my 30,000-foot view, specific to XRP, I think there’s a significant chunk of the crypto market that has sort of written it off or forgotten about it. And I think that part of the market is wrong,” Hougan stated. What Happens Post-Lawsuit With XRP? One of the key takeaways from Hougan’s analysis is the idea that XRP remains an unknown variable in the broader crypto landscape. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which have seen major adoption and institutional inflows, XRP has remained stagnant due to regulatory overhang. If the lawsuit concludes with clarity that allows unrestricted US adoption, the real potential of XRP in global finance could finally be realized. “The reality is, XRP has been suppressed by litigation for multiple years, and we don’t yet know what it can do on the global stage when it’s freed from those restraints,” he added. While Hougan did not make outright price predictions, he did note that institutional and retail sentiment could pivot quickly if XRP gains renewed regulatory clarity in the US. Related Reading: XRP Flirts With A Daily Range Breakdown – Price Must Hold Above $2 Level The discussion also delved into Japan’s aggressive adoption of XRP, with SBI Holdings leading the charge in integrating the asset into its digital banking ecosystem. As noted in the interview, XRP has now surpassed Ethereum in Japanese investor holdings, signaling deep institutional confidence in its future. Paul Barron emphasized that Japan’s approach could foreshadow broader global adoption: “SBI seems to be doing with XRP what Michael Saylor did with Bitcoin—strategically accumulating and positioning it for long-term institutional use.” Hougan agreed, highlighting that XRP’s role in international remittances and liquidity solutions remains underappreciated, and the ongoing legal battle has hindered a more comprehensive evaluation of its utility-driven demand. Another major topic of discussion was the possibility of an spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). While Hougan did not reveal any detail about Bitwise’s ETF filing and its progress with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he highlighted the firm’s confidence. “We don’t file for ETPs for fun. We file for them because we think they can launch, and we think there is a significant audience, and we think it’s an important asset.” While some analysts argue that XRP’s legal troubles have already been priced in, Hougan’s comments concluded that the potential upside remains largely ignored by the broader market. If the SEC case concludes favorably, the re-listing of XRP on major US exchanges, new institutional flows, and expanded adoption in banking systems could lead to a market repricing event. “There’s no guarantee XRP will be enormously successful, but there’s equally no guarantee that it won’t be,” Hougan emphasized. At press time, XRP traded at $2.12.

Despite this bearishness, a veteran trader and analyst explains his ideal scenario for a Bitcoin price bottom and a bullish reversal that leads to a $100,000 revisit. Ideal Scenario for a Bitcoin Price Bottom According to Analyst Due to the 23% crash in Bitcoin price from a high of $99,431 to $76,560, the outlook for crypto markets has been bearish, at least until BTC forms a potential bottom. RektProof, a veteran trader who turned $500 to nearly $360K, posted his thoughts on a potential Bitcoin bottom. According to this expert, Bitcoin price will likely form a bottom in the high time frame demand zone, extending from $73,000 to $65,000. This means that RektProof is expecting another leg down, i.e., after the sweep of the recently formed local high of around $83,000. Analyst’s Ideal Scenario For Bitcoin Price Bottom Before $100,000 BTC/USDT 1-hour chart Analysts’ Price Targets After BTC Bottoms? To predict Bitcoin price targets after a potential bottom formation, the analyst considers the 21% price swing between February 28 and March 2, extending from $78,200 to $94,984. A sweep of $78,200 into a high time frame demand zone could lead to a rally that revisits roughly $95K. However, this is the short-term Bitcoin price rally that the analyst is expecting. From a long-term perspective, RektProof expects a dip into the HTF demand zone to be a bottom that leads to a new all-time high of $130,000. BTC/USDT 1-hour chart So, the expert forecasts two Bitcoin price targets , one at $95,000 and the other at $130,000 . Bitcoin’s Options Data Hints Investors Are Hedging for Further Downside According to a researcher and analyst, CNO, the bottom is still not in and indicates that the “(crypto) market is still hedged for downside.” CNO sends a warning signal for eager bulls, indicating that there might be another flush to the downside before Bitcoin price reenters the $85,000 to $95,000 range. The basis for his prediction is options data that measures the call and put options pricing over time to gauge market sentiment and potential price direction. BTC Options In other tweets , CNO highlights that this flush will likely occur in the next few days due to the blood moon lunar eclipse that will catalyze heightened volatility for crypto markets, including BTC’s value . So, the overall Bitcoin price forecast from two analysts suggests another temporary but downside move that could lead to a bottom formation before BTC price targets $100K or a new ATH at $130K.

The miner became the 297th solo miner to mine a Bitcoin block from the solo.ckpool Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining pool, its developer, Con Kolivas, said in a March 10 X post. He added the miner used a 480-gigahash per second (GH/s) Bitaxe machine. For comparison, many big crypto-mining companies use machines that can operate at over 230,000 GH/s. “A miner of this size has only less than a 1 in a million chance of finding a block per day, or put alternatively, would take 3,500 years to find a block on average,” Kolivas added. The miner snared a total of 3.15 BTC for solving block 887,212, which was timestamped on March 10 at 7:22 pm UTC. That bounty includes the current 3.125 Bitcoin mining reward and another 0.025 Bitcoin from transaction fees, mempool.space data shows . Source: Con Kolivas A 1,200 gigahash Bitaxe Gamma 601 machine, which is nearly three times more powerful than the one used by the solo miner, is priced at around $158, according to Bitcoin miner marketplace ASIC Miner Value. ASIC Miner Value estimates that the Bitaxe Gamma 601 will make just over $20 a year while using around $18 worth of electricity, coming out to a yearly net profit of under $3. The Bitaxe Gamma 601 is roughly the size of a smartphone. Source: ASIC Miner Value It also states the odds of the Bitaxe Gamma 601 mining a solo block on any given day is one in 4.6 million, or one in 12,700 over a year. Related: Solo miner snags Bitcoin block reward worth $300K Solo Bitcoin miners rarely solve blocks, let alone those with tiny mining rigs. Most Bitcoin is mined from the larger pools such as Foundry USA — which obtains a large share of its hashrate from public Bitcoin miners like Cipher Mining, Bitfarms and Hut 8. The largest public Bitcoin mining firm by market cap and hashrate, MARA Holdings, uses its own Bitcoin mining pool, MARA Pool. While pocket-sized Bitcoin miners are hardly profitable, some of these micro miners are being built in an open-source manner to fight the “secrecy and exclusivity” of the Bitcoin mining industry, one of the builders of Bitaxe miners, “Skot,” told Cointelegraph in a September 2023 interview. Most Bitcoin miners, such as those made by Bitmai,n are closed-sourced, which runs contrary to Bitcoin’s ethos, Skot said. “The advent of these open-source projects serves to shed light on this often opaque area, making it more transparent and accessible to the public.” Magazine: Train AI agents to make better predictions… for token rewards",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 03:37:03

On March 11, the House of Representatives voted 292 for and 132 against a motion to repeal the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule that aimed to expand existing IRS reporting requirements to crypto. All 132 votes to keep the rule were Democrats. However, 76 of those in the party joined the Republican vote to repeal it. This follows the US Senate’s March 4 vote on the motion to repeal, which saw it pass with a vote of 70 to 27. The rule would force DeFi platforms, such as decentralized exchanges, to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions. Speaking after the vote, Republican Representative Mike Carey, who submitted the repeal motion, said, “The DeFi broker rule invades the privacy of tens of millions of Americans, hinders the development of an important new industry in the United States and would overwhelm the IRS.” Congressman Mike Carey speaking after the vote. Source: Mike Carey House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill also applauded the overturning of the rule, calling it “a clear example of government overreach that threatens to push American digital asset development overseas.” The resolution will need to pass another Senate vote before being sent to President Donald Trump, who has signaled he’d support it. Those opposing the rule repeal included Democrat Representative Lloyd Doggett, who said getting a “special interest exemption” from IRS disclosures “makes tax evasion and money laundering so much easier for wealthy Republican donors who have been using these decentralized exchanges.” He claimed killing the rule would create a “loophole that would be exploited by wealthy tax cheats, drug traffickers and terrorist financiers.” Related: US lawmakers advance resolution to repeal ‘unfair’ crypto tax rule In early March, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks said the administration would support congressional efforts to rescind the DeFi broker rule. At the time, officials from the Office of Management and Budget wrote “This rule … would stifle American innovation and raise privacy concerns over the sharing of taxpayers’ personal information, while imposing an unprecedented compliance burden on American DeFi companies.” Magazine: Mystery celeb memecoin scam factory, HK firm dumps Bitcoin: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 04:08:09

This includes imports from the other trading partners of the United States. This announcement came after Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick discussed turning down the electricity surcharge plan in exchange for easing Canadian metals’ tariffs. Ford added that a meeting had been arranged on Thursday with Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The meeting will be based on re-establishing the trade pact between the US, Mexico, and Canada before Trump imposes automobile tariffs on Canada on April 2. Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister-designate, said Trump’s tariffs are a direct attack on the country’s households and businesses. He says Canadian tariffs will continue until the U.S. makes “credible, reliable commitments” to fair trade. Ottawa has been alarmingly aware of Trump’s threat to annex Canada. Officials believe that Trump may act on these threats, causing serious harm to the Canadian economy. Trump’s tariffs threats lead to stock market losses The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 1.1%.S&P experienced a drop of 0.8%. Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2%. All these indexes experienced their worst two-day drop since August 2024. However, these stock market indexes experienced some recovery following the reports about Ontario backing off from electricity export tax. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the US is in a “period of economic transition from the mess that was created under Joe Biden and the previous administration.” Officials have emphasized that metal imports will not be exempt from the tariffs starting Wednesday. “The White House has shown itself to be adaptable on this tariff issue”, says Sen. Bill Hagerty, an ambassador to Japan during Trump’s first term. He added “I’ve seen him do steel and aluminum tariffs before, so I have no reason to not expect that will take place.” The observers at Capitol Hill see uncertainty in the final policy outcome due to U.S. past exemptions of Canada and Mexico’s tariffs.

Dogecoin has gained widespread popularity since its inception in 2013. While several factors have driven DOGE’s popularity over the years, investors cannot ignore Elon Musk's influence on the firstborn memecoin.Musk’s Effect on Dogecoin Tesla's CEO remains one of the top advocates who brought significant attention to DOGE during the 2020/2021 market cycle. The American businessman has continued to draw significant attention to DOGE by characterizing the token as the “people’s crypto.” Three months after this comment, the price of DOGE spiked to an all-time high of $0.7376 per token on May 8, 20221. Although DOGE has plunged significantly from its peak, many believe that the influence of public figures like Musk, alongside strong institutional adoption, could propel Dogecoin’s price to new heights. Amid this optimism, some imagine a scenario where DOGE’s market cap might match Musk’s net worth. Overview of DOGE Market Cap vs Elon Musk's Net Worth Musk is currently the world’s richest man, boasting an estimated net worth of $342.4 billion as of March 8, 2024. He is the CEO of several multi-billion dollar companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter). Elon Musk Net Worth On the other hand, DOGE stands as the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency globally, with a market cap of $28.94 billion. At this valuation, DOGE is trading at $0.1951, marking a 24-hour decrease of 5.37%. DOGE Price If It Equals Musk Net Worth For DOGE to match Musk’s net worth of $342.4 billion, its market cap must grow more than tenfold from its current value. Specifically, DOGE’s market cap must soar astronomically by 1,083% from its current valuation of $28.94 billion to equal Musk’s $342.4 billion net worth. If this hypothetical scenario happens, Dogecoin will be worth $2.3 per token, assuming its circulating supply of 148.34 billion DOGE remains relatively stable. To demonstrate the significance of this rally, a portfolio of 100,000 DOGE, currently valued at $19,510, will be worth $230,000 if DOGE hits the $2.3 projected target. DOGE to $2.3 Prediction Interestingly, several crypto experts, including Dogecoin’s co-founder Billy Markus, have predicted DOGE’s potential surge to the $2 mark. In January, Markus called for an upsurge of 500% that could potentially take DOGE’s price to $2.3. At the time, he envisioned the possibility of the token being supported as a tipping currency on X. A few weeks later, renowned crypto analyst Javon Marks referenced DOGE’s historical price pattern to predict the meme coin’s future rally to around the $2.3 mark. Meanwhile, Changelly experts set a timeline on when DOGE might hit the $2.3 target. According to the experts, the $2.3 price projection could become a reality for DOGE by July 2032, more than seven years from now. However, the popular prediction platform Telegaon suggests that DOGE might reach the $2.3 target early next year. It remains to be seen whether DOGE will reach this target or what the exact timeline is for this to happen. In the meantime, investors must exercise caution and seek professional advice before investing in cryptocurrencies like DOGE.",Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-03-12 04:50:53

On March 11, the US House of Representatives approved a resolution to overturn the Biden Administration’s controversial “Broker Rule.” Resolution Approved to Overturn “Broker Rule” The US House of Representatives voted 292-132 to approve H.J Res. 25, aiming to overturn the controversial Biden Administration “Broker Rule.” The resolution seeks to eliminate an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that requires certain brokers, including DeFi entities, to report transaction details. Bloomberg Law reports that the bipartisan vote seeks to relieve decentralized crypto exchanges from reporting sales, proceeds, and transaction details, explaining that the rule is “burdensome for business.” The bipartisan vote followed a Senate resolution to overturn an IRS rule that classified DeFi software developers as “brokers.” On March 4, the S.J. Res.28, led by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, 70-28. The resolution was co-sponsored by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tim Sheehy (R-Utah), and Ted Budd (R-N.C.). Rep. Carey introduced the joint resolution in the House of Representatives. The IRS rule in question expanded the definition of “broker” to include DeFi protocols, requiring certain brokers to report the gross proceeds from digital asset sales. In a press release issued by Senator Cruz’s office, he said: “Last night’s vote was a victory for American innovation. In a midnight move, the Biden administration attempted to undermine American privacy and impose burdensome regulations on digital currency. Yesterday, an overwhelming bipartisan majority voted in support of my legislation to rescind this harmful regulation.” Significant Win for Digital Assets According to critics, the controversial “Broker Rule” opposed excessive burdens on digital asset transactions and stifled innovation within the sector. The press release from Cruz’s office explained the Broker Rule “defined those developers as “brokers,” even though they did not touch any of the cryptocurrency being exchanged.” Proponents of the resolutions argue the rule imposes unnecessary compliance costs and suppresses crypto development, threatening to drive such development offshore. Following the March 5 win, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR) shared his support of the decision: “The previous Administration’s controversial ‘Broker Rule’ is a clear example of government overreach that threatens to push American digital asset development overseas. I was proud to protect America’s leadership in the digital asset ecosystem and vote to overturn this harmful, anti-innovation midnight rulemaking.” Kristin Smith, CEO of Blockchain Association, an NPO dedicated to promoting a pro-innovation policy environment for the digital asset economy, commented: “Today’s a bright day for DeFi – and all of crypto – in the United States. An incredible showing of bipartisan support passed Senator Ted Cruz’s Congressional Review Act resolution to roll back the DeFi-killing broker rule out of the Senate. It’s a hopeful sign that shows there is true bipartisan agreement in Washington that the American crypto industry deserves the freedom to grow and innovate here in the United States.” While President Donald Trump must sign the resolution to become law, the White House will likely support the measure as it aligns with the Administration’s broader strategy to foster innovation in the digital asset sector.

In a slew of filings on March 11, the agency said it has “designated a longer period” to decide on the proposed rule changes that would allow the ETFs to proceed. Among the affected ETFs are Grayscale’s XRP ( XRP ) and Cboe BZX Exchange’s spot Solana ( SOL ) ETF filings , with the decisions on them pushed until May. The SEC has delayed making a decision to approve several altcoin ETFs. Source: SEC Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a March 11 X post that while the SEC just “punted on a bunch of altcoin ETF filings,” he didn’t see it as a cause for concern. “It’s expected, as this is standard procedure.” He added that US President Donald Trump’s pick to chair the SEC, Paul Atkins, “hasn’t even been confirmed yet.” “This doesn’t change our (relatively high) odds of approval. Also note that the final deadlines aren’t until October,” Seyffart said. Source: Samuel Maverick Fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also chimed in, saying that “everything [is] delayed,” including ETFs featuring Ether ( ETH ) staking and in-kind redemptions . Un early December, Trump picked pro-crypto businessman and former SEC Commissioner Atkins to be the agency’s next chair. However, congressional confirmation hearings are yet to be scheduled. This is not the first time the SEC has extended an ETF decision deadline. On Feb. 28, it extended the deadline for Cboe Exchange’s request to list options tied to Ether ( ETH ) ETFs. This followed the SEC receiving a raft of altcoin ETF filings in the wake of Trump’s election and the resignation of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler . Related: Altcoin ETFs are coming, but demand may be limited: Analysts Gensler’s time at the SEC came with what the industry said was an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto , with 100 crypto-related regulatory actions during his tenure from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20. Since Gensler’s departure, a growing number of firms facing legal action from the regulator have had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4 . Meanwhile, acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda has also proposed abandoning part of a rule change that would have expanded regulation of alternative trading systems to include crypto firms.

His tweets suggest that while Bitcoin remains outside traditional financial structures, XRP is becoming increasingly integrated. This distinction, he argues, is influencing regulatory actions and institutional adoption. Bitcoin Outside the System, XRP Within In his latest tweet, SMQKE stated , “This is why attacks on XRP are increasing. Crypto is merging with the traditional financial system. Bitcoin operates outside that system. This is why attacks on XRP are increasing. Crypto is merging with the traditional financial system. Bitcoin operates outside that system. Meanwhile, XRP has been aligned with it from the start. https://t.co/CLkWTOIVKi pic.twitter.com/g7idBVAOzW — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 9, 2025 Meanwhile, XRP has been aligned with it from the start.” His perspective suggests that XRP’s deepening alignment with regulated financial institutions is making it a target of criticism, while Bitcoin continues to operate as an alternative outside mainstream finance. His previous tweet elaborated on this distinction: “The Bitcoin vs. XRP narrative is quietly being reversed. Why? Because Bitcoin ‘falls outside the system.’ Now, the IMF is pressuring countries not to use it as legal tender. Meanwhile, XRP ‘falls within the system.’ So ask yourself—what will the IMF push countries to adopt? Crypto assets that fall outside or inside the traditional system?” The mention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aligns with ongoing discussions about Bitcoin’s regulatory treatment. The IMF has repeatedly warned against nations adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, citing volatility and financial stability concerns. In contrast, XRP, designed for institutional use, appears to align more closely with global regulatory frameworks. Regulatory Integration and Institutional Adoption The images attached to SMQKE’s tweets reinforce this perspective. One document discusses how regulatory clarity paves the way for mainstream crypto adoption, stating, “Cryptoasset adoption is moving from the fringes of finance to the largest and most venerable trade centers in the world. Banks cannot afford to miss the moment.” This suggests an increasing role for digital assets within traditional finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another highlighted passage states, “The question of whether a given cryptoasset will be recognized as part of the formal payment system will largely depend on how it is meant to be used in a given jurisdiction. Bitcoin and Ether often fall outside, while XRP often falls within the system.” This further supports the idea that XRP is positioned within the regulated financial ecosystem, unlike Bitcoin, which remains separate. The discussion also touches on how different jurisdictions treat cryptoassets, with some banning them outright while others integrate them into legal frameworks. This divide influences how institutional investors and financial bodies interact with digital assets. XRP’s ability to fit within existing financial structures may make it a preferred option for regulatory acceptance compared to Bitcoin. Future of Crypto Regulation SMQKE’s observations highlight an evolving crypto landscape where assets that conform to regulatory standards may gain institutional backing, while those that remain outside the system could face increasing restrictions. If international financial organizations like the IMF continue to discourage Bitcoin adoption while supporting regulated crypto assets, the regulatory environment may increasingly favor tokens like XRP. The broader question remains whether regulatory pressures will shape the future of digital assets based on their compatibility with traditional finance. As governments and institutions integrate blockchain technology, distinguishing between “inside the system” and “outside the system” may define which assets thrive in the evolving financial order.

With the new tool, users can test strategies employed by more experienced traders and gain confidence in their trading skills before committing to the platform. Crypto copy trading While copy trading is typically a welcome feature on most exchanges, it is not without its problems, particularly considering that gains are never guaranteed, even when traders are executed by market veterans. WOO X’s new Demo Copy feature seeks to remedy some of the issues by allowing users to practice copy trading in a simulated environment, similar to how demo accounts allow users to try and practice investing without committing real funds. That is, with Demo Copy, users can simulate trades by copying top traders’ strategies without using real funds. Each trade’s performance, based on key metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and Profit and Loss (PnL), can be tracked from an interactive dashboard. While practicing, users can compare different strategies to identify the best performers, counter-copy less successful ones, and transition to actual copy trading once they have gained enough insight into the crypto market . Driving crypto adoption According to Ben Yorke, Ecosystem VP at WOO X, Demo Copy encourages crypto adoption by lowering entry barriers and making trading more accessible: WOO X has likewise promised to analyze the impact of Demo Copy on real copy trading adoption to ensure continuous improvements on the platform. As such, Demo Copy builds on WOO X’s already established Social Trading features — such as CounterTrading, which allows for strategic hedging against lead traders — and its Fair Profit-Sharing Model, which ensures profits are only shared when traders are in profit. In addition, enhanced risk management tools, such as WOO Shield and isolated portfolios, further emphasize the platform’s commitment to innovation and risk management.

The asset remains 25.1% below its all-time high of $109,000, recorded in January. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has seen an additional 0.7% decline, reflecting ongoing market hesitation and uncertainty among investors. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain has identified a notable trend in Bitcoin’s price channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Future Comes Down To This One Question, Says Bitwise Bitcoin Coinbase Premium and Market Sentiment Despite Bitcoin’s downward trajectory, the Coinbase premium has been forming higher lows, indicating potential underlying demand. However, the CryptoQuant analyst warns that no clear signals of a breakout or reversal have emerged, leaving the market in an uncertain state. Particularly, according to Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin’s price remains within a declining price channel, with repeated pullbacks making it difficult to determine a clear trend. Avocado noted: So far, there is no decisive movement indicating a full-fledged downtrend, but at the same time, there are no clear signs of a bullish reversal either. The market is becoming increasingly uncertain, creating an environment designed to confuse and unsettle investors. The Coinbase premium, which measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on Coinbase and other exchanges, has shown higher lows despite the downward price action. This could suggest that US-based investors are still accumulating BTC, even as the broader market struggles to find direction. The analyst cautions against overleveraging on bullish news or panic selling during downturns, emphasizing that strategic decisions should be made ahead of time rather than in reaction to market fluctuations. While there is no confirmation of a bear market, Avocado believes that exiting positions based on short-term fear could lead to missed opportunities in the long run. The analyst wrote: From my perspective, there isn’t enough data to declare a bear market at this point. Abandoning positions now could end up being an ill-timed exit rather than a calculated decision. Miner Selling Pressure and Market Implications Adding to the market pressure, CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech has noted a spike in BTC miner selling activity. Data shows that as Bitcoin dropped to $77,700, miners increased their BTC transfers to exchanges, a move that historically signals selling pressure at market lows. Related Reading: ‘The Magic Line’: Key Support Level At $74,000 Determines Bitcoin Bull Or Bear Future Miners often sell BTC to cover operational costs, especially during price declines. If miner selling pressure continues, it could limit Bitcoin’s ability to recover in the short term. However, if buyer demand remains strong enough to absorb the excess supply, Bitcoin may stabilize at its current levels before attempting a rebound.

This week, all eyes are glued to the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release, and its potential ripple effects across currency markets, particularly in Asia. Let’s dive into why Asia FX is currently muted, how the dollar is flexing its muscles, and what this all means for you. Why is Asia FX Currently Muted? The foreign exchange (FX) markets in Asia are displaying a sense of cautious calm, or as some might say, are ‘muted’. This isn’t necessarily a sign of inactivity, but rather an indication that traders are holding their breath, anticipating a significant economic indicator. But what exactly does ‘muted’ mean in the context of Asia FX ? Reduced Volatility: We’re seeing less dramatic swings in the exchange rates of Asian currencies compared to the US dollar and other major global currencies. Narrow Trading Ranges: The difference between the highest and lowest prices for currencies like the Korean Won, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar within a trading day is tighter than usual. Lower Trading Volumes: Some market participants are choosing to sit on the sidelines, leading to decreased overall trading activity in Asia FX pairs. This muted behavior largely stems from the looming release of the US CPI data. Think of it like waiting for the starter pistol at a race – everyone is poised, ready to react, but holding steady until they hear the signal. Dollar Gains Ground: A Safe Haven or More? While Asia FX is taking a breather, the US dollar is showing noticeable strength. The ‘greenback’ is gaining ground against a basket of currencies, including those in Asia. But why is this happening, and is it just a temporary surge? Several factors are contributing to the dollar’s upward trajectory: Safe Haven Demand: In times of global economic uncertainty or anticipation of market-moving data, the US dollar is often perceived as a safe haven asset. Investors flock to the dollar, believing it will hold its value better than riskier assets during turbulent times. Anticipation of Hawkish Fed: Stronger-than-expected CPI data could reinforce expectations that the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) will maintain its hawkish stance on monetary policy. This means potentially continuing with interest rate hikes to combat inflation. Higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive to investors, boosting demand for the dollar. Economic Resilience (Perceived): Despite global headwinds, the US economy has shown a degree of resilience. This perception, even if debated, supports the dollar’s strength as investors see the US as a relatively stable economic powerhouse. However, it’s crucial to remember that dollar gains can be influenced by various global events and are not always linear. The CPI data will be a critical test for the sustainability of this dollar strength. CPI Data Looms: Why is it a Market Mover? So, why is this CPI data release causing such a stir and influencing currency markets across Asia and globally? Simply put, the CPI, or Consumer Price Index, is a key measure of inflation. It tracks the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. Think of it as a snapshot of how much more or less expensive everyday things are becoming. Here’s why CPI data is a market mover: Factor Impact on Markets Inflation Gauge CPI is the primary indicator of inflation for many central banks, including the US Federal Reserve. High inflation can erode purchasing power and impact economic growth. Central Bank Policy Driver Central banks, like the Fed, use CPI data to guide their monetary policy decisions. Higher CPI can lead to interest rate hikes to cool down the economy and curb inflation. Lower CPI might suggest a need for rate cuts to stimulate growth. Market Expectations vs. Reality Markets are driven by expectations. If the actual CPI data deviates significantly from economists’ forecasts, it can trigger sharp market reactions, including currency fluctuations. A higher-than-expected CPI could strengthen the dollar, while a lower-than-expected reading might weaken it. Impact on Forex Trends CPI data directly impacts forex trends . Changes in interest rate expectations, driven by CPI, influence currency valuations. For instance, if strong CPI data suggests further US rate hikes, investors might buy dollars, anticipating higher returns on dollar-denominated assets. In essence, the CPI data acts as a critical piece of the puzzle for understanding the future direction of interest rates, inflation, and consequently, currency markets . Navigating Forex Trends Amidst CPI Uncertainty For those involved in forex trading or simply monitoring currency movements, the current environment presents both challenges and opportunities. So, how can one navigate these forex trends with CPI data looming? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the actual CPI data release and expert analysis following it. Reputable financial news sources and economic calendars are invaluable tools. Manage Risk: Given the potential for volatility, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider using stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging your positions. Consider Dollar Pairs: With the dollar exhibiting strength, currency pairs involving the USD (like USD/JPY, EUR/USD, AUD/USD) are likely to be particularly active and sensitive to the CPI release. Look Beyond the Immediate Reaction: Market reactions to CPI data can be immediate and sometimes knee-jerk. Try to understand the underlying implications for longer-term forex trends rather than just reacting to short-term spikes. Diversification: In times of uncertainty, diversification across different currency pairs and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Remember, no one can predict the future with certainty, especially in the fast-paced world of forex trading . However, being well-informed, prepared, and disciplined are crucial for navigating periods of market uncertainty like the one we’re currently in. Conclusion: Awaiting the CPI Verdict The muted Asia FX markets and the strengthening dollar are clear indicators of the market’s anticipation of the US CPI data. This economic release is not just another number; it’s a potential catalyst that could reshape forex trends and influence central bank policies. Whether the CPI data confirms expectations, surprises to the upside, or disappoints to the downside, it promises to inject volatility and direction into the currency markets. For traders and observers alike, the coming hours and days will be crucial in understanding the next chapter for Asia FX and the global financial landscape. The markets are poised, and the world is watching – what will the CPI verdict be?

One day you’re riding high on waves of optimism, the next you’re bracing for a market crash. Keeping a pulse on market sentiment is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes into play. Recently, we’ve witnessed a significant shift in this key market indicator. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Sentiment Compass The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is a powerful tool designed to gauge the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a sentiment compass, pointing towards the prevailing emotions driving investor behavior. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This zone indicates that investors are excessively worried. It can often signal a potential buying opportunity as assets may be undervalued. 25-49: Fear – While still negative, ‘Fear’ suggests a slightly less intense level of anxiety. Investors are cautious, but perhaps starting to see glimmers of hope. 50-74: Greed – This zone reflects growing optimism. Investors are becoming more confident and willing to take risks, potentially leading to market rallies. 75-100: Extreme Greed – ‘Extreme Greed’ signals excessive market exuberance. This can be a warning sign of a potential market bubble, as valuations may become unsustainable. The index isn’t based on guesswork; it’s calculated using a blend of six weighted factors, providing a holistic view of market sentiment: Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusual volatility spikes often indicate fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and volume against the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volume usually indicates greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags. High positive interaction rates can suggest greed. Surveys 15% Periodically conducts crypto surveys to gauge investor sentiment directly. (Currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased dominance can sometimes indicate fear as investors flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Rising search interest can indicate greed and increased retail investor participation. The Shift to the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does It Mean for Crypto? As of March 12th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered a value of 34, a notable 10-point jump from the previous day. This upward movement signifies a crucial shift – the index has transitioned from the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (below 25) into the ‘Fear’ zone (25-49). But what does this actually tell us about the current state of the crypto market and potential future movements? This climb out of ‘Extreme Fear’ suggests a tentative improvement in crypto market sentiment . While ‘Fear’ still dominates, it’s a step away from the deep pessimism that characterizes ‘Extreme Fear’. Several factors could be contributing to this shift: Market Stabilization: After periods of intense volatility and price drops, markets often experience a period of consolidation. This stabilization can ease investor anxieties and reduce extreme fear. Positive Newsflow: Even amidst broader market uncertainty, pockets of positive news – such as adoption updates, technological advancements, or regulatory clarity in certain regions – can inject optimism into the market. Accumulation at Lower Prices: Savvy investors often view periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ as opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. Increased buying activity can contribute to a gradual shift in sentiment. Is Bitcoin Dominance a Key Indicator in the Fear Shift? Bitcoin dominance , one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, warrants closer attention. Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market can fluctuate based on risk appetite. During times of fear and uncertainty, investors often seek the relative safety of Bitcoin, increasing its dominance. Conversely, in bullish phases, investors may diversify into altcoins, reducing Bitcoin’s dominance. Analyzing Bitcoin dominance alongside the overall Fear & Greed Index can provide deeper insights. If the Fear & Greed Index is rising while Bitcoin dominance is stable or decreasing, it might suggest a broader recovery across the crypto market, with altcoins also participating in the improved sentiment. However, if the Fear & Greed Index is rising primarily due to increased Bitcoin dominance, it could indicate a flight to safety rather than a widespread bullish reversal. Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors make of this move into the ‘Fear’ zone? Here are some actionable insights: Acknowledge the Sentiment Shift: Recognize that market sentiment is improving, but caution is still warranted. ‘Fear’ is still the prevailing emotion, suggesting ongoing uncertainty. Don’t Get Carried Away: While the shift is positive, avoid impulsive decisions driven by early optimism. A move from ‘Extreme Fear’ to ‘Fear’ is not necessarily a signal of an immediate bull run. Monitor the Index Closely: Keep a close watch on the Fear & Greed Index. Continued upward movement towards ‘Greed’ could signal further recovery. Conversely, a reversal back into ‘Extreme Fear’ would indicate renewed market anxieties. Consider Fundamental Analysis: Don’t rely solely on sentiment indicators. Combine the Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis of projects you’re interested in. Assess their technology, adoption, and long-term potential. Manage Risk Prudently: Continue to practice sound risk management. Diversify your portfolio, invest only what you can afford to lose, and avoid excessive leverage, especially in volatile market conditions. Cautious Optimism: The Path Ahead for Crypto Market Sentiment The leap of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into the ‘Fear’ zone is a noteworthy development.

The blockchain entrepreneur, who co-founded the HyperVerse and HyperFund crypto investment schemes, is facing fraud charges from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Prosecutors accuse him of running a $1.89 billion Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors worldwide. The SEC alleges that Lee and his co-conspirators operated a multi-level marketing scam disguised as a high-return crypto investment. From June 2020 to November 2022, investors were lured in with promises of guaranteed profits, but instead, their money was funneled into a fraudulent system. One of Lee’s key promoters, Brenda Chunga, has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, admitting that HyperFund “mined” investors’ funds rather than cryptocurrencies . One analyst tracked his scam history. Here’s what happened so far. Update: #SamLee , co-founder of #HyperVerse and #HyperFund , faces $1.89B Ponzi scheme charges for defrauding thousands worldwide. Although charged in a $2B #PonziScheme , Sam Lee denies any wrongdoing and remains active in Dubai’s #Crypto scene with new projects. #CoinPedia … pic.twitter.com/A0HO4sjDrF — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) March 12, 2025 A Web of Lies and Fake CEOs Investigations have uncovered deeper layers of deception. Lee allegedly used a fake CEO to front the HyperVerse scheme, misleading investors about its legitimacy. He also had connections to the now-collapsed Australian crypto firm Blockchain Global, raising suspicions about his past dealings. The crackdown has ruined his reputation, and few now support him. Arrest in Dubai – But Is Justice Coming? In November 2024, Lee voluntarily surrendered to Dubai authorities following an Interpol Red Notice. He was detained for 60 days before being released, sparking speculation about whether he will ever face justice in the United States. The DOJ is charging Lee with conspiracy for securities and wire fraud, which could mean five years in prison. The SEC is also suing him for illegally selling unregistered securities. A Defiant Stance Despite the mounting legal trouble, Lee remains defiant. In a video interview with Bloomberg, he dismissed the accusations, claiming that multi-level marketing is legitimate and that U.S. regulators are simply trying to suppress crypto. He also praised Dubai’s regulatory environment , hinting at future ventures in the space. His closing remarks— “there are many exciting projects on the horizon”—have sparked concerns that he may already be plotting his next scheme. These fears have only grown stronger as a series of nine YouTube videos promoting his new venture have resurfaced. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : GainBitcoin Scam: CBI Seizes $2.75M in Crypto After 60 Raids in India , Red Flags to Watch Out For Sam Lee’s new venture shows worrying signs of another scam. He still relies on affiliate marketing and unclear token systems, just like past Ponzi schemes. Instead of taking responsibility for HyperVerse’s collapse, he brushes off legal charges and shifts the blame. His tactic of dismissing critics as dishonest while demanding loyalty is a classic scammer move. His vague promises and secretive plans make him even less trustworthy. With so many warning signs, investors should be very cautious. For now, Lee remains in Dubai, possibly plotting his next crypto scheme.

In a March 10 complaint filed to a Texas federal court, Watch Skins Corporation alleged that LVMH misappropriated its “pioneering NFT display technology.” Watch Skins claimed it developed a unique system that allows users to display verified NFT artworks on smartwatches and holds multiple patents related to the technology. It claimed that a smartwatch from the LVMH-owned watch brand TAG Heuer and other products from the conglomerate’s brands unlawfully used NFT display technology that was based on three patents that Watch Skins owned. The TAG Heuer Connected Calibre E4 (pictured) was one of the watches Watch Skins claimed infringed on its patent. Source: TAG Heuer LVMH is a multinational holding company that owns dozens of well-known luxury goods brands, including Louis Vuitton , Givenchy, TAG Heuer, Tiffany, Christian Dior, Hennessy and the champagne brand Moët & Chandon. Watch Skins said its first patent covers a system that verifies NFT ownership before allowing it to be displayed on a watch face, the second one covers a system where an NFT must be verified through a blockchain wallet before being displayed on a smartwatch, and the third focuses on the retrieval and display of customized watch faces based on NFT ownership. It claimed TAG Heuer encouraged customers to infringe on the patents by providing instructions on how to use its NFT display features. “The watch allows the NFT to be displayed if owned by the user’s crypto wallet [and] connects to a user’s crypto wallet to guarantee authenticity of works displayed,” the complaint explained. Related: NFTs just had their worst performing year since 2020: DappRadar Watch Skins requested a jury trial and compensation for lost profits and royalties due to infringement and a court order preventing LVMH from further use of the patented technology. The company announced the launch of the world’s first blockchain NFT watch face marketplace at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2020. The mobile app gives consumers “the ability to purchase authentic, licensed smartwatch faces from their favorite brands,” Watch Skins stated at the time. Cointelegraph has contacted LVMH for comment.

The Australian dollar hovered around $0.629 on Wednesday, remaining under pressure this week after US President Donald Trump ruled out exempting Australia from his 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel—key exports worth nearly $1 billion. Despite the setback, Australia will not impose reciprocal tariffs on the US and will continue seeking an exemption from the Trump administration's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended lower amid trade policy uncertainty. U.S. stock futures modestly rise on Wednesday, after a weak day on Wall Street overnight ahead of CPI prints later today: Dow +0.19% ; S&P 500 +0.24% ; Nasdaq +0.28% .

41520429,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139344,1741757131,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Victory for DeFi: US House Overturns Controversial IRS Crypto Rule,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-irs-rule-overturned-house/,"In a significant win for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the U.S. House of Representatives has delivered a powerful blow against a controversial IRS rule. By a resounding vote of 292-132, lawmakers decided to overturn a regulation that would have mandated DeFi platforms to act as brokers, requiring them to collect sensitive taxpayer and transaction data. This move has sparked a wave of relief and celebration within the crypto community, but what exactly does it mean, and what comes next? What’s the Big Deal About the DeFi IRS Rule? Imagine if every time you traded stocks on your brokerage app, the platform had to meticulously track and report not just your trades, but also the personal details of everyone you traded with. That’s essentially what the now-overturned IRS rule aimed to impose on the burgeoning world of DeFi. This rule, intended to enhance tax compliance, was met with fierce opposition due to its potential to stifle innovation and impose impractical compliance burdens on DeFi platforms. Let’s break down why this rule was so problematic: Compliance Nightmares: DeFi platforms, often decentralized and automated, are not structured like traditional financial institutions. Implementing broker-like data collection would have been incredibly complex and costly, potentially pushing smaller platforms out of business. Privacy Concerns: The rule demanded the collection of user data, raising serious privacy red flags within a space that often prioritizes pseudonymity and decentralization. Innovation Chill: Supporters of the overturn argued that the rule threatened to cripple the rapidly evolving digital asset innovation within the U.S., potentially driving development and talent overseas. House Vote: A Victory for DeFi Regulation? The House vote represents a significant step back from what many considered an overreaching regulatory attempt. This bipartisan vote underscores a growing recognition in Washington of the need for nuanced and informed DeFi regulation . The resolution, having already cleared the Senate, now requires another Senate approval due to House amendments before it can reach President Trump’s desk. The expectation is that President Trump, known for his generally crypto-friendly stance, is likely to sign it into law. Key Highlights of the House Vote: Bipartisan Support: The 292-132 vote demonstrates significant bipartisan agreement on the need to reconsider the IRS rule. Focus on Innovation: Arguments in favor of overturning the rule heavily emphasized the need to protect U.S. digital asset innovation and competitiveness. Pushback on Overreach: The vote can be seen as a pushback against regulatory overreach that could harm a nascent and promising industry. Cryptocurrency Tax Implications: What Does This Mean for You? While this vote is a victory for DeFi platforms and innovation, it doesn’t mean that cryptocurrency tax compliance is off the table. It simply means the IRS will need to explore alternative, more practical approaches to tax regulation within the DeFi space. Here’s what you should keep in mind regarding cryptocurrency taxes: Tax Obligations Remain: Regardless of this specific rule being overturned, profits from cryptocurrency trading and DeFi activities are still taxable in the U.S. Existing Rules Apply: Current IRS guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, including reporting requirements for capital gains and losses, remain in effect. Future Regulations: While this particular rule is likely dead, the IRS will likely continue to seek ways to ensure tax compliance in the crypto space. Expect future regulatory proposals that are hopefully more tailored and less burdensome. Impact of the House Vote on DeFi & Crypto Taxes Aspect Before House Vote (IRS Rule in Place) After House Vote (Rule Overturned) DeFi Platform Compliance Burden Extremely High, Potentially Unfeasible Reduced, Focus Shifts to More Practical Solutions User Privacy Significantly Compromised Privacy Concerns Lessened Innovation in DeFi Threatened, Potential for Slowdown Boosted, Fosters Growth and Development Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Focus on Broker-like Reporting (Now Rejected) Need for Alternative Compliance Mechanisms Digital Asset Innovation: A Step Forward or a Step Back? The debate surrounding the IRS rule highlights a fundamental tension: how to regulate digital asset innovation without stifling its potential. Supporters of the overturn argue that the rule was a step backward, threatening to push innovation offshore and hinder the growth of a vital new technology sector within the U.S. Opponents, however, warn that rolling back the rule could create loopholes for tax evasion and potentially increase the national debt. Arguments For and Against Overturning the Rule: Pro-Overturn (Innovation Focus): Protects nascent DeFi industry from overly burdensome regulations. Encourages continued innovation and investment in the U.S. crypto space. Recognizes the unique nature of DeFi and the impracticality of traditional broker rules. Anti-Overturn (Tax Compliance Focus): Concerns about potential tax evasion in the DeFi space. Need for the IRS to have effective tools to ensure tax compliance. Arguments that all financial activities should be subject to similar reporting requirements. Navigating the Future of IRS Crypto Regulations The overturning of this specific IRS crypto rule is not the end of the story, but rather a pivot. It signals a need for a more collaborative and informed approach to regulating the crypto space. The IRS and lawmakers must now consider developing regulations that are both effective in ensuring tax compliance and practical for the unique characteristics of DeFi and other cryptocurrency activities. This could involve exploring alternative reporting mechanisms, focusing on user education, and working with the crypto industry to develop solutions that work for all parties involved. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of ongoing regulatory developments in the crypto space. Maintain Records: Regardless of specific rules, maintain detailed records of your crypto transactions for tax purposes. Engage in Dialogue: Support industry initiatives that promote sensible crypto regulation and engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers. Conclusion: A Breath of Relief, But the Journey Continues The U.S. House vote to overturn the IRS DeFi broker rule is undoubtedly a moment of relief and a testament to the crypto community’s advocacy efforts. It underscores the importance of informed and balanced regulation that fosters innovation rather than stifling it. While this victory is significant, the broader conversation around crypto regulation and taxation is far from over. The industry must continue to engage with policymakers, advocate for sensible rules, and work towards a future where digital asset innovation can thrive within a clear and supportive regulatory framework. The fight for balanced and effective cryptocurrency regulation continues, but for now, the DeFi space can breathe a little easier.

Why ETH and This New Coin Could Be 2025’s Top Performers”,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-big-rebound-why-eth-and-this-new-coin-could-be-2025s-top-performers/,"Ethereum (ETH) has had a rough ride recently, plunging 28% last month and falling below $2,000 in the recent crypto market crash.. investors wondering whether ETH can stage a comeback as it currently trades at $1,874.97, some critical indicators suggest a rebound could be on the horizon. From whale accumulation to technical signals and rising market interest, Ethereum price may be gearing up for a major rally. At the same time, a new coin – Rexas Finance (RXS), a promising Ethereum-based token, is gaining traction. With a record-breaking presale and growing investor confidence, RXS is currently priced at $0.20, with its launch price set at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Both ETH and RXS are positioning themselves as top contenders for the biggest crypto gains in 2025. Let’s dive into why. 3 Reasons Ethereum Price Could Rally Soon The following are reasons why ETH price is poised to surge soon. Whales Are Accumulating Ethereum Recently, Ethereum whales have been aggressively buying the ETH price dips while adding a total of 1.1 million coins within just 48 hours. This signals a potential rebound, due to increased confident in the leading altcoin. History records that, whenever whales accumulate during price declines, it often results into price recovery in the days that follow. As institutional investors look for cheaper entry opportunities, the current Ethereum price of $1,874.97 may be seen as undervalued, setting the stage for a significant rally. Ethereum price chart Ethereum Price RSI Suggests a Bullish Reversal Ethereum’s RSI is currently about 22, much below the 30 mark. This implies that ETH is oversold, so selling pressure has been too high, and a reversal could be about to happen. For traders trying to profit from a possible bounce, an RSI falling to such low levels usually indicates a strong buying possibility. Historically, Ethereum’s RSI falling below 30 has typically signaled a major price comeback. For instance, past cases of ETH exceeding sell conditions have resulted in a price recovery of 20% or more in the following weeks. Ethereum is presently in a similar state; hence, a relief rally might be imminent as buyers retreat to benefit from the lowered prices. Rising Social Dominance and Trading Volume Technical analysis isn’t the only factor backing Ethereum’s comeback potential. Its growing market presence adds weight to this possibility. Santiment , an on-chain analytics company, reports that ETH now makes up 9.2% of all crypto talks. This boost in attention shows that traders, analysts, and investors are keeping a close eye on Ethereum. More discussion and interest often come before price changes, as this buzz tends to draw in new buyers. Also, Ethereum stays one of the most traded assets on platforms like Coinbase, which points to steady demand even during the market slump. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star Poised for Explosive Growth As Ethereum price prepares for a possible recovery, another asset is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency market— Rexas Finance (RXS). As a token on the Ethereum network aimed at tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), RXS is rapidly gaining popularity in anticipation of its forthcoming exchange launch. Now priced at $0.20 in its last presale phase, the RWA token has successfully raised an impressive $47.01 million, with 91.02% of this round already sold. RXS will debut at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, representing an important achievement for early investors who have experienced increases exceeding 500%. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Reasons Investors Are Attracted to RXS Notable presale results: The high level of interest in RXS as a new cryptocurrency while in its presale phases, emphasizes investor trust in its future prospects. Whale interest: A significant recent acquisition of $85,000 in RXS reinforces the token’s increasing attraction to wealthy investors. $1 Million Giveaway : The project’s tactical marketing, featuring a $1 million giveaway with more than 1.6 million participants, has created significant excitement, drawing in both retail and institutional investors. RWA tokenization: As the tokenization of real-world assets gains traction in the crypto world, RXS stands out as a key contender in this area, establishing itself as one of the most promising tokens for 2025 Final Thoughts: ETH and RXS-A Perfect Pair for 2025? As Ethereum price gets ready for a possible price upturn, the mood in the wider crypto market will get better. This could help promising projects like Rexas Finance (RXS). Analysts anticipates that Ethereum’s comeback might spark a strong rally in other coins, and RXS, with its solid foundations, could be a big winner. Big investors are buying up ETH technical signs are good, and market interest is growing. All these point to a bright future for ETH. RXS is riding the wave of Ethereum’s network success. Both these assets could end up as some of the top performers in 2025. If you’re looking for chances to make big gains, watching Ethereum’s recovery and Rexas Finance’s upcoming launch could be a smart move that changes the game. The post Ethereum Price Big Rebound?

The tweet states: “The only $XRP guide you will ever need! Make sure to bookmark.” The post includes an informational image detailing XRP’s fundamentals, history, and utility. XRP’s Background and Development The guide provides a timeline of XRP’s development, beginning in 2004 when Ripple’s Ryan Fugger conceptualized the idea of a decentralized digital payment system. Jed McCaleb , David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto created the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2012. This marked the beginning of what is now known as Ripple Labs. XRP distribution began in 2013, with a total supply of 100 billion tokens pre-mined. The guide also highlights key events, such as XRP’s all-time high of $3.84 in 2017 and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. The legal battle led to significant price fluctuations. By 2023, Ripple secured a partial legal victory , with a court ruling that XRP was not a security in secondary market sales. The guide concludes with a 2024 update on XRP’s expanding utility in cross-border payments, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and enterprise adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How to Acquire and Store XRP The guide provides a brief overview of how to obtain XRP. It advises users to secure a wallet, purchase XRP on a cryptocurrency exchange, and finally store it in their wallet rather than keeping it on exchanges. This approach aligns with general best practices in cryptocurrency security, ensuring users maintain full control over their holdings. XRP’s Purpose and Functionality According to the guide, XRP aims to solve the problem of slow and costly international money transfers, which rely heavily on traditional banking systems. The guide states that XRP enables “near-instant, low-cost global transactions without intermediaries” and is used by financial institutions to improve liquidity efficiency. The XRP Ledger is a decentralized and open-source blockchain, designed to facilitate fast transactions at minimal cost. The guide highlights XRP’s quick settlement times of three to five seconds, its low transaction fees, and its adoption by over 300 banks and financial institutions. It also notes that, unlike Bitcoin, XRP is not mined, making it more energy-efficient. Key Features and Utility XRP is described as having a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens , with a small portion burned in each transaction, reducing the total supply over time. The guide emphasizes its use in cross-border payments, institutional finance, and decentralized applications built on the XRP Ledger. Additionally, it mentions that some investors view XRP as a hedge against traditional financial systems. Security and Adoption The guide affirms that XRP is a secure digital asset, as the XRP Ledger is decentralized and highly scalable. Its expanding adoption among financial institutions and enterprises further strengthens its position in the digital payments space. CryptoSensei’s post presents a structured and comprehensive overview of XRP, summarizing its history, functionality, and potential use cases. The guide is useful for those interested in understanding XRP’s role in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Experts Signal Now As The Best Time To Buy Remittix And Bitcoin As Market Looks To Recover,https://timestabloid.com/buy-these-cryptos-now-experts-signal-now-as-the-best-time/,"The crypto market is seeing initial signs of a strong recovery, and analysts are of the opinion that the moment is opportune to buy Remittix (RTX) and Bitcoin (BTC) before the price takes off. Bitcoin is currently gaining traction, and Remittix (RTX) is continuing with its explosive presale, creating huge interest among investors looking for high growth. While Bitcoin remains the king and Remittix (RTX) brings a revolutionary payment system, both these cryptos are what most traders are wagering on. Both BTC and RTX are likely to yield enormous returns when the market comes back, as predicted by experts. Bitcoin Gains Strength As Market Rebounds Bitcoin is 2.97% higher over the last 24 hours, reflecting renewed faith in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The market capitalization of BTC is now at $1.61 trillion, showing that despite the recent volatility, institutional investors remain positive. Although Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 18.08% to $60.51 billion, analysts are convinced the asset is preparing for a huge rally. In the past, BTC has always bounced back after market slumps, and most are convinced this is the last opportunity to purchase at these discounted prices. As confidence grows, investors are not only buying Bitcoin, but they’re also diversifying into Remittix (RTX)—a fast-growing token with real global financial applications beyond speculation. Why Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now As compared to Bitcoin, which is largely digital gold, Remittix (RTX) is disrupting the financial arena with its streamlined crypto-to-fiat payment solution. Worth $0.0734 at present, RTX has raised over $13.8 million and sold 518 million tokens, reflecting strong investor confidence. RTX’s PayFi solution allows for instant send and receive payments without banking lag and outrageous transaction fees. Instead of waiting days for funds to clear, freelancers, businesses, and individuals can off-ramp crypto to fiat with ease, making RTX one of the most practical blockchain projects in 2025. While Bitcoin recovers, Remittix (RTX) is picking up the interest of investors looking for practical financial solutions. While BTC remains a solid store of value, RTX is being heralded as the future of cross-border payments. Can Remittix (RTX) Outperform Bitcoin In Growth? While Bitcoin remains the crypto king, Remittix (RTX) is the growth contender. Unlike BTC, which is sustained by institutional investment and demand from the market, RTX generates demand by virtue of its real-world, practical applications in finance. A European freelancer getting paid by U.S. clients can utilize Remittix (RTX) to receive instant and low-cost settlements without incurring high bank charges and wire transfer latency. Likewise, institutions making cross-border transactions are starting to realize the benefits of RTX’s low-cost and scalable solution. As international remittances are a multi-trillion-dollar business, Remittix (RTX) is well on its way to becoming a leader in blockchain financial services. Bitcoin may indeed increase in value over the long term, but RTX’s adoption-driven growth might see even greater percentage gains. If Bitcoin recovers to new highs, Remittix (RTX) may catch the wave, making it one of the most valuable digital currencies of the year. Secure Your Spot In The Future Of Digital Finance While Bitcoin shows strength and Remittix (RTX) revolutionizes the payment system, investors are presented with the rare opportunity to buy two of the most promising cryptos for long-term gains. Though Bitcoin remains the industry leader, RTX is establishing a new standard for real-time transactions and therefore is one of the most promising investment opportunities for 2025. Since the crypto market is about to start a recovery, Bitcoin and Remittix (RTX) are among the top cryptos to invest in today. While BTC will surely appreciate in value as the market sentiment improves, RTX is poised to be one of the most promising blockchain payment projects. As the market recovers, those early investors who get into Bitcoin and Remittix are potentially positioning themselves to gain huge returns in the next cycle of cryptocurrencies. Want to invest in crypto’s next big thing? Check out Remittix presale and see what RTX is doing to revolutionize global transactions as Bitcoin bounces back.

Here’s Why Experts Say Solaxy Could Deliver Bigger Returns,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/xrp-headed-to-10-or-stuck-at-2-experts-say-solaxy-could-deliver-returns/,"The post XRP Headed to $10 or Stuck at $2? Here’s Why Experts Say Solaxy Could Deliver Bigger Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As cryptocurrencies face turbulence across the board, XRP has taken a substantial 14% hit this month. Industry experts are now examining recovery scenarios and potential price trajectories for the remainder of 2025 while also highlighting an emerging competitor in the blockchain space. Amid XRP’s price uncertainty, people are opting to look for alternative investments with strong utility like Solaxy. Q2 Forecast: XRP’s Legal Victory and Fed Policy Shift Could Spark Rally The crypto market faces numerous challenges as Q1 winds down. Bitcoin and Ethereum have surrendered critical support levels, escalating global trade tensions loom large, and the March 19 FOMC meeting will likely maintain current interest rates. The tide could turn dramatically in Q2, however. With a 48% probability of a May 7 interest rate reduction, market sentiment may improve weeks before the actual meeting. More significantly, April 16 marks the anticipated conclusion of the Ripple Labs vs SEC legal battle. The Motley Fool suggests this verdict could propel XRP beyond its current $2 price point, potentially challenging its previous all-time high of $3.84 if it maintains current support levels through March’s difficult market conditions. Rate Cuts Could Fuel Substantial Q3 Momentum The positive trajectory for XRP might accelerate during the year’s third quarter, driven by additional monetary policy adjustments and technical breakouts. FedWatch projections indicate interest rates potentially dropping to 350-375 basis points by September 17, representing a 75-point reduction from present levels. Historical patterns demonstrate how rate cuts in Q3 2024 coincided with robust crypto market performance, which only slowed when the Fed paused its easing policy. Similar conditions helped catalyze the 2020-2021 crypto surge. If XRP successfully establishes itself above $3 during Q2, these favorable monetary conditions could help drive prices into uncharted $4-$5 territory. ETF Decision Emerges as Q4’s Critical Catalyst October brings perhaps the most significant XRP price driver of 2025 – a potential ETF approval decision. Should regulators greenlight this investment vehicle, it would establish a formal channel for institutional money to flow into XRP, potentially creating both immediate buying pressure and widespread market excitement. Technical analyst Altcoin Pioneers has examined market cycles to project an ambitious $8-$10 price target, noting that XRP has already overcome a major trendline resistance that historically precedes substantial growth phases. Fellow market observer Crypto Bitlord offers a more tempered forecast of $7 – still representing a 3 – 5x return from current levels. Despite these impressive projections, some experts believe an emerging competitor offers even greater growth potential. Why Traders Are Pivoting to Solaxy’s Explosive Potential While XRP captures headlines, traders are still wary about the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and its upward potential. Meanwhile, Solaxy is quietly positioning itself as a revolutionary Layer-2 solution for Solana’s blockchain ecosystem. Solaxy’s infrastructure promises to deliver enhanced transaction speeds, reduced costs, and improved network reliability, which were already met with substantial user approval as the project managed to raise over $25 million in its ongoing presale. The project’s native $SOLX token serves multiple ecosystem functions, including staking, transaction fees, and governance participation. BEST SOLANA MEME COIN RIGHT NOW BUY NOW!? 1000X!? The Cryptonews YouTube channel has dubbed Solaxy “the best meme coin on Solana” due to its utility and meme coin culture blend. By addressing specific performance bottlenecks within one of blockchain’s leading platforms, Solaxy could generate billions in value, explaining why savvy investors are taking early positions in what could become one of the year’s most lucrative blockchain investments.

According to a recent Dragonfly report , up to 5.2 million Americans have been blocked from claiming airdrop tokens due to policies that aimed to reduce regulatory exposure. The report analyzed 11 geo-blocked airdrops. In total, these airdrops are valued at $7.16 billion and shared among 1.9 million wallet addresses. This means that the median payout per wallet address would be around $4,600. Between 2020 – 2024, US crypto users have missed airdrops worth between $1.84 billion and $2.64 billion, the report says. Another larger set of data analyzed by CoinGecko consists of 21 blocked airdrops. This brings the upper limit of the missed payouts to $5.02 billion. While some users would have accessed these airdrops via VPNs, there is still likely to be a significant portion of recipients who never claimed their tokens. The report said, “The economic repercussions of geoblocking on U.S. users are profound, with significant revenue losses that affect both the individual claimers and the broader economic landscape.” Overall, an estimated $418 million to $1.1 billion in federal tax revenue has been lost due to the restrictions. The report mentions that these estimates do not include the additional tax from capital gains from the sale of the airdrop tokens. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price gained around 2 percent to trade at about $81.6k on Wednesday, March 12, during the early Asian session. As a result, the fear of further crypto capitulation gradually declined as shown by Bitcoin’s fear and greed index, which jumped to 34 percent from 20 percent in the past 24 hours. XRP Price Update After teasing below a crucial support range between $2 and $1.9 on Tuesday, XRP price rebounded more than 10 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $2.15 at the time of this writing. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $215 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $6.9 billion, retested its falling logarithmic trend. From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price is on the cusp of a major bullish breakout if Bitcoin price regains a macro rising momentum beyond $100k. Moreover, the XRP price has been retesting the lower border of a multi-week horizontal consolidation coupled with a rising divergence of a daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How High Will XRP Price Go In 2025?

The announcement sent the stock price 8% higher past 3,500 JPY levels on Wednesday’s trading session. Furthermore, the company issued 2 billion JPY worth of bonds at 0% rate to fund additional BTC purchases. Bitcoin price selling pressure has shot up this week ahead of the US CPI data release and macro uncertainties amid the Trump tariff war. The Japanese firm seems to be making the most of this opportunity by buying the dips. Metaplanet Stock Jumps 8% on Fresh Bitcoin Purchases On Wednesday, Metaplanet announced its latest Bitcoin acquisition , purchasing 162 BTC for approximately $13.5 million, with an average purchase price of $83,123 per Bitcoin. Additionally, the company reported a year-to-date (YTD) BTC yield of 53.2% in 2025, delivering impressive returns despite a volatile crypto market. As of March 12, 2025, Metaplanet holds a total of 3,050 BTC, acquired at a cumulative cost of roughly $253.7 million, with an average purchase price of $83,180 per Bitcoin. Nearly 50% of its total BTC holdings have been purchased in 2025 so far only. Earlier today, the firm announced that its Board of Directors has approved the issuance of its 8th Series of Ordinary Bonds to EVO FUND. The JPY 2 billion (approximately $18.2 million) bond issuance is part of the company’s strategy to acquire Bitcoin. The announcement comes just two days after MicroStrategy announced its plans to raise $21 billion for Bitcoin purchases . According to the notice, the funds raised will be specifically allocated for Bitcoin purchases, as per the plans detailed in its January 28, 2025 notice regarding Stock Acquisition Rights. Following today’s development, the stock price gained 7.93% moving all the way to 3,605 levels. Amid the current market volatility, the stock has been range bound between 3,300 to 4,000 JPY levels. BTC Whale Accumulation on the Rise Despite the strong selling pressure in BTC over the past few weeks, long term holders and Bitcoin whales have been strategically accumulating at every fall. As per the data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin whales have accumulated over 65,000 BTC in the last 30 days, even as the cryptocurrency faces ongoing market corrections. Source: CryptoQuant While the accumulation may not have an immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, it indicates significant absorption by influential holders. BTC’s price is currently holding above the crucial support of $80,000; however, there have been rising calls for a dip under $70,000 before the long-term uptrend is resumed .

But what are the best crypto to buy? This article reviews five promising projects that could have 100x potential this year. Solaxy Solaxy is building the first-ever Solana layer 2 blockchain. Using off-chain computation and transaction bundling technology, the project will eradicate Solana’s congestion issue. It’s a huge leap forward for the Solana ecosystem, making it cheaper, faster, and more reliable. This will open Solana to new users and use cases, potentially creating billions of dollars in new value. And right now, SOLX is undergoing a presale. It’s a way for investors to join from the start. The presale has raised $25.7 million so far. It’s currently priced at $0.001658, but this will rise throughout the campaign. Solaxy is at a rare juncture right now. Not only is it opening Solana to new possibilities, but it’s also available to buy from the ground floor. For SOLX presale participants, this setup could give 100x gains. MIND Of Pepe MIND Of Pepe is a new Pepe-themed AI agent that aims to make its holders money. The agent has a wide range of abilities, including trend analysis, launching tokens, interacting with dApps, and even writing social media posts. It covers all angles, from identifying trading opportunities to creating them and then shaping social discourse around them. But its bread-and-butter is trend analysis. MIND Of Pepe will consolidate social media and on-chain data into actionable insights to predict future trends, helping MIND holders know what to buy and when. Moreover, it can also fill gaps in the market by launching its own tokens. Again, MIND holders will have first access, providing them with the best entry prices. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $7.2 million so far. As MIND Of Pepe seeks to make its community more profitable, the project is positioned to amass significant adoption, which could make the MIND presale a highly lucrative opportunity for traders. Mantra Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all down today, as are many smaller altcoins. However, Mantra continues to push ahead in what’s becoming a running theme throughout the past year. While the total crypto market cap is down 3.8% in the past 24 hours, Mantra is up 2.5% in the same window. It’s clear that investors see real value in the Mantra use case. The reason is that Mantra is a real-world assets-focused layer 1 blockchain, providing a regulatory-adherent environment for institutions to tokenize their assets. It’s a use case that veers outside the walled garden of normal crypto use cases and penetrates the traditional financial system. And it isn’t just today that Mantra has outperformed the market. Its price has surged by 2,000% in the past year. Mantra has a $6 billion market cap, so it’s unlikely to give 100x gains this year. However, given its immense strength and focus on institutional adoption, there’s every chance it will become a top-five cryptocurrency and potentially rival XRP and Ethereum in the coming years. Hedera Hedera offers an alternative to traditional blockchain platforms with its Hashgraph distributed ledger technology. Unlike conventional blockchain systems, Hedera’s architecture provides improved efficiency in several key metrics. The platform processes transactions with fees of approximately $0.0001 USD and confirmation times under five seconds. Hedera’s network can handle more than 10,000 transactions per second, which compares favorably to the 5-20 TPS typical of many proof-of-work blockchains. HBAR Hedera Hashgraph Crypto Price News Today – Price Prediction and Technical Analysis! HBAR, the network’s utility token, experienced significant price movement in late November 2024, rising from $0.04 to $0.37 before settling at around $0.20. This price activity reflects growing market awareness of the platform’s capabilities, with the recent downturn being attributed to the general crypto market. According to crypto analysts at More Crypto Online, HBAR is looking for downturn confirmation between $0.09 and $0.016. However, its mid-term outlook is extremely positive, with potential targets at $0.4 and $0.6. With a governance structure managed by the Hedera Governing Council and features designed to support enterprise applications, Hedera aims to address practical business needs while maintaining security and decentralization principles. As organizations continue to explore blockchain alternatives, Hedera’s focus on performance and regulatory compatibility may position it for increased adoption. BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token is a Bitcoin-themed meme coin that pays its holders Bitcoin rewards. The idea is to increase Bitcoin ownership among meme coin fans and offset some of the volatility of meme coin investing through airdrops. Users will receive free BTC and BTCBULL airdrops at key milestones on Bitcoin’s journey to $1 million. At the same time, Bitcoin-related cryptos tend to track Bitcoin’s price, so we can also expect the BTCBULL price to grow as Bitcoin rises. Users also earn even more via the project’s staking mechanism, which is live now and offering a 123% APY. BTC Bull Token also has a burn mechanism, which destroys a portion of the total supply at key price milestones. The project is available to buy via an ongoing presale, which has raised $3.4 million so far. With Bitcoin rewards at its core and multiple other community reward initiatives, meme coin fans are scrambling to buy BTCBULL .

LINE reports approximately 200 million active users across its platform, and the agreement will bring four LINE-based games, or ""mini-apps,"" to Soneium: Sleepagotchi, Farm Frens, Puffy Match, and Pocket Mob. The integration is meant to facilitate features like in-game rewards and purchases. Soneium is mainly managed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint program between Sony and Singapore-based Startale Labs. SBSL envisions the partnership as a way to ""transcend boundaries, allowing users to experience the benefits of web3 without friction,"" according to a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""LINE has built a strong presence and integrating successful mini-apps into the Soneium ecosystem is a next step toward making Soneium more accessible,"" said Jun Watanabe, chairman of Sony Block Solutions Labs. ""We believe this collaboration will drive engagement and adoption in ways that were previously difficult to achieve."" Soneium went live in January, and at the time, the team said that they hoped to bridge web2 users into the web3 space.

In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reportedly moving to drop its case against crypto YouTuber Ian Balina, reflecting a broader policy shift under the new administration. Meanwhile, in Europe, regulators are examining whether OKX’s Web3 services fall under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework after allegations that they were used to launder funds from the Bybit hack. EU Regulators Scrutinize OKX Over Potential Role in $100 Million Bybit Hack Laundering The European Union's financial regulators are reportedly investigating cryptocurrency exchange OKX over its Web3 wallet and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which may have been used to launder $100 million in stolen funds from the Bybit hack, according to a March 11 report by Bloomberg. This scrutiny follows concerns that OKX’s services may fall under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which governs digital assets across the EU. The controversy stems from whether OKX's decentralized platform and wallet should be subject to the same compliance standards as centralized exchanges. Sources cited in Bloomberg’s report state that national regulators from EU member states met on March 6 at a gathering hosted by the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) Digital Finance Standing Committee to discuss OKX’s involvement. At the core of the discussion is whether OKX's Web3 proxy and wallet service played a direct role in processing illicit transactions linked to the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit in January. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has claimed that 40,233 ETH (worth approximately $100 million) was laundered through OKX’s Web3 proxy, with some funds now untraceable. With OKX having secured a full MiCA license in January, regulators are assessing if its Web3 wallet service and decentralized exchange fall under MiCA oversight. If found to be in violation of EU regulations, penalties could follow. Authorities from Austria and Croatia were particularly vocal, arguing that OKX's Web3 service should fall under EU regulatory purview, despite the exchange asserting that it operates as a decentralized platform. Under MiCA, fully decentralized platforms might be exempt from stringent compliance measures, but the case for OKX remains ambiguous. Amid these allegations, OKX has denied being the subject of any formal investigation by EU regulators. In a statement posted on X, the exchange rejected Bybit’s claims, accusing the firm of spreading misinformation about OKX’s Web3 wallet and platform. OKX’s Web3 wallet has 53 million addresses and can connect to 100 blockchains, making it one of the most expansive decentralized ecosystems in the crypto space. The company maintains that its self-custodial nature means it does not have direct control over users' transactions, which differentiates it from centralized services that facilitate laundering through custodial accounts. The Bybit hack, which saw the theft of $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) and ETH-related tokens, is now considered the largest crypto hack in history. Cybersecurity experts and blockchain analytics firms have attributed the attack to Lazarus Group, a North Korean-affiliated hacking syndicate responsible for numerous high-profile crypto thefts. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has taken an aggressive stance against the hackers, publicly declaring war on the Lazarus Group and working with authorities to trace and recover stolen assets. So far, 3% of the stolen funds have been frozen, while 20% remain untraceable, raising concerns about how hackers are laundering assets through DeFi services and decentralized wallets. MiCA's Challenge: Regulating Decentralized Finance The controversy surrounding OKX shows the ongoing challenge regulators face in applying traditional compliance measures to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallet services. Under MiCA regulations, crypto service providers operating in the EU must comply with stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. However, fully decentralized platforms remain a gray area. The EU’s approach to DeFi regulation remains unclear, with policymakers struggling to define what constitutes “sufficient decentralization” under MiCA. The OKX case could set a precedent for how DeFi platforms and non-custodial wallets are treated under the EU’s evolving crypto regulatory framework. As regulators continue to examine OKX’s operations, it remains to be seen whether formal action will be taken against the exchange. If the EU determines that OKX's Web3 service falls under MiCA, the company could face compliance requirements, fines, or operational restrictions. SEC to Drop Case Against Crypto YouTuber Ian Balina in Major Shift Under New Administration In other news, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly moving to dismiss its lawsuit against Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics and a prominent YouTuber with over 100,000 subscribers. The case, which accused Balina of violating securities laws by promoting Sparkster (SPRK) tokens in 2018, was originally filed in 2022 but appears to be another casualty of the SEC's changing stance on crypto enforcement under the new Trump administration. Balina confirmed the news in a March 11 interview, stating that the SEC had informed him of its intent to recommend the court drop the case. The decision reflects the regulator’s evolving priorities following the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler in January and the appointment of acting Chair Mark Uyeda by President Donald Trump. The SEC’s lawsuit against Balina stemmed from his alleged failure to disclose compensation received for promoting SPRK tokens. The September 2022 complaint claimed that Balina agreed to receive a 30% bonus on the $5 million worth of tokens he purchased during the Sparkster initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018 but did not inform his social media followers about this arrangement. In May 2024, a judge ruled that SPRK tokens were securities, reinforcing the SEC’s case. Balina’s legal team had planned to appeal the decision, and a jury trial was initially scheduled for January 2025 before being postponed to a later, undetermined date. At the time of publication, no official filing had been made in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas to dismiss the case. However, if the case is formally dropped, it would mark a significant retreat from the SEC's aggressive enforcement actions against crypto influencers. Balina, who has been an outspoken critic of the SEC’s enforcement-first approach, welcomed the development and pointed to political shifts in Washington as the key driver of the SEC’s decision. Despite celebrating the likely dismissal, Balina admitted the legal battle had been costly, saying “It definitely was not cheap, cost a lot of money in terms of legal fees, which definitely sucks. Makes me wish the SEC hadn’t put priority on all this.” The SEC’s move to drop the Balina case aligns with a broader policy shift under President Trump, whose administration has taken a more favorable stance toward crypto. Since Trump took office in January 2025, the SEC has dropped or scaled back enforcement actions against several major crypto firms, including: Robinhood Crypto Gemini Uniswap OpenSea Coinbase Consensys Kraken Additionally, the SEC has backed off efforts to classify crypto firms as exchanges under new regulatory rules, a significant win for the industry. Critics have suggested that the crypto industry’s financial support for Trump’s campaign and inauguration may have played a role in these regulatory decisions. Many major crypto firms and executives backed pro-crypto candidates in the 2024 election cycle and were prominent donors to Trump’s inauguration fund. The close relationship between the new administration and the crypto sector was further highlighted on March 7, when Trump hosted a crypto summit at the White House, attended by representatives from Robinhood, Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken. The SEC’s Ripple Case Still in Play While the SEC has backed off in several cases, one major lawsuit remains unresolved: the commission’s legal battle with Ripple Labs. The case, which has been ongoing since 2020, saw a $125 million ruling against Ripple in August 2024. However, both Ripple and the SEC have filed appeals, leaving its long-term impact on crypto regulation uncertain. With the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation shifting, many in the industry expect a more business-friendly environment in the coming years. The potential dismissal of Balina’s case could set a precedent for other crypto influencers and projects that previously faced regulatory scrutiny. However, questions remain about how the SEC will approach new crypto-related cases under Chair Mark Uyeda. While enforcement actions may be scaling down, the need for clear regulatory guidelines remains a pressing issue. For now, Balina’s case represents another win for the crypto industry as Washington redefines its approach to digital assets. Whether this shift leads to long-term regulatory clarity or simply temporary deregulation remains to be seen.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TOKEN SALE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-12 06:00:00

Glassnode said in a March 11 markets report that a recent sell-off by top buyers has driven “intense loss realization and a moderate capitulation event.” Short-term holders fled as Bitcoin dropped from peak The surge in buyers paying higher prices for Bitcoin ( BTC ) in recent months is reflected in the short-term holder realized price — the average purchase price for those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days. In October, the short-term realized price was $62,000. At the time of publication, it’s $91,362 — up about 47% in five months, according to Bitbo data. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at $81,930 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. This leaves the average short-term holder with an unrealized loss of roughly 10.6%. Bitcoin is down 5.90% over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap Glassnode said that short-term holders’ realized price shows it is apparent that “market momentum and capital flows have turned negative, signaling a decline in demand strength.” “Investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence,” it added. Glassnode said that short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900 and warns that Bitcoin could bottom out as low as $70,000 if selling persists. “The probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is meaningful, at least in the near term,” Glassnode said. Bitcoin short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between $71,300 and $91,900. Source: Glassnode Market research firm 10x Research labeled it a “textbook correction” in a March 10 note, adding that with Bitcoin’s dip below $80,000, “approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months.” Related: Bitcoin slides another 3% — Is BTC price headed for $69K next? On the same day, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin may retest the $78,000 price level and, if that fails, may head to $75,000 next. Glassnode explained that a similar sell-off Bitcoin pattern was seen in August when Bitcoin fell from $68,000 to around $49,000 amid fears of a recession, poor employment data in the United States, and sluggish growth among leading tech stocks . However, Bitcoin has spiked 7.5% over the past 24 hours as the US market steaded on March 11 after plunging a day earlier after US President Donald Trump refused to rule out that a recession was on the cards.

Over the past 24 hours, BTC has fallen by 2.6%, while ETH has dropped by 7.9%, reflecting the broader market correction. This decline aligns with the overall downturn in the crypto market, which currently stands at $2.7 trillion. This marks a considerable 20.5% drop from its peak of $3.4 trillion at the end of Q4 2024. Despite these setbacks, numerous market analysts remain optimistic, suggesting that the recent dip presents a strategic buying opportunity. In this article, we analyze the current state of Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with key predictions from analysts, while also exploring two promising presale projects that have been attracting significant investments even amid market uncertainty. Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Market Dip That Signals Opportunity The latest crypto market correction has been fueled by concerns over a potential U.S. recession, with President Trump’s unpredictable tariff trade war leading to a broader market sell-off. In contrast to the bearish sentiment in Q1 2025, Q4 2024 was a period of explosive growth for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin surged past the $100K milestone for the first time, and Ethereum gained 60% over the quarter. However, since the start of 2025, Bitcoin has fallen by 14.29%, while Ethereum has dropped by a more significant 42.4%. Despite this downturn, many crypto analysts argue that now could be the perfect time to enter the market, anticipating a strong recovery in Q2. Bitcoin Price Prediction Many experts continue to have a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. One such expert is Jacob Crypto Bury, a well-followed crypto analyst with over 11,000 followers on X. He recently highlighted that despite the correction, a $2.7 trillion crypto market cap is still extremely bullish, especially considering that the market was valued at just $1.7 trillion at the start of 2024. https://twitter.com/BuryCrypto/status/1899040540630593789 Bury also pointed out that Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $80K even after a sharp correction is a positive sign, reinforcing the importance of a long-term perspective. Meanwhile, LordPlebDrake , another notable analyst, emphasized that the time to short sell BTC has passed, warning investors not to panic sell now that Bitcoin has already corrected. Overall, many experts remain bullish on BTC, especially in the long term. Ethereum Price Prediction Ethereum has also captured bullish interest from technical analysts. One notable prediction comes from CryptoELITES, an analyst with over 250,000 X followers. In a recent tweet , CryptoELITES highlighted a strong resemblance between Ethereum’s current price action and its 2017 price cycle, which ultimately led to a massive 50x rally. https://twitter.com/CryptooELITES/status/1899196058653348251 The analysis suggests that Ethereum is currently forming a five-wave correction, similar to what was seen in 2017 before a breakout. If this pattern holds, Ethereum could be on the verge of a major price surge in 2025. However, while historical trends can provide valuable insights, they should not be taken as a certainty. That said, Ethereum remains one of the best-performing crypto assets in history, up by more than 439,000% since its launch. Top New Altcoins to Buy Before Q2 While established cryptos remain attractive long-term investments, many investors are also looking at emerging projects that are currently in their presale phase. Below, we review two standout presales – BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) and Solaxy (SOLX) . BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has gained significant attention for its unique approach of rewarding token holders as Bitcoin’s price rises. This sets it apart from traditional meme coins that rely purely on hype. The presale has been incredibly strong, with BTCBULL raising $3.4 million in a couple of months. Trump Has Amazing Bitcoin News That Could Drive Prices Much Higher! BTC Bull Token has also implemented an innovative milestone-based reward system. When Bitcoin reaches certain price levels, BTC Bull Token will either burn tokens or distribute BTC rewards to holders. These milestones include: BTC at $125K, $175K, $225K – Token burns to reduce supply BTC at $150K, $200K – Bitcoin airdrops to BTCBULL holders BTC at $250K – A massive 10% airdrop of the total BTCBULL supply Additionally, the project offers 123% APY staking rewards, making it an attractive option for long-term holders. Given its solid presale performance, strong link to BTC’s success, and structured rewards system, BTC Bull Token could be a major contender in the next crypto bull run. Visit BTC Bull Token Solaxy (SOLX) Despite broader market corrections, Solaxy (SOLX) has emerged as one of the top-performing presales, raising an impressive $25.8 million in just a few weeks. As an upcoming Layer 2 scaling solution for Solana, Solaxy aims to address Solana’s network congestion and failed transaction issues, positioning itself as a crucial addition to the ecosystem. ​​ Honest Review: BUY SOLAXY OR NOT? (SOLAXY PRESALE REVIEW) Solaxy plans to introduce off-chain processing and transaction bundling to enhance Solana’s scalability. By handling transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Solana’s mainnet, Solaxy is expected to provide faster processing speeds and significantly reduce network congestion. This will be particularly valuable during peak demand periods when Solana has historically faced slow transaction times and frequent failures. The network is being designed to remain operational at all times, eliminating downtime and ensuring seamless transaction execution. Additionally, its staking program, which is already live, offers a competitive 158% APY, attracting investors seeking passive income opportunities. With its strong presale momentum and a clear focus on solving Solana’s scalability challenges, SOLX has the potential to be a valuable long-term investment as blockchain adoption continues to expand.

The Starknet Foundation’s Bitcoin roadmap , published on Mar. 11, outlined how the network could scale Bitcoin ( BTC ) from its current 13 transactions per second to thousands of tramsactions. Although Bitcoin provides deep liquidity and security, decentralized finance development has been difficult due to its limited programmability. Starknet ( STRK ) wants to change that. To achieve this, Starknet is pushing for OP_CAT, a proposed Bitcoin update that would allow users to set spending conditions for BTC and enable zero-knowledge proofs , which are cryptographic techniques for verifying transactions without revealing personal data. This would allow a fully trustless bridge between Bitcoin and Starknet. Until OP_CAT is adopted, Starknet will use alternatives like BitVM, a verification method that lets Bitcoin execute smart contract logic without changing its base layer.

It has also partnered with Bitcoin wallet Xverse. Xverse has been pushing to integrate Bitcoin DeFi into its wallet. Meanwhile, StarkWare, Starknet’s core technology provider, has moved part of its treasury into Bitcoin, creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In a Mar. 11 X space , Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin backed the idea of a highly secure Bitcoin layer 2 with strong security. Buterin noted that it might “make crypto payments great again.” He pointed out that scaling problems have slowed down Bitcoin’s initial objective of acting as a peer-to-peer cash system and that current solutions, such as the Lightning Network, have limitations. The Lightning Network, for example, has faced issues with liquidity constraints, routing failures, and the need for always-online nodes, which limit its efficiency for large-scale payments.

The report is scheduled to be released today. Analysts predict a slight drop in both headline and core inflation. If confirmed, this would be the first time since July 2024 that both inflation indicators have declined. US Inflation Expectations for February In January 2025, the core inflation rate rose from 3.2% to 3.3%. The consensus is that the rate will drop from 3.3% to 3.2% in February. According to TEForecast, the rate is expected to decline sharply from 3.3% to 3.1%. In January 2025, the US inflation rate increased from 2.9% to 3%. The consensus is that the rate will decline from 3% to 2.9% in February. If confirmed, this would be the first time since July 2024 that both inflation indicators have declined. In July 2024, the core inflation rate fell from 3.3% to 3.2%, and the US inflation rate dropped from 3% to 2.9%. Since September 2024, the US inflation rate has risen consistently. Meanwhile, the core inflation rate increased from 3.2% to 3.3% in September. It remained at the same level for the next two months. In December, it dropped to 3.2% from 3.3%. Market Confidence in Inflation Cooling Markets are extremely optimistic that inflation will decrease. Kalshi traders predict that the headline CPI will drop to 2.9%. Notably, Kalshi traders have accurately predicted at least 6 of the last 8 CPI numbers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today, 12th March : XRP News , Pi Network Price, XLM Crypto, Economic Calendar , Impact of Trump’s Trade Policies on Inflation US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President recently imposed import tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. His aggressive trade policies have triggered retaliatory tariffs and pushed the global economy to the brink of a disastrous trade war. Today’s inflation report will be the first to reflect inflation under Trump’s tough trade policies. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market If inflation declines as predicted, it could impact the cryptocurrency market in multiple ways. A cooling inflation rate increases the likelihood of the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy, potentially leading to lower interest rates. This could create a more favourable environment for risk assets like cryptos, driving investor confidence. However, uncertainty surrounding Trump’s trade policies might trigger volatility, as global economic instability often pushes investors toward safe-haven assets like gold. If inflation remains stubbornly high as against the expectation, the Fed may maintain tight monetary policies, putting pressure on the broader financial and crypto markets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The latest market crash brought Bitcoin's (BTC) price to new yearly lows below the pivotal $80,000 mark . Despite an immediate recovery above $80,000, Bitcoin remains in a critical position, currently changing hands at $81,800 with a 5.89% decline over the past seven days. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin StrategyAmid this market downturn, the performance of Strategy's Bitcoin investment has been low of recent despite maintaining impressive gains. For context, the firm holds 499,096 BTC , which it procured for about $33.1 billion. Notably, at Bitcoin's all-time high of $109,000, this holding would be worth $54.4 billion, yielding an unrealized profit of up to $21.3 billion for the Bitcoin strategy firm. However, currently, this profit has reduced to about $7.7 billion, as the worth of Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings slump to $40.8 billion.While the current profit still represents impressive gains, some XRP community figures have asserted how the software development company would have secured much greater profit had it turned its focus on XRP instead of Bitcoin.Interestingly, The Crypto Basic recently evaluated these claims and found an element of truth. For context, MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin purchase campaign in August 2020 with a purchase of $250 million worth of BTC. Since then, it has committed $33.1 billion in the firstborn crypto asset, buying at an average price of $66,375.MicroStrategy Profit if It Bought XRP InsteadNotably, if MicroStrategy had poured its $33.1 billion into XRP, especially during the period it amassed Bitcoin, its holdings would be worth more than the current value even with XRP's 29% collapse last month.For the sake of this assessment, we considered XRP's average price since August 2020. Within this timeframe, the altcoin has traded at an average value of $0.7, with most of its time spent within the $0.5 to $0.55 region during the 2022 bear market.Nonetheless, supposing Strategy purchased XRP at an average price of $0.7, the $33.1 billion would have procured 47.285 billion XRP tokens. Interestingly, according to the Q4 2024 markets report , Ripple held 42.4 billion XRP as of December 2024. Strategy's 47.285 billion XRP holding would have made it the largest XRP holder, surpassing Ripple.Meanwhile, these 47.285 billion XRP tokens are currently worth $101 billion amid XRP's current price of $2.15. This translates to a yield of $67.9 billion, over $60 billion more profit than what Bitcoin currently boasts. Notably, at XRP's mid-January peak price of $3.4, these holdings would be worth $160.769 billion.However, while this assessment confirms that an XRP strategy would have benefited MicroStrategy more, it still does not accurately evaluate the potential profit due to the DCA factor. Also, a decision from MicroStrategy to invest in XRP since 2020 would have pushed XRP to a different position today, possibly higher.",Market|Latest MicroStrategy News|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-03-12 06:52:23

The firm made a preliminary prospectus filing for the product with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11. The filing is the latest in a slew of spot altcoin ETF applications by asset managers, who expect a more receptive approach from the SEC during the Trump administration. https://t.co/gvX0htbJ3S — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 11, 2025 17 XRP ETF Filings Franklin’s XRP ETF is set for listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange while Coinbase has been appointed as the custodian for the fund’s holdings. In February, Franklin Templeton also filed for an ETF that will track the spot price of Solana (SOL). On March 7, Volatility Shares filed three XRP ETF applications: one for a straight spot fund, one for a 2x leveraged XRP fund, and one for a -1x XRP ETF. There are now 17 XRP ETF filings pending a response from the US securities regulator. They include issuers Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Canary Capital, CoinShares, Invesco, VanEck, Fidelity, Ark Invest, Galaxy Digital, ProShares, Hashdex, and Volatility Shares. XRP made a minor recovery, gaining 4% over the past 24 hours to reach $2.15 at the time of writing, though it remains down 13% over the past week. In related news, Bitwise launched an ETF holding stocks of companies with large Bitcoin treasuries on March 11. The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) “seeks to track the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index, a new equity index of companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries,” the firm stated . At launch, the top five holdings of the index were Strategy 21%, MARA Holdings 12%, CleanSpark just over 6%, Riot Platforms 6%, and Boyaa Interactive just under 6%. Meanwhile, Cboe BZX is seeking permission from the SEC to incorporate staking into Fidelity’s ETH ETF, according to a March 11 19b-4 rule change filing . SEC Delays Altcoin ETFs It has been a busy week for crypto ETFs as the SEC issued a notice on Tuesday extending the review period for NYSE Arca’s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust to May 21. The regulator also pushed back approvals for the VanEck Spot Solana ETF, Canary Spot Litecoin ETF, Canary Spot Solana ETF, Canary Spot XRP ETF, and Grayscale Spot Dogecoin ETF. Issuers now have to wait until May, the new deadline for the SEC to either approve, reject, or delay the process.

The platform’s offerings promise huge gains for individuals seeking profit. XYZVerse sets a new memecoin trend XYZVerse emerges as a leading memecoin project with strong community backing and substantial growth potential. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a notable crossover that’s gaining popularity. According to XYZVerse, ‘wealth isn’t built in a day, but every buy, every HODL, every move gets you closer’. XYZVerse will blend sports and meme cultures Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently supported the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is unquestionable. XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model that goes beyond mere hype to ensure long-term sustainability. The platform allocates 15% of its total coins supply to liquidity, establishing a strong foundation. The team also reserves 10% of the total supply to incentivize community participation through bonuses and airdrops. XYZVerse further dedicates 17.13% to deflationary burns which potentially reduces the supply and increases demand for XYZ tokens over time. XYZ Verse sets up ambassador program to award free coins to users The XYZVerse team recently launched the Ambassador Program which enables users to earn free tokens by promoting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? XYZVerse has a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, which are ingredients of a project with serious potential. Many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big although the crypto market is always unpredictable. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity PI network brings crypto mining to smartphone users Pi is a GCV project that will create a decentralized and eco-friendly network for mobile devices. Its Open MainNet launch is expected to bring Pi closer to its goal of becoming a globally adopted digital. Pi network’s popularity has surged in recent months and the platform has now surpassed 110 million installations, with a daily average of 110K new downloads. On February 17 alone, over 540K new users joined the network. Pi leverages the Stellar Consensus Protocol which uses less power than the Bitcoin system. PI network launched the Ambassador Program to enable smartphone users to mine crypto without the need for expensive hardware or electric power. Stanford graduates launched the mobile-first Pi network in 2019 building a crypto-mining community that democratized digital assets. Unlike Bitcoin mining which requires expensive hardware and technical knowledge, Pi lets users earn crypto through a mobile app by performing daily check-ins. The app, according to a report by Livemint, does not drain battery life, ensuring maximum utility for for crypto miners. The Pi project has created a mining system that anyone can join and users are allowed to onboard trusted contacts. The token also positions itself as easy-to-use social cryptocurrency as the world moves towards a more decentralized Web3 internet. PI is more attractive than traditional cryptocurrencies, especially in today’s market where energy efficiency and accessibility are highly valued by investors. The PI network is expected to transform mainstream crypto adoption. Solana’s SOL prioritizes speed and efficiency The Solana blockchain prioritizes scalability and speed which allow developers to build decentralized apps that manage a high volume of users without compromising performance. Solana’s architecture processes transactions faster and more efficiently than other blockchains that employ complicated methods. SOL is used to compensate network supporters, execute programs, and pay for transactions. Investors see great potential in SOL because of its technology. SOL differentiates itself in a market where capacity and speed are important factors for investors. Conclusion XYZVerse’s sports-themed coin and zealous growth goals make it a standout choice in the current 2025 bull run although PI and SOL remain strong investments.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As SHIB and Pi struggle to prove their real-world use, Remittix’s PayFi solution is capturing attention with its $13.8m presale and growing investor interest. Table of Contents Shiba Inu’s struggle Pi Network’s user-driven model Remittix: The emerging PayFi disrupt Conclusion Remittix keeps heads spinning by breaking more than $13.8 million in presale, selling 518 million tokens for $0.0734. The growing interest is coming as investors are putting SHIB, PI, and RTX against one another in a fight to lead as long-term prospects. With SHIB still failing to gain a solid footing as a top memecoin and Pi Network failing to gain traction in the mainstream, more and more individuals are looking to Remittix’s PayFi focus as a dark horse to become one of crypto’s elite. Shiba Inu’s struggle Shiba Inu lost much of the luster from the stratospheric 2022 rise but remains a top 20 by market capitalization. Recent CoinMarketCap data on SHIB ‘s circulating supply indicate that the token-burning system and Shibarium layer-2 developments could lead to a price resurgence. The community recalls how Shiba Inu soared to near $0.00009, making early investors millionaires. However, skeptics are questioning whether meme-based tokens will make it to the top 10 without real-world applications. According to a prediction by Changelly regarding SHIB’s 2025 outlook, the coin may burst $0.00003 if it keeps getting traction and attracts new retail buyers. Still, there is tough competition from other meme coins, and macroeconomics may work against swift gains unless Shibarium or major exchanges bring it back into the limelight. Pi Network’s user-driven model Pi Network caused a commotion with its mobile mining configuration, and it built an immense community that “mines” PI via an application on their phone. One analysis of the price action by bitdegree.org speculates that once the majornet is coming into full contact with exchanges, market capitalization gains in dramatic form are possible. Hype comes to focus on its vast user base, much of which is expecting Pi to explode when open trade starts. Skeptics are quick to point out that Pi’s real-world applications are still unknown despite the project showing potential e-commerce applications. With a $13.8 billion market capitalization, half-listing Pi created confusion as exchanges listed “IOU” tokens. To achieve top 10, the network must have real-world usage and be able to keep users engaged past novelty. If Pi’s developers can convert that user base into a functional economy, the coin will quickly ascend the ranks. You might also like: SHIB faces challenges while Remittix gains traction with real-world solutions Remittix: The emerging PayFi disrupt Remittix is distinct by bridging the crypto-to-traditional remittances gap. With presale capital exceeding $13.8 million and currently selling tokens at $0.0734, it has transferred 517 million RTX. In a tribuneindia focus on the real-world adoption by Remittix, industry analysts observe that cross-border payments amount to over $190 trillion every year, and that is a massive opportunity if Remittix is able to outprice traditional systems and do so faster. The users can envision a Filipino worker in Canada sending stablecoins to their native land, getting them converted into pesos in real-time by local agents without exorbitant bank fees. That real-world application sets Remittix apart from memecoins or brand-hype-based coins. Bulls have a good vision to 10x or 20x multiples as soon as Remittix listings commence and if large diaspora communities align with its PayFi solution. Integrations with licensed money transmitters can optimize usage, creating a compelling case toward top 10 ambitions. Secondly, the compliance-oriented strategy employed by the project will also appeal to risk-averse traders, who have been scammed by rug pulls or memecoin frenzy. Providing it maintains the traction post-presale, particularly by rolling out partnerships on major remittance corridors, Remittix can overtake most established coins. Outpacing Pi and Shiba Inu in trading volumes or adoption on a daily basis could even put it in crypto’s elite. Conclusion Shiba Inu, Pi Network, and Remittix are all carving their own trajectories to potential top 10 by 2025. Shiba Inu relies on brand equity and fanbase to keep it moving, even if there are lingering questions regarding real-world adoption. Pi Network accesses an outlandish level of users via mobile phone mining but must lock in interest in real-world adoption. Remittix, on the other hand, addresses a real global remittance problem with crypto’s efficiency and could very well find itself to be an interesting play to capture humongous market share if diaspora adoption takes hold.

With Ethereum (ETH) also hitting a 17-month low, slipping below $1,800, the outspoken economist didn’t hold back, questioning the logic behind the U.S. government holding cryptocurrencies as reserve assets. Schiff Trolls Crypto Traders Known for his longtime criticism of Bitcoin in particular and crypto in general, Schiff took to X to poke fun at crypto investors after BTC’s latest downturn. The cryptocurrency’s price had dropped to $76,784, marking a 29% decline from an all-time high of $108,786 attained earlier in the year. Following the dip, Schiff suggested that many so-called crypto millionaires might need to find other work soon. “Now there’s another reason to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” he quipped. “A lot of crypto millionaires are going to need jobs,” he added. Despite the ribbing, some analysts believe Bitcoin’s current correction matches what happened in past bull cycles. In 2017, the asset saw an average correction of 35%, while in 2021, it was 37%. If history repeats, the coin could still fall to $70,000 before stabilizing, a possibility already predicted by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. He recently told traders to “be f***ing patient,” suggesting that a bottom near $70,000 would be a normal part of the market cycle. Schiff Calls for Saylor’s Ouster as MSTR Tumbles Schiff didn’t stop at Bitcoin’s waning prices. He took aim at MicroStrategy (MSTR), now known as Strategy, which has invested billions in the number one cryptocurrency, calling for the ouster of its Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Since peaking in November 2024, the firm’s stock has plunged over 55%, prompting Schiff to declare its Bitcoin acquisition plan had failed. “Clearly, the strategy is not working. The company needs a new CEO too. It’s time to fire Saylor,” he wrote. Saylor’s defenders countered, pointing out that MSTR shares had surged 1,500% in the last five years, and still remained up 85% in the last six months. However, the Euro Pacific Capital CEO dismissed their protestations, insisting that insolvency was inevitable for Strategy. “The company is on its way to bankruptcy,” he tweeted. In a separate post, the investment strategist also criticized ETH as well as its spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The financial products have plummeted 45% since their launch in July last year, while the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently cracked below $1,800, a level last seen in November 2023.

According to Bet-David, if XRP were to replace traditional financial systems like SWIFT and FedNow, the demand for XRP could skyrocket, leading to a massive increase in its price.XRP to $1,000: Breakdown of the NumbersIn his commentary, the market commentator explained that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can process transactions in just 3 to 5 seconds. This speed comes at near-zero cost, contrasting the much slower and more expensive SWIFT system.He pointed out that currently, SWIFT handles $5 trillion daily, or 1.25 quadrillion annually. If XRP captured just 10% of this volume, it could see a market worth $125 trillion annually.Bet-David cited statements from analysts who have predicted that such a massive volume would lead to a $10 trillion market cap for XRP. Accordingly, the unit price of XRP could rise to $100.Meanwhile, Bet-David also mentioned that these analysts anticipate that with the full replacement of traditional systems, the value of XRP could soar to $1,000. However, the media personality noted that these analysts may have vested interests in Ripple and XRP. As a result, he cautioned that while the scenario is plausible, it is not guaranteed.Nonetheless, Bet-David emphasized that this analysis presents a bold vision of the future for XRP. It suggests that if these developments come to pass, it could be a game-changer for the coin.Major Factor Influencing Bold XRP Prediction at This TimeNotably, these analyses come as Bet-David weighs in on the significance of U.S. President Donald Trump mentioning XRP among the tokens the U.S. could officially hold for the long term. On Truth Social, Trump shared a post about XRP and included comments about Bitcoin and Ethereum.Bet-David speculated that this move could indicate growing support for XRP behind closed doors, potentially from influential figures advising the president. He emphasized that such endorsements could signal something significant on the horizon for XRP.Accordingly, he urged listeners to keep an eye on the next 3, 6, and 12 months for potential developments. He also cautioned those who might not have the time or resources to conduct their own research, advising diversification as a safer strategy.Ultimately, Bet-David believes the coming months hold important news that could drastically impact the future of XRP and other cryptocurrencies.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-03-12 07:03:50

In a new post on the social media platform X, the crypto veteran outlines a series of events that he thinks would pressure the Federal Reserve to pivot and end its restrictive monetary policies. Hayes sees Bitcoin capitulating alongside the US stock market but says that those events will not be enough to trigger a Fed intervention. According to the Maelstrom CIO, the collapse of traditional financial (TradFi) firms in the US would force the Fed to end quantitative tightening (QT) – a move that would drive other major central banks to follow suit. “BTC likely bottoms around $70,000. A 36% correction from the $110,000 all-time high is very normal for a bull market. Then we need stonks, SPX (S&P 500) and NDX (Nasdaq Index) to enter free fall. Then we need TradFi muppet to go under. THEN we get the Fed, PBOC (People’s Bank of China), ECB (European Central Bank) and BOJ (Bank of Japan) all easing to make their country great again. THEN you load up the truck. Traders will try to buy the dip, if you are more risk averse wait for the central banks to ease then deploy more capital. You might not catch the bottom but you also won’t have to mentally suffer through a long period of sideways and potentially unrealized losses.” According to Hayes, Bitcoin will likely witness wild price swings once it gets close to his downside price target due to the massive number of outstanding derivative contracts, or open interest (OI), at the low $70,000 price area. “There are a lot of options OI struck at $70,000-$75,000, if we get into that range it will be violent.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $82,780, up nearly 5% in the past day.

The indicator in consideration is the spread between ""continuous"" next month and front-month standard BTC futures trading on the global derivatives giant. A continuous contract is a calculated representation of a series of successively expiring futures contracts, allowing for a continuous historical data series for analysis. The spread has narrowed to $495, the lowest since Nov. 5, having peaked at $1,705 on Dec. 17, according to data source TradingView. In other words, it has completely reversed the Trump bump in a sign of weakening bullish sentiment in the market. ""The narrowing spread between front-month and next-month CME Bitcoin futures could suggest traders are tempering their price expectations,"" Thomas Erdösi, head of product at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk. The unwinding of the Trump bump likely means the market has moved past the narrative that a pro-crypto President in the White House is good for the industry, and macro correlations are back in the driver's seat. ""What we can see is that the front contract basis has repriced lower substantially since the beginning of March, signalling moderating near term expectations that the primary catalyst for the recent rally—the election of President Trump—has been fully priced in,"" Erdosi said. That's already happening. Both BTC and Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, have dropped 20% and 8%, respectively, since early February on a myriad of factors, including geopolitical uncertainty, Trump tariffs and the outlook for inflation and economic growth. Additionally, the bitcoin market had to digest disappointment over the lack of fresh purchases in Trump's strategic digital asset reserve plan. Last week, Trump signed an executive order, directing a creation of a strategic reserve that includes BTC seized in enforcement actions. ""The announcement about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is not what the market was hoping for. Many expected the Reserve to buy new Bitcoin, but instead, they stated they would not sell any of their existing Bitcoin or confiscated Bitcoin. While this is a positive move, it caused a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price,"" Ian Balina, founder and CEO of Token Metrics, told CoinDesk in an email. Futures are still in contango While the spread between next month and front month CME futures contracts has narrowed, the entire curve remains in contango, where far-dated futures contracts (with longer maturities) trade at a premium to near-dated. That's how it usually is in all markets due to factors like storage, financing, insurance costs, and expectations of rising prices over coming weeks or months. ""The fact that perpetual funding rates remain positive and the futures basis is still in contango suggests the recent move is driven by unlevered spot longs being squeezed, rather than broader market contagion,"" Erdösi noted.",Markets|Bitcoin|CME|Futures|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-12 07:05:17

In a March 11 X post, Upbit Korea announced that it had added the altcoin to its USD market, with trading starting at 16:00 KST on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Arkham ( ARKM ) formed a “god candle,” surging from $0.47 to $0.70 within 10 minutes following the announcement. Its market cap exceeded $220 million at that time, while its daily trading volume hovered around $154 million. The gains also coincided with Arkham Exchange’s launch in China on the same day, which sparked significant interest among its community. Arkham Exchange is a cryptocurrency trading platform launched by Arkham Intelligence in November 2024. The platform offers spot and perpetual trading services, integrating advanced analytics and real-time market data tools. You might also like: Declining BTC whale ratio on Binance could signal market rebound, says analyst ARKM is the native token of the Arkham ecosystem and is used within the exchange for trading fee discounts, incentive programs, and potential governance participation. The expansion into China likely boosted demand for ARKM as more traders and investors in the region gained access to the platform. Lately, whales have been showing interest in ARKM, with Santiment data revealing a jump in the number of large holder addresses holding between 10,000 to 10 million ARKM tokens compared to the previous day. Such an increase in large holders suggests accumulation among whales, who may see long-term potential in the altcoin rather than focusing on short-term profits. Further, CoinGlass data shows consistent net outflows from exchanges since mid-January. However, despite these catalysts, ARKM had lost most of its gains and was up only 5.8% over the past day as of press time, while its daily trading volume surged threefold during the period to $366 million. ARKM price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, ARKM is trading above the descending trendline it had been stuck in from Dec. 7 to Feb. 22, signaling a potential break from its prolonged bearish trend. ARKM price, MACD and RSI chart — March 12 | Source: crypto.news The MACD and signal lines remain close to each other and below the price level, indicating weak bullish momentum. This is reinforced by a Relative Strength Index reading of 37, well below the neutral 50 mark. As such, ARKM may struggle to establish a sustained uptrend unless buying pressure increases significantly. While it has technically broken out of its downtrend, stronger bullish confirmation is needed for further gains. However, some indicators suggest an underlying demand that may help counteract selling pressure. According to CoinGlass data, derivative traders have been betting more on ARKM’s price moves, with open interest in the futures market jumping over 100% in the past day.

What's Needed for a Rise? Standard Chartered Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-bitcoins-fall-completely-over-whats-needed-for-a-rise-standard-chartered-explained/,"Bitcoin and altcoins have lost a lot of blood in the downtrend that has been going on for weeks. While BTC has fallen below $80,000, prices in altcoins are also at rock bottom. As investors wonder if the decline will continue and when the rise will begin, Standard Chartered has released its updated forecast. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, said Bitcoin’s recent decline was due to weakness in broader risk assets rather than crypto-specific issues. Stating that the recovery in Bitcoin depends on the FED, Kendrick said that positive news such as the FED's interest rate cuts are needed for the BTC price to recover. “Positive news specific to BTC, such as FED or purchases from the US and other countries, could boost Bitcoin. It is important that macroeconomic concerns, particularly those related to tariffs, are resolved quickly. “If the probability of a rate cut at the FOMC meeting in May increases after today's CPI, Bitcoin could recover. However, if that doesn't happen and the downtrend continues, Bitcoin could fall to $69,000.” Stating that the $200,000 BTC target for the end of 2025 is still valid, Kendrick stated that although market uncertainty has increased with Trump's tariff policies, next week's FED interest rate decision is an important test for Bitcoin's course. CoinDCX Ventures General Manager Rohit Jain also stated that the FED's interest rate decision is important for Bitcoin and altcoins. If interest rates remain steady at next week's FOMC meeting, it could impact sentiment toward risk assets, Jain said. “This hesitation to cut interest rates could trigger further declines in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin could test support levels around $70,000 in the coming days, while altcoins like Ethereum and Solana could continue to decline,” Jain said. *This is not investment advice.

There is a short-term rising channel forming with resistance at $2.250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it clears the $2.250 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.20 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.120 and $2.050 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $2.00. A low was formed at $1.90 and the price recently started a decent upward move. There was a move above the $1.980 and $2.00 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.365 swing high to the $1.90 low. The price is now trading below $2.1850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.250 level. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with resistance at $2.250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.365 swing high to the $1.90 low is also near the $2.250 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.350 level. The next resistance is $2.420. A clear move above the $2.420 resistance might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.150 level. The next major support is near the $2.120 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.120 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.120 and $2.050.

Cryptocurrency projects and enthusiasts view airdrops as a means of rewarding fervent users who have interacted with a protocol. Through pre-determined metrics, new and already existing projects incentivize user engagement with their ecosystems.While these have changed over time due to the farming trick—a ploy employed by users to pose artificial interaction and earn more rewards—airdrops remain a widely recognized means projects boost community engagement. Meanwhile, US residents have missed major drops since 2020 amid regulatory impediments.A recent Dragonfly report highlights this disposition and the estimated financial impact on both US residents and the government.US Residents Lose $1.84B-$2.64B in Airdrop RewardThe report, published on Tuesday, shows that US residents have missed substantial rewards due to their inability to participate in airdrops. For perspective, the US Securities and Exchange Commission clamped down on crypto projects since former chair Gary Gensler took office in 2021, with projects geoblocking US users from airdrop participation in a cautious move.Meanwhile, the United States has between 18.4 and 52.3 million cryptocurrency users. Interestingly, the geoblocking affected 920,000 and 5.2 million of these monthly active market participants in 2024.Notably, the Dragonfly report highlighted 11 major airdrops between 2020 and 2024, which dropped a staggering $7.16 billion to over 1.9 million claimants. Some of these projects include 1inch, Uniswap, and EigenLayer , and the average median claim is $4,562 per eligible address.As a result of the airdrop exclusion, US residents have missed between $1.84 billion and $2.64 billion in potential revenue. Moreover, these figures get larger with CoinGecko’s sample of 21 airdrops, with between $3.49 billion and $5.02 billion in revenue lost. Estinated Revenue Miss from US Residents Estimated Revenue Miss from US Residents US Government Not Left OutThe report further indicated that the US government has also lost staggering amounts of revenue. With the $1.84 billion lower band and CoinGecko’s $5.02 billion upper band, an individual tax of $418 million and $1.1 billion and a state tax of $107 million and $284 million would have flowed into the state’s purse had the geoblocking not affected residents.In total, the US government has lost between $525 million and $1.38 billion in taxes on US residents’ airdrop geoblocking. This adds to the growing number of funds the country has missed out on due to its mismanagement of the opportunities the crypto industry brings.David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, recently pointed out that the United States missed over $17 billion from the nation’s miscalculated Bitcoin sales.",Market,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|AIRDROP|MARKET|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-03-12 07:14:37

What Happens to Pi Coin Next?,https://coingape.com/is-pi-network-heading-for-price-pegging-what-happens-to-pi-coin-next/,"The latest reports in the market suggest that Pi Network is heading for a price pegging mechanism on the blockchain. Reportedly, the community has recently come across a smart contract code associated with Chainlink, while making direct references to the native cryptocurrency Pi Coin. The Pi price has shot up by 8% today, moving to $1.50 as investors continue to stay bullish for a rally to $5 and beyond. Pi Network To Implement Dynamic Pegging Mechanism? The Pi Network community has recently come across a smart contract code, featuring Chainlink, while putting up a direct reference to Pi Coin. This code hints at implementing a dynamic pegging mechanism, thereby potentially signaling plans to stabilize Pi’s value via an automated minting and burning system. If verified, the discovery suggests that Pi Network could be implementing a price-pegging mechanism to manage volatility. This approach is commonly used in stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which tie their value to assets such as USD or gold. The mechanism further enables price stability, providing a predictable and less volatile trading environment. Some market analysts believe that a pegged Pi Coin could attract more users and investors by offering a more reliable valuation method. They also believe that as an algorithmic stablecoin, the altcoin could see greater acceptability in everyday transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. However, the PiCoreTeam still needs to confirm the authenticity around this pegging mechanism. What Will Be Pi Coin Price After Pegging? Recent details about Pi Network’s pegging mechanism highlight a unique approach to stabilizing its value through dynamic algorithmic pegging. The smart contract, reportedly tied to Chainlink, will automatically manage the supply of Pi Coins based on price fluctuations. It will do this in two ways: Minting additional Pi Coins when the price drops below the target. Burning existing Pi Coins when the price exceeds the target. As shown in the image below, the name of the pegged token is Pi Coin with a target price of $314,159 USD (represented as 314,159 × 10¹⁸ Wei, the smallest Ethereum unit). The mint mechanism will be activated when the price falls below the target and the burn mechanism will be activated when the price moves above the target. Binance Listing an Immediate Price Target The latest reports in the town suggest that the Pi Network cryptocurrency could be heading for an immediate listing on crypto exchange Binance . This could provide it a major liquidity boost, driving the price higher. With a binance listing, Pi Coin could register its spot among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. Pi Coin’s price has demonstrated resilience, holding firmly at the $1.30 support level despite recent market volatility. Analysts point to this as a bullish signal, suggesting that Pi cryptocurrency may be gearing up for a significant upward move. Market sentiment is turning optimistic, with growing calls for a potential rally pushing PI towards the $5 mark. Source: Moon Jeff The post Is Pi Network Heading for Price Pegging?

Ether (ETH), BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP and Cardano’s ADA rose as much as 3%, alleviating some losses from the past 7 days. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) added nearly 4%. Elsewhere, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying decisions on XRP, Dogecoin, and Litecoin filings. Bloomberg analysts had previously pegged Litecoin’s odds at 90%, Doge at 75%, and XRP at 65% for an ETF approval by year-end, yet the regulator’s hesitation is keeping the market on edge. Traders still eye a pullback to the $74,000 level, and below, before an eventual push higher. “Previously, a similar decline would complete a corrective pullback, attracting buyers,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, told CoinDesk in an email. “However, the chances of such an outcome are now lower than in previous years due to the powerful influence of traditional financial companies, which has strengthened the link between the crypto market and stock dynamics.The scenario of a pullback to the $70-$74K area still looks the most probable for us. This is all the truer as the consolidation and rebound in early March has taken the short-term oversold stance out of the market,” Kuptsikevich added. Gains in BTC came as Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, pushing for the U.S. to scoop up 1 million BTC as a strategic reserve. The bill, which Lummis first introduced last year, would direct the government to purchase 1 million bitcoins over five years. The first $6 billion in remittances from reserve banks would be set aside each year between 2025 and 2029 to build up the reserve and rely on the Fed’s gold certificates. Some speculated the possible inclusion of major tokens in such a reserve in the future. “Altcoins such as XRP, SOL, and ADA pumped higher than expected as pro-crypto Senator Lummis reintroduced her strategic Bitcoin reserve bill to purchase 1 million Bitcoins, and there’s speculation that previously announced altcoins will later be included in the reserve purchases,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.",Markets|Dogecoin|XRP|Litecoin|ETF|Bitcoin|SEC,EN,0,0,BTC|XRP|LTC|DOGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-12 07:17:38

With $1.7 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton joining the race for a spot XRP ETF, fresh developments in the Ripple lawsuit, and bullish technical signals flashing, Ripple looks prime for a rally that could outperform the rest of the market. Will April 2025 be the turning point for the XRP price? Let’s explore. Top 3 Reasons Why April 2025 Could Spark a Major XRP Price Rally XRP price struggled in February and remains under bearish pressure in March as a brutal crypto market selloff continues. Despite weak demand and rising selling pressure, three key factors suggest that April could be a turning point for Ripple price, potentially shifting the trend from bearish to bullish. Key Development on the Ripple Lawsuit on April 16 A major catalyst that could impact the XRP price in April 2025 is a potential breakthrough in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. Attorney Fred Rispoli has noted that the lawsuit could potentially be resolved before April 16, 2025. In an earlier statement, Rispoli said that the new pro-crypto SEC was waiting for Paul Atkins to take over as the new Chair before dropping the lawsuit. Per Rispoli, “Although there is no formal reason requiring it, it is reasonable to speculate that the SEC v. Ripple case is resolved–or at least something significant happens–before Ripple’s filing deadline of April 16, 2025.” Positive developments in this lawsuit have fueled XRP price surges. In late 2024, Ripple price soared 200% after Trump’s victory sparked hopes of a pro-crypto SEC. If the lawsuit resolves in April 2025, history suggests another major rally could follow. Franklin Templeton Joins Race for a Spot XRP ETF Asset managers are scrambling to submit filings for spot XRP ETFs, suggesting high institutional interest in the altcoin. On March 11, 2025, Franklin Templeton, one of the largest asset managers with $1.7 trillion in assets under management filed a prospectus for a spot XRP ETF to track XRP price. Franklin Templeton XRP ETF Filing This filing came after the SEC delayed its decision on the other submitted filings for a Ripple ETF until May 2025. However, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart believes the delay was standard procedure until Atkins takes over as the new chair. Franklin Templeton joins Fidelity and other top asset managers who have filed for a spot XRP ETF. The flurry of filings shows high institutional interest in this product, which could see BlackRock joining the race and stirring a parabolic rally for XRP price in April 2025. XRP Price Gears for Rally as Technical Indicators Flip Bullish Besides these catalysts, XRP price also seems poised for a parabolic rally after technical indicators on the 4-hour chart flipped bullish. XRP price today trades at $2.18 after a 3.7% gain in 24 hours. The volume profile bars indicate that Ripple has entered a strong buy zone, which could accelerate the uptrend toward the 50% and 78.6% Fibonacci levels of $2.45 and $2.76, respectively. The Awesome Oscillator bars have flipped green, which is indicative of rising bullish momentum. If these bars flip positive, it could set the stage for a parabolic rally for XRP price past $3. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart Conclusion April 2025 could be a make-or-break month for XRP price, with key catalysts aligning for a potential breakout. A potential breakthrough in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, optimism around an XRP ETF approval, and bullish technical signals indicate Ripple price is on the verge of another explosive rally.

The crypto market shows PEPE predicted to hit $0.01 while ADA aims for $5 but MUTM emerges as the notable underdog due to analyst predictions of reaching $8 in a short time. MUTM functions as a high-utility DeFi project that has attracted more than 5,200 holders during its presale process where investors contributed $3.1 million to the project. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Riding the Meme Coin Wave The demand for Pepe Coin (PEPE) has increased rapidly after Binance added it to the BNSOL Super Stake program. The announcement of PEPE in BNSOL Super Stake prompted an increase in investor trust which resulted in immediate PEPE price appreciation by 7%. The crypto analyst Mister Crypto anticipates PEPE will achieve $0.0144 shortly while estimating a value of $0.00014 for 2025. An increase of ten times in value seems possible because Meme Coins have historically shown significant price boosts after both exchange listings and staking initiatives. PEPE functions as a risky bet because it is purely speculative compared to utility-based crypto tokens. Cardano (ADA): A Crucial Breakout Ahead The price movement of Cardano (ADA) stands at a decisive point in its historical trajectory. ADA’s price movement maintains a position above $0.80 but faces market resistance when it reaches $1.20. The potential market surge beyond $5 would begin if investors manage to break through this price barrier. The path to reaching this target demands an enormous elevation in network operation speed and trading market size. The recent decrease of active addresses on the blockchain network indicates users have shown less engagement with the system. The ongoing price rise of ADA depends on both rising network member engagement and enhanced liquidity levels. The $5 target requires a favorable market environment to become attainable even though it represents a difficult yet achievable goal. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dominates the market through its groundbreaking lending framework and solid token economic system. The MUTM pre-sale has reached its third phase while collecting $3.1 million from 5,200 token buyers who obtained tokens for $0.02 each. The following presale stage will adjust the MUTM price to $0.025 thus increasing the initial investment value by 25%. Users who hold MUTM tokens before the launch will experience a 200% profit since the token price starts at $0.06. Mutuum Finance stands out from the competition because its platform operates in the real world. Users can access passive income generation by using decentralized lending pools on this platform to borrow or lend assets. The mtTokens system operates as a unique feature where users can tokenize their deposits to earn extra income and gain more liquidity. The buy-and-distribute approach strengthens MUTM’s value by continuously buying from the market while also giving long-term investors additional rewards. Market analysts project MUTM will achieve a value of $8 following its launch since more users are adopting and utilizing the platform. A $2,500 investment during the presale phase will produce more than $60,000 if MUTM reaches a value of $0.60. The rush of investors during presale periods indicates that the opportunity to acquire MUTM at its initial price value will soon disappear. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as the top DeFi project with profound utility because it demonstrates potential that exceeds the growth prospects of Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Cardano (ADA). MUTM stands out due to its innovative lending approach and robust tokenomics together with its fast-rising presale performance which makes it an attractive investment opportunity. MUTM remains well-positioned to drive the following DeFi innovations as the crypto market develops. The phase 3 investment period is rapidly filling up because an upcoming price hike will occur soon.

The U.S. national debt currently stood at more than $36.2 trillion at the time of publication. Ray Dalio told CNBC’s Sara Eisen at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore that “the first thing is the debt issue; we have a very severe supply-demand problem.” The Bridgewater founder also noted that trade policy uncertainty had added to a sense of unease on Wall Street. He believes that investors were concerned about the impact of a brewing trade war on the global economy. Ray Dalio warns of shocking developments in the U.S. economy BREAKING: Ray Dalio warns that a severe US supply-demand problem may lead to ""shocking developments,"" per CNBC. He says the US will see ""shocking developments"" in terms of how the debt crisis will be ""dealt with."" pic.twitter.com/JTW8u7J0az — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 12, 2025 American investor Ray Dalio believes that a severe U.S. supply-demand problem regarding U.S. debt could have a disruptive impact on the global economy. It is the latest in a series of stern warnings about the nation’s mounting debt from the Bridgewater founder. The U.S. hedge fund billionaire argued that the U.S. has to sell a quantity of debt that the world is not going to want to buy. The state’s national debt was currently at above $36.2 trillion. Dalio also warned that it was imminent and of “paramount importance” to take note of the country’s supply-demand imbalance. He argued that the state’s deficit needed to go from a projected level of 7.2% of gross domestic product to about 3% of GDP. He stated that it was a big deal and that “you are going to see shocking developments in terms of how that’s going to be dealt with.” Dalio made the comments on the same panel as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff amid a tariff ride for markets in recent days. “Just as we are seeing political and geopolitical shifts that seem unimaginable to most people, if you just look at history, you will see these things repeating over and over again. We will be surprised by some of the developments that will seem equally shocking as those developments that we have seen.” – Ray Dalio , founder of Bridgewater. Dalio was asked whether the U.S. debt problem could lead to a period of austerity and he said the issue could result in a restructuring of the debt. The American investor also believes that the debt problem could lead to the U.S. applying pressure on other countries to buy the debt, or even cutting off payments to some creditor countries. Dalio warns of potential “economic heart attack” due to rising federal debt Dalio had previously stated at the World Governments Summit in February that the federal debt had surged to $36.4 trillion against a GDP of $29.1 trillion. He warned of a potential “economic heart attack” if no immediate action was taken by the U.S. government. The country’s current debt-to-GDP ratio stood at roughly 125%, with federal debt having surged 80% since 2020 while GDP grew only 38%. Data from the Congressional Budget Office revealed that the annual budget deficits were projected to average 6.1% of GDP through 2025, which was significantly higher than the 50-year average of 3.8%. CBO also believes that the deficit to GDP ratio will drop to 5.2% by 2027 as revenues rise faster than expenditures. The data also projected that national debt will rise by nearly $24 trillion over the next decade. The American investor has been constantly advocating for his “3% solution,” which he said combined spending cuts, tax adjustments, and careful interest rate management. Dalio also supported the President’s proposal for interest rate deductions but emphasized that it must be accompanied by spending cuts to effectively address the deficit. The American investor was asked if the wasteful expenditure cuts undertaken by the DOGE, handled by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, will help achieve the 3% deficit threshold. He answered, “I don’t see it.” Dialo argued that the department should also focus on the impact of the expenditure cuts and efficiency enhancement initiatives on interest rates if the deficit problem had to be addressed. The entrepreneur also maintained that the three-year time horizon was achievable if the focus was on increasing tax income, doing “tolerable” expenditure cuts, and focusing on interest rates.

The presale structure is unlike anything you’ve seen before, with Arctic Pablo traveling across various “locations” and gradually increasing its price as it progresses. With over $1.84 million already raised, this project is proving to be a serious contender for investors looking to maximize their returns. The token burn mechanism ensures long-term sustainability by permanently removing unsold tokens, creating scarcity that could boost the coin’s value over time.

With the changing microeconomic trend, the crypto market quickly added $89 billion, hitting $2.61 trillion, with $2.63 trillion as a key resistance level. Whereas Bitcoin is back above $80,000 and needs to break $82,761 to aim for $85,000, backed by strong investor support. What Happened in Crypto Today? One of the biggest factors behind this bullish call was Ukraine’s agreement to a temporary 30-day ceasefire after talks with U.S. officials according to Bloomberg . This move helped reduce global uncertainty, calming investors who were previously worried about geopolitical risks. Please see a joint statement from United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and myself: Today, United States Secretary of Commerce @howardlutnick and Premier of Ontario Doug Ford had a productive conversation about the economic relationship between the United States… — Doug Ford (@fordnation) March 11, 2025 At the same time, Ontario announced it was lifting a 25% tariff on electricity exports to Michigan, New York, and Minnesota. This decision eased trade tensions, another factor that had been weighing on financial markets. In the U.S., political leaders also stepped in to reassure investors. House Speaker Mike Johnson encouraged patience regarding President Trump’s economic policies, suggesting that they would bring stability in the long run. Moreover, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added that the recent market turmoil was only temporary and that the economy was in a transition phase. These combined factors helped boost confidence, leading to a recovery in both traditional and crypto markets. Crypto Market Sees Relief After Massive Bloodbath The crypto market had been under intense pressure earlier in the week, with nearly $1 billion in liquidations causing Bitcoin and Ethereum to drop to monthly lows. However, the situation has improved significantly. Over the past 24 hours, total liquidations dropped to $384.4 million. Out of this, $138.2 million came from long positions (bets that prices would go up), while $246.2 million were short positions (bets that prices would go down). Bitcoin was the biggest mover in this recovery, jumping 3.6% to trade at $82,299. According to Coinglass data, Bitcoin liquidations totaled $186.7 million, with most coming from short positions. This means that many traders who had bet against Bitcoin’s price were forced to exit as the market turned in the opposite direction. Ethereum also saw a similar trend, with $73.6 million in liquidations, nearly evenly split between long and short trades. Will the Market Stay Strong? The market’s recovery has been driven by political stability and easing economic tensions, but investors are still cautious. While the drop in liquidations and Bitcoin’s price rebound are positive signs, further market movement will depend on how global economic conditions evolve. Any new geopolitical risks or economic policies could still impact the market’s momentum. For now, crypto traders are watching closely to see if this recovery can hold or if more volatility is on the way.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 07:54:18

Due to decreased liquidity and investor participation, the network’s total value locked decreased from $63 billion in January to $44 billion in February, according to DefiLlama data . Stablecoin inflows have slowed down, indicating a slower capital rotation into Ethereum ( ETH ) protocols. The data also shows that decentralized exchange trading volumes are down, from $92 billion in December to $82 billion in February. As other chains like Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) and Solana ( SOL ) register growing perpetual futures trading volumes, futures trading on Ethereum has suffered, dropping from $31 billion in December to $18 billion in February. Ethereum’s revenue has taken a major hit, falling from $193 million in December to just $26 million in February. Declining transaction fees and low network activity have caused the sharp decline.

Credit: crypto.news Bollinger Bands show higher volatility. Ethereum is hugging the bottom band, suggesting oversold conditions. At 34.51, the relative strength index is near the oversold threshold of 30, showing poor buying pressure but the possibility of a relief rally should demand increase. The low trading volume indicates poor market participation. ETH may move toward $1,800 if it breaks below $1,875; while a reversal would face resistance at $2,282. Ethereum must reclaim its 50-day moving average to see a bullish shift, but price movement is still under pressure. One important development to keep an eye on is the push to include staking in Ether ETFs. Cboe BZX has filed a request for U.S. regulators to allow for staking of Fidelity’s Ether ETF, following a similar request from 21Shares in February. If approved, investors could earn around 3.3% in staking rewards, which might attract more institutional interest.

The price is trading below $0.750 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.720 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.750 resistance zone. Cardano Price Climbs Higher In the past few days, Cardano saw a bearish wave below the $0.80 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.750 and $0.70 support levels.

At the time of writing, BTC stands at $81,086, reflecting a 1.7% increase in the past 24 hours but still showing a 2.3% decrease over the past week. The ongoing correction has raised concerns among investors about whether the asset will recover or enter a prolonged consolidation phase. While there is no definitive reason behind Bitcoin’s ongoing price movements, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has highlighted an interesting correlation between BTC and Nasdaq According to Darkfost, Bitcoin is currently more correlated with the Nasdaq index than with the S&P 500, suggesting that macroeconomic factors and broader market sentiment are playing a role in BTC’s performance. This correlation indicates that external market trends, such as changes in US equity markets and monetary policy decisions, might be influencing Bitcoin’s price direction. Related Reading: Michael Saylor’s Strategy Unveils $21 Billion Stock Issuance For Bitcoin Investment Short-Term Holder SOPR and Bitcoin’s Market Cycle Amid Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, CryptoQuant analyst Kripto Mevsimi has examined the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) EMA (155), which provides insights into market cycles and investor behavior. According to Mevsimi, SOPR EMA (155) recently peaked and is now declining, signaling that short-term holders are realizing fewer profits. This trend could indicate that the market is entering a consolidation phase. The analyst further explained that if SOPR approaches 1 and holds as support, it may signal a healthy market reset before the next potential uptrend. However, if SOPR drops below 1, it could indicate increased selling pressure, which may lead to further market weakness. Mevsimi emphasized that for Bitcoin’s bullish trend, which began in early 2023, to continue, SOPR should stabilize around 1 and then trend upward again. Failure to hold this level may suggest a shift in market dynamics, putting Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory into question. Whale Accumulation Continues Amid Market Correction While short-term price action remains uncertain, another CryptoQuant analyst, caueconomy, has highlighted a significant accumulation trend among large Bitcoin holders. Over the last 30 days, Bitcoin whales have added over 65,000 BTC to their holdings, reflecting strong buying pressure from major network participants. Caueconomy noted that this accumulation is occurring despite the broader market correction, suggesting that whales are absorbing supply rather than selling off their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Downtrend Continues, But Analyst Predicts $180K Target—Is It Possible? This behavior contrasts with miners and exchanges, which often offload BTC to maintain liquidity. If the current accumulation pattern continues for several more weeks, it could resemble the consistent buying pressure seen between November and December, which helped Bitcoin rally in late 2023.

Its resurgence coincides with an entire revival of the crypto sector, where BTC surged past $82,000. Pi Network’s native token has been at the forefront of gains in the past 24 hours, with its price rising by 15% to just south of $1.60. Its market capitalization soared above $11 billion, thus surpassing Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to become the 12th-biggest cryptocurrency. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko One factor potentially contributing to the rally is the approaching Pi Day on March 14 . The date holds significance for the community, marking the end of the period during which users must complete KYC verifications and migrate to the mainnet. Additionally, the project will celebrate its sixth birthday on March 14. Some industry participants have speculated that Binance might list PI on that day. Last month, the largest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see the asset available for trading. Over 86% of the voters clicked the “yes” option, but the company has remained silent on the matter . PI’s latest resurgence also aligns with the broader revival of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly pumped above $83,000 before settling at approximately $82,000. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and many more leading altcoins are also well in the green on a 24-hour scale.

With this, the investor’s confidence climbed, leaving a positive impact on Bitcoin & the other altcoins. Solana’s price reversed the possibility of drawing below $110 as the rebound pushed it back above $120. Currently, the token appears to be in a ‘safe zone, ’ but the fear of a pullback may prevail until and unless the SOL price does not secure a pivotal resistance. Buzz Around Solana-ETF, Future Contracts, & More In a recent development, the SEC has delayed its decision regarding ETFs for Solana and other cryptos, which is believed to be extremely important for future institutional adoption. Meanwhile, the potential approval of Solana ETF is estimated to be 70%. On the other hand, the CME group is set to launch a futures contract for Solana on March 17, 2025, offering a platform for investors to deal with Solana. Secondly, Solana has maintained its lead in decentralized exchange trading volume, surpassing BinanceSmartChain and Ethereum for the fifth consecutive month. On the other hand, a recent funding round for Solana-based decentralized computing platform Voltix secured $10 million, indicating ongoing investor interest in the ecosystem. These developments shed light on Solana’s growing influence and an increase in institutional interest. Will These Impact the Solana (SOL) Price Rally in Future? The Solana price , which is trading around $123.25, has been showing signs of recovery but continues to face challenges due to recent market conditions. The broader market is experiencing panic, with technicals suggesting weak momentum and fading network activity, which raises concern about Solana’s ability to regain traction. The SOL price has dropped below the crucial range, which suggests the bears may soon take over the rally. As soon as the price dropped below the support of the rising parallel channel, the Ichimoku clouds were preparing for a bearish crossover. While the RSI is heading towards the lower threshold, the CMF has plunged and plunged just below 0. This suggests the token in the long term has been sliding under bearish influence, and hence reclaiming $125 is extremely important for the Solana price rally. Meanwhile, the experts believe Solana needs to reclaim the pivotal resistance at $133 to flip the prevailing bearish influence over the token, which is feared to drag the levels below $100.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 08:11:48

After a heavy crypto liquidation in the past few days, the leveraged crypto futures and spot market have significantly cooled down, thus setting the stage for a rejuvenated rebound in the coming days. Moreover, the stars are all aligned for a parabolic crypto rally in the coming months, led by the regulatory environment change in the United States. Sui Price Chart Breakdown After hitting its all-time high (ATH), around $5.3 earlier this year, Sui’s price has been trapped in a falling channel to date. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $22 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $1 billion, has rebounded from the lower border of the falling logarithmic trend in the past two days. Additionally, the Sui price has been retesting a crucial support range between $2 and $2.39, which will decide its fate in the coming weeks. A potential macro bullish rebound for the Sui price will be confirmed if the altcoin consistently closes above $5.3. When Spot ETF? The Sui network has grown to a vibrant DeFi ecosystem, with more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over $638 million in stablecoins market cap. Remarkably, web3 projects building on the Sui network raised a whopping $200 million in the first three months of 2025, signaling investors’ confidence. As a result of the palpable growth, the hype on potential spot Sui ETF in the United States has significantly increased. Already, the VanEck fund manager has been offering a Sui Exchange Traded Note (ETN) on Deutsche Börse and Euronext. Although the ETN is not a spot ETF, its success will heavily impact the desire of other fund managers led by Canary Capital to file a spot Sui ETF soon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 08:13:35

In the past 13 hours, the whale has unloaded 600 MKR for 701,068 USDT, at an average price of $1,168. This was their first-ever trade of any kind since they first began accumulating MKR on February 14, 2025. If recent prices for the DeFi token are anything to go by, the massive sell-off has resulted in a loss of anywhere from $30,000 to $65,000 for the whale. Whale’s First Trade in MKR: Significant Losses and Current Holdings For a whale of this scale, the move to sell 600 MKR is particularly worth noting. Given the volatility of the crypto market, many had expected that large holders like this one would ride out price fluctuations and not make sudden trades. But in this instance, the whale made a trade and realized a loss. The 12.8% markdown in value of the MKR sold amounted to about $276,000 in losses on this particular sale. The whale holds a substantial amount of MKR, even after the apparent loss. At present, they possess half a thousand in MKR tokens, equivalent to about 589 grand in the market today. Additionally, the whale appears to have supplied 400 of the MKR tokens to Aave, which, if you ask me, could be them using a portion of their assets as collateral. The whale made an intriguing decision when it sold 600 MKR at an average price of $1,168, considering the general market trend and the price of MKR at the time of the trade. MKR, the governance token of Maker DAO, has enjoyed some considerable ups and downs in recent months. But these swings in price have made our whale’s trade even more striking in hindsight, especially for a holder with such a large position. Understanding the Market Context and the Whale’s Position As the governance token for the Maker ecosystem, MKR plays a central role in maintaining and securing the Maker protocol, which is the underlying technology for the DAI stablecoin. However, recent months have seen the price of MKR oscillating, driven by the overall market sentiment and the performance of DeFi protocols. These price fluctuations might have prompted the whale to sell a portion of MKR. It is also entirely possible that the whale simply needed funds for other investments. Nevertheless, the losses are tough to overlook. Offloading 600 MKR for $701,068 means the whale got around $1,168 per MKR on average. With an estimated loss on the trade amounting to around $276,000, this signals that the whale was buying MKR at a higher price, probably during a more recent market peak. Looks like this whale is finally saying goodbye to $MKR . In the last 13 hours, Whale 0x5a3 sold 600 MKR for 701,068 USDT at an average price of $1,168. This whale started trading MKR on February 14, 2025, and this was their first trade. pic.twitter.com/nohaYXXYpa — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) March 11, 2025 Simultaneously, the whale’s failure to liquidate its entire position suggests some level of confidence in MKR’s long-term trajectory. The whale holds 500 MKR tokens, of which they appear to have supplied 400 to Aave. These signals could mean the whale is betting on a rebound in MKR’s price; alternatively, they might be using the tokens as part of some other financial strategy in alliance with Aave. Aave’s Role in the Whale’s Strategy Choosing to supply 400 MKR to Aave presents yet another interesting angle from which to contemplate the whale’s strategy. Aave is one of the largest decentralized lending protocols in the DeFi space, allowing users to earn interest on their supplied assets or borrow against them. By supplying MKR as collateral, the whale could be taking advantage of Aave’s liquidity to access funds without fully liquidating their MKR holdings. This isn’t exactly a lights-out tactic for maximizing returns; by supplying MKR to Aave, the whale isn’t earning any interest, and there’s a chance, albeit a slim one, that Aave could become insolvent. The whale’s move to put MKR on Aave could indicate a more bullish outlook on the long-term value of the token. They may be hoping to earn interest on their supplied MKR while simultaneously allowing the market conditions to shift in their favor. Even if the whale is in this situation, the risk here is that if MKR continues to decline in value, their collateral could face liquidation, depending on the lending platform’s liquidation thresholds. What’s Next for This Whale and MKR? This whale’s position with $276,000 in realized losses from their first MKR trade raises several questions. Will they cut their losses further, or will they hold their remaining MKR in hopes of a market rebound? The fact that they have retained a significant portion of their holdings suggests a long-term strategy, despite the current losses. Moreover, the current market turbulence offers risks and opportunities. If MKR makes a comeback, the whale can look not only to recover his losses but also to perhaps regain some semblance of the profit path on which he’d been cruising before the recent downturn. But if the token can’t find its legs soon, the risk that his Aave-supplied collateral could be disciplined via liquidation becomes another potential loss in what has already been a tough month. The whale’s significant remaining stake and its involvement with Aave suggest that it is not entirely exiting its position. This indicates a potentially more nuanced strategy—maybe even a simple buy-and-hold strategy. For now, though, the whale’s MKR price trajectory is our only real clue to what’s actually going on. To summarize, the whale’s first loss in MKR trading cuts to the heart of the crypto market’s volatility that we’re all too familiar with. Yet, even with that stunning setback, our aquatic friend still has a gigantic remaining position, and they still play in DeFi platforms like Aave. So the question remains: will this whale recover from its MKR loss, or is it more likely that we’ll see additional risks unravel? Stay tuned! Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With Pi Network price climbing as the token secures its position as the 11th largest crypto by market cap, speculation is rife over whether Trump will mention Pi Coin in his next press briefing. If this happens, how high will Pi Network price rally? How High Will Pi Network Price Rally if Trump Mentions Pi Coin? There are several factors that could make Pi Network price the next topic in Trump’s crypto discussions, fueling a parabolic rally. White House crypto czar David Sacks recently told Bloomberg that Trump mentioned ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA because they rank among the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. In the meantime, Pi Network token is rapidly closing in, securing its spot as the 11th largest crypto just weeks after launch. Beyond its market position, Pi Coin has also overtaken Ethereum in social following, making it the fourth most-followed cryptocurrency. Pi Network X Following With Pi Network price surging amid growing adoption and investor interest, it could soon be among the top digital assets Trump highlights in his next press briefing. Pi Coin is also swiftly gaining adoption in the US. The token has gained entry into a trillion-dollar US industry . Additionally, Pi Network is one of the affiliate members at Stanford School of Engineering alongside other US crypto companies such as Ripple and a16z, whose executives were present at the White House Crypto Summit. As Pi Coin gains inroads in the US, it could soon be recognized as one of the top US altcoins . This could prompt Trump to mention it during his pro-crypto press briefings and drive a Pi Network price rally. Grok AI notes that if Trump were to mention Pi Coin, the price could rally by as much as 200% within a few hours. If this rally extends for days, it would target $100. It noted, “Realistically, a mention alone might drive a 100-150% rally within 48 hours, mirroring past Trump-induced spikes. For a longer-term surge—say, toward $100 or beyond.” Pi Network Token Soars 20% – More Gains Ahead? As the Pi Coin community awaits a potential mention by Trump, Pi Network price is already rallying ahead of the project’s sixth anniversary on March 14. At press time, the Pi Network token trades at $1.66 after a staggering 20% gain in 24 hours. After these gains, Pi Coin flipped resistance at $1.44, and could soon rally to the 123.6% Fibonacci level of $3.42. The RSI stands at 62, which is a bullish zone. It shows that buying pressure and the upward trend are strong, which could spark a major Pi Coin price rally . The MACD line is tipping upwards and attempting to cross over to the positive region to confirm the bullish thesis. At the same time, the MACD histogram bars show that buyers are in control. As these bullish signs emerge, the Pi Network price prediction shows that a rally past $3 is likely to happen in the near term. PI/USDT: 2-hour Chart In summary, Pi Network price today is bullish ahead of the project’s sixth anniversary on March 14. However, if the project’s iconic growth piques the interest of President Trump, the token could rally by 200% within a few hours and possibly hit $100 within days.

In total, four large crypto whales moved 47,756 ETH (about $89.53 million) from their wallets to centralized exchanges (CEXs) in a series of transactions that took place between October 6 and October 7. What’s concerning, of course, is that these funds are now on the exchanges instead of being held in over-the-counter (OTC) markets or kept by the whales in their own private wallets. Many have started to question whether the whales are preparing to sell off large portions of their holdings. Why? Because of when these sudden deposits have been made. Ethereum’s price is continuing to fluctuate as it weathers the ongoing storm of market turbulence, but in and of itself, the movement of this much ETH just looks concerning for the next few price candles. Whale Movements and CEX Deposits Four major whale accounts deposited large sums of ETH. Within the Ethereum community, this has drawn a lot of interest. Here’s a simple rundown of the transfers and the platforms that are receiving all these deposits. 0xb69: This whale sent 16,555 ETH (about $31.51 million) to two important platforms — Coinbase and Wintermute. Coinbase, one of the largest and most reliable centralized exchanges, has seen an explosion of ETH deposits from institutional investors and whales in recent days. 1. Longling Capital is a well-known crypto investment entity that has transferred a sum of Ethereum to Binance. 2. The sum in question is 21,000 ETH. 3. In terms of USD, this is approximately $38.81 million. 4. This is a significant amount for anyone to transfer, but is especially notable coming from Longling Capital, given the size and scale of their operations. 3. 0x702: Another whale account moved 7,200 ETH (roughly $13.71 million) to Binance. Although smaller than the previous two, this deposit still represents a notable amount, further adding to the overall influx of ETH into centralized exchanges. 4. 0xAA1: The whale 0xAA1 made one last transfer that netted it a colossal amount of ETH. Unloading 3,000 ETH (worth about $5.15 million), 0xAA1 sent the coins to Binance. This transfer was part of a concerning trend of major ETH outflows to centralized exchanges. These deposits have brought about much debate among analysts, traders, and crypto enthusiasts. The whales may be setting up to sell big chunks of ETH in the not-too-distant future, and that could serve to push the price down. Whale Sell-Off Triggers ETH Drop? 47,756 $ETH Deposited to CEXs in 24H According to The Data Nerd, 4 whales have deposited a total of 47,756 $ETH (~$89.53M) to CEXs in the past 24 hours: 0xb69 sent 16,555 $ETH (~$31.51M) to @Coinbase & @wintermute_t . Longling Capital… — Followin (@followin_io) March 11, 2025 Impact on ETH Price Action Recently, the price of Ethereum fell sharply after “whale” individual investors deposited large amounts of ETH into centralized exchanges. Because these exchanges facilitate trading of all kinds, when ETH flows into them, people start to think about what this could mean for the price of ETH itself. Here are a few potential implications of the price drop in light of these big deposits. In the past, hefty deposits of cryptocurrencies into exchanges have signified impending sales or trades. Of late, we’ve seen the writeup on centralized exchanges (CEXs) swell with Ethereum (ETH)—put plainly, there is a lot of ETH on centralized exchanges. With that in mind, it’s not a huge leap to say that was written about in a way that might have traders and investors freaking out and anticipating a significant market dump of ETH. Of course, ETH being one of the most traded and liquid assets in the space, these movements have a noticeable effect on its price. Some analysts think that the huge ETH deposit is a strategic move by the whale to profit lock during the present market situation. After a year in which the price of Ethereum saw huge appreciation, these whale might be trying to take some profits at this time before any possible price corrections. They might be waiting for the next leg up before they make any further moves with their ETH. Whales and Market Sentiment Large holders, or whales, have always had a huge say in how the price of assets like ETH moves. When they start moving large amounts of cryptocurrency to exchanges, it’s like they’re sending a signal to the market that there’s about to be some serious selling going on. This, of course, makes the smaller traders and retail investors hit the sell button that much faster, driving prices down even further. It is also worth noting that whale movements do not always translate into immediate price increases. Of course, when a whale makes a big purchase, we can expect some positive price action. But often, these massive entities seem to act more like market makers, driving price action not just in one direction but in both up and down (obviously, with down not being a good thing for the price). It’s also important to remember that when whales are suspected of starting to act more like sellers, that doesn’t always correlate with them actually divesting themselves of their assets. They could just be using those assets in some exchange-related way that doesn’t involve them cashing out. In both situations, ETH being sent to CEXs is making the market feel uncertain. Quite a few traders are now feeling a little on edge and watching closely to see if the whales are actually going to follow through and sell a good amount of ETH or if they are just shifting their assets around in preparation for growth. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for ETH? Ethereum, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, faces the same issues of price manipulation as other virtual currencies. This spring, Ethereum Foundation CTO, Afri Schoedon, said in a tweet that “whales”—large holders of Ethereum—”might manipulate the price, as they did with #bitcoin over the last months. Why should we trust any cryptocurrency that is not behaving like gold, not with its price, not with its market cap?” Currently, the substantial decrease in the price of ETH serves to remind investors of the wild fluctuations that typify the cryptocurrency market. It is uncertain whether the movements of these large-scale investors will push prices down even more or if we are on the verge of a price stabilization, but it is apparent that these big trades are making the market react, with the sentiment surrounding Ethereum taking the brunt of it. To sum up, the recent deposit of 47,756 ETH to centralized exchanges has sparked concerns of a potential sell-off that could weigh on ETH’s price. The crypto market continues to react to these large transactions, and traders and investors are closely watching to see how the whales will move next and what impact this will have on Ethereum’s price action in the days to come. Whether this marks the beginning of a larger market correction or a temporary dip remains to be seen, but it is clear that these whale movements are influencing market sentiment.

Santiment says that since March 3rd, Bitcoin whales and sharks have collectively added 4,486 BTC to their holdings amid panic by retail crypto traders over the past couple of days. Before the latest accumulation by the wallets holding more than 10 BTC, the whales and sharks had briefly trimmed their portfolios, according to Santiment. “Bitcoin’s whale and shark wallets have gone through several key turning points these past six months, as the chart below reveals. In short, their mild dumping from mid-February to early March contributed to crypto’s latest dump.” Source: Santiment/X On the impact the accumulation by whales and sharks is likely to have going forward, the analytics platform says, “Prices have not reacted to their buying just yet, but don’t be surprised if the second half of March turns out much better than the bloodbath we’ve seen since Bitcoin’s all-time high seven weeks ago… assuming these large key stakeholders continue their coin collecting.” According to Santiment, “crypto markets move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations.” Based on the views being expressed on social media platforms, the crypto analytics platform says Bitcoin is likely to rally when the bearish sentiment reaches a fever pitch. “Social media is showing a massive level of fear, with Bitcoin being associated with sub-$70,000 levels at the highest rate since the February 27th crash. The true capitulation point (and optimal buy spot) will be when low prices ($50,000 – $69,000) are being predicted across social media with very little mention of high prices ($100,000 – $119,000).” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading at $81,678 at time of writing.

The purchases will be made in a non-disruptive way in the open market, and will use a structured trading approach, with specific parameters, to ensure the way the trading is done doesn’t influence the price of the tokens in question. The declaration signals an important development in Offchain Labs’ ongoing work to bolster the Arbitrum network, guaranteeing that the interests of Offchain Labs align closely with the future upward trajectory of the ecosystem. By picking up ARB tokens in the open market, Offchain Labs not only aims to strengthen its hand within the network but also to send a message to the extended crypto community that it is unambiguously bullish on Arbitrum’s token and its long-term prospects. A Gradual Approach to Acquiring ARB Offchain Labs lays out a strategic purchase plan that is not an immediate, one-time purchase but will be executed over time based on predetermined parameters. This approach—instead of a market-reaction purchase—affords careful consideration of overall market conditions and captures the long-term vision for Arbitrum. The exact details of the specific parameters governing the purchase plan remain undisclosed, but the strategy is designed to minimize market disruption while allowing Offchain Labs to acquire ARB tokens in a way that aligns with its long-term objectives. Using open-market purchases, and possibly other trading methods, the team intends to up its holdings of ARB tokens in a manner that avoids causing any significant price fluctuations that might destabilize the market. This methodical approach enables Offchain Labs to amass ARB tokens and employ them as a part of its broader strategy to improve the value and scalability of the Arbitrum network. As the platform continues to evolve and expand, this strategic purchase plan aims to maintain alignment and sync with the ongoing development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Importance of ARB for the Arbitrum Ecosystem At the core of the Arbitrum network’s functionality are the ARB tokens. They serve as the governance tokens for the Arbitrum ecosystem, enabling holders to participate in the processes of governance and decision making that affect the future of Arbitrum. Offchain Labs acquiring the ARB tokens is a key demonstration of their commitment to decentralization. They are enabling themselves to participate in the governance of Arbitrum, in much the same way that the holders of ARB tokens will be doing after the token is launched. As the DeFi and blockchain industries keep expanding, the need for scaling solutions such as Arbitrum becomes ever more pressing. Arbitrum has earned widespread acclaim for enabling high-speed, low-cost transactions while ensuring that the Ethereum network remains as secure and decentralized as ever. This scalability has made Arbitrum a popular solution for dApps and other Ethereum-based projects that require far more efficient transaction processing. Offchain Labs taking the initiative to boost its ARB coffers, the firm is clearly signaling a vote of confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem and its potential to be a major player in the blockchain space. This move also reflects a growing trend in the crypto world, where projects are increasingly participating in and backing their own ecosystems by amassing their native tokens. A Long-Term Commitment to the Ecosystem Offchain Labs’ decision to invest in ARB tokens through a strategic acquisition plan underscores its commitment to the Arbitrum ecosystem and its future triumph. As the R&D team behind Arbitrum, Offchain Labs has been the primary driver behind the development and implementation of the Layer-2 scaling solution, and this acquisition plan is the latest example of its long-term vision for the network. When Offchain Labs buys ARB tokens, it is boosting its position—and the presumed influence that comes with it—in the network’s governance. The company is supplying not just monetary but also considerable political capital to the ecosystem. Whether that translates to more stability and better coordination among the network’s key actors remains to be seen. But if it does, then we can expect that buying trend—alongside what developers and other key players do with governance tokens; i.e., how they vote for or against various proposals—to lead to a more stable Arbitrum ecosystem. We're reinforcing our commitment to the ecosystem and strengthening our alignment by adding $ARB to our treasury through a strategic purchase plan. It's never been more clear that the ecosystem is growing through technical advancements and strategic DAO initiatives. Under the… — Offchain Labs (@OffchainLabs) March 10, 2025 In a market that is frequently depicted by uncertainty and volatility, Offchain Labs’ strategy is not only designed to solidify its own standing but also seemingly contributes to the broader growth and stability of the Arbitrum network. This step could also instill confidence in other investors and stakeholders, thereby further elevating the presence and stature of the Arbitrum platform in the competitive arena of blockchain technology. Looking Ahead: The Future of Arbitrum The strategic acquisition program being implemented by Offchain Labs can, and almost certainly will, have a big impact on the smart contract development side of things, and also on the Arbitrum community writ large. By hoarding ARB tokens, and thereby taking a sizable position in what is increasingly looking like a solid crypto network, Offchain Labs is really doing three things: 1. Solidifying the value and the potential of the Arbitrum network. The rising significance of Layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum underscores the necessity for even more efficient, even more scalable, blockchain networks. Arbitrum’s purchases are a clear sign that Offchain Labs is committed to staying at the leading edge of this rapidly evolving space. To conclude, the newly initiated strategic purchase plan for ARB tokens by Offchain Labs shows its long-term commitment to the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. When it buys ARB tokens, Offchain Labs does so in a slow and steady way—this is what we mean by a “methodical” approach. Why is it good for us in the Arbitrum ecosystem if Offchain Labs acquires ARB tokens with this approach? Because coming next is a word we love to hear: “decentralization.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The number of tokens created on that day—2,023—by the prolific token creator Clanker, was not only a single-day record for Clanker but was also the highest total ever seen in Base network history for a day’s work. That same day, Clanker’s tokens realized a gargantuan trading volume measure of $45.78 million, marking the highest level of trading on the platform since the late November activity spike. On March 10, the Base network launcher Clanker created a record-high 2,023 tokens, marking the highest daily total in history.On the same day, the trading volume of tokens launched by Clanker reached $45.78 million, the highest level since late November 2023.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2025 The rising figures display the influence and momentum of the Base network in the still-emerging ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi). The numbers are seen as a clear sign of the growing popularity of the Base platform, which has made news in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world in recent months for its fresh strategy in the space of token launching. The Surge of Clanker’s Tokens March 10 was a day of activity for Clanker. The attention had already been captured, but it was the way in which Clanker captured it that got people even more intrigued. The token launches were not only being hailed as a record for Clanker, but also a record for the Base network. Is it a project that is going to hit a wall soon? Is it going to keep going up? Which project could possibly be next in line? What differentiates Clanker from other creators of tokens is the amount of engagement and interest from the market that its launches consistently generate. This attention has been recorded in the trading volumes, which hit a stunning $45.78 million on the very same day, eclipsing all previous numbers since way back in late November 2023. This level of trading volume certainly is significant, as it underscores an interest in the platform that seems to be rekindled and an appetite from the market for tokens that are being created on the Base network. In spite of continued volatility in the larger cryptocurrency market, the intense trading activity surrounding Clanker’s tokens indicates that some projects are cutting through the noise and really seem to be thriving, in fact, because of the current political and economic situation. Since these tokens were only recently launched, it’s almost like the Base network has become the Enron of the crypto space in a good way. Top Clankers: Dominating the Market Clanker dominates in terms of the market capitalization that the tokens created on its network have. At the moment, the vanguard trio of Clankers is out front, each drumming up a significant market cap that shows off the success of its token. 1. Clanker: Clanker, with a market cap of $74 million, leads the field by a wide margin. Its tokens are under serious scrutiny by the trading community and developers alike, and that is precisely why it holds a lofty valuation on the Base network. 2. $Bankr: Hot on the heels of $Bankr is $Bankr, with a market cap of $39.86 million. This token has also seen remarkable growth, thanks to its dedicated community and constant development. 3. $DRB: In third place is $DRB, with a market cap of $26.14 million. Even though it’s lagging behind Clanker and $Bankr, $DRB has nonetheless carved out a respectable niche for itself in the marketplace, providing good returns and piquing the interest of a growing number of investors. gm, just woke up. making coffee. top 3 clankers 1. #clanker – $74m mc 2. $bankr – $39.86m mc 3. $drb – $26.14m mc if you are new to clanker eco, a great place to learn more about our ecosystem is @clankfun , I check it every morning https://t.co/AWYLjhaVt8 — clanker ~ autonomous memes ~ (@_proxystudio) March 11, 2025 The combined market cap of these three top tokens is indicative of the overall health and momentum of the Base network. The tokens’ diversity—and their success—is a clear sign of a vibrant and active marketplace, wherein both established and newer projects can find growth opportunities. That these numbers even exist is a testament to the Base network working as a legitimate platform for token launching and trading. A Glimpse Into the Future of Base Network The Base network keeps growing, and that Clanker and other well-known token creators have been successful on it points to a really cool development for the platform. The easy and efficient way that Base lets you launch a token is now almost a thing of legend, and when it gets mentioned, it seems the conversation often leads to the insane token activity that happened on March 10. The Base network looks set to expand its reach and influence. Meanwhile, it is likely that even more tokens will be created and traded over the next few months. The Base community, meanwhile, is really growing in substance and profile. With sustained attention from developers and investors alike, it certainly seems like Base is well on its way to becoming a key decentralized space, especially when it comes to token kicks and capital efficiency. The charge led by Clanker bodes well for the next possible record-breaking achievement. As the crypto market changes, the quality of experience that platforms like Base can offer for token launches will be paramount to their survival—let alone success. And the message from the Base network is clear: it’s not the price of a token that matters; it’s the amount of trading that the token is doing. Combine the two, and you get the bullish picture that Base painted. To conclude, the extremely high token creation and trading volumes experienced on March 10 not only further confirm Clanker’s role as a significant player in the Base network but also showcase the palpable appetite in the market for fresh token creation platforms. As the network continues to develop, that unmistakable growth curve will only seem more pronounced, benefitting traders, developers, and investors.

41529774,https://nulltx.com/?p=146973,1741771572,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Meme Coin Investor Murad Faces Significant Losses in Crypto Portfolio,https://nulltx.com/meme-coin-investor-murad-faces-significant-losses-in-crypto-portfolio/,"Murad is widely recognized in the meme coin community, but his image took a hit last week when he shared a series of top 10 lists that showed some surprisingly out-of-touch crypto opinions. One of these lists, for example, was a ranking of the best meme coins, a category imaginably difficult to take seriously. Anyway, the top 10 meme coins had names like Doge, Shiba, and this site’s own token, Tap. At least one of these has probably gone to zero since then. So, Murad is not doing very well. But to be fair, he’s not alone. This situation reflects the what-goes-up-must-come down volatility of the current cryptocurrency market. A Closer Look at Murad’s Portfolio Murad’s portfolio is most invested in SPX, the largest holding in his collection of meme coins. Despite being one of his more significant assets in that collection, SPX has also taken a substantial hit. Currently priced at $0.28, SPX has fallen by an eye-popping 30.12% over the past two weeks. Murad holds approximately 29.964 million SPX tokens, and that alone gives his portfolio an estimated valuation of $8.48 million, although we’re not certain whether that estimation was made using Q2 or Q3 financials. Well-known Meme Coin KOL Murad has seen a significant decline in his crypto portfolio over the past two weeks.His total assets currently stand at $9.72 million, reflecting an overall account drop of 39.59%.Murad’s largest holding, SPX, has fallen to $0.28, a 30.12% decline, with… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2025 The problems with Murad’s portfolio go way beyond SPX. Besides his enormous SPX position, Murad has several other meme coins that now constitute large losses in his portfolio. Let’s take a look at the performance of his different coin holdings. -$SPX: -80% -$GIGA: -90% -$RETARDIO: -94% -$POPCAT: -93% -$MOG: -90% JUST IN: Murad's memecoin portfolio is down $40 million since the beginning of 2025 His portfolio includes • $SPX : -80% • $GIGA : -90% • $RETARDIO: -94% • $POPCAT : -93% • $MOG : -90% pic.twitter.com/hpryxcSbxB — BlockNews (@blocknewsdotcom) March 10, 2025 These losses are stark and striking, and they reveal the intrinsic risks tied to meme coins. Unlike cryptocurrencies that are backed by real-world business models, the only backing meme coins seem to have is the laughter of their creators. The market can only appreciate these tokens for what they are (near) worthless, or else the next round of price appreciation will be (near) just as superfluous as the last one. Yet here we are: Meme coins are somehow still a market sector that has the potential to pummel naïve speculators. The Risks and Realities of Meme Coin Investing By their very nature, meme coins are highly speculative and usually don’t have the fundamental backing of more solid cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Much of the value of these coins seems to be driven by community sentiment and social media trends, which can result in some extreme volatility. This is especially true for tokens like SPX, GIGA, RETARDIO, POPCAT, and MOG, which are all quite niche within the crypto space and haven’t achieved the same kind of mainstream adoption as more popular tokens. For Murad, who is known for his involvement in meme coins, the past few weeks have been a tough reminder of the risks involved in investing in such assets. Meme coins often rely on viral trends and social media influencers to drive their value, and when the hype fades or market sentiment shifts, these tokens can experience severe price corrections. The ugly losses Murad has seen in his portfolio are an indictment of the just-as-unpredictable nature of the meme coin market, where prices can swing wildly based on what’s cool and what’s not. Although meme coins have been known to generate incredible profits for some investors, they’re just as likely to produce enormous losses. Murad’s portfolio illustrates the risky nature of investing in these tokens. He took a 28% hit, and his net worth in meme coins is now around $350,000. Even prominent figures in the meme coin community aren’t immune to the wild price swings of these digital assets. What’s Next for Murad and Meme Coins? The road ahead for Murad and his holdings in meme coins is likely to be a tough one. The market is always full of surprises, yet the recent performance of his assets indicates that the investor may need to rethink his holdings. With sizable losses across various tokens, the next steps for Murad seem like they could involve a potential rebalancing of his investments, maybe moving on from high-risk meme coins and toward more dependable assets. In the larger meme coin market, Murad’s position could act as a cautionary tale. It is a narrative that investors—particularly those drawn to the prospect of investing in meme coins—would do well to consider. What happened to Murad is extreme, but the events that led to his current situation are likely a loosely bound part of the frequently bursting hype bubbles that surround meme coins. Indeed, the moment one meme coin starts to lose value, the risk that the next one will lose value too becomes very real. Invested as they might be, those in the still-nascent, speculative meme coin market would be well advised to undertake a serious review of their investment portfolios. It might be time to think about diversifying into some actual cryptocurrencies, which have a much better shot at maintaining value. Meme coins have shown us that nothing is guaranteed in this wild west of an investment space. To sum up, Murad’s present investment portfolio troubles are similarly being experienced by a number of other meme coin investors amid the current meme coin market downturn. Volatility, price corrections, and market speculation have way too often been the investment landscape’s signs of leading investors right to the promised land (of investment returns) or leading them straight to the guillotine (of investment losses).

""The Risk Is Not Over!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/glassnode-revealed-the-real-reason-for-the-fall-in-bitcoin-warned-investors-for-this-level-the-risk-is-not-over/,"While Bitcoin has been on a downward trend in recent weeks that has caused billions of dollars to be wiped out of the market, Glassnode has explained the real reason for the decline. In its latest analysis, on-chain cryptocurrency analytics platform Glassnode argued that the Bitcoin price is under constant selling pressure from short-term investors. He said that these investors bought BTC at its peak of $109,000, but started to panic sell after a small drop. Stating that the decline in BTC and altcoins was deepened by the panic sales of short-term investors, Glassnode said that if the sales continue, there may be a further decline. Glassnode also said that there is a large disconnect between the average purchase price of these investors and the current market value of Bitcoin. According to the data, the average purchase price of investors in October was $62,000, while that price has currently risen to $91,362. With Bitcoin trading at $81.9400, these investors are facing an unrealized loss of approximately 10.6%. Specifically, Glassnode analysts added that selling pressure due to market panic caused short-term investors’ SOPR indicator (on-chain data that measures whether holders are selling their assets at a profit or loss) to drop below 1. “A drop in SOPR below 1 is a sign that short-term investors are cutting their losses because they are unable to overcome their fears. If the sell-off continues, Bitcoin could fall to $70,000.” *This is not investment advice.

Đầu tuần trước, giá tăng vọt nhờ tin đồn về Quỹ Dự trữ Bitcoin của Mỹ và Hội nghị Crypto của Nhà Trắng , nhưng khi tin chính thức ra mắt, trader liền chốt lời theo kiểu “bán khi có tin tốt” (sell-the-news), khiến thị trường đảo chiều ngay lập tức. Độ biến động càng bị khuếch đại khi $3 tỷ hợp đồng quyền chọn Bitcoin và Ethereum đáo hạn vào thứ Sáu, kéo theo hàng loạt biến động giá mạnh. Độ biến động thực tế của quyền chọn Bitcoin vượt mốc 80% , cho thấy thị trường đang trong trạng thái cực kỳ nhạy cảm với các thay đổi vĩ mô. Trước thềm hội nghị, độ biến động dự kiến cũng tăng 35,7% khi trader ráo riết điều chỉnh vị thế. Dữ liệu on-chain cho thấy nhiều trader đã chịu tổn thất lớn trong tuần qua với khoản lỗ thực tế lên đến $818 triệu mỗi ngày. Hai ngày 28/2 và 4/3 thậm chí ghi nhận mức lỗ lớn nhất trong chu kỳ này. Dù đây có thể là tín hiệu ổn định dần của thị trường, nhưng những lo ngại về địa chính trị và kinh tế vĩ mô vẫn là rào cản lớn. Tỷ lệ lợi nhuận đầu ra đã chi của Bitcoin. (Nguồn: Bitcoin Magazine Metrics) Tỷ lệ Lợi Nhuận Đầu Ra Bitcoin (Spent Output Profit Ratio – SOPR) vừa rơi vào vùng thua lỗ lần đầu tiên kể từ tháng 10/2024, cho thấy sự bán tháo do áp lực tài chính. Chỉ số SOPR dành cho các nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn ghi nhận mức âm lớn thứ hai trong chu kỳ này ở mức 0.95, dấu hiệu rõ ràng rằng những người mới tham gia thị trường đang đầu hàng. Về mặt lịch sử, bất kỳ chỉ số SOPR nào trên 1.0 đều báo hiệu sự tích lũy trở lại và xu hướng tăng giá, trong khi việc duy trì dưới mức này có thể dẫn đến thêm rủi ro giảm giá. Nếu cấu trúc thị trường tăng giá vẫn còn nguyên vẹn, các nhà mua sẽ bắt đầu quay lại ở mức giá hiện tại, khiến SOPR trở thành một chỉ số quan trọng cần theo dõi trong những tuần tới. Tỷ lệ thất nghiệp và thay đổi hàng tháng của bảng lương phi nông nghiệp (Nguồn: Cục Thống kê Lao động) Các chỉ báo kinh tế vĩ mô hiện không đưa ra một hướng đi rõ ràng. Dù thị trường lao động Mỹ vẫn khỏe với 151,000 việc làm mới trong tháng 2, tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng lên 4.1% do cắt giảm việc làm chính phủ. Lương tăng mạnh , nhưng chi phí lao động cao và áp lực lạm phát có thể khiến kỳ vọng về việc Fed cắt giảm lãi suất nhiều lần trong năm nay trở nên xa vời. Năng suất lao động tăng 1.5% trong quý 4/2024, giúp doanh nghiệp bù đắp chi phí mà không cần tuyển dụng thêm, nhưng nếu việc làm đình trệ, rủi ro dài hạn sẽ gia tăng. Trong khi đó, ngành sản xuất đối mặt với nhiều biến động khi các loại thuế mới làm tăng chi phí và chậm đơn hàng, gây lo ngại về khả năng duy trì tăng trưởng giữa bối cảnh thương mại bất ổn. Việc Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump thiết lập Dự Trữ Bitcoin Chiến Lược, sở hữu hơn 187,000 BTC trị giá $13 tỷ, đánh dấu một bước ngoặt lịch sử khi chuyển từ việc đấu giá Bitcoin tịch thu sang giữ chúng như một tài sản quốc gia. Chính quyền của ông cũng đang thúc đẩy lập pháp về stablecoin trước tháng Tám và nhằm chấm dứt các chính sách hạn chế như Chiến Dịch Choke Point 2.0, củng cố vị thế của Mỹ là lãnh đạo toàn cầu về crypto. Với kế hoạch Dự Trữ Bitcoin Chiến Lược, Mỹ có thể giữ Bitcoin như một tài sản tài chính dài hạn thay vì bán ra, tiềm năng ảnh hưởng đến chính sách crypto toàn cầu. Trong khi đó, Nhóm Đặc Nhiệm Crypto của SEC dự kiến tổ chức một cuộc thảo luận bàn tròn vào ngày 21/3 để làm rõ trạng thái bảo mật của tài sản kỹ thuật số, báo hiệu sự chuyển đổi sang hướng dẫn quản lý có cấu trúc hơn. Tại Nhật Bản, Đảng Dân Chủ Tự Do đang triển khai các cải cách thuế thân thiện với crypto , giảm thuế lợi nhuận vốn xuống 20% và phân loại tiền điện tử như một loại tài sản riêng biệt.

The token is now trading at about $0.9534, down significantly from the expected peg of $1. This has got investors and market participants talking. They are now questioning the stablecoin’s stability and future viability. While the intention was for USDZ to track the value of the US dollar, recent events have caused some to wonder if the problem is with the underlying reserves. USDZ’s Reserve Composition and Stability Concerns USDZ, which has an approximate total supply of 120 million tokens, is backed mainly by cash, cash equivalents, and credit portfolios. If one were to attempt to account for all the different types of assets backing USDZ, one would arrive at a figure of about $122 million. By this reckoning, the reserves backing USDZ are theoretically sufficient to maintain the coin’s peg to the dollar. Underwriting concerns mainly stem from the fact that only about 5.27% of USDZ’s reserve assets are cash or cash equivalents, which augurs poorly for the stablecoin’s ability to maintain its peg during market stress. The RWA protocol Anzen’s stablecoin USDZ, backed by Circle Ventures, has been experiencing depegging and high volatility recently, currently trading at around $0.9534. USDZ has a total supply of approximately 120 million, primarily backed by $122 million in cash, cash… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2025 Most of the backing of USDZ comes from non-liquid assets, such as credit portfolios, which may not be as accessible or stable as one would like in times of market turbulence. This is not only a modern take on dollar backing, but it also has some folks worried about whether USDZ can really withstand significant market fluctuations—especially when liquidity is critical for maintaining the stable peg. USDZ’s recent price drop, which has gone as low as $0.9534, underscores the possible dangers connected to these reserve placements. In a moment of market freakout or when the token needs liquidity to prop it up, the cash and cash equivalent reserves seem paltry. Just how are we supposed to defend the peg in anything resembling a believable way? And guess what? We’re not alone in facing this not-so-enviable situation. Other stablecoins have run into troubles when their reserves weren’t liquid enough, weren’t diversified enough, or some combination of both. The Role of Circle Ventures and Market Perception Anzen has obtained some degree of credibility in its stablecoin endeavor, USDZ, through partnership with Circle Ventures, a major player in the stablecoin and cryptocurrency markets. Circle’s association, especially in light of its flagship product, USDC, has instilled a good deal of confidence in USDZ’s supposed stability. But what happens when even a stablecoin backed by such nineteenth-century financial figures as Franklin, Hamilton, and Twain starts to experience price fluctuations? How unstable is USDZ? For traders and investors who rely on stablecoins for consistent value in a highly volatile market, this is a particularly concerning question. Stablecoins like USDZ are often used to hedge against price declines in other cryptocurrencies, providing reassurance and refuge for investors looking to park their assets in a stable, dollar-pegged token. But if the token you’re using as a refuge starts to fluctuate in price, then what are you using as a refuge? The price of USDZ is now more stable. This isn’t true for USDZ. It fluctuates like another cryptocurrency and is even seen by some as a not-so-much-stable stablecoin. This perception has opened up — and continues to open up — debates in the crypto community about what makes a consistently reliable stablecoin. Among the most mentioned are: 1. How transparent are its reserves? 2. How liquid are they? 3. How resilient are they to large-scale shocks, like, say, the bankruptcy of a major player? After all, if we’re storing our wealth in something called a stablecoin, it should be stable, right? The Path Forward for USDZ The recent instability and depegging of USDZ highlight how much more stable we need stablecoins to be. When it comes to risks, I think USDZ has a couple of big ones that could contribute to a repeat situation like we’ve seen play out recently. First off, USDZ’s reserves could be a lot more liquid; in fact, its reserve mix is so illiquid that it may be causing the volatility we’ve seen lately. Second, we’re still learning a lot about how to manage the kind of credit risk that’s present in USDZ’s portfolios. To fully trust any stablecoin, we need to be able to see and understand that risk. In addition, Anzen must repair the peg and reestablish the price of USDZ to guarantee that it can function as a secure and dependable stablecoin. Doing so will likely require a blend of different strategies: they will need to diversify their reserve assets, enhance their liquidity management, and deal with the wider market in order to restore the faith that its stakeholders need to have in the token for it to work. The peg must be maintained, and the stablecoin’s design must ensure that it is stable in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. As USDZ grapples with these challenges, it must show that it can not just effectively manage a reserve but also, with confidence, respond to the nudges of the market to ensure that no one on the design or user side of the stablecoin is feeling jittery. In conclusion, despite having substantial support and a partnership with Circle Ventures, USDZ currently faces significant difficulties with depegging and volatility. These problems spotlight the critical part that reserve liquidity and market perception play in the success of stablecoins. For USDZ to continue to exist, let alone thrive, it will have to confront these challenges and prove that it can maintain a stable peg even in the kind of tough market conditions that pull it in the other direction.

On March 12, the leading crypto exchange announced that it will provide trading support for a number of new spot trading pairs, which include CVC/USDC ( USDC ), EURI/USDC, SYN ( SYN ) /USDC, USDC/RON, and VELODROME/USDC. Trading will start on March 13 at 08:00 UTC. Aside from the other tokens, RON is the Romnian leu fiat currency that can now be traded with Circle’s USDC. Additionally, the Binance will also enable Trading Bots services for the aforementioned trading pairs once trading support is launched. However, some users who live in certain regions may not be able to access these spot trading pairs due to local restrictions that may change overtime. Users that live in Canada , Cuba, Crimea Region, Iran , Netherlands , North Korea , Syria, United States of America and its territories, and any non-government controlled areas of Ukraine will not be able to access the new spot trading pairs. Therefore, all users would need to undergo account verification to access the new trading pairs. Shortly after the announcement, most of the tokens listed for spot trading pairs experienced gains. CVC went up more than 5% after the Binance notice was published. Civic’s native token is currently trading hands at $0.095.

SYN’s Binance boost helped it break through the downward trend as the token has been going down nearly 30% in the past week and declining more than 50% in the past month. SYN was first listed on Binance Futures in August 2024, but has yet to receive a stand-alone token listing on the exchange. Furthermore, Velodrome Finance’s token went up by 2.2% since the Binance notice came out. In the past 24 hours, VELO has gone up by 1% to $0.048. Similar to SYN, VELO also broke through its decline pattern. VELO has gone down by 21.2% in the past week and decreased by more than 34% in the past month. Lastly, EURI only saw a slight rise by 0.3% to $1.09 in the past 24 hours of trading. The Eurite token has been seeing small gains in the past few days. EURI has gone up by 2.3% in the past week and increasing by 5.7% in the past month.

With forecasts showing this digital asset will reach $10 in the market, experts rank it as among the most promising possibilities to create spectacular returns. Reaching $3.1 million in its presale phase and drawing 5,200 token holders with each token valued at just $0.02, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still generating great demand. Solana (SOL) is driven by institutional faith since it employs its expanding force to generate momentum. Currently in front of great rivalry, three main blockchain initiatives take the stage. Why is this hysteria under way? Allow me to dissect it here. Pivotal Press of Cardano Keeping a delicate position slightly above the $0.80 support level, Cardano (ADA) resembles a brave tightrope performer. Market analysts still focused on this barrier, hence the $1.20 resistance acts as a significant barrier preventing prior upticks in Cardano prices. Once Cardano passes its current resistance level, further price targets of $1.50 and $3 become feasible destinations. Reaching $10 is a daring action requiring ADA to rise 1,960% from its present level. Slower activity evidenced by the daily active addresses of the network, according on-chain statistics, reduces market enthusiasm. Such a comeback may definitely start this sharp climb. Presale Pandemonium by Mutuum Finance As time runs down, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains its explosive progress under Phase 3 of the presale operation. Token purchasers who received their tokens for $0.02 each have attracted $3.1 million investment from Mutuum Finance, thereby raising the total holding base to 5,200. While investors expect Phase 4 to debut with a token price of $0.025, Phase 3’s fast expansion is now ongoing. When the following phase starts in 2025 current customers will get 25% profit on their investment. The actual nasty thing is Tokenomics has set $0.06 as the future listing price, which will yield 200% gains for present owners. More boldly still, experts predict a post-launch peak of $4, which would provide early birds an incredible 19,900% increase. By leaning on a lending model and buy-pressure system unlike those of its competitors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives substantial value above fleeting hype. Demand is rising; the window to lock in at this price is fast closing. Solana, meantime, is not lazing about. Phase 3 Frenzy Calls Attention to Interests Starting Phase 2 early at $0.015, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has changed the script so that buyers now stand to profit 400%. at the debut at $0.06. Phase 3’s $0.02 admission is the lowest price still on offer; it’s also vanishing faster than a mirage in a desert storm. Investors are flitting driven by the possibility of an orderly ascent. The five million strong proponent base of the movement exhibits unwavering faith in its DeFi goal. This is not only conjecture; the numbers match and clear pressure to act exists. With a $39 million staking action by Galaxy Digital, a potent expression of trust in a challenging market, Solana (SOL) is shining in the light. With a 4.4% decline, trading at $136 is recovering from sell-offs connected to FTX that rocked its foundation. Staking catches downward pressure and shows a parabolic climb. Analysers see a right-angled triangle on the charts that, should buyers gather behind it, points to a breakthrough. Summit Lighting Future Possibilities The US Crypto Summit has ignited a fire beneath Cardano (ADA), Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and Solana (SOL), top gainers in this high-octane run. Cardano’s potential $10 climb shines with ambition, while Mutuum Finance’s $4 post-launch estimate screams urgency—especially with Phase 3 contraction. Solana is racing against stronger currents, but her staked lifeline enhances her case.

Bitcoin 50-Week MA Is Currently At $75,195 In a new post on X, analyst James Van Straten has shared a couple of important MAs related to Bitcoin. An “MA” is a technical analysis (TA) tool that calculates the average value of any given quantity and as its name implies, it moves in time along with the quantity and updates its value accordingly. MAs can be taken over any window of time, whether that be just 10 minutes or 10 years. The main use of this indicator is for studying long-term trends, as it helps filter out any short-term deviations in the chart. Related Reading: Solana Falls Under Realized Price: Here’s What Happened Last Time Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the 50-week and 200-day MAs of the Bitcoin price over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin price has dropped below the 200-day MA after the recent market downturn, meaning that the asset’s value now is lower than the average for the last 200 days. In TA, the 200-day MA is often looked at as a boundary line between bearish and bullish trends, with a breakdown of the level being considered a bad sign. Thus, it would appear that BTC has lost this important level with its latest plunge. Another level that may divide macro trends, however, is the 50-week MA, which the cryptocurrency still remains above. “Below 50WMA is a bear market,” notes Van Straten. At present, the level is situated around $75,195. If BTC’s current bearish trajectory continues, it’s possible that this line might be put to test. The analyst has pointed out, though, that the coin has dropped under the 200-day MA a few times before and managed to recover before breaking below the 50-week MA. It now remains to be seen whether a similar pattern would play out this time as well or not. In some other news, the downwards trajectory of the market has meant that a leverage flush has occurred over on the derivatives side of the sector, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has shared in an X post. In the chart, the analyst has attached the data for the “Open Interest,” an indicator that measures the total amount of derivatives positions related to a given asset that are currently open on all centralized exchanges.

41530009,https://nulltx.com/?p=146971,1741771943,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin’s Market Momentum Hinges on Key Price Levels: What’s Next for BTC?,https://nulltx.com/bitcoins-market-momentum-hinges-on-key-price-levels-whats-next-for-btc/,"Bitcoin’s price movement recently has underscored the importance of the short-term holder (STH) cost basis as a key momentum indicator. It has emerged as a vital threshold for the sentiment of this market. And it’s where we are right now Bitcoin, as it moves in the contracting range of the $72,000 to $92,000 levels, testing the STH cost basis on its way downward, and then finding support on it as it moves upwards toward the $92,000 level again.If it can make it through the $92,000 level (with the price above it being a confirmation), then the next key level to watch will be the all-time high of just under $65,000. If it can stay above the STH cost basis and the next level to watch is the all-time high. Price Action and the Critical $92k Threshold The current relevance of the holder cost basis in the short term has been underlined once again by recent price fluctuations in Bitcoin. Base-ingoi-ing at about $92,000, it is now the most significant and closely watched psychological and technical barrier that exists in today’s market. Sustaining prices above this point almost routinely elicits and signals further buying. Over the last few days, Bitcoin has been on quite the rollercoaster, bouncing off some important levels and trying to power through the $92k wall. Price action above $92k for a sustained period, we think, would be a very bullish sign, with investors and traders anticipating that such a move would set in place the next leg of Bitcoin’s push to higher prices. On the flip side, if Bitcoin can’t hold above $92k for any length of time, we think the next stop for it may be substantially lower prices. Supply Gaps and Risk of Downside Movement Besides the STH cost basis, the current supply structure also influences Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Recent analysis shows that there are supply gaps extending from the $90K to $69K range, with the most notable supply buildup occurring between $80K and $90K. However, despite the accumulation in these price ranges, there remains a relative lack of supply in the $70K region, which could have significant implications if Bitcoin’s price begins to drop. The scant supply around $70,000 means that if Bitcoin breaches key support levels, like $80,000, and doesn’t quickly recover, we could see a faster, more accelerated price drop. The next significant support level is in the low $60,000s. Some technical analysts see a thin supply zone between $66,000 and $68,000, which means Bitcoin could very well plummet through that to hit the next level of supply. Given the present market structure, holding support at around $80k is critical for the bull case to remain intact. If Bitcoin cannot hold this level, the downside risk becomes acute and leaves traders and investors with no choice but to closely monitor the price action over the next few days. Long-Term Accumulation and Key Support/Resistance Levels Immediate price movement is very important, but the Bitcoin long-term view is being influenced almost as much by the potent patterns of accumulation taking shape across various price levels. Over the longer-term, the short-term price action is less important than the Supply/Demand picture for Bitcoin. Thus, we present a six-month supply analysis, which indicates where the price might be headed in the near-term, as well as where it is likely to head in the long-term. Two main areas of pivotal long-term support and resistance have emerged across our six-month analysis: 1. Accumulation at the price level of $30,000. 2. Accumulation at the price level of $60,000. The first major accumulation level is pegged at around the $98,000 mark, where about 268,000 BTC has been accrued. This is a significant level as it is just 24% above the current spot price, showing that a lot of holders are banking on Bitcoin moving upwards from here. To me, this looks like a long-term resistance level—a place where, if Bitcoin returns to it, some folks are likely to emerge from hibernation and sell. Alternatively, a second accumulation cluster has formed at the $62,100 juncture. At that level, investors have acquired 228,000 BTC. This now-massive cluster let’s just call it a ‘hedge’ for argument’s sake since that’s what it really is. – It’s almost a 22% dip from here. – It’s a 21.4% ‘bufferish’ area just in case we dip further. – Significant long-term accumulation suggests they think there is serious value around here and this price range, providing a likely good support bottom for any further corrective moves. – That kind of accumulation, if it doesn’t reverse in the next few weeks, is paving the way for a Bitcoin price recovery after any kind of bump near-term. Recent price action has confirmed the importance of the STH Cost Basis (~$92k) as a key momentum indicator for #Bitcoin . Sustained breaks above typically signal bullish sentiment, while rejections end up in deeper corrections: https://t.co/MtbEOSAK4v pic.twitter.com/M0EFg40khi — glassnode (@glassnode) March 10, 2025 Navigating the Road Ahead At around $92k, the cost basis for STH is very close to the current valuation of Bitcoin. This situation has elicited a very critical sentiment among traders and investors toward the market. They will be closely watching the next few daily closes to see if price action resolves into a strong uptrend, breaking key resistance levels, or a downtrend, registering lower high formations and potentially working its way down to the low $70k range. Meanwhile, the presence of significant supply gaps between $90k and $69k, thin supply in the $70k range, and no demand above current prices creates a porous sounding board for future price movements. Yet, the persistent build-up around the $98k and $62.1k levels sheds light on what might come next in the price action. These zones are now the key support and resistance levels for Bitcoin, with the $98k region serving as a sturdy resistance and the $62.1k level acting as a must-hold support level. If and when Bitcoin gets back to either of these levels, its price action will likely give traders clues about what might happen next. To summarize, Bitcoin’s current market behavior shows just how important key price levels and accumulation zones are. The $92k STH cost basis is a particular standout as a momentum indicator. And whether Bitcoin can keep support or push through these key levels will in large part determine its near-term direction. As always, the crypto market is highly volatile, and it’s up to market participants to be on watch to either take profits or stop losses at the appropriate times.

Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Demand for Bitcoin remains weak Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) outflows have played a big role in the BTC price drop since late February, surpassing $1.5 billion over the last two weeks. Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today? Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s apparent demand remains low, implying a decline in risk appetite from potential investors, according to data from market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, What to know: Apparent demand is the difference between production and changes in inventory. Production refers to BTC mining issuance, while inventory refers to inactive supply for over a year. Apparent demand weakens if production exceeds inventory reduction. After a period of acceleration between November 2024 and December 2024, fueled by President Donald Trump’s victory , Bitcoin apparent demand dropped from 279,000 BTC on Dec. 4 to 10,000 on Feb. 26. On Feb. 27, the metric turned negative for the first time since September 2024. It currently stands at -93,700 BTC at the time of writing. If the trend continues, the price could dip lower, just as it happened in July 2024.

Source: CryptoQuant However, this metric does not always guarantee more downside in the future. For example, it was also negative in late May 2024 and late October 2024 before the price rallied 7% and 73%, respectively. Bitcoin valuation metrics hint at deeper correction Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView show Bitcoin price trading 7% above its four-month low of $76,600 reached on March 12. Despite this rebound, several valuation metrics are still leaning bearish, suggesting a deeper correction is possible, according to CryptoQuant. The Bitcoin bull-bear market cycle Indicator is at its “most bearish level"" of this cycle. The bull/bear market cycle indicator is a momentum metric that measures the difference between the P&L Index and its 365-day moving average. Values above 0 show that BTC is in a bull market, while values below 0 indicate a bear market. The current value of -0.067 is at the lowest level since May 2023, when Bitcoin’s price embarked on a sustained recovery. Bitcoin: Bull-bear market cycle indicator. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, the MVRV ratio Z-score has crossed below its 365-day moving average, indicating that the upward price trend has lost momentum. The MVRV ratio Z-score is a key metric used to assess whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. “Historically, valuation metrics at these levels have signaled either a sharp correction or the start of a bear market.” Bitcoin price bear flag hints at $68,400 From a technical perspective, BTC price is trading within a bearish continuation pattern that indicates a potential correction ahead. Key points: BTC is trading within a bear flag pattern, indicating the possibility of more downside if key support levels don’t hold. The bear flag developed after Bitcoin dropped from $92,000 to a local low of $76,600 between March 6 and 11. The consolidation within the bear flag has BTC trading in an ascending parallel channel, with today’s drop testing critical support levels, including the lower boundary of the flag at $82,000. BTC/USD four-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView A breakdown of this level could trigger another price crash. The bear flag’s downside target, derived from the height of the previous drop, is approximately $68,400, representing a 17% drop from the current price. CryptoQuant analysts, meanwhile, say that if the current support zone between $75,000 and $78,000 doesn’t hold, Bitcoin could go even lower to $63,000.

Monero (XMR): A Privacy Focus Monero has long been a top pick among crypto enthusiasts who like privacy. In contrast to numerous alternative cryptocurrencies that utilize public blockchains, Monero employs a technology that facilitates transactions that are entirely anonymous. This distinctive characteristic renders it a preferred choice for individuals who prioritize financial privacy. In a recent development, Monero has upgraded its network, introducing enhancements that not only expedite transaction processing but also fortify its privacy features. This upgrade serves to solidify Monero's position as the leading privacy coin in the crypto world. This heightened interest can be attributed to an increasing number of individuals and businesses seeking methods to safeguard their financial transactions from governmental and corporate surveillance. Monero's emphasis on privacy and anonymity positions it as a leading choice for individuals and businesses seeking to safeguard their financial activities. Given the growing emphasis on digital privacy, Monero's sustained development ensures its continued competitiveness as a top contender among the best crypto assets to purchase on March 12th. Investor firms have also provided their projections for the price of Monero in the coming years. Some investors say that in 2025 XMR will stand at approximately $178.21, which is relatively conservative in comparison to other projections. Conversely, you can also find experts predicting a higher valuation of $476.53 for 2025 and even more optimistic projections for 2030, forecasting Monero's value to reach $1,372.39. Lastly, you can also encounter projects with a more optimistic price prediction for the coin going up to $307.32 in 2025. As for the long-term prediction, Monero could possibly reach $1,952 by 2030. 3. AAVE (AAVE): The DeFi King AAVE is a prominent figure in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). AAVE has garnered significant attention due to its pioneering lending and borrowing protocols, which offer an alternative to traditional financial services. AAVE facilitates decentralized lending, enabling users to borrow and lend without the need for intermediaries, while earning interest on their holdings. AAVE's ongoing commitment to innovation, evidenced by the introduction of new features designed to enhance the user experience, has solidified its position as a leading entity in the DeFi landscape. Recently, AAVE introduced a unique feature that allows users to earn rewards for staking AAVE tokens in liquidity pools. These developments have significantly increased the token's appeal and have positioned it as a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. AAVE's preeminence in the DeFi sector, coupled with its ongoing innovation, renders it a subject of considerable interest. As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector experiences growth, AAVE's capacity to provide secure, transparent, and profitable financial services solidifies its position as a highly regarded cryptocurrency, particularly for acquisition on March 12th. 4. Immutable X (IMX): The Future of NFTs Immutable X has brought about a paradigm shift in the domain of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by offering a gas-free, scalable platform. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Immutable X offers a layer-2 solution that facilitates expeditious and secure trading of NFTs, eliminating the substantial transaction fees typically associated with blockchain networks. Immutable X has forged strategic partnerships with prominent gaming platforms, with the objective of integrating NFTs into their respective ecosystems. These strategic collaborations have diversified the applications of NFTs, while Immutable X's seamless integration has solidified its position as a prominent choice among developers and creators. As the NFT market continues to expand, Immutable X is strategically positioned to dominate the sector. The ability to trade NFTs without incurring exorbitant gas fees is a significant development that has the potential to transform the landscape of the NFT industry. Immutable X's scalability and absence of gas fees render it a compelling option for individuals and entities engaged in the NFT domain, thereby consolidating its position among the most advantageous cryptocurrencies to acquire on March 12th. 5. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Narrative of Resurgence Terra, once a project with considerable promise, has encountered significant turbulence. Nevertheless, Terra Classic (LUNC) has emerged as a promising candidate for a comeback. The community-driven revitalization of Terra Classic has generated fresh interest in the token, with many speculating that it possesses the potential to regain its previous prominence. The Terra Classic community has been working diligently to burn tokens and reduce supply, a strategy that may result in price appreciation over time. The Terra ecosystem is undergoing a gradual reconstruction, with the launch of new dApps and projects on the network. The resurgence of Terra Classic serves as a testament to the transformative power of community engagement and innovative thinking. The ongoing efforts to stabilize the network suggest the potential for significant returns in the near future. Those looking for the established crypto project with a revitalized vision are recommended to stick with Terra Classic as one of the best cryptos to buy on 12th March.

Pullback to $74K More Likely Some traders are waiting for a drop to $74,000 before expecting a rebound. Analysts note that a similar decline in the past attracted buyers for a bounce-back. Also, the likelihood of a pullback to the $70-$74K range is now higher than before, due to the growing influence of traditional financial companies, which have linked the crypto market more closely with stock market trends. The analyst also pointed out that the rebound in early March has reduced the oversold conditions, making the pullback even more probable. Senator Lummis Reintroduces BITCOIN Act BTC gained momentum after Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, which proposed that the U.S. government purchase 1 million BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. Lummis initially introduced the bill last year. She noted that Bitcoin is not simply a technological opportunity, but a national imperative for America’s continued financial leadership in the 21st century. Notably, between 2025 and 2029, the first $6 billion in remittances from reserve banks would be used to build the reserve, with the Fed’s gold certificates backing it. Some have speculated that major tokens could be included in the reserve in the future. Besides, altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA surged more than expected after pro-crypto Senator Lummis reintroduced her Bitcoin reserve bill. Macro Movements Weigh On Bitcoin Bitcoin’s recent price movements reflect a market influenced by regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and broader economic conditions. The announcement of the Crypto Strategic Reserve has boosted optimism, but global economic uncertainties continue to affect investor sentiment. Bitcoin is currently trading at $82,299, up over 1% in the past day. Despite this recovery, Bitcoin remains 24% below its all-time high.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-12 09:36:15

The four-year period was chosen to align with bitcoin’s (BTC) halving cycle while also capturing the typical bull/bear market cycle, which tends to follow a similar timeframe. In March 2021, four years prior, bitcoin was trading around $60,000, near the peak of the previous market cycle. The decline in CAGR is expected as bitcoin's volatility and returns diminish over time as the asset matures. However, this metric is highly dependent on the reference points. In 2021, Bitcoin was experiencing a blow-off top early in the cycle, whereas in March 2025, $80,000 could be marking a cycle bottom. The ether (ETH)-to-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio has also entered negative CAGR territory at 6%, reflecting the underperformance of ethereum's native token compared to bitcoin. This decline is primarily due to ether price remaining essentially flat since February 2021, which is now below $2,000. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio stands at 0.024, marking its lowest level since late 2020.

However, fast forward to 2025, the narrative seems to have shifted completely, with crypto and blockchain technologies not only having entered mainstream parlance but actively redesigning the global financial landscape — with some of the world's largest financial institutions leading the charge in this regard. For instance, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recently saw its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) offering become the fastest-growing ETF in history . The company’s Bitcoin holdings surged from a modest 2,621 BTC in January 2024 to a staggering 573,136 BTC by March 2025. And, when a company with over $11 trillion in assets under management (AUM) makes such a decisive foray into seemingly uncharted grounds, the market takes notice. That said, this institutional wave hasn’t been limited to just BlackRock. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) too also attracted billions in investments to date, while Michael Saylor led MicroStrategy has concurrently continued on its path of Bitcoin accumulation strategy, amassing over 152,000 BTC last year (thus bringing its total holdings to 499,096 BTC as of Feb. 24, 2025). If that wasn’t enough, a host of traditional banking giants — who were once vocal critics of digital assets — including JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have also expanded their digital asset services by offering cryptocurrency custody solutions to institutional clients. The result? Over $120 billion in institutional inflows into these products in 2024 alone, driving Bitcoin to new all-time highs of around $108,000. Trading giants are embracing the crypto revolution The shifting tides of institutional interest have created a tsunami of activity for cryptocurrency exchanges as well. To this point, during Q4 2024, the world’s top crypto exchanges achieved a record-breaking spot trading volume of $6.45 trillion — a staggering 111.7% increase from the previous quarter. Not only that, even the average Bitcoin deposit size across major exchanges jumped from 0.36 BTC in 2023 to 1.65 BTC in 2024, thus offering even more concrete evidence of larger players entering the space. This surge in institutional participation hasn’t happen in a regulatory vacuum, with clearer regulatory frameworks having been a key catalyst for the same. For example, the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, along with progressive regulatory approaches in financial hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore, have created environments where institutional investors can engage with digital assets with greater confidence. Amidst these tides of positive developments, a growing number of exchanges (with unique operational models) have sought to bridge the gap between the traditional finance realm and decentralized technologies. GRVT (pronounced ""gravity""), for example, has stood at the forefront of this transition, offering clients the world's first fully licensed decentralized exchange (DEX). Unlike conventional platforms, GRVT has pioneered a hybrid approach that combines the security and transparency of decentralized systems with the speed and efficiency typically associated with centralized exchanges (CEXs). To elaborate, the platform's hybrid model enables off-chain order matching with on-chain settlements at an impressive 600,000 transactions per second, all while allowing users to maintain self-custody of their assets through smart contracts (using zkSync tech). This architecture eliminates one of the core vulnerabilities that have plagued failed exchanges up until now, i.e. user funds being misappropriated or mismanaged. With GRVT, trades are settled directly between wallets, removing the exchange as a potential point of failure. The platform further enhances security through multi-layered protections, combining traditional Web2 controls like two-factor authentication with Web3 mechanisms such as wallet private keys and smart contracts. All of this is made to occur within a fully compliant framework, which in turn operates in line with rigorous KYC and AML screening processes. Lastly, it bears mentioning that GRVT's future roadmap envisions the platform becoming a comprehensive financial marketplace where traditional assets like stocks, securities, ETFs, and real-world assets can be traded alongside cryptocurrencies. Moreover, in the coming months, GRVT plans to expand its capabilities with advanced trading tools, portfolio management features, cross-chain functionality, and eventually a real-world asset (RWA) marketplace. Harmony, not replacement will define the future From the outside looking in, the future of finance doesn't seem to be about crypto tech replacing traditional systems but rather a harmonious integration that leverages the strengths of both worlds. In this context, platforms like GRVT — which bring together the best aspects of centralized and decentralized finance — are destined to play a pivotal role in the market. Interesting times ahead!

SEC lawsuit before Ripple’s April 16, 2025, filing deadline . While no formal requirement dictates this timeline, Rispoli’s statement has fueled speculation that the case may soon reach a turning point. His remarks indicate that the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple may be approaching its final stages. Although there is no formal reason requiring it, it is reasonable to speculate that the SEC v. Ripple case is resolved–or at least something significant happens–before Ripple's filing deadline of April 16, 2025. Let's keep an eye on it…and hope. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) March 11, 2025 Growing Signs of a Case Dismissal The SEC’s recent actions in other cryptocurrency lawsuits and investigations suggest that its appeal against Ripple will be dismissed soon. The regulator has dismissed multiple lawsuits and investigations without any enforcement actions, confirming the new administration’s pro-crypto stance. Additionally, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci recently implied that the SEC might have already dropped its case against Ripple. During a podcast episode, Scaramucci included Ripple among companies that had seen cases against them withdrawn. While Rispoli, Scaramucci, and many others believe both parties have settled behind the scenes, there has been no official confirmation from the SEC regarding the status of the lawsuit and the case remains in the appeals process. Ex-SEC Official Observes Signs of Imminent Appeal Withdrawal John Reed Stark, former SEC enforcement chief, has observed developments suggesting that the SEC may reconsider its appeal against Ripple . Stark noted that the SEC has been scaling back efforts to classify digital assets as securities, exemplified by its decision to drop appeals concerning certain crypto firms. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, internal restructuring within the SEC, including the rebranding of its crypto enforcement unit to the “cyber unit,” indicates a potential shift in enforcement priorities. Possible Resolution Timelines Attorney Jeremy Hogan, another prominent figure in the XRP community, has offered his perspective on the potential resolution timeline of the Ripple-SEC case. Hogan suggests an earlier resolution is possible, estimating that the case might conclude by May or the first half of April 2025. His April prediction correlates with Rispoli’s April 16 deadline. Ripple must file its opening brief in its cross-appeal against the SEC by that date, and the SEC may be dragging its feet on a settlement because the date is still far. While Rispoli and many others hope for a dismissal, Jeremy Hogan recently explained why the Ripple lawsuit is too complicated for this outcome , because of the $125 million ruling currently waiting to be resolved. As the case moves toward a potential resolution, market participants will closely monitor the market to see how the digital asset reacts.

41530673,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/bitcoin-as-a-hedge-against-inflation-a-new-era-in-financial-stability,1741772957,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41530673.jpeg,Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation: A New Era in Financial Stability,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/bitcoin-as-a-hedge-against-inflation-a-new-era-in-financial-stability,"Bitcoin is often said to be a kind of “digital gold” due to its scarcity, with its supply capped to a maximum of 21 million coins that will ever be produced. Advocates of Bitcoin argue that this limit makes Bitcoin a great anti-inflationary store of value, and now governments are increasingly taking the same view. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a “strategic reserve” of Bitcoin, in line with his plans to ensure the country becomes a leading innovator in the crypto industry. Crypto supporters have hailed the President’s plan as a genius, while skeptics have argued that doing so will unnecessarily expose U.S. taxpayers to crypto markets' notorious volatility. But what is Trump hoping to achieve with a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and will it pay off? What is Trump’s Plan? Initially, at least, creating the strategic reserve won’t cost the U.S. government much money, as Trump’s order states that the almost 200,000 seized Bitcoins currently in the possession of federal agencies will be used to form it. That’s according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks, who explained that the government doesn’t intend to sell any of the BTC deposited into the reserve. Instead, it will be retained as a “store of value”, he added. “The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold,'"" Sacks said in a post on X, referring to the Kentucky-based fortress where the U.S. keeps most of its physical gold reserves. Trump’s order calls for federal agencies to conduct a full audit of their Bitcoin holdings, which is something that Sacks says has never been done before. According to him, the federal government has sold around 195,000 Bitcoins that were seized as a result of criminal activity over the last decade for around $366 million. Had the government not sold those assets, they would now be worth around $17 billion, he added. In addition, Trump’s order also enables the U.S. Commerce and Treasury departments to create “budget-neutral strategies” for the acquisition of even more Bitcoin. Interestingly, the proposed reserve won’t just hold Bitcoin, but also other cryptocurrencies such as Ether, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. Trump, who previously railed against crypto during his first presidential term, has pivoted to become the most crypto-friendly President in history. He first pledged to create a Bitcoin reserve last year during an election trial appearance at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. What is a strategic reserve? Strategic reserves are created by governments around the world to stockpile what they believe are vital resources, primarily to create a safety net should problems ever arise. For instance, the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant to ensure the country has access to a regular supply of oil during times of crisis or war. It also has stockpiles of foods like grain to protect against food shortages, as well as vaccines and also gold. In the U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, the U.S. government holds approximately 8,133 metric tons of gold In more recent times, the U.S. and other governments have sought to create reserves of critical minerals required for technologies and energy resources. As for Bitcoin reserves, the first country to establish one was El Salvador in 2021, when it also made BTC a legal tender. Alongside the creation of the reserve, El Salvador has sought to position itself as a welcoming place for crypto-focused businesses to set themselves up, with favorable regulations being developed. Despite criticism from bodies like the International Monetary Fund, El Salvador’s decision has clearly been paid off, with Finbold reporting in Nov. 2024 that its reserve had accumulated an unrealized $200 million profit due to Bitcoin’s price increases over the last year. El Salvador's move is further justified by reports that Brazil, Japan, Russia and Switzerland are also considering creating their own Bitcoin strategic reserves. Beyond these governments, a number of publicly-traded companies have also amassed substantial BTC holdings, chief among them MicroStrategy, which held more than 499,999 BTC worth around $45 billion as of Mar 1, 2025. What Benefits Will It Bring? The most important question regards what benefits such a reserve will bring to the U.S. government and its citizens. Proponents of the strategy argued that a crypto-based reserve would help the federal government to improve its financial stability by diversifying its assets beyond traditional stores of value such as gold, bonds, and foreign currencies. There is, of course, significant potential for price appreciation over the long term, given that the value of Bitcoin has always been on an upward trajectory ever since it first appeared in 2009. By creating a national stockpile, the U.S. government would also be helping to bring further legitimacy to crypto assets, encouraging more financial institutions to diversify into them. At present, many institutional investors continue to be wary of digital assets. In turn, greater legitimization could promote more investment in the U.S. crypto sector, leading to the creation of more jobs. Could DeFi be an option? Perhaps the biggest benefit of holding Bitcoin is its potential to be invested through so-called decentralized finance protocols, which allow digital asset holders to generate significant returns on their crypto holdings. Bitcoin-based DeFi is a relatively new development, as it was not compatible with the earliest DeFi protocols due to its lack of programmability, but recent updates to its codebase have changed that. Through protocols like Babylon , it’s possible to “stake” Bitcoin, which involves locking the asset into a smart contract to secure other blockchain networks. By doing so, investors can earn substantial rewards, especially if they “lock” their BTC for longer periods. Bitcoin can even be “restaked” through newer protocols such as SatLayer , where the restaked BTC is used to secure Bitcoin Validated Services, or decentralized applications that are backed by the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. By restaking Bitcoin through SatLayer, investors can earn regular rewards paid out in BTC. BVSs are intriguing for dApp developers as they provide them with strong foundational security for their applications at launch, which is not the case when they have to build their secure network. The concept has proven to be quite popular, with SatLayer accumulating more than $285.9 million in total value locked. There are many other ways to invest in Bitcoin too, with protocols like Zeus making it simple to bridge BTC to the Solana blockchain and use it in that network’s growing DeFi ecosystem. It remains to be seen if the U.S. government will go down the DeFi route with its Bitcoin strategic reserve, but for many crypto investors, it makes sense to do so, as it allows them to generate a passive income rather than just sitting on those assets. Ultimately, the U.S. government’s strategy for using its Bitcoin strategic reserve will likely be guided by market conditions and crypto’s evolving role in the broader financial economy. The more mainstream crypto becomes, the more options it will have on how to put those funds to work. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Complexity. Chain fragmentation, wallet nightmares, liquidity silos—these are roadblocks standing between users and seamless blockchain experiences. But Okto is here to change that. Meet the Okto Testnet—a high-performance pessimistic proof-based Layer 2 rollup, engineered for chain abstraction, now live with Zeeve’s fully managed RaaS infrastructure. Built on Polygon CDK, this testnet is a full-stack solution rewiring how chains interact, how liquidity moves, and how users experience Web3. “ The launch of Okto Testnet marks a pivotal leap toward realizing our vision of a truly abstracted Web3, where users interact seamlessly without wrestling with chain complexity or fragmented liquidity. This milestone, powered by Polygon CDK and Zeeve’s robust RaaS infrastructure, validates our technical architecture’s capacity to unify decentralized experiences at scale. Zeeve has been instrumental in this journey—their fully managed infrastructure has helped Okto to securely support 12M+ wallets, 50+ protocols, and over $1B in monthly recurring revenue. As we move toward mainnet, this partnership ensures Okto’s rollup remains the unstoppable backbone for frictionless blockchain adoption. ”, said Neeraj Khandelwal, Co-founder of Okto and CoinDCX. Why Polygon CDK at the Centre of Okto’s Chain Abstraction Vision? When Okto set out to build a truly seamless blockchain experience, it needed a foundation that could scale without sacrificing security, cost-efficiency, or customization. Polygon CDK gave them just that. Ethereum -grade security is non-negotiable. But users shouldn’t have to choose between safety and usability. With Polygon CDK’s pessimistic proofs, Okto benefits from Ethereum’s battle-tested security model while delivering near-instant, low-cost transactions. More than just speed, Polygon CDK gives Okto full control over its rollup architecture, allowing it to design an abstraction layer tailored specifically for a wallet-first, liquidity-optimized Web3. A big reason Okto chose Polygon CDK was flexibility. No predefined upgrade paths, no constraints on governance, or dependencies on centralized sequencers . Okto wanted freedom. Polygon CDK allowed it to customize key elements, ensuring its infrastructure scales on its own terms while still connecting seamlessly to Web3’s growing ecosystem. Okto’s ZK Rollup is the Backbone of a Frictionless, Abstracted Web3 Blockchain complexity isn’t just a minor inconvenience—it’s the biggest reason why mainstream adoption is still a dream. Okto is solving that by abstracting everything that makes web3 confusing and giving users a simple, intuitive experience. Users don’t need multiple wallets for different chains. Okto’s Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN) lets them log in, transact, and interact across Web3 without ever worrying about addresses, keys, or gas tokens. Liquidity isn’t locked into separate ecosystems—Okto’s Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL) finds the best available route for any transaction, across chains, with no manual swaps required. And when users execute transactions, they don’t fail. The Decentralized Transaction Network (DTN) ensures every action is confirmed, optimized, and completed without them needing to adjust gas fees or retry failed swaps. Okto already powers 12M+ wallets, 50+ protocols, and over $1B in monthly recurring revenue. This public testnet opens up the next step: a Web3 experience where users don’t even know they’re using a blockchain. Zeeve: The Infrastructure That Keeps Okto Unstoppable A rollup built for abstraction needs infrastructure built for resilience. A rock-solid infrastructure that ensures zero downtime, smooth execution, and deep visibility at every level. That’s where Zeeve comes in. From the ground up, Zeeve has been the silent force behind Okto’s rollup, handling everything from customized monitoring to high-availability scaling—so Okto’s developers can focus on building, and users can experience Web3 without roadblocks. Live monitoring, tailored for Okto – Custom-built monitoring tools track performance, transaction flow, and execution bottlenecks in real time. Built for 24/7 uptime – A high-availability setup, automatic failover mechanisms ensure Okto’s rollup never slows down or drops transactions. Smoothest testnet-to-mainnet scaling – Smooth transitions from testnet to full deployment, with zero friction. TraceHawk Explorer integration – Deep visibility into transactions and network activity for developers. “Web3 needs to move beyond complexity. Okto is building the abstraction layer that Web3 has been missing, and at Zeeve, we’re making sure it runs without a hitch. No downtime, no limits—just a network that works.” — Dr. Ravi Chamria , Co-founder & CEO, Zeeve The Okto testnet is live, but this is just the start. Okto Points S2 launches in March, leading up to the $OKTO token generation event (TGE) in April 2025. The infrastructure is here, the community is growing, and the next chapter of blockchain usability is being built in real-time. Okto is LIVE.

Historically, I've advised buying Bitcoin Cash directly rather than paying high premiums for BCHG. Though we're now 12 months from the start of private placements, BCHG lockup expiration is far from over. I suspect we could even see a return to NAV discount. Perhaps making matters more complicated is that Bitcoin Cash usage is down. Given the network's elevated NVT ratio, the coin's price could fall substantially if the crypto correction continues. After 16 months trading at a significant premium to Net Asset Value, the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust ( OTCQX:BCHG ) is quickly approaching NAV. As of market close on March 10th, BCHG shares command less than a 6% premium to the net asset value of the fund. This is after opening the year at a 43% premium to NAV and trading as high as a 200% premium as recently as October. I've certainly been no stranger to covering this fund. Bitcoin Cash vs BCHG: NAV Rate Compression Begins BCHG: Five More Months Until Unlocks Begin Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust: Still Playing with Fire My general view when covering BCHG over the last year has been fairly straightforward; if you like Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ), it's best to buy BCH directly rather than pay an enormous premium for the exposure through Grayscale's fund. Since my late December article, the price return for BCHG has been nearly twice as bad as that of a direct BCH position: BCHG vs BCH-USD (Seeking Alpha) In this update, we'll revisit Grayscale's BCH trust as well as Bitcoin Cash network data to see if either assets justify an upgrade from 'hold.' Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust BCHG NAV Rate (CoinGlass) Back in November 2023, BCHG shares flipped from a sizable NAV discount to a premium. As the crypto market broadly recovered from lows throughout 2024, BCHG shares quickly began trading at a large premium to NAV. At times in 2024, that premium even eclipsed 200%. These large premiums triggered an important catalyst for Grayscale - the reopening of private placements. When I covered BCHG back in September, I noted the importance of these private placements and specifically mentioned February 2025 as the timing when new private placements could be liquidated on the secondary market: This is certainly not the worst private placement pile-on from accredited investors that can currently be observed in the Grayscale single-asset altcoin funds. But given BCHG is Grayscale's 2nd largest single-asset product of this type by AUM, I suspect BCHG will be one of the first Grayscale funds to normalize when restricted shares start coming out of lock in February 2025. While we still aren't yet in 'discount' territory for the NAV rate, I wouldn't totally rule it out: CoinGlass We can see in the chart above that BCH holdings through Grayscale's Bitcoin Cash Trust have continued to increase over the last year. The holdings figures flipped from a small, stable decline while private placements were closed to a large inflow in February 2024. Per CoinGlass, the low for BCH holdings via BCHG shares was 299.88k BCH on February 18th, 2024. That number stood at 391.84k one year later. Notably, the big move higher in BCH holdings didn't even come until April and clearly continued through the rest of last year. Thus, it's entirely possible that the BCHG NAV rate could again dip back into a discount if accredited investors who took private placements last Spring decide to cut their losses. Bitcoin Cash Network Data Perhaps compounding the setup for BCHG is the fact that Bitcoin Cash hasn't seen any meaningful increase in usage even at a time when on-chain usage for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has fallen dramatically. I prefer to compare BCH to other Proof-of-Work blockchains that primarily serve as payment-focused networks. My selected peer networks are typically, Bitcoin, Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), Dash ( DASH-USD ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ). CoinMetrics Generally, Bitcoin and Litecoin are well ahead for the three additional networks in terms of raw Daily Active Addresses. Given that, the chart above shows DAAs for BCH, DOGE, and DASH only. After spending most of 2024 with a higher 30-day average DAA figure, BCH has been well below DOGE and DASH going back to November. Of course, DAAs aren't the only thing that matter in measuring utility. Another important figure is the transferred value from the network. Here, we see Bitcoin Cash ahead of Dash, but behind LTC and DOGE. CoinMetrics Since the start of the year, Bitcoin Cash has generally settled between $35-45 million in daily value transferred. Again, I've resisted showing BTC so as to not skew the chart. None of these networks typically sniff the dollar-denominated transfer value of Bitcoin on a daily basis. Transferred value is also useful because it helps us gauge valuation relative to market capitalization. CoinMetrics The chart above shows the 30-day average NVT Ratios - or network value to dollar denominated transaction value. Not only is BCH as overvalued as it has been at nearly any point in the last 5 years at a 220 NVT Ratio, but it's also showing the highest NVT ratio of the five PoW coins in the chart. Frankly, only LTC even sniffs 'cheap' and that's largely because everything else is so overvalued based on network utility. Closing Summary If you look back at my coverage of BCHG over the last year, I've warned about this NAV premium compression each time I've written about the fund. We're clearly at the point where the premium has all but vanished and the majority of private placement lockups from the last year haven't even really started yet. Given that, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that we see BCHG begin to trade at a discount again. There is an argument to be made that the fund could be converted to an ETF. Such a move would alleviate the deep NAV discount risk that we saw in the fund during 2023. But keep in mind, the only real fundamental argument for longing BCHG today is if one buys into the idea that Bitcoin Cash is an asset worth owning. I'm not saying that BCH is a bad asset or that Bitcoin Cash is a bad network. But even good assets can be purchased at a bad price. Given the lack of network usage, I don't think we can call BCH a buy at a 220 NVT ratio. I'll reiterate a 'hold' on both BCH and BCHG. But I still see far more risk here than opportunity.",BCHG|BCH-USD,EN,0,0,BCH|TRADING|DOGE|LTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-12 09:55:43

Solana Shows Potential for Rebound Amid Recent Price Decline Solana has experienced a notable price decrease, dropping 12.39% in the past week and 37.63% over the past month. Currently trading between $108.17 and $162.20, the coin sits below its 100-day Simple Moving Average of $133.34 but near the 10-day SMA of $120.69. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.21, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic Oscillator stands at 91.38, suggesting overbought conditions that might lead to short-term adjustments. If bulls manage to push the price above the nearest resistance level at $197.86, Solana could aim for the second resistance at $251.89. Achieving this level would represent an increase of more than 50% from current prices. On the downside, the nearest support is at $89.80. Holding above this support may signal strength among bulls. With anticipation building for an upcoming altcoin season, Solana’s performance in the coming weeks could be a key indicator for the broader crypto market. Conclusion Despite SOL’s appeal, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the groundbreaking memecoin, uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth, making it a compelling choice in the current bull run.

Cardano has exhibited notable price fluctuations over the past 24 hours, ranging between $0.70 and $0.74. In that time, ADA gained 1.7% in the last hour and 1.8% over the past day.However, the weekly trend shows a 21.6% decline, indicating a recent correction. Despite this, the token has posted an 8.1% gain over the past 14 days and a 5.9% increase over the past month, showing resilience in the broader trend.Chart Analysis Suggesting Potential BreakoutFollowing this recovery, analysts are weighing in on the next moves for Cardano. A chart shared by CryptoElites highlights a ""Cup and Handle"" pattern in ADA's price movement, forecasting a potential 12-fold price breakout once resistance is breached.The ""Cup"" forms as the price declines, consolidates at the bottom, and begins to recover. The ""Handle"" appears as a smaller pullback before an expected surge. A breakout from this pattern typically signals strong upward momentum.The analyst suggests that ADA's key breakout resistance lies at $3.23. If the price surpasses this level, the next target would be around $6.45, based on the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. The ultimate price projection, should bullish momentum persist, is $9.33, in line with the 1.414 Fibonacci extension. In total, the analyst expects Cardano to see a 12X price surge. Cardano chart by CryptoElites Could Cardano Reach $10?Meanwhile, another analyst pointed to further bullish patterns. Dan Gambardello presented a chart featuring a curved dotted line, suggesting a possible parabolic trend. If ADA follows this path, it could result in a significant breakout to $10. The chart also included a moving average, which often signals bullish momentum when prices rise above it. At the time of the analysis, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed values between 50 and 60, reflecting increasing buying momentum. An upward trend in RSI suggests growing strength in the market, which could push ADA toward overbought levels.On-Chain Metrics and Whale AccumulationElsewhere, crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported on March 11 that whales had accumulated 180 million ADA tokens in the previous week. This increased their total holdings to 6 billion tokens for wallets containing 1 million to 10 million ADA. Continued accumulation by large investors strengthens the case for a potential price recovery.Additionally, Cardano network activity has shown a resurgence. On-chain data reveals a 4.79% increase in new addresses over seven days. Cardano Daily Active Addresses Cardano Daily Active Addresses Active addresses have risen by 11.99%, while zero-balance addresses have grown by 12.26%.

Demand is contracting, whales are slowing accumulation, and spot Bitcoin ETFs have turned into net sellers. Currently, the BTC price stands at $82,706 – at least 32.39% below the all-time high. In the last 30 days, the Bitcoin market has experienced a drop of 15.3%. In the last seven days alone, the market has dropped by 5.8%. The question remains: Is this normal, or the start of a deeper downturn? Bitcoin Metrics Turn Bearish The CryptoQuant Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is at its most bearish level in this cycle. Importantly, the MVRV Ration z-score has declined below its 365-day moving average . What this suggests is a loss of upward momentum. Bitcoin Demand Is Weakening According to the CryptoQuant weekly report, whales have slowed their accumulation. Bitcoin ETFs in the US are now net sellers instead of buyers. Yesterday alone, at least 371M flew out of the Bitcoin Spot ETF market. At least 35.50M flew out of GBTC, around 151.3M from IBIT, nearly 107.10M from FBTC, 9.10M from BITB, 14.9M from BTCO, 600K from HODL, and around 3.4M from BRRR. Bitcoin’s apparent demand shrank by 103K last week, the fastest decline since July 2024. At the start of March, the price of BTC was at $84,352.73. On the second day, it climbed to a peak of $94,302.78. This month, the market has suffered at least two serious corrections: a 8.55% correction on March 3 and a 13.27% correction between March 6 and 10. Yesterday, the BTC market grew from $78,629 to 82,922. Currently, the price stands at $82,706 – slightly below yesterday’s closing price. As per the report, the annual accumulation rate of investors has also dropped significantly. How Deep Will This Correction Go? Right now, the price of Bitcoin is at least 32.39% below its all-time high. The BTC markert has witnessed a sharp correction. Valuation metrics suggest this correction is deeper than those seen in previous bull runs. If demand remains weak, Bitcoin could enter a prolonged bearish phase. In conclusion, Bitcoin is facing serious bearish pressure, with shrinking demand and negative signals from key metrics. While similar corrections have happened before, the depth of this downturn raises concerns about whether BTC is headed for a prolonged bear market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Why Analysts Can See 40x Gains From Here,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/remittix-rtx-has-been-building-momentum-with-its-real-world/,"The post PEPE Price Prediction: Pepe to Hit $100B Market Cap? Why Analysts Can See 40x Gains From Here appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The buzz for the “memecoin era” has continued despite the regular dips and the odd delisting. One of the tokens in the thick of it is PEPE, a project that became well-liked following its meme-based popularity. A recent 26% price decline in a week, however, has investors wary and they are making them reconsider any ambitious Pepe Price Prediction such as whispers of a $100 billion market cap. In the meantime, newer projects such as Remittix are finding niches for themselves by focusing on utility in the real world rather than hype. Here, we examine PEPE’s present troubles and why some analysts are eyeing 40x returns, while traders are seeking tokens with better fundamentals. PEPE: On the Edge of Hype and Despair What used to be representative of memecoin vigor, PEPE is now trading at $0.0000061, a far cry from its highs. The main support at $0.0000070 recently gave way and a trail of deep losses followed. As selling pressure mounted, trade volume rose 15%, showing how fast sentiment reverses when fundamentals fail to align. Market commentators are split on Pepe Price Prediction. Some see a potential 200% gain if new demand is reignited, but the token’s exposure to virality is evident. In the absence of solid institutional commitment or a functioning use case, price predictions hinge on transient social sentiment. In the meantime, some 78% of PEPE holders are underwater, holding out expectations for imminent recovery in check. Pepe Price Chart The discussion whether PEPE can reach a $100B market cap continues, fueled by memes and Twitter chatter. However, onlookers say it would take a frenzied speculative run, the sort of which was seen in the recent memecoin mania. While, on the other hand, the breaking of support levels and the continued volatility are suggesting restraint, with no compelling catalysts around the corner. In any case, memecoins can be notoriously unpredictable and 40x returns are still possible if the market goes on another hype-driven binge. Remittix: A Practical Alternative to Memecoins While PEPE waits, Remittix (RTX) has been building momentum with its real-world use case in the cross-border remittance sector. Having sold more than 518 million tokens in presale, the project managed to raise $13.8 million during a bear market. Priced at $0.0734, Remittix was capable of delivering 1000% returns to early adopters showcasing that utility and speculation can co-exist. The platform is attractive to freelancers, migrant workers and companies looking for less expensive, quicker cross-border transactions. Consider a Brazilian graphic designer billing U.S. clients on a recurring basis. Through conventional banking, they would encounter multi-day delays and excessive wire transfer fees. Through Remittix, the funds are processed through local networks and blockchain rails and typically arrive within hours for a fraction of the cost. Other than speed and lower fees, Remittix fosters transparency through an open ledger that minimizes fraudulent or hidden fees. Its pay API accepts over 40 cryptocurrencies, converting them to local fiat automatically. This use-case-driven approach differs from memecoins like PEPE, whose prices rely on short-term speculation. Analysts foresee another 200% rally for Remittix this month, citing the coin’s robust fundamentals and locked liquidity as reasons why it may outperform most purely speculative tokens. A Changing Landscape for Altcoins Amidst today’s Pepe Price Prediction hype, the memecoin hype cycle is notoriously unreliable. PEPE can easily do 40x if a bull run of investors comes in, but recent price action and increasing underwater holders put sustainability into question. In the meantime, Remittix tells a different story in a crypto space fast approaching maturity. DeFi has begun rewarding projects that are addressing real pain points of users. Rather than relying on influencer pumps, tokens like Remittix are tapping into a $190 trillion remittance market with real-world benefits. Presale investors have already seen enormous returns and continued adoption could spark another run-up. In a space where the majority of memecoins experience enormous highs followed by Mega drops that persist for months, Remittix stands out by bridging real-world payments and blockchain technology.

This move, impacting billions of dollars in trade, raises critical questions about the future of global commerce and the potential ripple effects across various sectors, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. As the world watches, the question remains: will this trade standoff devolve into a full-blown trade war, or can dialogue pave the way for resolution? EU Countermeasures: A Bold Response to US Trade Tariffs The European Commission (EC) has officially declared its intention to implement countermeasures valued at a staggering €26 billion ($28.3 billion). This forceful response is directly aimed at U.S. exports to the EU, targeting approximately $28 billion worth of goods. This action comes after the EC deemed the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, initially imposed several years ago, as unwarranted and damaging to fair trade practices. The timing is particularly significant, as the EC had previously paused the implementation of these countermeasures, initially introduced in 2018 and 2020. However, this period of forbearance has now come to an end, with the pause expiring on April 1st, signaling a decisive shift in the EU’s approach. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements: Value of Countermeasures: €26 billion ($28.3 billion). Targeted Exports: $28 billion of U.S. goods exported to the EU. Reason for Countermeasures: EU considers U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum ‘unjustified’. Previous Stance: EC had paused countermeasures introduced in 2018 and 2020. Trigger for Action: Expiration of the pause on April 1st. This assertive stance underscores the EU’s determination to defend its economic interests and challenge what it perceives as protectionist trade policies from the United States. The implications of these EU countermeasures are far-reaching, potentially impacting a wide range of industries and supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic. The Economic Impact of Trade Tariffs: Beyond Steel and Aluminum While the immediate focus is on steel and aluminum, the broader economic impact of these trade tariffs and subsequent countermeasures extends far beyond these specific industries. Trade tariffs, in general, are taxes imposed on imported goods, making them more expensive for consumers and businesses within the importing country. When countermeasures are implemented, they essentially become retaliatory tariffs, escalating the trade conflict and potentially leading to a cycle of protectionism. Consider these potential economic ramifications: Increased Costs for Businesses: Tariffs raise the cost of imported materials and components, potentially impacting manufacturing and production across various sectors. Higher Consumer Prices: Increased costs for businesses can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services, contributing to inflation. Disrupted Supply Chains: Trade disputes can disrupt established supply chains, forcing businesses to seek alternative sources, which can be costly and inefficient. Reduced Trade Volumes: Higher tariffs can deter international trade, leading to a decrease in the overall volume of goods and services exchanged between nations. Uncertainty and Market Volatility: Trade tensions create uncertainty in the market, which can negatively impact investment decisions and contribute to market volatility. This uncertainty can also spill over into markets like cryptocurrency, which are often sensitive to macroeconomic developments. For the cryptocurrency space, the economic impact of trade disputes might seem indirect, but a volatile global economy can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite. Periods of economic uncertainty can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like cryptocurrencies, perceived as hedges against traditional market instability. Conversely, economic downturns can also lead to reduced investment across the board, impacting the crypto market as well. Global Trade Dynamics: Navigating a Complex Landscape The current situation highlights the increasingly complex landscape of global trade . For decades, the world has moved towards greater trade liberalization, with organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) promoting free and fair trade among nations. However, recent years have witnessed a resurgence of protectionist sentiments and trade disputes, challenging the established norms of international commerce. Key aspects of the current global trade scenario include: Aspect Description Rising Protectionism Increased use of tariffs and other trade barriers to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Trade Disputes Escalating disagreements between major trading partners, often leading to retaliatory measures. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions expose the vulnerabilities of global supply chains. Regional Trade Blocs Growing importance of regional trade agreements as alternatives to global multilateralism. Geopolitical Influence Trade policies increasingly used as tools of geopolitical influence and strategic competition. In this intricate web of international relations, understanding the dynamics of global trade is crucial for businesses, investors, and policymakers alike. The cryptocurrency industry, operating on a global scale, is particularly sensitive to these shifts in the international trade environment. Regulatory frameworks, cross-border transactions, and market access are all influenced by the broader context of global trade relations. The Promise of Trade Dialogue: A Path to Resolution? Amidst the escalating tensions, there is a glimmer of hope for de-escalation. EC President Ursula von der Leyen has publicly expressed the EU’s openness to engage in meaningful trade dialogue with the United States. This willingness to communicate and negotiate offers a potential pathway to resolving the current dispute and preventing further escalation into a full-blown trade war. The benefits of trade dialogue are numerous: De-escalation of Tensions: Dialogue can help to calm tensions and prevent further retaliatory measures. Negotiated Solutions: Direct talks can lead to mutually acceptable compromises and solutions to trade disputes. Predictability and Stability: Successful dialogue can restore predictability and stability to trade relations, benefiting businesses and investors. Strengthened Relationships: Engaging in constructive dialogue can strengthen bilateral relationships and foster cooperation on other global issues. Avoidance of Trade War: Ultimately, dialogue is the most effective way to avoid a damaging trade war that would harm economies on both sides. Whether the U.S. will reciprocate the EU’s openness to trade dialogue remains to be seen. However, the EU’s public stance provides a crucial opportunity for both sides to step back from the brink and explore a more constructive path forward. For the global economy, and indeed for the cryptocurrency market which thrives on international interconnectedness, the prospect of dialogue is a welcome sign. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Trade Terrain For those involved in the cryptocurrency and broader financial markets, understanding and adapting to the evolving trade landscape is essential. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in international trade policy and disputes, particularly between major economic blocs like the EU and the US. Assess Portfolio Risk: Evaluate how trade tensions might impact your investment portfolio, considering potential market volatility and sector-specific impacts. Diversify Investments: Diversification across different asset classes and geographical regions can help mitigate risks associated with trade-related economic uncertainties. Monitor Regulatory Changes: Be aware of potential regulatory changes that may arise as a consequence of trade disputes, particularly concerning cross-border financial transactions. Prepare for Volatility: Trade disputes can contribute to market volatility. Be prepared for potential price fluctuations in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. By staying informed and proactive, individuals and businesses can better navigate the complexities of the current trade environment and position themselves to weather potential storms. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Global Trade The EU’s decision to implement countermeasures against U.S. tariffs marks a pivotal moment in global trade relations. While the immediate impact will be felt in specific industries, the broader implications extend to the entire global economy and even touch upon the digital asset space. The willingness of the EU to engage in trade dialogue offers a crucial opportunity to de-escalate tensions and find a path towards resolution. The coming weeks and months will be critical in determining whether dialogue prevails or if the world is headed towards a more fractured and protectionist trade order. For the cryptocurrency community, understanding these global economic shifts is paramount, as they shape the broader landscape in which digital assets operate and evolve.

In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) briefly pumped to almost $84,000 before settling at just north of $82,000. Most leading altcoins are also well in the green, with Pi Network (PI) taking center stage and witnessing a 20% price increase. BTC Enters Green Territory Again The last several days have been quite turbulent for the primary cryptocurrency. Its price reached almost $95,00 at the beginning of March after US President Donald Trump announced that his administration is working on establishing a strategic BTC reserve. On March 4, though, the valuation tanked below $83,000 after the global trade war initiated by America’s political leader escalated. The bulls reacted quickly, pushing the price to as high as $92,300 on March 6, but the peak was short-lived. The crypto market endured another collapse on March 11, with BTC sinking below $77,000 for the first time since November 2024. The last 24 hours have brought some relief to the asset’s proponents as the price briefly spiked to nearly $84,000. As of this writing, BTC is worth roughly $82,300 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko Its market capitalization has surged past $1.6 trillion, while its dominance against the alternative coins remains unchanged at around 58.9%. PI Leads the Altcoin Charge The alternative coins have followed BTC’s resurgence, and some of them have even charted more substantial price spikes than the leader. Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are among the notable gainers. However, Pi Network’s native token – PI – outshined them all. Its valuation has exploded by over 20% in the last 24 hours amid speculations that Binance might become the next crypto behemoth to list the token. Meanwhile, Tron (TRX) and MANTRA (OM) are among the very few top 100 cryptocurrencies whose prices have headed south for the day. The total market capitalization of the sector currently stands at roughly $2.765 trillion, representing a 1% rise on a 24-hour scale.

Tether is also likely to face difficulties in the U.S. due to new regulations. The company will have to modify its reserve measures if a proposed stablecoin bill prevents offshore issuers from accessing U.S. Treasury markets, a move which could further benefit U.S.-based rivals like USD Coin ( USDC ). As regulatory pressure grows, Tether made a strategic decision in January to relocate its headquarters to El Salvador after securing a Digital Asset Service Provider license.

However, declining revenues warn of a potential crash ahead. With the crypto market at a potential crossroad of a bullish comeback, Solana is witnessing a minor recovery above $120. Notably, SOL is down by 14% in the past seven days. Amid the minor recovery, there’s growing anticipation for a possible bullish comeback. However, analysts warn of a potential downfall for Solana.Solana Sell SignalOn the daily chart, Solana's price trend shows a quick bullish recovery, with a 5.98% surge on March 11. This ends a streak of five consecutive bearish candles but fails to establish a new bullish trend.With an intraday pullback of 1.14%, Solana is trading at $123.94. This short-term reversal could be a retest of the broken $130 demand-turned-supply zone.Solana's decline from its all-time high of $295 has resulted in nearly a 60% drop. This has led to a ""death cross"" event between the 50 and 200 EMA lines.Moreover, the 100 and 200 EMA lines are on the verge of crossing over bearishly, which would trigger a strong sell signal from the EMA lines. Declining Meme Coin Trading Volume is Hurting SolanaBrandon Farmer, an analyst at ZeroKnowledge Polygon, questions Solana's real economic value. According to the analyst, the previous spike in Solana's real economic value (REV) was driven by high meme coin trading activity on decentralized exchanges.The surge in meme coin trading led to a significant demand for block space, with transactions per second increasing as speculative traders executed large volumes of trades. This created a ""SOL wealth effect,"" driving up the SOL price, generating more liquidity, and increasing risk appetite.However, with the recent price drop in Solana, traders have become more risk-averse. Additionally, the decline in meme coin activity on the Solana network has sharply dropped its REV.Solana’s weekly REV has dropped 90% from its all-time high, indicating a massive decline in the network’s ability to generate sustainable transaction fees. As Farmer notes: ""Meme coin trading volume is both unsustainable and mercenary."" Analyst commentary on Solana Analyst commentary on Solana Analyst Warns SOL Price Drop Below $1Supporting the possibility of a massive crash in Solana, technical analyst Gert van Lagen has pointed out a double-top formation in the SOL price trend. On the weekly chart, van Lagen identifies a key double-top formation in Solana's price, with the meme season now over.The analyst also highlights that Solana’s failed non-vote transaction rate has risen to 75%.

Like the rise of Dogecoin in 2021, a pattern is expected to start in 2025. Beginning at a paltry $0.02 per token, investors are rushing to the third phase of this distributed financial venture in hope of creating a wave that might eclipse the profits of Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA). Though there are speculations of a fourth phase, the third phase is selling out fast. Demand is too much. With a 50x return expected by Q2 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a constant investment opportunity in DeFi unlike declining tendencies. Given that this train seems to be accelerating, you ought definitely go board it. Presenting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A loan program made by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making values go up and down a lot. People can use Ethereum and other stuff to make liquidity pools; then they get mtTokens, and the value of those goes up over time because of interest. Debtors can get back money by using collateral locking without needing to sell their stuff. Using platform earnings to buy MUTM tokens, which are then given to stakers, makes a special plan that creates demand. Phase 4 is going to make the price go up from $0.02 in Phase 3; the clients right now are getting a nice 25% profit. The goods are running fast. Tokenomics makes sure that the listing price is $0.06 when it comes out, so it will make a 200% gain. What happens after the show is first shown? A super big 9,900% jump means you could make $2 by the second quarter of 2025. While it closes, investors are really wanting to get in at this low price. Holding on is a Challenge for Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is moving steadily with slow-burn improvements and whale hoarding. The market’s ravenous need for more extravagant conduct has kept its price about $1 despite its committed following. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) starts its presale earlier than ADA, thereby avoiding this slowness. Cardano may make a quick effect as it gets ready for governance reforms with MUTM’s lending engine at readiness. Seeking a quick profit, those leaving MUTM are looking for ADA because of its quick ascent. Cardano is already refining its approach, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may have a 50x ROI in Q2 2025. Clearly, more important than anything else is time. Litecoin (LTC) Cryptocurrency Invisible As the value of crypto keeps rising, Litecoin’s “silver to crypto’s gold” reputation is fast fading. With exemption from transaction speed, it cannot match Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in terms of firepower. MUTM’s presale glitter is little compared to LTC’s flat cost. Though Litecoin’s market is slow, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is acting fast to follow a strategy revaluating its currency. Many people desire a breakthrough like the one in 2021, so they are selecting MUTM over LTC because of its great potential but dull nature. MUTM may experience a 50x rise in Q2 of 2025 while Litecoin would stay very flat. The change is starting to show daily. The Great Relevance of Mutuum Finance After releasing Phase 2 at $0.015, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to start Phase 3 at $0.06, where they hope a 400% profit. Since this is already factored into the computations, a crystal ball is not necessary. Phase 3’s $0.02 price is fast disappearing as 5,200 holders fight for a one-in- a- million opportunity to receive DOGE worth of reward. Thanks to MUTM’s financing options and constant buying demand, jumping to $2 in 2025 is no more a crazy projection. This speed is not matched by either Litecoin nor Cardano. The maximum gain window is also shrinking as Phase 4’s $0.025 becomes smaller. Investors run the danger of missing a 50x rocket if they slow down. Try to get in before Phase 3 locks down takes place.

In February, Gunzilla Games Web3 director Theodore Agranat described blockchain gaming as a “game of musical chairs” in which the same capital cycles through different projects and “no new money” comes in. The executive also said users go from project to project to extract value. After that, they leave and search for the next project. In the same month, the much-anticipated Web3 game Illuvium announced a 40% layoff , demonstrating the need for teams to go “super lean” in today’s market. Sky Mavis co-founder and CEO Trung Nguyen announced a similar move in October 2024, cutting 21% of its staff to optimize its budget for upcoming projects. Despite these events, Web3 gaming professionals said that capital still exists, and explained some of the factors contributing to the industry-wide trend. Investors no longer blindly throw their money at projects Sky Mavis co-founder Jeffrey Zirlin told Cointelegraph that Web3 gaming is not uniquely struggling but rather experiencing the same capital constraints affecting the broader crypto industry. The executive said Web3 gaming is not facing a unique challenge as the landscape is “tight across the board.” Still, Zirlin pointed out exceptions. He cited Fableborne, a mobile Web3 game that was oversubscribed by 16,000% despite the market downturn, as demonstrating that “fresh capital was indeed flowing into Ronin,” the Sky Mavis blockchain network. He added: “It’s not that investment has dried up entirely. It’s just that investors are no longer blindly throwing money at projects like they did with so-called ‘Axie killers’ that failed to deliver.” “Axie killers” was a term used to describe gaming projects that claimed to be the next big Web3 game that would surpass Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis’ flagship Web3 game. Meanwhile, The Sandbox co-founder and chief operating officer Sebastien Borget told Cointelegraph that the “game of musical chairs” description suggests a degree of randomness. Borget said he disagrees with this. The executive said that while new capital is more limited and investors are more cautious, there is now less of the unpredictability previously fueled by hype cycles. “The success of blockchain games increasingly depends on the ability to meet traditional gaming metrics. These include delivering compelling content and gameplay, fostering sustainable user acquisition, establishing a strong in-app economy and building a loyal user base,” he added. Related: Axie Infinity teases new Web3 game as NFT outlook turns positive Projects can’t just “slap NFTs” into a game and raise millions Josh Gier, chief marketing officer of the gaming tournaments platform Coliseum, told Cointelegraph that the days of simply adding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to a game and earning massive support from crypto investors are gone. “Yes, the speculative phase of blockchain gaming, where projects could raise millions just by slapping NFTs onto a game, has cooled off. But that doesn’t mean capital has disappeared,” Gier said. The executive said the capital is becoming more selective and flows toward projects with strong fundamentals and sustainable economies. “Investors are showing interest in games that integrate Web3 elements in a way that enhances the player experience rather than focusing solely on financial incentives,” Gier added. Vineet Budki, the CEO of venture firm Sigma Capital, said some core investors, like Animoca Brands, specifically focus on the blockchain gaming segment. He said that games take longer to build, unlike other niches, so gaming investments take longer to bear fruit. Still, the executive said, raising Web3 gaming capital has become more complicated. “Gone are the times when you would make a video on gameplay, have attractive tokenomics and raise capital,” Budki said in a statement sent to Cointelegraph. The executive said that teams building great games and having knowledge of the distribution process are the elements that can attract capital.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-cannot-be-clawed-back-on-xrp-ledger-like-rlusd-heres-what-it-means/,"Renowned XRP community figure WrathofKahneman recently addressed the issue of clawback functionality on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), clarifying a distinction between XRP and other issued tokens, including RLUSD. In a post on X, he stated , “Remember, XRP cannot be clawed back. Other tokens issued on the XRPL can include clawback functionality, but it’s not mandatory. For example, RLUSD requires clawback capability to comply with regulations, but never XRP.” Remember, #XRP cannot be clawed back. Other tokens issued on the #XRPL can include clawback functionality, but it's not mandatory. For example, #RLUSD requires clawback capability to comply with regulations, but never #XRP . — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) March 11, 2025 This statement underscores XRP’s decentralized nature and regulatory resilience. The discussion follows ongoing scrutiny of digital assets and compliance mechanisms in the evolving regulatory landscape. XRP and Clawback Functionality The term “clawback” refers to a feature that allows issuers to reclaim tokens under certain conditions, typically to comply with regulatory requirements. While this function is an option for assets issued on the XRPL, it does not apply to XRP itself. One prominent example is Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , which, according to WrathofKahneman, includes the clawback feature for regulatory compliance. This aligns with Ripple’s broader focus on institutional-grade solutions and adherence to legal frameworks. Community members reacted to this clarification, with X user Mentallect@X369 emphasizing the legal expertise behind Ripple’s operations. He noted , “Ripple’s legal compliance team is world-class. XRP being the ‘banker’s coin’ isn’t an insult. RLUSD is the most compliant, audited, collateral-backed & audited stablecoin on Earth. When the Great Crypto Purge happens, XRP & RLUSD will be viewed as safe haven digital assets.” This perspective highlights the perception that XRP and RLUSD could emerge as secure options amid potential regulatory crackdowns on non-compliant digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Commodity Status and Decentralization Another user, aixrp, echoed WrathofKahneman’s sentiments, adding, “correct. xrp is a commodity with no issuer, making clawbacks impossible. rlusd, as a stablecoin, needs clawback for regulatory compliance. xrp remains clawback-free, ensuring its unique utility and decentralization.” This statement reinforces the notion that XRP’s classification as a commodity distinguishes it from issued tokens like RLUSD. Without an issuer, there is no central authority with the power to reclaim XRP from holders, strengthening its decentralization. Broader Implications for XRP Holders The discussion reflects the XRP community’s awareness of the asset’s positioning in regulatory discourse. The inability to claw back XRP adds to its appeal as a digital asset independent of centralized control. Meanwhile, RLUSD’s compliance measures position it as a stablecoin that aligns with regulatory standards, making it a potential option for institutions seeking a compliant digital asset. The distinction between XRP and issued tokens on the XRPL becomes crucial as the cryptocurrency industry navigates increasing oversight. The community’s response highlights the legal safeguards built into RLUSD and the fundamental characteristics that maintain XRP’s decentralization.

While MSTY sports a high yield, the leveraged Bitcoin exposure provided by MSTR seems uniquely unsuited to a call-selling strategy. This could lead to massive opportunity costs for investors over the long term. As a result, we rate MSTY a 'Sell'. Over the last year or so, we've written a number of negative articles on the Yieldmax ETFs, including the following pieces on NVDY , CONY , and TSLY - the company's respective funds that sell calls on Nvidia ( NVDY ), Coinbase ( COIN ), and Tesla ((TSLY)): TSLY: Good In Theory, Disastrous In Practice CONY: Don't Buy This Yield Trap NVDY: Steer Clear Of This Yield Trap In each of these articles, we focused on how Yieldmax's aggressive call selling and payout structures would likely lead to long-term NAV erosion, which we've since seen in each underlying fund: TradingView While some may argue that these funds require dividend re-investment to 'sustain' the principal and build out a yield 'after that', we'd counter with the idea that these funds' single-stock risk, inflexible call selling regime and full premium payout will likely lead to long-term decay and underperformance for shareholders. In this article, we're going to be taking a look at MSTY , the Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF . While we could write an article about how we think that the fund is an inefficient, risky wrapper for a highly volatile asset, we'd rather look at it through the lens of opportunity cost. That is, how much you're actually giving up by holding it over the long run. Some may trumpet this fund's strong 'bitcoin backed' asset base and high yield, but as we see it, MSTY couldn't have picked a worse underlying asset to sell calls on, even if you have no interest in the Strategy ( MSTR ), or are only interested in the yield. Today , we'll break down MSTY's construction, dive into the fund's performance, and explain why we think the ETF is a uniquely bad fund concept, even after accounting for the incredibly high-income potential. Sound good? Let's dive in. MSTY's Construction Let's start off by taking a look at how MSTY is constructed because that's crucial to understanding why we don't like the fund. First up - what actually happens with your money under the hood when you invest into MSTY? In short , MSTY takes your cash and does a couple of different things. First, the ETF takes investor capital and buys US Treasuries, which it then uses to collateralize a longer dated synthetic option position in MSTR: IR By being long calls and short puts, the theta cancels out for the most part, and MSTY gets a similar type of 'long' price exposure as if it just bought MSTR alone. This whole song and dance exists for two reasons: better cash management, and the fact that regulations prohibit a singular stock from being the main holding of a fund. From here, MSTY - on an ongoing basis - sells short-dated calls and call spreads to generate income. These trade structures crystalize potential upside into a current cash payout , which is the whole idea of the fund. Again, this is the core idea; trade potential capital appreciation in MSTR that could occur above a certain point into real cash income. For some stocks, this seems like a sensible tradeoff. We've written countless articles on the benefits of selling puts and calls on stocks with a high level of stability and a medium / medium-low return profile. But even though the call premiums for MSTR - which is one of the most volatile stocks around - compensate for this risk to some degree, we'd argue that Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) underlying price action doesn't lend itself well to this strategy. Here's why. In short, you can think of MSTR as one giant, leveraged currency bet, built up on strong historical performance and zero-cost debt : Assume that you could go back to 2013, and that you had $100,000 in your bank account in that year. What would you do with it? If you were smart, you'd invest it into Bitcoin, which was trading around $100 bucks per coin. This gets you out of a 'losing' currency and into a 'winning' currency. Monetarily, a $100k purchase in 2013 gets you 1,000 Bitcoins. In today's day and age, that would be worth roughly $85 million. Inflation adjusted, that's still $63 million in 2013 dollars. Not bad. If you held the cash in your account and didn't touch it, then you'd be down more than 37% in terms of buying power for key U.S. goods and services, as measured by the CPI. The lesson here is simple - USDs tend to lose value over time, and with a fixed supply and increasing utility, Bitcoins - so far - have mostly gained value over time. But what if you wanted to make the most amount of money that you could? If you were placed back in 2013, then you'd actually borrow as much USD as you could get your hands on to buy Bitcoin. The borrowed funds would cost you less to pay back in the future, and those funds would also grow into a much larger balance over time, a winning pair trade combo. This is ... exactly what Saylor has done with MSTR's treasury. Thus, when viewed in aggregate, MSTR's balance sheet includes $31 billion in Bitcoin 'equity' , alongside a leverage, add on of ~$9 billion in convertible debt, which has gone straight towards buying an extra ~$9 billion in BTC exposure. Downstream, this means that MSTY is ultimately selling calls on a leveraged derivative of the following price chart, which trends very strongly in both bull and bear markets : TradingView As a result, our belief is simple - that MSTY will materially underperform MSTR over time, given that selling calls at highs provides minimal protection , and selling calls at lows provides serious capital impairment . Why sell off your potential upside in this leveraged BTC trade for pennies on the dollar? MSTY's Performance If you actually look at the fund's performance, this is exactly what has been happening. First, let's look at the performance gap just by looking at price return: TradingView Since inception, MSTY has decreased in price by roughly 13.22%, while MSTR has increased in price by more than 230%. So much for MSTY keeping some 'capital appreciation' elements within the broader total return package. Either way, once you add back in dividends, MSTY underperformed MSTR by more than 90% over the last year alone: TradingView While these charts are much closer in performance, there are some key gaps to know about. As we mentioned, MSTR should trend strongly in the future based on BTC's strong history of volatility. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, but we'd argue that BTC has retained significant volatility even as its market cap has grown considerably, which in our mind solidifies a higher-for-longer outlook for BTC vol. When trending strongly, MSTY's short option positions don't do it any favors. In September through November 2024, we saw a huge gap in performance. MSTY produced total returns of ~170%, while MSTR popped more than ~313% from trough to peak. This is material capital impairment, especially when considering that during the recent selloff, from mid-jan through today, we've seen MSTR decrease by ~39%, while MSTY has decreased by -34%. So much for the downside protection story. In our view, as one of the trendiest stocks out there, MSTY's underlying exposure is one of the worst possible assets Yieldmax could have chosen for a call-selling fund. We're aware that the income potential is massive, especially given the incredible underlying IV, but going forward, it appears as though NAV will continue to deteriorate, which could impact long-term income potential for investors. Possible Uses So - we've made the case that MSTY is a poor choice for price appreciation, total returns, and income, depending on what you're comparing it to, and what your goals are. But how could the fund be used, if you were looking to add it to a portfolio? As we see it, there's really only one role for MSTY - as a small portion position replacement option for long-term MSTR investors who are also looking to monetize an income from the asset. If you're looking for income, and you have a position in MSTR, it might make sense to sell some of it off and replace it with MSTY in order to generate yield. Since the IVs are so high, even an 80-20 split could produce dividends in the ~30% range, while retaining a good chunk of the potential upside you get with an MSTR position. Summary Other than that, though, we'd argue that MSTY is a poor option for Bitcoin believers, long-term income investors, and everyone in-between. Thus, our ' Sell ' rating.

He blames what he sees as a rigged system while pushing ahead with new tariffs that sent investors scrambling. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5% during trading before slightly recovering to close 0.8% lower, as all 11 market sectors finished the day in the red. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed by 1,700 points in just 28 hours, a decline deeper than the infamous August 5 Japanese Yen Carry Trade collapse, per data from CNBC. Trump’s trade war with Canada worsens market fears The stock market crash happened after Trump announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, one of the United States’ biggest trading partners. The decision was made public in a post on Trump’s social media platform, where he said : “Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on “Electricity” coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th. Also, Canada must immediately drop their Anti-American Farmer Tariff of 250% to 390% on various U.S. dairy products, which has long been considered outrageous. I will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.” The stock market had attempted a brief rebound early in the day on Tuesday, but the tariff announcement erased those gains, pushing the Nasdaq Composite down another 0.2% after it had already suffered a 4% loss in its worst trading session in two and a half years. Wall Street’s fear index, the VIX, shot past 29, its highest reading since August, hinting at extreme volatility ahead. The Magnificent 7 tech stocks, which used to dominate market gains, lost $3.5 trillion in market value since December 17. Once accounting for 34.4% of the S&P 500, the Big Tech companies now make up only 30.4%. Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury Secretary, confirmed the administration’s stance that short-term economic pain is acceptable to achieve long-term trade leverage. “The president understands that some volatility is inevitable,” Bessent said in a White House briefing on Tuesday. “But these policies will ultimately benefit American workers.” Trump’s willingness to sacrifice market stability for his economic goals is a huge difference from his first term, where he frequently touted Wall Street gains as a measure of his success. The US economy is still unstable, in spite of Trump’s claims Outside the stock market, other warning signs are flashing. The Atlanta Federal Reserve released a report on Monday predicting a decline in the U.S. economy for the first quarter. The government’s spending cuts via Elon’s D.O.G.E could contribute to this slowdown, but private sector confidence is also taking a hit. Meanwhile, the trade war with Canada is only getting worse. Trump, speaking off the cuff, suggested turning Canada into the “51st state” once again. But it’s not just Canada. The European Union is next in line for economic restrictions, with new trade barriers expected within the next three weeks, according to Trump. The reason? Trump has called for “reciprocity” in trade relationships with EU countries, Mexico, and especially China.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 4.275%, while the 2-year yield fell to 3.936%, hitting its lowest level since October. Investors are looking ahead to upcoming inflation data, as the next consumer price index (CPI) report is set to drop soon. February’s core inflation, which removes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.3% month-over-month and 3.2% year-over-year. Meanwhile, headline inflation is forecasted at 2.9% annually. On Thursday, the producer price index (PPI) report is also due, offering another look at price trends. Meanwhile, in a separate post, Trump said: “The price of eggs have come down, interest rates have come down, gasoline prices have come down—It’s all coming down!

Security researchers at Socket.Dev uncovered six new malicious packages with each designed to deploy the BeaverTail malware while establishing a persistent backdoor, InvisibleFerret. These tactics resemble previous Lazarus-linked cyber operations. With over 330 downloads, these malicious packages closely mimic trusted libraries, employing typosquatting to deceive developers into integrating them into projects. Source: X Lazarus’ New Tactics: How Crypto Developers Are Being Targeted Lazarus has long employed supply chain attacks, but its latest focus on crypto-specific infrastructure marks a significant escalation. The malicious packages are engineered to steal sensitive data, including credentials, system information, and, most critically, cryptocurrency wallet files. The malware specifically scans for id.json, the key storage file for Solana wallets, which allows Lazarus to gain direct access to funds. It also retrieves the exodus.wallet, a critical file used in the Exodus crypto wallet, enabling unauthorized transactions and fund extraction. In addition, the malware searches through Chrome, Brave, and Firefox profiles, extracting login credentials and session data that could facilitate further exploits. Using multi-stage payload deployment, Lazarus ensures prolonged access to compromised systems. The malware is designed to download additional payloads, including the InvisibleFerret backdoor, securing deeper infiltration into developer environments. The ability to hijack npm packages and spread malware through open-source channels amplifies the supply chain attack vector, making it significantly more dangerous for blockchain projects relying on npm libraries. Source: Socket.dev Sophisticated Execution: How the Attack Works Lazarus’ latest campaign showcases an advanced understanding of open-source ecosystems and modern software development workflows. The group’s strategy relies on several deceptive tactics. Lazarus tricks developers into unknowingly integrating these infected files into their projects by creating malicious npm packages with names resembling popular dependencies. Fake GitHub repositories further add credibility, making the packages appear legitimate. To conceal the malware’s true intent, Lazarus employs various obfuscation techniques. The malicious code closely resembles previously documented Lazarus operations, reiterating its attribution to the APT group. Once inside a system, the malware scans local directories for crypto wallet files and sensitive credentials, specifically targeting Solana and Exodus wallet storage files. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to a Lazarus-controlled server, allowing attackers to access victims’ funds directly. To maintain persistence, the script downloads and deploys InvisibleFerret, a backdoor designed to control infected systems for a long time. Multi-stage malware deployment ensures that Lazarus retains access to compromised environments even if initial infection vectors are detected and removed. Increasingly Sophisticated Threats Against the Crypto Sector Lazarus’ latest attack aligns with a growing trend of sophisticated cyber threats targeting the crypto industry. The group’s previous campaigns have included major exchange breaches, laundering stolen funds via DeFi protocols, and now, infiltrating developer environments. A February 2025 report highlighted how crypto-focused attacks have surged. The report shows a staggering 20x increase in crypto losses in February 2025 , particularly within centralized finance (CeFi). Bybit alone lost $1.46 billion to Lazarus, the largest hack in crypto history. While DeFi continues to suffer a high volume of attacks, the overwhelming concentration of financial losses in CeFi has raised questions about whether centralized exchanges invest enough in preventative cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the persistent targeting of BNB Chain and Ethereum, accounting for nearly 73% of total losses, adds to these doubts and calls for better security. For now, it is clear APT groups like Lazarus are refining their attack methodologies, shifting from direct exchange breaches to more insidious supply chain compromises. Developers are advised to stay vigilant. They remain prime targets because they hold the keys to critical blockchain infrastructure, making them an attractive entry point for cybercriminals.

The firm warns that continued selling pressure could push Bitcoin’s price down to $70,000. In a March 11 market report , Glassnode highlighted that recent sell-offs among top buyers have led to “intense loss realization and a moderate capitulation event.” This trend is evident in the short-term holder realized price—an average purchase price for those who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. Bitbo Data: Short-Term Bitcoin Holder Realized Price Was $62K in October According to Bitbo data , the short-term holder realized price was around $62,000 in October. As of now, that figure has surged to $91,362, marking a 47% increase over the past five months. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading at $81,930, leaving short-term holders with an average unrealized loss of approximately 10.6%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Glassnode noted that this metric indicates a shift in market momentum, with capital flows turning negative and demand weakening. “Investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence,” the report stated. The firm also pointed out that short-term holders are “deeply underwater” between the $71,300 and $91,900 price levels, making $70,000 a possible bottom if the selling pressure continues. “The probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is meaningful, at least in the near term,” Glassnode added. Market research firm 10x Research described the current situation as a “textbook correction” in its March 10 analysis, noting that nearly 70% of all selling came from investors who purchased Bitcoin within the last three months. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also weighed in, predicting that Bitcoin could retest $78,000, and if that level fails, the next support may be at $75,000. An ugly start to the week. Looks like $BTC will retest $78k. If it fails, $75k is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options OI struck $70-$75k, if we get into that range it will be violent. pic.twitter.com/q4cq0rthGJ — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 9, 2025 Glassnode compared the ongoing sell-off to August 2023, when Bitcoin tumbled from $68,000 to around $49,000 due to recession fears, weak U.S. employment data, and underwhelming growth among tech stocks. However, Bitcoin rebounded 7.5% on March 11 as U.S. markets stabilized after an earlier drop. The recovery came following former President Donald Trump’s remarks, in which he refused to rule out the possibility of a recession. Bitcoin Still a Risk Asset: Analyst Bitcoin has long been hailed as a potential hedge against geopolitical and fiscal instability, often compared to gold as a store of value. However, despite its decentralized nature and limited supply, Bitcoin continues to trade like a risk asset, moving in tandem with equities rather than diverging as a safe haven, according to Garrison Yang, co-founder of Web3 development studio Mirai Labs. In a recent interview with Cryptonews.com , Yang argued that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional financial markets remains strong, posing challenges to its hedge narrative. For Bitcoin to establish itself as a true hedge against macroeconomic instability, Yang said that it must break its correlation with U.S. equities and other risk assets. Currently, Bitcoin’s price movements are heavily influenced by investor sentiment in traditional markets, particularly the stock market.

Wood tells her 1.7 million followers on the social media platform X that the US economy is currently experiencing the final stages of a rolling recession, setting the country up for a bullish phase. A rolling recession is an economic term used to describe the phenomenon of different sectors of an economy experiencing contractions and recoveries at different times, preventing a full-blown recession. “In our view, the market today is discounting the last leg of a rolling recession, which will give the Trump administration and the [Jerome] Powell Fed many more degrees of freedom than investors expect, setting up the US economy for a deflationary boom in the second half of this year.” She also says during a new interview with Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano at the Bitcoin Investor Week in New York that if US Congress adopts an expected tax cut plan, it could help reduce market uncertainty and unleash economic productivity. “If we said we’re taking your tax rates down, choose a percentage, three percentage points, retroactive if they did this very soon to February 1 or March 1, let’s say, and they finish the negotiation that would take the uncertainty away. That would take that very important uncertainty away. And honestly, I think we will have a booming economy with much lower than expected inflation… After we’ve been through this rolling recession and now here’s the last leg of it, where housing, autos, capital spending, small businesses were creamed, lower income creamed, finally, high income cracking, we’re ready for a massive productivity increase… Productivity increases and a rising dollar are two of the biggest antidotes to inflation.

In a series of filings dated March 11, the regulator stated that it was extending the review period for proposed rule changes that would allow these ETFs to trade on U.S. markets. Among the impacted applications are Grayscale’s XRP ETF and Cboe BZX Exchange’s spot Solana ETF, both of which will now have to wait until at least May for a decision. The move follows a familiar pattern, as the SEC has repeatedly delayed ETF approvals, particularly those involving cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite the postponement, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reassured the market that the delays are procedural rather than indicative of outright rejection. “The SEC just punted on a bunch of altcoin ETF filings. This is expected—standard procedure,” he noted in a post on X. Industry Awaits New SEC Leadership Trump’s decision to nominate former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins—widely regarded as pro-crypto—has been seen as a potential turning point for digital asset regulation. However, without a confirmation hearing scheduled, the SEC continues to operate under interim leadership. Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that in addition to delaying altcoin ETFs, the SEC has also pushed back decisions on Ether staking ETFs and in-kind redemption models. These delays suggest that the agency is taking a cautious approach to crypto-related financial products, even as industry sentiment shifts in favor of regulatory clarity. This isn’t the first time the SEC has extended deadlines for crypto ETFs. In late February, it postponed a decision on Cboe Exchange’s request to list options tied to Ether ETFs, signaling its ongoing hesitation in approving broader crypto-based financial instruments. Post-Gensler Agency Shows Signs of Softening The latest round of ETF delays comes amid a changing regulatory landscape following the resignation of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in January. Known for his aggressive stance against crypto, Gensler oversaw over 100 enforcement actions targeting digital asset firms during his tenure. Since his departure, several high-profile cases against crypto firms have been dismissed . On Feb. 26, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Gemini, and on March 4, the regulator ended legal proceedings against Cumberland DRW, a prominent crypto trading firm. Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda has also proposed rolling back a rule that would have expanded oversight of alternative trading systems to include crypto platforms.

The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions. Payment Firms Adopt Cryptocurrencies In April, Fintech giant Stripe announced its decision to once again allow customers to accept cryptocurrency payments after a six-year break. In 2014, Stripe dipped its toes into the world of cryptocurrency with tests involving Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency. However, in 2018, the company decided to halt its support for Bitcoin due to its volatility and lack of suitability as a means of exchange. Aside from Stripe, other payment companies have also adopted stablecoins as a means of payment. More recently, Singapore-based payments company Triple-A announced plans to integrate PayPal’s stablecoin into its list of supported tokens for customer payments.

Currently, the market is struggling, but a good number of top-cap cryptocurrencies are being discussed at an increased rate on social media. According to a tweet by the on-chain intelligence platform Santiment, bitcoin (BTC, Starknet (STRK), ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), Grok (GROK), and USD Coin (USDC) are recording the highest rises in chats across X, Telegram, Reddit, BitcoinTalk, 4Chan, and Farcaster. Coins Trending Across Social Media Bitcoin has had the highest increase in social media discussions, and these talks are fueled by the asset’s price fluctuations, market behavior, and importance in financial systems. Investors are developing strategies for staying afloat during the latest dip, emphasizing the need to hold BTC for the long term. BTC recently fell below $77,000; however, traders are cautioning against selling during such price drops. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the coin was worth $81,800 at the time of writing. The second project is Starknet, but its reason for being in social media discussions is quite unusual. The business intelligence firm Strategy announced plans to raise $21 billion via a program involving its preferred stock, STRK, to acquire more BTC. As a validity rollup that scales the Ethereum network, Starknet’s native cryptocurrency is STRK. Since Strategy announced the program, the preferred stock STRK has been trending, and because the asset is not a cryptocurrency, Starknet’s STRK has filled in the space. Meme Coins And Stablecoins Following STRK is ETH. Social media discussions are comparing the second-largest cryptocurrency to bitcoin and other altcoins. Due to Ether’s underperformance this cycle, users are skeptical about the asset reaching new all-time highs. There are also concerns about high transaction fees on the Ethereum network. USDT is the fourth crypto asset with high social media discussions. Platforms that offer the stablecoin as an asset for daily earnings are promoting it more, highlighting its role as an asset for financial freedom and profit generation. Up next is GROK, a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok. While Musk’s AI startup xAI has yet to release an official token for Grok, market participants have launched several meme coins inspired by the chatbot. Nevertheless, GROK is trending on social media because of its association with the meme coin Grokster (GRK). Grok suggested Grokster as a name for its official mascot, and an unidentified user launched the token on Base. Since then, users have been bullish about GRK, highlighting its growth potential. Finally, USDC is trending because of discussions about its interest rates compared to USDT, especially with regulatory changes in Europe.

Bitcoin Act is introduced On Tuesday, Republican Congressman Nick Begich introduced a bill to the House for the formation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He was joined in this endeavour by Senator Cynthia Lummis who is sponsoring the bill. Included in the bill is a commitment to purchase 200,000 BTC per year over the next 5 years. The bill has the purpose of enabling the US to acquire as much as 5% of the entire Bitcoin supply, which would likely put the US in the driving seat as the number one holder of Bitcoin in the world. While President Trump has already signed an executive order for the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, this latest bill aims to go well beyond this and be enshrined into law. This would prevent future governments from overturning the legislation, and would set a minimum amount of 20 years before any sales could be made. According to an article on the subject by the Washington Examiner, Begich is quoted as saying: “Any strategic reserve asset needs to be held long enough to be strategic, and so the United States government is not a day trader. We’re interested in long-term, stable assets that provide a strategic advantage to the national balance sheet.” He added: “What this bill does is it establishes the strategic Bitcoin reserve in law, long-term, so what a president can do in four years, a Congress can do permanently.” Can the bill pass? For this legislation to be enacted, it still has to pass through both houses, and although the republicans control both House and Senate, true understanding of Bitcoin is probably in its infancy, and congressmen and senators may be swayed by the plethora of negative mainstream press that has dogged Bitcoin practically over the whole course of its sixteen years of existence. Europe follows a totally different path The US direction into a future monetary policy that includes Bitcoin, is in stark contrast to what Europe is currently following. A few days ago, ECB President Christine Lagarde stated in a press conference, when asked about a “golden opportunity” for a European digital currency, that she agreed with this, and that the European Central Bank had a deadline of October 2025 to implement a CBDC. Lagarde said that this implementation would only be able to take place if “stakeholders”, which she denominated as the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Parliament, were all in agreement. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would have the effect of giving total control to the European Central Bank over the movement of every single transaction made by citizens. This would include the ability to prevent any transaction before it happens, and to financially sanction a citizen immediately if the central bank thought that transactional, or any other behaviour of a citizen, transgressed its policies. The future of finance is about to be decided While such a tight and restrictive financial implementation awaits all European citizens, the U.S. government is going in completely the opposite direction, as it seeks to enable its citizens to have the right by law to hold and transact with Bitcoin - a currency that is completely outside of government control.

However, Nintendo stock has dropped 10% in the last week, which is a big drop after it hit an all-time high last month and gained more than 40% in the six months before the sell-off. Fears that Trump’s tariffs will make game prices go up in the US also caused shares of Sony Group, the company that made PlayStation, to drop 6%. The current rise in US tariffs under Donald Trump’s administration is causing worries about rising costs and problems in the supply chain. This has had a knock-on effect on shareholders’ confidence in the Japanese game makers. Comparison of Sony and Nintendo stocks between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025. Source: Financial Times The problem isn’t just with US gamers and Japanese system makers; it’s also with China. The video game market is in danger because US taxes on Chinese goods have gone up sharply from 10% to 20%. A lot of gaming consoles are made or depend on suppliers for key parts in the People’s Republic. This means that the industry has to deal with rising prices and possible problems in the supply chain. The aftermath for Sony and Nintendo The tariffs don’t directly target games, but they do affect hardware exports to the US, such as computers, mobile phones, and game consoles. This could raise prices for customers. The fight over tariffs could also take attention away from a bigger fight going on in the gaming business. Price alone will not be enough for console makers to make money and keep market share as they get ready for their next big hardware shift. That said, the real fight for dominance is to get players more involved. Digital ecosystems and recurring income are becoming increasingly important for growing margins. That will have a huge impact on the industry and force game companies to find new ways to make money, like subscriptions, special content, and going into new markets. Concerns about tariffs may be making investors sell gaming stocks, but they may not be seeing the bigger, more important game that’s coming up. Nintendo is especially at risk. Its customers have always been price-conscious. This means passing on higher costs to them could lower demand. Taking on the effects of tariffs on the inside is also tricky because profits are already being squeezed. The company has already lowered its profit forecast for the year to March and lowered its full-year console sales estimate from 12.5 million units to 11 million units. For Sony, China is becoming more than just a place to make things. It is also becoming a good place to reach players. For a long time, this market was seen as weak for Sony because mobile gaming is so popular there. But new growth is making this market stronger for the company. With more customers, it should be better able to handle the costs that come with tariffs. In addition, even though prices have recently dropped, the overall picture for gaming is still good. For example, Sony’s PlayStation 5 has been selling very well. It set new sales records over the holidays and sold over 9.5 million units in the last quarter, which increased Sony’s income forecast for the whole year to $87.6 billion. Japan-based game makers experience a market crash Many Japanese companies that depend on other companies’ technology have also been hurt, like DeNA, the company that made the Pokémon TCG Pocket. The Japanese studio’s shares hit a record high on February 21, up 137% in a year, thanks to Pocket’s huge success. However, as one of the biggest new mobile games of 2024, the game will only last as long as players can get their hands on cheap, up-to-date phones. Since March 3, DeNA’s shares have gone down almost 10%. Data shows that 26% of TCG Pocket players’ buying has come from the US. This makes the US the second most important market for the game after Japan. Capcom’s shares are also down about 10% since the day before Trump’s news. Although the company’s new Monster Hunter game, Monster Hunter Wilds , broke sales records when it came out. Capcom’s fastest-selling game ever, it sold more than eight million copies in its first three days after its release on February 28. The company’s stock price did go up, but only for a short time. Other mobile companies’ shares have gone down a little since the tariffs were announced, but that’s to be expected since shares change all the time. CyberAgent, which owns Cygames, has seen its shares drop by 1%, and Square Enix has seen its shares drop by 2%. The stock price of Puzzle & Dragons maker GungHo has dropped almost 4%, and the stock price of Mixi has dropped almost 6%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

BitLemons is making waves in web3 gaming with a fully operational platform, real revenue, and a fast-selling presale, all while bigger names like Ethereum and BNB struggle. Table of Contents Is BitLemons the next big name in web3 gaming? Will ETH regain its momentum or slip further? BNB prepares for a game-changing hardfork BLEM continues to excel as presale nears final stage Ethereum is stuck in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, while Binance Coin is gearing up for a network upgrade that could alter its trajectory. Traders are laser-focused on these developments, but are they overlooking the real play? BitLemons (BLEM) has been quietly gaining traction, operating a fully functional web3 gaming platform while competitors are still caught in market speculation. With its presale nearing full capacity, investors are rushing to secure their spot before it’s too late. Is BitLemons the next big name in web3 gaming? BitLemons is a fully operational web3 gaming platform that is already generating real revenue. Unlike speculative projects, BLEM has secured a sustainable business model, offering over 8,000 games from top-tier providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, alongside its exclusive in-house releases. Three original BitLemons games, BLEM Keno, Crash, and Wheel, have launched, further boosting platform revenue. BitLemons has raised over $1.89 million, with Stage 2 of the presale already over 90 percent sold out. The price is set to increase from $0.02 to $0.03 soon, making this a crucial moment for early investors looking to secure an entry. More than just a gaming token, BLEM is built for long-term growth. Thirty percent of Gross Gaming Revenue is allocated back to the community, with 15 percent fueling buybacks and burns to increase scarcity, while another 15% is reserved for high-yield staking rewards. Strategic partnerships and influencer collaborations are rumored to be on the horizon, and these could be catalysts for even greater demand. Will ETH regain its momentum or slip further? Ethereum is facing challenges as it struggles to maintain key support levels. Recent developments have shown bearish sentiment, with resistance forming near the $1,880 range. A move above this level could indicate a shift in momentum, while failure to do so may see Ethereum retest lower supports in the near term. Despite this short-term uncertainty, Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation. With Layer 2 scaling solutions gaining traction and institutional adoption continuing to grow, the long-term outlook remains strong. Traders are keeping a close eye on whether Ethereum can regain its position above $2,000 in the coming days. You might also like: Will TRX or PI outpace BitLemons in the 2025 crypto race? BNB prepares for a game-changing hardfork BNB is gaining attention as Binance’s Pascal Hardfork approaches, set for March 20. This upgrade aims to enhance Ethereum compatibility on the BNB Chain, introducing gasless transactions and batch approvals for smart contracts. These improvements are expected to attract developers and expand the BNB ecosystem. Another significant development is Binance’s community co-governance model, which allows users to vote on token listings and delistings. This shift toward decentralization aligns with broader trends in the crypto industry. While BNB’s price has seen some volatility, these structural improvements could provide long-term benefits. The market is watching closely to see how these changes impact BNB’s position in the web3 space. BLEM continues to excel as presale nears final stage While Ethereum and BNB navigate uncertain price movements, BitLemons continues to deliver tangible results. Its fully operational web3 gaming ecosystem is attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors. The platform’s revenue-sharing model and sustainable business approach make it a standout in the current market. The presale is moving fast, with over 90 percent of Stage 2 already sold. The price is set to rise again soon, and investors are securing their positions before demand drives it higher. With staking rewards, buyback mechanisms, and continuous game releases fueling the ecosystem, BLEM is positioning itself as a dominant force in web3 gaming.

Using his pocket-sized Bitaxe machine, this miner single-handedly mined a block of BTC and earned around $263,000. This miner became the 297th solo miner to mine a Bitcoin block from the solo.ckpool Bitcoin mining pool. Mining pool developer Con Kolivas congratulated the miner, saying that the miner was using a 480 gigahashes per second (GH/s) Bitaxe machine, which is a very, very simple machine compared to the machines that can run at over 230,000 GH/s used by many major crypto mining companies. Congratulations to the super lucky miner who solved the 297th solo block on solo.ckpool with a 480GH bitaxe with only 3.3TH! The chance of a miner of this size finding a block per day is less than one in a million, or alternatively, it would take 3,500 years on average to find a block.” Bitcoin blocks are produced approximately every 10 minutes and are typically mined by mining pools that have the highest chance of winning the block reward. The reward for successfully mining a block is currently 3,125 Bitcoins after a halving event earlier this year. *This is not investment advice.

Upcoming US CPI data and potential Ukraine peace talks may influence market sentiment in the short term, determining whether SHIB’s bullish momentum continues or reverses. The Potential Catalysts After underperforming over the past few weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has finally charted a solid price rally in the last 24 hours. It currently trades at around $0.00001232 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 5% increase for the timeframe. An important element that may have positively impacted the valuation is Shibarium’s resurgence. Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution has processed almost 250,000 transactions in the past 24 hours, which is a substantial rise compared to the number of daily transactions witnessed earlier this month. Shibarium is specifically designed to foster the development of the meme coin’s ecosystem. Earlier this month, the popular analyst Davinci Jeremie suggested that SHIB could go “to the moon,” but this would depend on the protocol’s progress. “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically, it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet. If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon,” Davinci stated. Another factor that should be mentioned is SHIB’s exchange netflow . According to CryptoQuant, the figure has been on a downtrend in the past week, signaling a possible shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This development reduces the immediate selling pressure. CryptoQuant’s data also shows that SHIB’s reserves stored at exchanges have dropped to an almost four-year low of approximately 94.2 trillion tokens. The Market’s Rebound Lastly, Shiba Inu’s revival could be attributed to the recovery of the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and most leading digital assets have charted solid gains in the past 24 hours, erasing some of the losses incurred in the last few weeks. Meme coins, including SHIB, often follow the overall trend. It is worth mentioning that the next few days may offer additional volatility due to the release of the US CPI data and the potential negotiation talks about peace in Ukraine. This could solidify the current bullish move, or the bears might retake control if the news is not so positive .

Res 25, effectively rejecting the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) controversial broker rule. The resolution, which gained overwhelming bipartisan support, aims to protect decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation and prevent regulatory overreach. Taxing Requirement According to the DeFi Education Fund, 292 lawmakers voted in favor of the resolution while 132 went against it, nullifying a rule that would have imposed strict reporting requirements on DeFi platforms. The 292 included all House Republicans, apart from a few that didn’t show up, as well as 76 Democrats. The advocacy group praised the move, saying in a statement posted on X: “The DeFi Education Fund applauds all members who voted in favor of the resolution, reaffirming that Americans should have the freedom to decide how they transact.” Pushed by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS, the contentious rule sought to improve tax compliance by treating DeFi platforms and software providers like traditional brokers, subjecting them to stringent reporting obligations. However, critics argued that it ignored the unique nature of decentralized technology and would have placed undue compliance burdens on developers who never take custody of users’ assets. In December last year, Andreessen Horowitz joined a legal challenge against the regulation, claiming that it exceeded the IRS’s statutory authority and threatened the growth of the crypto industry in the U.S. Following the passing of the joint resolution, French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, stated that the broker rule is “a clear example of government overreach” that could push American digital asset development offshore. He also reaffirmed his commitment to working across party lines to create clearer, more appropriate regulatory frameworks for crypto. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, H.J. Res 25 will now move back to the Senate due to a technicality requiring “bills that affect the budget to originate in the House.” Senators, who voted in favor of a similar resolution 70 to 27 earlier in the month, must pass it before it heads to the president for final approval. If signed into law, it will officially overturn the IRS rule and prevent it from coming back in a similar form. Market Reaction Despite the development, at the time of writing, the broader crypto market was down 0.7% in the last 24 hours. However, some high-cap assets including Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), were showing signs of recovery. BTC was up 1.1% on its price from yesterday, while XRP and DOGE recorded even better improvements at 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. In the past week, data from CoinGecko shows that the digital asset sector lost nearly 10% of its value as it battled a period of enhanced volatility. In that time, Bitcoin dropped to a four-month low, dipping under the $77,000 level, while its closest rival, Ethereum (ETH), slipped below $1,800 for the first time in nearly 16 months.

Although the altcoin has recovered significantly since then, the possibility of further decline still exists as the tokens near a critical resistance zone. At the same, it also opens the potential for the breakout above $2,610. Ethereum Price Overcomes Massive Downtrend Ethereum currently trades at $1,912.04 with market capitalization and trading volume of $230.61B and $26.3B, respectively. With a minor surge, ETH shows renewed investor interest amid broader market recovery. However, the market’s volatility is still in action, putting downtrend pressure on the token amid the whale liquidations. With this, it is approaching a critical resistance zone between $2,248.27 and $2,610.35, with a significant 12.28 million addresses holding approximately 65.24 million ETH. More importantly, this is the crucial junction. Here, 70.42% of the Ethereum holders (100.97M ETH) are under a loss, while only 27.65% are managing profits. However, the concerning part is the 1.95% holders, who are at break-even points and may sell their tokens to recover loss, creating pressure on the altcoin. This could result in a further downtrend or a potential crash amid high selling pressure. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is $3000 Possible? Although Ethereum is maintaining its demand in the market, the $2,610 resistance has become its biggest barrier. The failure to break out of this level keeps the token in the consolatory phase despite building institutional interest and broader market recovery. However, in contrast, if the ETH price breaks above $2,610, it would generate a strong bullish breakout, as the resistances above this are relatively weaker. With that, ETH can potentially target $2,750 or even $3,000 in the coming weeks. However, failing to break this key resistance could result in the continuity of the current consolidation. Key Technical Levels to Watch Although the trajectory of the ETH is uncertain amid market volatility and upcoming CPI data , a better analysis can be made considering the key technical indicators. The primary resistance is $2,610, and the next is $2,750. It could reach higher levels if the token breaks through the $2,610 level with investor demand and strong volume. Interestingly, this may happen amid the Ethereum ETF speculation, deflationary mechanism, and favorable CPI data outcome could favor this rally. However, the failure could push it down, as the Ethereum price analysis reveals key support at $1,500. A downtrend below this could result in the price reaching $1,250 and lower. Interestingly, experts believe the Ethereum Foundation has a longed $182,000,000 position, which would get liquidated if the value crashed to $1,127. This would also negatively affect the ETH price. Will Ethereum Break Through $2,610? As Ethereum sits at a crucial level, both bullish and bearish scenarios are open. A decisive breakout above $2,610 could lead to a rally towards $2,750 and $3,000, especially if CPI data is favorable and whale accumulation resumes. However, the Ethereum price prediction reveals that the rejection at resistance and increase in whale liquidation could bring it down. Investors must keep an eye on key resistance and support levels before jumping into trade.

Bitcoin (BTC) price was stuck at $82,400, while Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) were trading at $1,885 and $2.20, respectively. This article provides a forecast for the BTC, ETH, and XRP ahead of the CPI and as Japan 30-year bonds surged to the highest point since 2008. BTC, ETH, XRP Analysis as Japan 30Y Yields Surges Ahead of US CPI The Japanese bond market continued its freefall this week. Japan’s 30-year bond yield soared to 2.62%, a big increase from 0.227% in 2020. Similarly, the ten-year yields jumped to 1.58% from the January low of about 1%. The ongoing bond yield surge is primarily because the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has embraced a highly hawkish tone this year. It has hiked interest rates by 0.25% and hinted that more were coming as inflation remains elevated. Japan 10 Year and 30-year yields The BoJ is hiking rates as concerns about the global economy remain as the Trump tariffs continue. Also, it is doing that as other central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB), slash rates. The BoJ’s actions impact all assets, including BTC, ETH, and XRP. That’s because the rising bond yields is helping to unwind a carry trade that existed for years. A carry trade is a situation where investors borrow cheaply in Japan and invest in high-yielding assets, including Bitcoin. As the yields rise, many investors are now unwinding these bets. BTC, ETH, and XRP will next react to the US CPI data. Economists expect the data to show that inflation softened slightly in February, making the case for a future Fed cut now that US bond yields are falling . However, these inflation numbers may not move the needle a lot since they will not include Trump’s tariffs. BTC Technical Analysis Bitcoin price bottomed at $76,500 on Tuesday and then bounced back to $84,000 as traders focused on US-Canada relations. It remains below the 38.2% retracement level. The 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) have crossed each other, forming a death cross. A death cross is one of the riskiest patterns in the market. Therefore, the BTC price will likely resume the downtrend and possibly retest the support at $76,500. Ultimately, the coin will likely do a break-and-retest by moving back to the key support at $72,500, the highest swing in March of last year and the 50% retracement. It will then bounce back, possibly after the Lunar Eclipse happens on Friday. BTC Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis The weekly chart shows that the ETH price formed a triple-top pattern at $4,035. It has now crashed below the neckline at $2,153, validating the bearish view. Ethereum price has also dropped below the 61.8% retracement level, which is known as the golden ratio. That’s because most reversals happen at that level. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for ETH price is bearish, with the next target being at $1,545, the lowest swing in October 2023. A move above the key resistance at $2,200 will invalidate the bearish view. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis The XRP price bottomed at the crucial support level at $1.9615. This was an important level since it was the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. The ongoing rebound is a sign that investors are fighting back to prevent a drop below that level. A crash below $1.9615 would likely lead to panic selling and risk the coin falling to $1. The H&S pattern is still a risk, which will become invalidated if it rises above the right shoulder at $3. XRP Price Chart Summary on Crypto Market Price Action Ahead of US CPI The upcoming US CPI data will likely have a mild impact on the crypto market because it will not include the recent tariffs. However, the actions by the Bank of Japan, which meets next week, may have a significant impact on coins like BTC, ETH, and XRP because of the carry trade factor.

The White House has dismissed concerns about a looming recession, and the weakening US dollar is driving optimism towards risk assets. As crypto traders react to these developments, is a stronger rally on the horizon? Crypto Prices Rebound Today As White House Downplays Recession Amid Weak Dollar The concerns of an economic recession in the US drove Bitcoin price to $76,000 yesterday. However, crypto prices are up today, with Bitcoin recovering to $81,000. Meanwhile, XRP and Dogecoin had also rebounded after the White House pushed back against recession talks. While speaking to CNBC, the National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, shut down recession rumors . He noted that the US economy was still on a positive trajectory despite the likelihood of Q1 2025 data not being positive. Hassett’s remarks come after experts hiked their recession odds, JPMorgan increased the odds of a US economic recession from 30% to 40% while Goldman Sachs analysts raised their probability from 10% to 15%. Trump’s tariff hikes have been blamed for slowed economic growth. These policies have also weakened the performance of the US dollar against major currencies. The US dollar index has fallen to 103, its lowest level since November 2024. US Dollar Index A weak greenback is good for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As the dollar weakens, crypto prices are rising today due to speculation that capital inflows will surge. Bitcoin Price Analysis – Can BTC Recover to $90K? Bitcoin price trades at $82,480 today after a marginal 1.1% gain in 24 hours. BTC price brushed $83,000 today and is on the way to making a significant price rally after forming an ascending triangle pattern, which often precedes a trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Popular analyst Ali Charts notes that if Bitcoin continues to gain and breaches the upper trendline of this ascending channel, it could stir an 8% price rally toward $89,000. If BTC hits this level and market sentiment remains positive, it highlights a bullish Bitcoin price prediction and possible gains past $90,000. BTC/USD: 10-Minute Chart XRP Price Confirms a Bullish Reversal XRP is among the top gainers as crypto prices rebound today amid speculation of a BlackRock XRP ETF application . XRP price today hovers around $2.19 with a 2.5% rise in 24 hours. Ripple has broken above the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern confirming a bullish reversal. The RSI is at 52, signaling neutral conditions, with buyers having a slightly upper hand. The On-Balance Volume also remains stable at high levels, hinting at steady participation from traders. If the XRP price confirms a decisive breakout above the upper trendline, the next targets are the 50% and 100% Fibonacci levels of $2.61 and $3, respectively. XRP/USDT: 1-Hour Chart Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin price has gained by 4.6% today to trade at $0.168 despite the SEC’s DOGE ETF delay . Meanwhile, the short-term holder NUPL suggests that DOGE price may have reached a local bottom. This metric has declined significantly aligning with the recent downtrend, suggesting that short-term holders are heavily underwater. If history repeats, this drop could precede a capitulation or a reversal opportunity. Short-Term Holder NUPL Final Thoughts on Crypto Prices Today Crypto prices are bullish today with the weakening US dollar and White House remarks on recession providing tailwinds for Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin prices. If risk assets see a continued rise in demand, it could fuel significant price gains.

This follows a recent surge of 1.81% in the ETH coins market capitalization in the last 24 hours. The recovery comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) evaluates proposals regarding Ethereum staking. With ETH showing potential growth, now may be a prime time to buy these Ethereum coins amid slight market corrections. Ethereum coins to buy: ONDO (ONDO) ONDO (ONDO) price stands at $0.84, showing a slight 2.50% increase in the last 24 hours. After a rise over the past year, ONDO is experiencing a minor recovery following the crypto market rebound. Meanwhile, the ongoing SEC decision on ETH staking could influence Ethereum coins to buy. ONDO price has witnessed a surge in new addresses, increasing 390% in 24 hours from 935 to 4,559. This rapid adoption suggests rising market interest, which could lead to higher demand. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has risen 5% in 24 hours, reaching $0.000012. This increase highlights its growing appeal in the market. Over the past year, SHIB has emerged as a top Ethereum token to watch. Its momentum is supported by increased trading, regular token burns, and Shibarium’s launch. As market sentiment shifts, Shiba Inu continues to strengthen its position. If bullish trends persist, analysts predict potential SHIB price forecast targets of $0.000015 and $0.00002, reflecting SHIB’s increasing market confidence. MANTRA (OM) MANTRA (OM), a security-first, real-world asset (RWA) focused Layer 1 blockchain, ensures strict adherence to regulatory norms. Currently, OM trades at $6.33, marking a modest daily increase of 0.18%. Despite broader market downturns, MANTRA’s value has impressively surged by 1900% over the last year. The whale activity on the Mantra (OM) network has reached a record high as transactions exceeding $1 million surged. This sharp rise suggests growing interest from large holders. Increased whale transactions often impact market sentiment, potentially leading to price volatility. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is trading at $0.000006321, gaining 7% in the past 24 hours following a market rebound. The Ethereum-based token has been moving sideways recently but remains in focus. A crypto analyst hinted at a potential 40x rally for the Pepe price prediction in the coming months. If realized, this surge could place it among the top Ethereum tokens to watch. Meanwhile, the SEC’s stance on Ethereum staking remains a key factor influencing the market. Final Thought The recent SEC developments and Ethereum’s recovery could pave the way for higher demand for Ethereum coins to buy. The future of ETH staking remains a crucial factor for market movements. Keep a close eye on these coins as the SEC’s decision unfolds.

On March 6, financial watchdogs from all 27 EU member states met under the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to discuss whether OKX’s Web3 service falls under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. If regulators determine that it does, OKX could face severe penalties under European law. Officials say hackers connected to North Korea’s Lazarus Group funneled stolen funds through OKX’s self-custodial wallet and decentralized trading service, per the report. Just last month, the company had to plead guilty to operating without a US license, processing over $1 trillion in unauthorized transactions, and agreed to pay $504 million in penalties. Regulators question OKX’s Web3 compliance under MiCA The Bybit hack was the single largest in crypto history, and they mainly took Ether and moved the funds using cross-chain bridges and decentralized exchanges. Authorities now say a portion of the stolen crypto—about $100 million—was washed through OKX’s Web3 service, which lets users swap tokens and interact with multiple blockchains. OKX operates a major crypto exchange that supports over 300 cryptocurrencies, but its Web3 platform is separate and allows users to connect to 100 different blockchains via a self-custodial wallet. As of July 2023, OKX reported that 53 million wallets had been created on the platform. While fully decentralized platforms are exempt from MiCA, regulators from Austria and Croatia argue that OKX’s Web3 service should be covered under EU law. During the March 6 meeting, regulators reviewed a presentation that pointed out how OKX’s Web3 wallet is directly integrated into the company’s website. The presentation also shared that OKX’s terms of use list an entity in Singapore as its main operator, though OKX has denied any link between its Web3 wallet and OKX SG Pte, the company’s Singapore-based entity, which is registered under Singapore’s central bank. The meeting also raised concerns over whether OKX’s role in the Bybit hack constitutes a violation of sanctions on North Korea. But regulators have yet to decide whether formal legal action will be taken on that front, according to Bloomberg. In response to the allegations, OKX released a statement saying, “Claims of OKX’s involvement in laundering any funds are inaccurate and preposterous, we’ve been assisting Bybit on tracking wallet addresses and blocking those necessary in real time.” ESMA and EU watchdogs push for huge penalties against OKX Several EU regulators are now calling for strict action against OKX. Officials have urged ESMA and the European Banking Authority (EBA) to investigate the exchange’s MiCA compliance. A key focus is OKX’s MiCA license, which it secured through Malta’s financial regulator in January 2025. Just a month later, OKX obtained permission to “passport” its services across the European Economic Area (EEA). During the March 6 meeting, watchdogs pressured Malta’s financial authority to consider penalties, including revoking OKX’s MiCA permit and blocking its ability to operate across the EEA. Malta’s regulators confirmed they would meet with OKX’s senior management to discuss the Bybit hack , but did not say whether formal action would be taken. Both Malta’s financial watchdog and the EBA declined to comment on the investigation. ESMA though issued a statement saying, “We stand ready to deploy all available regulatory tools, if necessary, to safeguard market integrity and investor protection.” Under MiCA’s Article 64, regulators can revoke a license if an entity fails to prevent money laundering or violates compliance rules in other serious ways, and the law also allows ESMA and the EBA to request a full investigation into whether an exchange is still meeting MiCA requirements, said the report.

As the price fell below the liquidation level, the whale’s $306.85 million position was liquidated. At press time, ETH is trading near $1,908, having registered a price surge of over 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 35%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors, potentially due to ongoing market uncertainty and significant price fluctuations. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears bullish as it has regained momentum above the $1,900 level. Historically, this level has acted as a strong price reversal zone and a key area where assets experience buying pressure. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ETH holds above the $1,800 level, it could surge by 15% to reach $2,200 in the coming days or even higher. At press time, the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals a potential price reversal, as it has formed a higher high while ETH was making a lower low.

Posting a huge loss weekly, it is now looking bearish following a consistent drop since the start of the month. Following last week’s crash, which halted the market bullish trajectory, LTC posted a heavy loss and quickly tumbled. The drop came unnoticed until it closed that week’s price under the psychological $100 level. Things turned out even worse yesterday when the crypto market dropped 3%. It fell through the $90 level to a low of $83 today. It has recovered briefly from there as a result of a rejection and now trades at $89. Nevertheless, the price remains weak on the monthly scale. The latest sell-off is targeted at last month’s low, and a breakdown from this low could fuel a massive collapse in the mid-term. Failure to break it could subject the market to a temporal consolidation phase, as we saw last week, before advancing bearishly. However, if the market stays above the $80 level, LTC may see a brief retracement to the lost psychological level. After that, we can expect the bearish action to resume at full speed. A retracement above the lost level could bring a strong recovery. But with the look of things, the bears will likely gain more dominance in the future. LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from the $87 level, the current low is considered daily support. A drop off $80 should send the price to $74.3 support and potentially $68 by the end of the month. Following a short bounce to $92.6 on the hourly chart, the key resistance level lies at $100.

Floki Inu (FLOKI) and This Penny Token Could Outshine PEPE,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-pepe-coin-pepe-reach-00001-in-2025-floki-inu-floki-and-this-penny-token-could-outshine-pepe,"Over the past year, the meme coin space has undergone profound changes, with Pepe Coin spearheading the developments in 2025. Investors are now asking whether PEPE will be able to maintain its upward trajectory and hit the remarkable target of $0.0001 by 2025. While Pepe Coin rides the bullish trend, other contenders—Floki Inu and Rexas Finance —are gathering notable focus as prospective outperformers. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Is It Possible to Hit $0.0001? PEPE is priced at $0.00000912, while its market cap is an impressive $3.84 billion. The technical chart on the weekly timeframe reveals a bullish engulfing pattern, which indicates the prevailing positive price action. Moreover, over the next five weeks, PEPE has been recovering from previous dips and has restored investors' faith in cryptocurrency, which is impressive. If PEPE maintains this pattern, it could surpass its ATH of $0.0000282852. Nevertheless, long-term bullish market conditions must exist for that prediction to fully come to fruition. To reach $0.0001, PEPE would need a market cap of nearly $42 billion. This scenario may be possible considering the required tremendous liquidity to utilize PEPE. Still, investors must ask themselves if other meme coins with better characteristics will overtake PEPE in 2025. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Is It Possible for It to Overtake PEPE? Another meme coin sensation, Floki Inu (FLOKI), has been making waves as it continues establishing partnerships and real-world utilities. Expert analysts and AI-driven predictions suggest FLOKI could attain a maximum price of $0.000231 in 2025, translating to a possible 140% increase. On the conservative side, the weakest estimated figure for FLOKI is approximately $0.0001076, which showcases strong bullish enthusiasm. With PEPE excluded, FLOKI has been branching out into speculative trading. Blockchains, like the Valhalla metaverse and staking, provide opportunities that can interest long-term investors. If this persists, FLOKI may attain the forecasted highs and put itself ahead of PEPE as the number one meme coin. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale The Underdog: Rexas Finance (RXS) Set to Present the Crypto World on Its Own Terms Rexas Finance (RXS) is contending strongly in the competition for the most emerging altcoins, while seasoned meme coins like PEPE and FLOKI continue to capture conversations. Unlike many of its peers, RXS is not solely fueled by hype. It is a utility-driven cryptocurrency that aims to marry real-world financial applications with blockchain technology. RXS is in its last presale stage (stage 12), and the price has soared to $0.20. With an astounding $46.5 million raised, the project has sold 452.9 million tokens. Now at 90.58% completion, the presale hopes to launch on June 19, 2025, with an impressive listing price of $0.25. Considering the completion rate of this offering, the growth opportunities available to RXS post-listing are massive, especially given the company's promotional roadmap. What sets RXS apart from the rest of the industry and gives its investors a reason to have faith in the company is its capacity to cater to institutional and retail investors. Additionally, RXS adopts a more structured approach by offering staking rewards, liquidity pools, and real-world payment solutions, making it a serious contender against meme coins such as PEPE and FLOKI and established altcoins. Will PEPE, FLOKI, or RXS Dominate 2025? As they compete for supremacy in cryptocurrency, the performance of these three altcoins is likely to be driven by investor perception, the state of the market, and how well each project can remain relevant. Among these coins, meme tokens have the highest market cap, but achieving a target price of $0.0001 poses an uphill battle for PEPE. FLOKI is far ahead in the meme token race, with a changing probability of sustained gains through system expansion and immense utility-driven integration. At the same time, RXS provides a new, appealing narrative to both day traders and long-term value seekers. Approaching the mid-phase of 2025, the three above coins are worth a closer look, specifically focusing on their risk portfolios and which best balances investments. The question is: to what extent is RXS and its public offering the best value play ahead of a price rise?

The rollercoaster of regulatory decisions continues as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just dropped a bombshell. Investors eagerly awaiting a spot Cardano (ADA) exchange-traded fund (ETF) are facing a setback. The SEC has officially postponed its decision on Grayscale’s proposed ADA ETF . This delay sends ripples through the crypto market, leaving many to wonder: What does this mean for Cardano, for crypto ETFs, and for your investments? Why the Delay on the ADA ETF Decision? According to a recent filing, the SEC needs more time to evaluate Grayscale’s application for a spot ADA ETF . While the official statement is brief, such postponements often point to complex considerations. Let’s break down what could be behind this decision: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. The SEC might be taking a cautious approach to ensure investor protection, especially with newer assets like Cardano. Regulatory Scrutiny: Spot crypto ETFs are relatively new territory. The SEC is likely conducting thorough due diligence to establish a precedent for future ETF approval s. They need to ensure that the market infrastructure and surveillance mechanisms are robust enough to prevent manipulation and fraud. Custody Concerns: Secure custody of underlying crypto assets is paramount for ETFs. The SEC may be scrutinizing Grayscale’s custody arrangements for the proposed Cardano holdings. Novelty of Cardano: While established, Cardano is not as mature in the ETF market as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SEC might be taking extra time to assess the specific risks and characteristics of a Cardano ETF . Impact on Cardano and the Crypto Market This delay undoubtedly impacts Cardano and the broader crypto market sentiment. Here’s a look at the potential ripple effects: ADA Price Action: Expect potential price fluctuations for ADA. While some investors might be disappointed by the delay, others may see it as a temporary setback. The long-term impact on ADA’s price will depend on various market factors and future regulatory developments. Investor Sentiment: The postponement could dampen enthusiasm for crypto ETFs in the short term. However, it also underscores the SEC’s commitment to a rigorous review process, which could build long-term trust in regulated crypto investment products. Broader ETF Market: This decision sets the stage for future ETF approval processes. It signals that the SEC is proceeding cautiously and methodically, which might mean longer timelines for other pending crypto ETF applications. Grayscale’s Perspective and What’s Next Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, proposed this Cardano ETF , aiming to expand its suite of crypto investment products. Their perspective is crucial in understanding the future trajectory: Grayscale’s Track Record: Grayscale has been instrumental in bringing crypto investment products to market. Their success with other ETFs, like their Bitcoin Trust, lends credibility to their endeavors in the Cardano ETF space. Continued Engagement: Grayscale is likely to work closely with the SEC to address any concerns and provide further information. They have a vested interest in seeing this ETF approved and will likely pursue all avenues to achieve that goal. Future Timeline: While the current decision is a postponement, it’s not a rejection. The SEC will set a new deadline for their decision, and the crypto community will be watching closely. Patience is key in navigating these regulatory processes. The SEC’s Stance on Crypto ETFs: A Closer Look Understanding the SEC ‘s overall approach to crypto ETFs is essential. They are tasked with protecting investors while fostering fair and efficient markets. This balancing act is evident in their crypto ETF decisions: Aspect SEC’s Focus Investor Protection Ensuring adequate safeguards against fraud, manipulation, and risks associated with crypto assets. Market Integrity Maintaining fair and orderly markets, requiring robust surveillance and custody solutions. Regulatory Framework Developing a comprehensive regulatory framework that accommodates innovation while mitigating risks. Due Diligence Conducting thorough reviews of ETF applications, considering the unique characteristics of each crypto asset. The SEC ‘s cautious approach, while sometimes frustrating for the crypto industry, is rooted in its mandate to protect investors and maintain market stability. This delay on the Cardano ETF is a testament to their rigorous evaluation process. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in light of this news? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments and SEC announcements regarding crypto ETFs. Reliable news sources and crypto publications are crucial. Diversify Investments: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different crypto assets and investment strategies can mitigate risks associated with regulatory uncertainties. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investing is often a long-term game. Regulatory hurdles are part of the journey. Focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of your chosen cryptocurrencies like ADA. Understand Risk: Be aware of the inherent risks in crypto investing, including regulatory risks. Only invest what you can afford to lose and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainties of Crypto Regulation The SEC ‘s postponement of the decision on Grayscale’s Cardano ETF is a reminder that the path to mainstream crypto adoption through regulated investment products is not always smooth. While delays can be disappointing, they are also a part of the regulatory process, reflecting the SEC’s commitment to thorough evaluation and investor protection. For ADA and the broader crypto market, this means continued patience and adaptation. The journey towards greater regulatory clarity and wider ETF availability continues, with each decision shaping the future landscape of crypto investments.

41538441,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139370,1741785610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Defiant Stance: Commerce Secretary Backs Trump’s Risky Economic Policy Amid Recession Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-policy-recession-risk-economy/,"In a bold defense of former President Trump’s economic strategies, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has ignited a fiery debate. He insists Trump’s approach is “worth it,” even if it means flirting with a recession. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors closely watching global economic shifts, this stance raises critical questions about market stability and future investment strategies. Let’s delve into the details of this controversial perspective and what it could mean for the broader economic landscape. Decoding the Commerce Secretary’s Support for Trump’s Policy Howard Lutnick, the current U.S. Commerce Secretary, didn’t mince words in his recent CBS News interview. He firmly stood by President Trump’s economic playbook, even when confronted with the looming shadow of a potential recession. His unwavering support hinges on the belief that the long-term gains outweigh the short-term pains. But what exactly are the pillars of Trump’s economic policy that Lutnick champions so vehemently? Tax Cuts: A cornerstone of Trump’s strategy was significant tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations and high-income earners. The rationale was to stimulate business investment and job creation. Deregulation: Trump’s administration aggressively pursued deregulation across various sectors, aiming to reduce the burden on businesses and foster economic activity. Trade Protectionism: “America First” trade policies, including tariffs and trade disputes, were central to Trump’s approach, intended to protect domestic industries and jobs. Lutnick argues these policies, despite potential short-term economic turbulence, are laying the foundation for sustained economic growth . He envisions a future where these measures translate into tangible benefits like increased revenues, business expansion, and a resurgence of American manufacturing. He pointed specifically to the promise of new factories sprouting across the U.S. as a direct result of these policies. Is Recession Risk Truly “Worth It”? Analyzing the Potential Downsides The elephant in the room is the “recession risk.” Economists and market analysts have been raising concerns about potential economic slowdowns, and Lutnick’s seemingly casual dismissal of these risks is raising eyebrows. Is it truly prudent to gamble with a recession, even for potentially significant long-term gains? Let’s consider the potential challenges: Market Volatility: Recession fears can trigger significant market volatility, impacting stock prices, currency values, and investor confidence. For the crypto market, already known for its fluctuations, this could mean amplified price swings and increased uncertainty. Job Losses: Recessions are typically accompanied by job losses and increased unemployment, directly impacting individuals and families. Reduced Consumer Spending: Economic downturns often lead to decreased consumer spending, which can further exacerbate the recessionary pressures. Business Failures: Recessions can lead to business failures, particularly for smaller enterprises that may lack the financial buffers to weather economic storms. While Lutnick paints a rosy picture of future prosperity, the immediate risks of a recession cannot be ignored. The question becomes: are the potential long-term benefits substantial enough to justify navigating through a period of economic contraction and uncertainty? Blaming Biden: Diverting Focus or Valid Criticism? A key element of Lutnick’s defense is shifting blame to the former Biden administration. He attributes any potential market impact and economic headwinds to what he terms “nonsense” policies from the previous administration. This raises several points: Policy Lags: Economic policies often have lagged effects. It can take months or even years to fully realize the consequences of policy decisions. Therefore, attributing current economic challenges solely to the previous administration might be an oversimplification. Global Factors: The global economic landscape is influenced by numerous factors beyond domestic policies, including international events, geopolitical tensions, and global economic cycles. Attributing economic issues to a single administration ignores these complex global dynamics. Political Rhetoric: Blaming the previous administration is a common political tactic. It serves to deflect criticism and reinforce partisan narratives. While it’s true that policy transitions can create economic adjustments, a nuanced understanding requires acknowledging the interplay of various factors, both domestic and international. Attributing everything to “nonsense policies” risks oversimplifying complex economic realities. The Promise of Growth: Factories, Revenue, and a US Economic Outlook Despite acknowledging the recession risks, Lutnick doubles down on the anticipated rewards of Trump’s economic vision. He emphasizes the promise of: Revenue Generation: Tax cuts and deregulation, according to proponents, are designed to stimulate economic activity and ultimately lead to increased government revenues through a larger economic pie. Factory Boom: A key promise is the resurgence of American manufacturing, with new factories being built within the U.S. This resonates with the “America First” narrative and the desire to bring jobs back home. Sustained Growth: The overarching goal is to establish a trajectory of sustained economic outlook and long-term prosperity for the United States. However, the realization of these promises is not guaranteed. Economic projections are subject to change, and unforeseen events can significantly alter the course of the economy. The success of Trump’s economic strategy, even according to its supporters, hinges on navigating potential recessionary periods and effectively translating policy intentions into tangible economic gains. Navigating the Uncertain Economic Terrain: Actionable Insights For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, the current economic climate and the debate surrounding Trump’s policies necessitate a cautious and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights: Insight Description Diversification is Key In times of economic uncertainty, diversifying your investment portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed Keep a close watch on economic indicators, policy developments, and market analysis. Knowledge is your best tool for navigating volatile markets. Risk Management Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategies accordingly. Consider using tools like stop-loss orders to manage potential downside risks. Long-Term Perspective Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Maintain a long-term investment perspective and focus on fundamental value. Conclusion: A Bold Gamble or Reckless Endangerment? Secretary Lutnick’s staunch defense of Trump’s economic policies, even with the specter of recession, presents a high-stakes gamble. He paints a vision of long-term prosperity, fueled by tax cuts, deregulation, and trade protectionism. However, the path to this promised land is fraught with potential pitfalls, including market volatility, economic contraction, and job losses. Whether this strategy proves to be a bold and defiant move towards sustained growth or a reckless endangerment of the US economy remains to be seen. For those navigating the crypto markets and the broader financial world, vigilance, informed decision-making, and a balanced perspective are more crucial than ever.

The purchase was made at an average price of $91,000 per coin. The move is part of Rumble’s previously disclosed plan to adopt a bitcoin treasury strategy and allocate up to $20 million of its cash reserves to bitcoin. Rumble’s CEO Chris Pavlovski said the decision was part of its further involvement in the crypto industry. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies,” Pavlovski said in a press release .

The broker started coverage of the crypto wallet firm with a buy rating and a $38 price target. The shares rose 5.7% to $25.89 in early trading. The Nebraska-based company has the ""right product at the right time,"" wrote analyst Mark Palmer. The need for self-custody was underscored in recent weeks, when crypto exchange Bybit was the subject of a hack of 400,000 ether (ETH), worth about $1.5 billion. Exodus Movement has lost more than 60% of its market cap in the last five weeks, Benchmark noted, giving a compelling entry point for investors looking for exposure to a company with ""strong operating momentum, the demonstrated ability to scale rapidly, and a tailwind from the accommodative stance toward the crypto space in the U.S.,"" the report said. The recent weakness is not linked to concerns about the firm's operating performance, the report noted, as the company posted strong fourth-quarter results earlier this month. Exodus Movement gets most of its revenue from its exchange aggregation feature, Benchmark said, and its ""wallet-as-a-service"" business leverages this technology in its crypto swap engine, which is integrated with platforms such as Ledger and Magic Eden.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported Wednesday that the consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the cost of a wide range of goods and services, rose 0.2% for the month, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.8%. The economists had forecasted 2.9% for the year and 0.3% for the month, but inflation didn’t rise as much as expected. The core CPI, which removes food and energy prices, also increased by 0.2% in February and hit 3.1% over the past 12 months. That number also fell short of projections, which were 3.2% for the year and 0.3% for the month. Markets react as inflation data changes investor expectations Stock markets responded immediately after the report was released. S&P 500 futures jumped 1.1%, up from 0.8% before the data was made public. Meanwhile, Treasury yields rose, and the U.S. dollar climbed 0.2% against a basket of six other major currencies. The biggest driver of the CPI increase was shelter costs, which make up more than one-third of the index. Those costs rose by 0.3% for the month, lower than in January, but they still accounted for nearly half of the total inflation increase. The BLS pointed out that this figure includes a category where homeowners estimate how much rent they would receive if they leased out their property. Other price movements included a 0.2% rise in both food and energy costs. Used car prices surged 0.9%, and apparel prices increased 0.6%. The biggest surge came from eggs, which shot up by 10.4% for the month and posted a 58.8% increase over the last 12 months. The Federal Reserve now faces increased pressure to cut interest rates. Futures markets currently predict two rate cuts this year, with an 85% chance of a third. That expectation ticked up slightly following the inflation report. Federal Reserve is now under even more pressure as economic uncertainty grows The Federal Reserve , led by Chair Jerome Powell, is in a tough position. It has to control inflation while avoiding a recession. That balancing act has become even more difficult as Trump’s trade policies continue to be aggressive and unpredictable. The president’s tariffs on major U.S. trading partners have been rolled out in a chaotic manner, with sudden escalations and reversals nearly every single day for the past week at least. Despite the concerns, Powell repeated last week that the Fed isn’t rushing to cut rates. He said that the central bank is focused on “separating the signal from the noise” as it evaluates economic conditions. However, the latest inflation data could increase calls for the Fed to move sooner rather than later. “February’s numbers show that inflation is cooling, but the Fed still has a tough job ahead,” said Robert Kaplan, a former Federal Reserve Bank president. “With markets already pricing in multiple rate cuts, the pressure is on Powell and the committee to act.” Meanwhile, some analysts believe that if Trump’s trade policies trigger a recession, he won’t care about the political consequences. “The reality is that Trump isn’t running again. He doesn’t need to worry about approval ratings,” said David Rosenberg, an economist who has tracked Trump’s policies since his first term. “If tariffs slow down growth, that’s a problem for the markets, not necessarily for him.” Analyst Janan Ganesh said in an editorial for FT today that: “Trump is emancipated from public opinion, which did a serviceable job of keeping him in check last time around. If his tariffs induce a recession, or his foreign policies a world crisis, driving his approval rating to hellish depths, what exactly does he lose?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

One is on the spending stopgap bill, and another deals with the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to roll back the IRS’ crypto exchange rule . House Republicans unveiled their spending plan over the weekend. It calls for a $6 billion increase in defense spending and cuts non-defense spending by $13 billion. The deadline for a funding bill is this Friday. The bill is expected to go to a floor vote as soon as tonight, but not all Republicans are on board. Rep. Thomas Massie has said he will vote no, while Reps. Cory Mills and Tim Burchett have said they’re undecided. Speaker Mike Johnson needs support from his entire party in both the House and the Senate, plus a few Democrats, to get the measure passed. The CRA , introduced in January with bipartisan support, is also supposed to head to a floor vote this afternoon. Reps started debating the resolution at noon today and, as of 2 pm ET, had not voted on the matter yet. It’s possible that the partisan nature of the spending bill will bleed into other pending legislation, but the extent of that remains to be seen. Keep an eye on your inbox tomorrow for updates.

The initiative, following directives from the Russian president, would permit a restricted group of investors to buy and sell digital currencies. Under the proposal , only “particularly qualified” investors — those with investments exceeding 100 million rubles in securities and deposits or an annual income above 50 million rubles — would be eligible. Additionally, corporate-qualified investors and financial organizations meeting regulatory standards could participate. The central bank will introduce specific risk-based requirements for financial institutions investing in cryptocurrency.

The Bank of Russia maintains that private cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and not backed by any jurisdiction. Investors would bear the risk of potential losses. The central bank continues to reject cryptocurrency as a means of payment and proposes banning crypto transactions between residents outside the EPR, with penalties for violations. However, all qualified investors would be allowed to invest in derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets linked to crypto value but not involving direct delivery of crypto assets.

33767162,[object Object],1741786251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"SEC Delays Spot XRP, Dogecoin, SOL And LTC ETFs—What’s Going On?",https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-spot-xrp-dogecoin-sol-ltc-etfs/,"A fresh wave of postponements has swept across the crypto market, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed decisions on a set of proposed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, and Litecoin. This latest move pushes back potential approval dates to May 2025 for various ETF applications, including those from VanEck, Canary, and Grayscale. XRP, Dogecoin, SOL And LTC ETFs Hit SEC Delay The agency states that it needs a longer review period without specific reason: “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” According to official documentation, the affected ETFs and revised target decision dates include VanEck Spot Solana ETF on May 19, 2025; Canary Spot Litecoin ETF on May 13, 2025; Canary Spot Solana ETF on May 19, 2025; Canary Spot XRP ETF on May 22, 2025; Canary Spot ADA ETF on May 29, 2025; Grayscale Spot XRP ETF on May 22, 2025; and Grayscale Spot Dogecoin ETF on May 21, 2025. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described these delays as standard procedure, stating in a X post, “Yes, the SEC just punted on a bunch of alt coin ETF filings including Litecoin, Solana, XRP & DOGE. It’s expected as this is standard procedure & Atkins hasn’t even been confirmed yet. This doesn’t change our (relatively high) odds of approval. Also note that the final deadlines aren’t until October for these.” Fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, reacting to the announcements, noted that “Eth staking and in-kind also delayed. Everything delayed. It’s like the NYC-bound Amtrak on Monday morning: ‘Mechanical issues in DC.’” Notably, Franklin Templeton has also stepped into the fray yesterday with a filing for its own spot XRP ETF. In a portion of its official submission, the asset manager—which oversees approximately $1.6 trillion—explained that “The Fund seeks to generally reflect the performance of the price of XRP.” In early December, the White House announced that pro-crypto businessman and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins would be nominated to serve as the commission’s next chair. Congress has not yet scheduled confirmation hearings, leaving the timeline for a permanent leadership transition equally unsettled. During this interim period, acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has proposed rolling back parts of a rule change that would have broadened oversight of alternative trading systems to include crypto firms, signaling that regulators themselves remain divided on how to handle the rapidly shifting digital asset environment. Meanwhile, odds of eventual approval for these proposed ETFs vary. Bloomberg’s ETF experts Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have projected a 90% approval likelihood for Litecoin, 75% for Dogecoin, and 70% for Solana, while XRP stands at 65%. At press time, XRP traded at $2.17.",Crypto News|Doge|dogecoin|Dogecoin ETF|Dogecoin news|litecoin|LTC|SEC|SOL|solana|Solana ETF|Solana news|XRP|XRP ETF|XRP news,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-12 13:30:51

Innovative, secure, and fitted with a selection of features most bank account holders will have never seen before. There’s a financial revolution upon us. By leveraging blockchain technology, crypto banks and deobanks are outpacing the innovation of traditional banks at an unprecedented rate. This leaves banking customers with two options: adapt and embrace the change, or get left behind with the soon-to-be-obsolete brick-and-mortar banks. What is a Crypto Bank? A crypto bank is a financial institution that integrates blockchain technology and digital assets into its core services. Unlike traditional banks, crypto banks offer a wide variety of decentralized financial tools, empowering users to manage, trade, and invest in cryptocurrencies alongside fiat currencies. While some operate within existing regulatory frameworks, others are pushing the boundaries towards more decentralized, user-controlled systems. Crypto banks have become the core component and leading disruptor of the evolving financial world. The new era of services includes crypto-backed loans, intelligent decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-custodial wallets with neat designs and empowering features, and new, streamlined options for interactions with merchants, friends, and more. The following list showcases five leading crypto banks that are actively driving change by tapping into the power of blockchain technology and decentralized systems. Transparent, user-centric, and efficient financial experiences are set to become the new norm. 1. WeFi (Upcoming) As the first true Deobank, WeFi will go beyond competing with crypto banks by pioneering an entirely new category of its own. A truly decentralized on-chain banking experience is going to put users firmly in control of their assets, while providing streamlined access to the DeFi world. In short, WeFi will set a new benchmark for financial freedom in the age of decentralization. Here are some key features for the upcoming product release: Choice of Custody: By offering both non-custodial and custodial accounts, WeFi will hand users the ultimate decision about the level of control they want to have over their accounts and digital assets. Unparalleled Transparency: Leveraging blockchain technology ensures that WeFi can make every transaction traceable and auditable, delivering the transparency that users demand and deserve, without sacrificing privacy. Deep DeFi Integration: By seamlessly connecting with yield farms, token staking opportunities, and DeFi governance mechanisms, all directly from a WeFi account, users will unlock the full force of decentralized finance. Crypto Card: WeFi card holders (both physical and virtual) are going to enjoy the flexibility of being able to spend their crypto assets in the real world without the tiresome process of liquidation or having to move funds around. WeFi will prove that it can break free from the constraints of traditional banking, neobanking, and crypto banking, to enter into a league of its own as the first Deobank. Offering faster and cheaper transactions completely on-chain, while also making a commitment to serve the unbanked and underbanked (a mission largely ignored by rivals), WeFi will put it in a very competitive position. 2. Revolut Revolut has carved out a niche for itself as a user-friendly digital banking platform, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world, successfully onboarding millions of global customers. Here’s what has made Revolut so popular: Wide Selection: With over 210 cryptocurrencies available directly in the app, Revolut has a good number of options for customers. Cashback: Revolut Pro account holders can earn a small cashback incentive of up to 1% for any business-related expenses. Competitive Rates: With strong exchange rates for both crypto and fiat currency exchanges, Revolut makes it easy for users to move quickly between asset classes. Despite its accessibility, Revolut ultimately operates as a custodial platform, meaning users must entrust their assets to the company and therefore lack true control over their digital wealth. This also means that Revolut's security vulnerabilities are passed on to all users, and that the platform also has the executive power to freeze or restrict accounts. 3. Crypto.com Crypto.com has become a household name through huge marketing campaigns, an all-in-one platform, one of the best crypto Visa card programs that bridges everyday spending, and arguably for its powerful name and branding. Why people choose Crypto.com: Cashback: Rewards are paid out for spending using your Crypto.com card, and are paid in Cronos (CRO), the platform’s native currency Staking: Crypto.com’s diverse staking program invites users to lock up their digital assets in exchange for healthy returns DeFi Services: Albeit in a custodial environment, Crypto.com app users will find various decentralized services for digital asset management Unfortunately, Crypto.com falls short for its limited transparency on internal operations and the fully custodial nature of its platform (there’s no non-custodial option). 4. Nexo Nexo has done well to position itself as a robust provider of crypto-backed lending and high-yield interest accounts, offering a number of traditional financial services that are boosted by blockchain technology. A recent rebrand and minimum deposit requirements to open an account have seen Nexo reposition itself as a service for elites, walking away from its previously inclusive messaging. The best features of Nexo: Credit Availability: Crypto credit lines allow users to leverage their crypto holdings as collateral to avoid needing to sell Earn Interest: Daily interest payouts on both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies incentivize long-term usage Nexo Card: Account holders don’t need to liquidate assets manually to spend them, with all the exchanges taking place automatically at the point of sale. Cashback rewards of up to 2% are also given. Loyalty: Users can hold the $NEXO token for additional benefits. While offering innovative financial products, Nexo's custodial model requires users to entrust their assets to the platform, sacrificing the autonomy and control that defines true decentralization. The company’s new image and minimum deposit have also seen the platform move further towards the centralized banking model. 5. Wirex Wirex aims to simplify crypto spending, providing an easy way for crypto owners to integrate digital assets into their everyday transactions. Wirex key features: Debit Card: Wirex’s crypto-enabled debit card allows for global spending Rewards: Up to 8% cashback has positioned Wirex as the go-to platform for people who like to spend big on card Selection: A modest selection of around 60 fiat and cryptocurrencies offers a manageable range of options for users While convenient and generous, Wirex is almost entirely reliant on traditional banking infrastructure and has failed to integrate key blockchain technologies or offer advanced DeFi features that improve customer autonomy. The Dawn of a New Financial Era These crypto banks offer more than just decentralized financial services, they’re offering a change of mindset. Align with them and you enter the future of finance. Stubbornly rebel, and you’ll watch everyone else move on without you. It’s a FOMO-inducing prospect. While Revolut, Crypto.com, Nexo, and Wirex have all made notable advancements in integrating crypto with traditional finance, it’s WeFi's clear commitment to decentralization, transparency, financial inclusion, user autonomy, and user empowerment that reinforces its status as a leader. It is setting the bar for the future of crypto banking. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Pepe ( PEPE ) jumped to a record high of $0.00002833 in December before crashing by over 80% this month. This retreat has mirrored the performance of other meme coins, whose prices have dropped by double digits from their 2024 highs. Pepe price has formed a falling wedge and a double bottom Technicals suggest that Pepe may be on the verge of a strong bullish breakout in the coming days or weeks. The daily chart shows that it has formed a falling wedge, a popular reversal pattern. This pattern consists of two descending and converging trendlines. The upper side of this wedge connects the highest swings since December, while the lower side connects the lower lows since November last year. Pepe’s price has also formed a giant double-bottom pattern at $0.0000060. A double bottom consists of two lower swings and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $0.00002830, representing its all-time high. The double-top level also coincides with the strong pivot and reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. The Relative Strength Index has continued rising and has just crossed the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since January—a sign that it has completed a bullish crossover pattern. Therefore, the Pepe coin price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next target being at $0.00002095, the highest swing on January 19, which is about 220% above the current level. A bearish breakout below the key support at $0.000002980, the weak stop and reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines, will invalidate the bullish view.

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, fell from 3.3% to 3.2%.

The open interest remains much lower than the year-to-date high of $556 million. Historically, big price gains start when the open interest is low.

Legal Expert Comments,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-end-soon-legal-expert-comments/,"TL;DR Lawyer Fred Rispoli hints at a deal between Ripple and the SEC before April 16. The former White House official Anthony Scaramucci recently claimed the regulator has already dropped the case against the crypto company. Resolution in the Next Few Weeks? Over the past several months, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) witnessed major leadership changes and dropped or paused numerous lawsuits against crypto businesses. However, the legal battle against Ripple remains ongoing. And while the exact date when the two sides will shake hands on a mutual agreement can’t be predicted , the popular lawyer Fred Rispoli suggested such a development might occur before April 16. This date marks Ripple’s scheduled filing of their appellate brief. Although there is no formal reason requiring it, it is reasonable to speculate that the SEC v. Ripple case is resolved–or at least something significant happens–before Ripple’s filing deadline of April 16, 2025. Let’s keep an eye on it…and hope. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) March 11, 2025 The assumption triggered heated discussion on X (formerly known as Twitter). One user claimed that the case has been over for weeks but the announcement is yet to be released. Rispoli agreed to that thesis, adding that such deals usually happen behind closed doors. Not long ago, Anthony Scaramucci took part in an interview during which he placed the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit among the ones the securities regulator has already dismissed. The host of the discussion – Scott Melker (known as The Wolf of All Streets) – shared the same viewpoint. XRP Bulls Await the News The eventual conclusion of the legal tussle is expected to cause enhanced volatility in the price of Ripple’s native token. A resolution that favors the company might propel a bull run for XRP, while the opposite scenario could result in a substantial downtrend. Developments in the lawsuit have historically triggered huge price swings for the asset. Other factors that may benefit the bulls include the overall market resurgence and the possible launch of a spot XRP ETF in America. The companies that have filed to introduce such an investment vehicle are Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Bitwise, and others. Most recently, Franklin Templeton also joined the list.

The firm is making a strategic investment of $16 million in Ethena and bought $20 million in USDe stablecoin to expand the adoption of synthetic dollars in decentralized finance (DeFi) and offer an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins, the statement said. The move comes after Ethena, the developer of USDe, raised $100 million last year , which was backed by Franklin Templeton and Fidelity Investments-affiliated F-Prime Capital, among others. Known as a synthetic stablecoin, USDe is unlike traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC in that it is not backed 1:1 by fiat assets. Instead, it maintains its peg by collateralizing stablecoins and taking futures positions with large open interest. USDe's market cap has risen to nearly $6 billion, while more traditional stablecoins currently have market caps above $50 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total market cap for stablecoins is currently above $200 billion. MEXC’s backing comes as competition in the stablecoin market intensifies, with projects seeking innovative models to ensure stability and accessibility. ""As demand for investment in bitcoin and other digital assets continues to rise, stablecoins are set to attract even greater investment,"" said Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC. ""MEXC sees Ethena as a key player in the development of diverse stablecoins that will drive the crypto industry forward, supporting broader adoption and providing users with more stable and efficient financial solutions.""

However, despite this rebound, a shocking trend is emerging, Bitcoin’s long-term growth rate has hit an all-time low. Meanwhile, the four-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) has dropped to just 8%, marking the first time it has ever fallen below 10%. Why Has Bitcoin’s Growth Slowed? In March 2021, Bitcoin was trading near $60,000, close to its peak for that market cycle. Since then, as Bitcoin has grown, its price swings have become less extreme, leading to a natural slowdown in its overall growth rate. Now, in March 2025, Bitcoin is hovering around $84,000, possibly marking the lowest point of this cycle. This decline isn’t unexpected , as Bitcoin’s market has become more stable compared to previous years when price movements were much wilder. Institutional Investors Are Changing the Game One reason for this increased stability is the growing presence of institutional investors. The launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also made investing easier and more regulated, reducing the extreme price swings seen in the past. Even though Bitcoin’s growth rate has slowed, institutional investors are still making gains. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment, for example, remains 18.9% profitable, despite suffering its worst weekly drop on March 10. A Pause or a New Phase for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s price growth has slowed, its potential as an investment remains strong. Some experts believe Bitcoin is entering a more stable phase, while others see this as a temporary slowdown before another major rally. Over the past two months, Bitcoin has dropped 22%, falling from over $106,000 to around $82,535. However, a recent 4% daily surge suggests a potential recovery. Bitcoin Price Analysis Despite the rebound, Bitcoin is struggling near the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key resistance level that could slow further gains. If Bitcoin manages to break above this level and build momentum, the next target would be $90,000, a price that previously acted as strong support.

This possibility and potential of the Bitcoin strategic reserve have seen a major tailwind as the new administration took charge in the US in January 2025. While gold has historically backed monetary systems and oil remains a key economic and security asset, Bitcoin represents a new kind of digital reserve that challenges traditional financial paradigms. The United States holds substantial reserves in gold and oil, but its Bitcoin holdings are comparatively small and primarily acquired through asset seizures. As of the third quarter of 2024, the US holds approximately 8,133.46 metric tons of gold, valued at around $789. 87 billion (on March 8, 2025), making it the largest sovereign holder of gold reserves. These reserves have historically been used as a hedge against economic uncertainty and to back the dollar before the gold standard was abandoned in 1971. In the case of oil, the US maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which, as of August 2024, holds around 372 million barrels. The SPR was established in the 1970s in response to the oil crisis and is valued at approximately $28 billion at current market prices. These reserves manage supply disruptions, control inflationary pressures, and stabilize energy markets during geopolitical crises. Bitcoin, unlike gold and oil, is not an official reserve asset, but the US government possesses a significant amount through confiscations . Estimates suggest the government controls roughly 200,000 BTC, worth around $15.90 billion at a Bitcoin price of $79,515 (as of March 10). However, unlike gold and oil, these holdings are not stored as strategic reserves but rather as assets pending auction or liquidation by the Department of Justice and the US Marshals Service. Liquidity and market dynamics of gold, oil and Bitcoin Gold, oil and Bitcoin each exhibit unique liquidity and market dynamics, with gold being the stablest, oil driven by geopolitical factors and Bitcoin characterized by high volatility and 24/7 accessibility. The depth of liquidity of an asset in a market is an extremely important indicator of the asset’s health. Typically, the higher the liquidity, the better the options investors have around pricing and risk management. Let’s understand how gold, oil and Bitcoin differ from each other in terms of liquidity and market dynamics: Gold: It remains one of the most liquid financial assets, with daily trading volumes exceeding $200 billion across futures markets, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Its deep liquidity and universal recognition make it a preferred asset for central banks, institutional investors and governments looking to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. While gold’s price varies, it has historically maintained lower volatility than most other assets. Oil: It is traded at immense volumes in both spot and futures markets, with daily future volumes reaching about 1 million barrels globally. Unlike gold, oil’s liquidity is largely tied to its industrial demand and geopolitical developments. The price of oil is highly sensitive to supply chain disruptions, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decisions and macroeconomic policies. Given its role in energy markets, oil volatility is much higher than gold, with price swings that can result from political instability, production cuts or major conflicts. Bitcoin: Bitcoin, despite being a relatively new asset, is highly liquid, with daily trading volumes often exceeding $30 billion–$50 billion across global exchanges. While BTC has gained legitimacy among institutional investors, it remains significantly more volatile than gold and oil due to speculative demand, regulatory uncertainty and market structure. Unlike gold and oil, Bitcoin operates on a 24/7 trading cycle, making it unique in terms of accessibility and global liquidity. Storage and security concerns for reserve assets Storage and security concerns are crucial for any reserve asset, with each asset presenting unique challenges and costs. Gold: It is typically stored in highly secure facilities such as Fort Knox, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other vaults worldwide. The cost of storing gold varies, but large-scale sovereign reserves require substantial security infrastructure, transportation costs and insurance. Additionally, physical gold is vulnerable to theft and requires constant auditing to ensure authenticity and weight accuracy. Plus, custody fees for institutions storing gold in vaults range from 0.10% to 0.50% per year, depending on the storage provider. Oil: Unlike gold and Bitcoin, oil presents logistical challenges as it must be stored in underground salt caverns, refineries or tanker fleets. The cost of maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve requires billions of dollars in infrastructure, maintenance and security. Moreover, oil storage is subject to depreciation due to environmental conditions, evaporation and contamination risks, making it more expensive to maintain than gold or Bitcoin. Bitcoin: Bitcoin storage differs fundamentally, as it is a digital asset . Governments and institutions typically use cold storage wallets and multisignature security to protect their holdings. While Bitcoin custody does not require physical storage facilities, cybersecurity risks such as hacking, private key mismanagement and regulatory oversight present major challenges. Institutional-grade custody solutions like BitGo, Fireblocks and Coinbase Custody charge anywhere from 0.05% to 0.25% per year, significantly lower than gold storage costs. However, the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions increases the risks associated with mismanagement or unauthorized access. Strategic and economic role of reserve assets Gold, oil and Bitcoin each play strategic roles in global economics, with gold as a hedge, oil influencing geopolitical stability , and Bitcoin emerging as a decentralized asset for inflation protection. All of these assets have gained strategic and macroeconomic significance over time. Their narrative with relevance to the broader capital markets is perhaps what is needed to drive investors’ interest. Gold: Gold’s strategic role in the global economy dates back thousands of years, serving as a universal store of value and a medium of exchange. The US formally tied its currency to gold in the Bretton Woods system (1944–1971), which established the dollar as the world’s reserve currency backed by gold. Even after the US abandoned the gold standard in 1971, gold remained a key strategic asset held by central banks worldwide as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. Oil: It has evolved into an indispensable economic and security asset, with its price fluctuations directly impacting inflation, consumer spending and geopolitical stability. The formation of OPEC in 1960 and the subsequent oil crises in the 1970s demonstrated oil’s ability to drive inflation and shape economic policy. The petrodollar system, in which oil transactions are settled in US dollars, has further solidified oil’s role in global finance, ensuring sustained demand for the dollar and influencing US foreign policy. Bitcoin: BTC’s potential as a reserve asset lies in its decentralized nature, fixed supply (21 million BTC) and resistance to monetary debasement. Unlike gold and oil, which require extensive infrastructure, Bitcoin can be transferred globally in minutes and stored at near-zero cost. As institutional adoption grows, Bitcoin’s strategic value as a hedge against inflation and government debt is increasingly recognized. The future of US government’s Bitcoin policy Policy moves suggest that the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve could position it alongside traditional assets like gold and oil in the future. In January 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Building upon this initiative, on March 7, President Trump signed another executive order to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “US Digital Asset Stockpile,” aiming to position the US as a leader in the cryptocurrency space . These reserves will be funded exclusively through cryptocurrencies seized during law enforcement operations, ensuring no taxpayer funds are utilized. However, the reserve will be funded using cryptocurrencies already held by the government, primarily obtained through asset forfeitures rather than through new government purchases. This strategy has had mixed reactions. While some view it as a positive step toward embracing digital assets, others express concern over the lack of new investments and the potential implications of using forfeited assets. As of March 10, 2025, Bitcoin’s value declined by more than 5% to approximately $79,515, reflecting market disappointment over the reserve’s funding approach. Looking ahead, the US government’s Bitcoin policy is likely to continue evolving. The Presidential Working Group is expected to provide recommendations by July 2025, which could influence future regulatory frameworks, investment strategies and the integration of digital assets into the broader financial system. As global interest in cryptocurrencies grows, the US may further refine its policies to balance innovation with security and economic stability alongside traditional assets such as gold and oil, which remain integral to the nation’s financial strategy.",US Bitcoin reserve|gold|oil,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-12 13:40:00

Comedian (BAN) If you're exploring the latest crypto coins, Comedian (BAN) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, drawing inspiration from Maurizio Cattelan's infamous artwork: a banana duct-taped to a wall.

Fun fact: The founder of the BAN token, Michael Bouhanna, is a digital art analyst at Sotheby's, adding an intriguing layer to the token's origin. While Comedian (BAN) offers a humorous take on the crypto market, investors should approach it with caution due to its speculative nature.

There are many new crypto coins coming out, but only a few actually make waves. Right now, one name is standing out in the crowd: $DAGZ. While others rely on hype, Dawgz AI brings staking, AI-powered trading, and real utility- a mix that’s got investors sniffing around for more. The Dawgz AI Takeover Forget meme coins that are all bark and no bite. Dawgz AI has: Over $2.6M raised in presale, with a price increase ahead. Staking rewards that let ETH holders earn passively. High-frequency AI trading working 24/7 to grow your bag. And let’s be honest; nothing beats making money while doing absolutely nothing. That’s what makes Dawgz AI a top contender in the meme coin space. Fun fact: Some of the biggest meme coins in history started as a joke until they made people millionaires. Other meme coins are popping up, but most lack a real reason to hold. Airdrops? Cool. Community hype? Great. But what happens after that? Without staking, AI trading, or real growth mechanics, most meme coins fizzle out fast. That’s why Dawgz AI is trending; it’s not just a meme, it’s a full-blown crypto project built for long-term gains . Conclusion Jumping into new crypto coins can feel like a gamble, but picking the right one makes all the difference. I’ve dabbled in plenty of meme coins, and most were just hype with no real reason to hold. That’s why Dawgz AI is special; it’s got staking rewards, AI-powered trading, and a presale that’s gaining serious traction.

Meanwhile, the SEC is reportedly dropping its case against crypto YouTuber Ian Balina over alleged securities law violations related to the promotion of SPRK tokens. This move follows a broader regulatory shift under the Trump administration, which has scaled back crypto enforcement actions. Additionally, the SEC is considering scrapping a proposed rule that would have expanded its oversight of crypto firms. Luxury Giant LVMH Accused of Patent Infringement Watch Skins Corporation filed a lawsuit against LVMH, accusing the luxury fashion giant of patent infringement over its NFT display technology for smartwatches. The complaint was submitted on March 10 in a Texas federal court, and alleges that LVMH misappropriated its proprietary system that enables users to showcase verified NFT artworks on smartwatches. Watch Skins claims to hold multiple patents related to this technology and argues that LVMH’s TAG Heuer smartwatch and other products from the company’s brands unlawfully integrated its patented innovations. One of the watches Watch Skins claimed infringed on its patent LVMH is a multinational conglomerate that owns luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, TAG Heuer, Tiffany, Christian Dior, Hennessy, and Moët & Chandon, and it is accused of infringing on three patents held by Watch Skins. According to the lawsuit, the first patent covers a system that verifies NFT ownership before allowing it to be displayed on a smartwatch face, the second focuses on a verification mechanism through a blockchain wallet, and the third relates to the retrieval and display of customized watch faces based on NFT ownership. The lawsuit also asserts that TAG Heuer encouraged customers to engage in patent infringement by providing instructions on how to use its NFT display features. The complaint points out that TAG Heuer’s smartwatch enables NFTs to be displayed only if they are linked to the user’s crypto wallet, ensuring the authenticity of the digital assets shown. Watch Skins is seeking a jury trial, financial compensation for lost profits and royalties, and a court order to prohibit LVMH from continuing to use the patented technology. Watch Skins has been a pioneer in the NFT smartwatch space, and launched the world’s first blockchain-based NFT watch face marketplace at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2020. The company’s mobile app allows users to purchase officially licensed smartwatch faces from popular brands, ensuring the authenticity of digital timepiece designs. SEC Drops Case Against Crypto YouTuber While LVMH’s legal troubles mount, Ian Balina , the CEO of Token Metrics and a popular crypto YouTuber, announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to drop its case against him over allegations of securities law violations related to the promotion of Sparkster (SPRK) tokens in 2018. During a recent interview , Balina said that the SEC informed him of its intention to recommend the court dismiss the lawsuit that was filed in 2022. The lawsuit accused him of engaging in an unregistered offering and promotion of SPRK tokens. Balina attributed this decision to the change in administration after the appointment of Mark Uyeda as acting SEC Chair by President Donald Trump after the departure of Gary Gensler in January. He suggested that the new administration is much more favorable toward the crypto industry. The SEC’s lawsuit against Balina alleged that he agreed to receive a 30% bonus on the $5 million worth of SPRK tokens he purchased during the initial coin offering but failed to disclose this to his audience. In May of 2024, a court ruled that SPRK tokens qualified as securities, falling under the SEC’s jurisdiction. At the time, Balina’s legal team announced plans to appeal, and a jury trial was initially scheduled for January of 2025 before being postponed. So far, no official filing has been made in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas requesting the case’s dismissal. Balina acknowledged the financial burden the lawsuit placed on him, and is very frustrated over the legal costs. If the SEC follows through with dropping the case, it will be one of several instances where the regulator recently pulled back on crypto-related enforcement actions. Since Trump took office in January, the SEC either ended or scaled down investigations into Robinhood Crypto, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea, Coinbase, Consensys, and Kraken. However, the commission is still engaged in a legal battle with Ripple. Although many people are happy with the regulatory shift, it also attracted a lot of criticism. Some suggest that the crypto industry leveraged political influence by supporting Trump’s presidential campaign and contributing to his inauguration fund. The White House even recently hosted a crypto summit , which was attended by executives from major crypto companies like Robinhood, Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken, all of whom have previously supported pro-crypto policies. SEC Considers Scrapping Controversial Crypto Rule The way the SEC handles regulation may change even more as the regulator may abandon a proposed rule change that would have required certain crypto firms to register as exchanges. At the Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers on March 10, Mark Uyeda revealed that he instructed SEC staff to explore options for scrapping the portion of the proposal that sought to expand the regulation of alternative trading systems to include cryptocurrency firms. He pointed out that there is overwhelming public opposition to the rule change, and stated that it was a mistake to conflate Treasury market regulation with an effort to tighten oversight of the crypto industry. The rule was originally introduced in 2020 under former SEC Chair Jay Clayton, and was designed to provide clearer regulatory guidelines for alternative trading systems, particularly those involved in US Treasury markets. However, when Gary Gensler took over as SEC Chair, the scope of the rule was broadened in 2022 to redefine the concept of an exchange. The revised definition included communication protocols without a clear explanation of what that term encompassed, effectively bringing a wide range of crypto-related platforms under the SEC’s regulatory purview. During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC took a very aggressive approach to crypto regulation by initiating more than 100 enforcement actions against various firms between 2021 and his resignation on Jan. 20 this year. On the same day, Donald Trump began his second term as US President. Trump previously stated that he planned to remove Gensler if elected. Since his departure, the SEC softened its stance on cryptocurrency by dropping multiple cases against firms. In addition to abandoning certain enforcement actions, the SEC also launched a crypto task force that is aimed at developing a regulatory framework for digital assets. This initiative is being led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has long advocated for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TOKEN SALE|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-12 13:41:29

Hyperliquid had to take over a 160,000 ETH position and start unwinding it, using the protocol’s own liquidity. A recent high-risk Ethereum (ETH) long position served as a stress test for Hyperliquid. A whale opened a large-scale position, liquidated a part of it in profit, and then let the position get liquidated. Hyperliquid had to take over the position at $1,915 per ETH, with the task of unwinding the entire 160,000 ETH. Due to market turbulence, Hyperliquid initially absorbed a floating loss of $4M. Hyperliquid protocol clarifies the liquidity drain is not an exploit The protocol denied the liquidation and liquidity drain to be a deliberate exploit or a hack. The trader simply used a high-risk strategy, which allowed him to be long on ETH for a little under an hour and lock in profits. After that, the trader let the position expire, while the DEX had to absorb losses. Regarding commentary and questions on the 0xf3f4 user's ETH long: To be clear: There was no protocol exploit or hack. This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h. HLP's… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 12, 2025 As a result, Hyperliquid will rethink its leverage levels for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), to discourage the high-risk strategy. As a final result, the whale walked out with $1.8M, while causing $4M unrealized losses for Hyperliquid and the task of unwinding the position. The funds to cover the position originated from a HyperLiquidity Provider (HLP) community vault, which earns from providing funding to other traders. Currently, the vault carries over $408M in liquidity, but the removal of the top whale position erased over $4.2M in PnL. The Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vault lost over $4.2M after the long liquidation. | Source: Hyperliquid Hyperliquid usually offers basic low leverage of 3-5X even for meme tokens, and competes with other exchanges by offering the riskiest trades. The decentralized market relies on community liquidity and decentralized vaults, hence the lack of regulation or a conservative approach to leverage. HLP vault took on bad debt The trader’s actions were seen as more than simple risk-taking. The strategic withdrawal of the margin collateral after less than an hour of trading meant the whale managed to achieve gains while leaving the bad debt to the exchange. In addition to the whale’s own actions, copy traders also took similar positions, with varying results. The whale’s long position on ETH was considered extremely risky and counter-intuitive, making use of the recent recovery from local lows. Hyperliquid reminded traders that joining the HLP pool to make passive income from traders is not a risk-free strategy. The vault still has over $60M in gains over its lifetime. The biggest fear for Hyperliquid is that the whale’s actions were deliberate, and were amplified by the involvement of copy-traders. For many analysts, the liquidation of a 160K ETH position was deliberate, aiming to cause the HLP vault to take over the toxic position. The initial withdrawal of the margin collateral also helped bring about the liquidation for the main trader and for anyone copying the position. The large long liquidation exploited the HLP vault. The liquidity pool works by distributing profits and losses to all participants, so now the liquidity providers would be saddled with the large-scale loss to cover the long position. There are also suspicions the whale may have also held a short position to benefit from the liquidation, though there were no known corresponding whales shorting ETH at that same moment. Reportedly, the trader used 13X to 19X leverage to maximize the early earnings. The whole operation was performed with $23M in underlying capital, though the final liquidation was for over $306M. Soon after the news of the large liquidation at the expense of the HLP pool, the native HYPE token lost up to 10% of its price in a temporary dip. HYPE fell toward $12.80 before recovering to $13.35. The high-level liquidation position also affected Ethereum (ETH). The asset fell to $1,915.83, around the levels where the large whale position was liquidated. The recent Hyperliquid risky trade may affect the larger crypto market, stopping the recent ETH rally above $2,000. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Gemini exchange has partnered with Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick to bring US dollar payment support for institutional clients in the UK and Switzerland, according to an announcement originally shared with Cointelegraph on March 12. This enabled institutions to deposit, withdraw, and trade directly in US dollars on the exchange, instead of having to convert to British pounds or Euros first. To enable instant deposits in dollars (even outside of normal banking hours), Gemini is using Bank Frick’s “xPulse” service.

Other exchanges have offered USD trading in Europe before (e.g., Coinbase in 2019 before discontinuing it in 2023), but it’s not widespread. Moreover, unlike other exchanges that rely on third-party partnerships to bring USD support to EU customers, Gemini is offering this service directly through its own licensed entities , which are authorized to handle electronic money (EMI licenses). “Unlike most CASPs [crypto asset service providers] that rely on partnerships for funding rails due to the lack of an EMI license, Jennings said, “our regulatory-first approach allows us to provide seamless funding solutions directly through our own EMI-licensed entities.” You might also like: Gemini, backed by Winklevoss twins, taps Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to explore IPO",News|Cryptocurrency|Gemini|USD,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-12 13:44:26

The plan would introduce an experimental legal regime (ELR) lasting three years wherein “particularly qualified” investors would be allowed to conduct cryptocurrency transactions, according to a statement from the central bank. To be considered “particularly qualified,” individual investors would need to have over 100 million rubles ($1.14 million) in investments or an annual income exceeding 50 million rubles ($570,000). Institutions recognized as qualified investors would also be able to trade cryptocurrency. The initiative aims to establish standards for crypto-related services and increase market transparency while expanding investment opportunities for “experienced investors willing to assume higher risks.” The Bank of Russia repeated its warnings about the volatility and risks of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing that they are not backed by any jurisdiction. In line with its stance, the central bank proposed banning cryptocurrency transactions between residents outside the ELR and enforcing penalties for violations. Beyond direct cryptocurrency trading, the Bank of Russia plans to allow qualified investors to access derivatives and securities linked to digital assets, provided they do not involve direct cryptocurrency ownership. The move is Russia’s latest foray into the cryptocurrency space. Last year, the country’s lower house of the Federal Assembly, the State Duma, passed two bills legalizing cryptocurrency mining and bringing in an experimental regime on cross-border settlements and exchange trading in digital currency. The country’s central bank is looking to get its largest banks to support a digital ruble for retail and commercial use later this year. The country has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. and Europe after its invasion of Ukraine, and the central bank digital currency is seen as a way to circumvent the financial restrictions it’s facing. Back in 2021, the Bank of Russia said that the ruble-backed central bank digital currency could be used as a tool against sanctions.

Notably, many market watchers deem the current surge due to the upcoming Pi Day optimism, with many anticipating a flurry of announcements during this time. Besides, the anticipation of a potential Pi Coin’s Binance listing has further bolstered market confidence. Pi Network Soars 20%: What’s Next? Pi Coin value today was up over 23% and exchanged hands at $1.67, while its trading volume soared 62% to $747 million. Notably, the crypto has touched a high of $1.74 in the last 24 hours, recovering from its one-day low of $1.35. Besides, the surge comes amid rumors of an impending price-pegging mechanism of Pi on the blockchain. The community recently discovered a smart contract code linked to Chainlink, referencing Pi Coin. The price-pegging mechanism is expected to bring stability to Pi’s value, further fueling investor enthusiasm. Although there is no official confirmation, a recent Pi price analysis hints at a potential rally to $5 ahead. Pi Day Fuels Excitement Pi Network’s recent rally has sparked optimism across the crypto community. Many attribute the surge to growing anticipation ahead of Pi Day, which falls on March 14. Crypto analyst Moon Jeff highlighted Pi’s strong $1.3 support level, predicting a price jump to $5 if momentum holds, echoing a similar sentiment to CoinGape’s price analysis. Meanwhile, crypto exchange HTX also teased its followers with Pi-related posts, fueling speculation about a major announcement. In an X post, HTX stated, “Two days to go! How should we celebrate Pi Day?” This cryptic message has left many wondering whether a new listing or partnership is on the horizon. Here’s What To Expect On Pi Day Pi is rapidly building its decentralized ecosystem, with over 100 decentralized applications (dApps) reportedly in development. A Pi Coin enthusiast on X, The Times of PiNetwork, expressed excitement about upcoming upgrades, stating, “Pi Network is preparing to unveil 100+ dApps, enhancing the coin’s real-world utility.” Pi’s growing ecosystem has positioned it as a potential game-changer in the Web3 space. With 65 million active users and over 150 million app downloads, its adoption rate surpasses many established cryptocurrencies. Enthusiasts believe this could lead to mainstream recognition and utility-driven price stability. Global Impact & Future Outlook Of Pi Network Pi Network’s unique approach to mining has drawn global attention. Unlike Bitcoin, which requires high energy consumption, Pi Coin can be mined on mobile devices, making it more accessible. The project has already KYC-verified nearly 20 million users, setting a record in the crypto industry. As Pi Day approaches, investors and enthusiasts eagerly await official announcements. If Pi Network delivers on its promises, its price momentum could extend beyond March 14. Another key driver behind Pi Coin’s bullish momentum is speculation surrounding a potential Binance listing. Pi is already available on several major exchanges, including OKX, MEXC, and Bitget. However, a Binance listing would significantly boost liquidity and exposure. If Binance confirms a listing on Pi Day, as many anticipate, the crypto could see an explosive rally in the coming weeks.

The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers are in, and they’re painting a picture that could bring a sigh of relief to the volatile world of digital assets. For months, inflation has been the buzzword spooking traditional and crypto markets alike. But could we finally be seeing a turning point? Let’s dive deep into the February CPI data and explore what this economic heartbeat means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the CPI: Inflation’s Latest Chapter The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics dropped the February CPI report, and the numbers are generating significant buzz. Here’s the headline: the **CPI** rose 2.8% year-over-year. While any increase might sound alarming, it’s crucial to understand the context. This 2.8% figure is actually below the 2.9% economists predicted, according to Investing.com. In the world of economic forecasting, even a 0.1% difference can be a big deal, signaling potential shifts in broader economic trends. Let’s break down the key figures: Year-over-year CPI: 2.8% (Expected: 2.9%) – This is the main inflation gauge, comparing prices to the same month last year. Monthly CPI: 0.2% (Expected: 0.3%, Previous month: 0.5%) – This shows the price change from January to February, indicating a slowing monthly increase. Year-over-year Core CPI (excluding food and energy): 3.1% (Expected: 3.2%) – Core CPI strips out volatile food and energy prices to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. Monthly Core CPI: 0.2% (Expected: 0.3%) – Similar to monthly CPI, core CPI also shows a slower pace of increase compared to expectations. In essence, across the board, the CPI data for February came in slightly cooler than anticipated. But what does this mean in plain English? Why is CPI Data a Big Deal? Understanding Inflation’s Impact You might be wondering, “Why should I, as a crypto investor, care about the **CPI**?” The answer lies in the intricate dance between inflation, interest rates, and market sentiment. Inflation, at its core, erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies like the US dollar. When inflation is high, your dollars buy less. To combat this, central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), often raise interest rates. Higher interest rates can have a ripple effect: Increased Borrowing Costs: Loans become more expensive for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing down economic activity. Attractiveness of Savings: Higher interest rates make saving more appealing compared to riskier investments like stocks and, yes, cryptocurrencies. Dollar Strength: Higher rates can attract foreign investment, strengthening the US dollar. Conversely, when inflation shows signs of cooling, as indicated by the latest CPI report, it can suggest that the Fed might become less aggressive in raising interest rates, or even consider pausing or reversing rate hikes in the future. This shift in **interest rates** expectations can be a powerful catalyst for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Market Expectations vs. Reality: CPI Surprise and Crypto’s Reaction The financial markets are forward-looking beasts. They thrive on anticipating future trends. Leading up to the CPI release, the market consensus, or **market expectations**, was for a slightly higher inflation reading. When the actual CPI data came in lower, it created a positive surprise. This surprise can trigger significant market reactions. So, how did the crypto market react to this CPI data surprise? Initial Price Jump: Typically, when inflation data is softer than expected, we often see a knee-jerk reaction in crypto prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the bellwethers of the crypto market, often experience upward movement as traders anticipate a less hawkish stance from the Fed. Altcoin Rally Potential: If the positive sentiment sustains, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) can also benefit, sometimes experiencing even more pronounced percentage gains than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Risk-On Mood: Lower-than-expected inflation can foster a “risk-on” mood in the broader market. Investors become more willing to allocate capital to riskier assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, moving away from safer havens like bonds or cash. However, it’s crucial to remember that market reactions are often short-lived and influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just one CPI report. Sustained positive momentum requires continued favorable economic data and evolving central bank communication. Navigating Crypto Markets in an Evolving Inflation Landscape The February CPI data is undoubtedly a welcome sign for those hoping for a less restrictive monetary policy. But is this the all-clear signal for crypto markets to surge to new all-time highs? Probably not just yet. Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate the crypto landscape in this evolving **inflation** environment: Don’t Get Carried Away by One Data Point: While encouraging, one month’s CPI data doesn’t guarantee a sustained downtrend in inflation. Monitor upcoming economic releases, including future CPI reports, jobs data, and GDP growth, to get a more comprehensive picture. Pay Attention to the Fed’s Response: The Federal Reserve’s reaction to this CPI data is paramount. Listen closely to speeches and official statements from Fed officials to gauge their evolving stance on interest rates. Are they hinting at a pause in rate hikes? Or are they still emphasizing the need to combat inflation aggressively? Consider Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the inherent volatility of crypto markets and the uncertainty surrounding the inflation trajectory, dollar-cost averaging can be a prudent strategy. Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, smoothing out the impact of price fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one crypto basket. Diversify your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and potentially even traditional assets to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: The crypto market is incredibly dynamic and influenced by global economic events. Stay updated on the latest news and analysis from reputable sources to make informed investment decisions. The Road Ahead: Cautious Optimism for Crypto? The February CPI report offers a glimmer of hope that **inflation** may be moderating. This is potentially good news for crypto markets, as it could pave the way for a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. However, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. One month of data doesn’t define a trend, and the fight against inflation is far from over. For crypto investors, the key takeaway is to remain vigilant, stay informed, and manage risk responsibly. The path forward may still be bumpy, but the latest CPI data injects a dose of cautious optimism into the crypto narrative. Keep your eyes peeled on future economic indicators and Fed pronouncements – the story of inflation and its impact on crypto is still unfolding.

With its vibrant community, strong tokenomics, and an undeniable meme appeal, the AI meme coin isn’t just leading the wave, setting the stage for an explosive surge FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Signals Big Run Ahead FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a meme coin that is now part of the cryptocurrencies that have the impact of Matt Furie. Like Matt Furie’s PEPE the Frog, FloppyPepe (FPPE) aims to increase the reach of art and spread its influence in the crypto community. The AI meme coin is working hard to create AI tools to improve art and meme culture. One of the tools is the Meme-o-Matic AI machine recently launched on Telegram. This tool has taken the market by storm, introducing a unique function of converting texts into images, allowing users to create memes through text prompts. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) team specifically designed the AI tool to be easy to use, as it will allow tons of people with creative ideas to come up with entertaining memes. Moreover, Floppy X is another AI machine from FloppyPepe (FPPE) set to lead the market. This AI tool helps to create videos from text/ image prompts making it easier to make viral content from anything. By using AI technology to make the meme coin space more interesting, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is drawing new and existing meme coin enthusiasts and, at the same time, cementing its place in the ever-growing billion-dollar AI crypto market. The meme coin will also collaborate with leading artists to release regular hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe art. With a big opportunity for explosive growth ahead of FloppyPepe (FPPE), its community size is growing exponentially, and its presale is recording massive numbers. With an attractive market price of $0.0000002, FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale has raised close to $900,000 in less than a week, showing huge market interest. Analysts are bullish that with the token’s offerings and positive influence, investors are looking to get up to 700% in profit as the AI meme coin is set to mirror PEPE’s 700% year-to-date rally. PEPE Success That Set Precedence In The Market PEPE the Frog is one of the first Matt Furie-inspired tokens. The meme coin’s market performance since its debut reflects positively on the influence of Matt, the legendary and visionary artist behind iconic internet memes. In 2021, Pepe (PEPE) soared astronomically. However, its success didn't stop there, as its year-to-date rally sits comfortably at 700%. This is in contrast to meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have been battling a serious decline over the years, making PEPE the standout meme coin in the market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Loses Market Position Shiba Inu's (SHIB) current run in the crypto market is disappointing. Over the past four weeks, its green days have been stuck below 13 out of 30. With the upcoming listing of FloppyPepe (FPPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) may soon lose its position on this AI meme coin. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to rally 700%, mirroring PEPE’s year-to-date uptick. This potential increase will make it outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB). As Shiba Inu (SHIB) declines with no rebound expected soon, investors are moving to more lucrative and stable options in the market. Conclusion FloppyPepe (FPPE) is undoubtedly a highly promising meme coin ahead of Shiba Inu (SHIB), as its utilities are about to evolve the meme coin community. While it is set to mirror PEPE’s 700% to-date rally, it is equally on course to surpass its 2021 historic pump. With deflationary tokenomics that burns 1% of every transaction, FloppyPepe (FPPE) will have a better long-term value than Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Additionally, a successful audit of FloppyPepe's (FPPE) smart contract by SolidProof improves the confidence of market bulls. Its private presale round set a new benchmark in the market with over $1 million raised in 24hrs. Analysts believe the current presale round offers investors a once-in-a-life opportunity to achieve maximum returns, as the AI crypto is set to eclipse PEPE’s 700% YTD rally.

This time, it’s not about user privacy or antitrust concerns, but something deeply rooted in the age of artificial intelligence: AI copyright lawsuit . In France, a coalition of powerful publishers is accusing Meta of what they term ‘economic parasitism’ – essentially, leeching off their creative work to fuel its AI engines. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, where data ownership and digital rights are paramount, this case is a crucial indicator of the battles ahead in the AI era. Let’s dive into the details of this landmark case and explore what it means for the future of content and AI. Why is Meta Facing an AI Copyright Lawsuit in France? The heart of the matter lies in the training of Meta’s sophisticated AI models, including Llama. To make these models ‘intelligent,’ they need vast amounts of data to learn from. The lawsuit alleges that Meta has been using copyrighted content from French publishers – articles, books, and other literary works – without proper authorization to train these models. This is not just a minor oversight; French publishers, represented by the National Publishing Union (SNE), the National Union of Authors and Composers (SNAC), and the Society of People of Letters (SGDL), view this as a fundamental violation of their intellectual property rights. Here’s a breakdown of the core accusations: Unlawful Training Data: The publishers assert that Meta has been using their protected content as training data for its large language models without obtaining licenses or permissions. Economic Parasitism: This strong term, used by the plaintiffs, underscores their belief that Meta is unfairly benefiting economically from content they have not paid for. They argue Meta is building valuable AI products on the back of their creative work without fair compensation. Copyright Infringement: At its core, the lawsuit is a claim of copyright infringement. Publishers believe their rights to control the use and distribution of their content have been violated. Maia Bensimon, the general delegate of SNAC, didn’t mince words, describing Meta’s actions as ‘monumental looting.’ This strong rhetoric highlights the deep sense of injustice felt by the publishing industry. The David vs. Goliath Battle: French Publishers vs. Tech Giant Meta Renaud Lefebvre, the director general of SNE, aptly framed this legal challenge as a ‘David versus Goliath battle.’ This isn’t just a simple commercial dispute; it’s a clash between traditional media institutions and a tech behemoth. The publishers, while united, are facing a company with immense resources and legal firepower. This framing resonates deeply, especially in a world where concerns about the power of Big Tech are increasingly prevalent. What are the potential implications of this lawsuit? Precedent Setting: This case could set a significant precedent in France and potentially across Europe regarding AI copyright and the use of copyrighted material for AI training. A ruling in favor of publishers could force AI companies to rethink their data acquisition strategies. Financial Repercussions: If Meta loses, it could face substantial financial penalties and be required to pay licensing fees for using copyrighted content in AI training going forward. Impact on AI Development: A win for publishers might lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny over how AI models are trained, potentially slowing down or increasing the cost of AI development. Global Ramifications: Given that Meta is also facing similar litigation in the U.S., the French case adds to the mounting legal pressure on the company regarding AI and copyright. The outcomes of these cases could have global ramifications for the tech industry. AI Training Data: The New Gold Rush and the Copyright Question The fuel that powers today’s cutting-edge AI models is data. Vast datasets are essential for training these models to perform complex tasks, from understanding language to generating images. This has led to what some are calling a ‘data gold rush.’ However, this rush is raising critical questions about the source and legality of this AI training data . Key questions emerging from this debate include: Fair Use vs. Copyright Infringement: Is using copyrighted material for AI training considered ‘fair use,’ similar to how snippets of text might be used in search results? Or does it constitute copyright infringement requiring explicit permission? Transparency and Consent: Should AI companies be more transparent about the data they use for training? Should they be required to obtain consent from copyright holders? Compensation for Creators: If AI companies profit from models trained on copyrighted content, should creators be compensated? How would such a compensation system work? The Future of Content Creation: How will these legal battles shape the future of content creation and the relationship between AI and human creators? Will it foster a more equitable ecosystem or stifle innovation? The French lawsuit against Meta is not an isolated incident. It reflects a growing tension between the rapid advancement of AI and the existing legal frameworks designed to protect intellectual property. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into our lives, these legal and ethical questions surrounding publisher rights and data usage will only become more critical. What Does This Mean for the Crypto and Blockchain World? You might be wondering, what does an AI copyright lawsuit in France have to do with the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain? The connection is more profound than you might initially think. Here’s why this case matters to the crypto community: Data Ownership and Rights: The core principles of blockchain and crypto often revolve around decentralization and individual data ownership. This lawsuit highlights the broader debate about who owns and controls data in the digital age. If publishers can successfully assert their copyright over training data, it reinforces the importance of data rights, a concept central to many blockchain projects. AI and Decentralization: As AI becomes more powerful, the question of its governance and control becomes crucial. Decentralized AI initiatives are emerging, aiming to distribute AI power and prevent concentration in the hands of a few large corporations. The outcome of copyright battles like this could influence the trajectory of decentralized AI development. NFTs and Content Monetization: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) offer new ways for creators to monetize their digital content and assert ownership. The discussions around AI copyright could indirectly impact the value and utility of NFTs in the content creation space. If copyright is strongly enforced in the AI context, it might strengthen the argument for using NFTs to manage and protect digital intellectual property. Smart Contracts and Licensing: Smart contracts could potentially play a role in automating and streamlining the licensing of content for AI training. If regulations require AI companies to obtain licenses, blockchain-based systems could offer efficient and transparent solutions for managing these agreements and ensuring fair compensation for creators. In essence, the Meta France AI lawsuit is a microcosm of the larger challenges and opportunities presented by the intersection of AI, copyright, and digital rights. It’s a wake-up call for all stakeholders in the digital ecosystem, including the crypto community, to pay close attention to how these issues are resolved. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI and Copyright The legal battle between French publishers and Meta is just the beginning. As AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into every aspect of our lives, we can expect to see more such clashes over Meta lawsuit and copyright. The outcomes of these cases will shape the future landscape of AI development, content creation, and digital rights. Key takeaways to consider: Increased Scrutiny of AI Data Practices: AI companies will likely face increased scrutiny regarding their data sourcing and training practices. Transparency and ethical data handling will become even more critical. Evolving Legal Frameworks: Copyright laws may need to adapt to the realities of AI and large language models. Legislators and courts will grapple with defining the boundaries of fair use and copyright infringement in the AI age. Collaboration and Dialogue: Finding a sustainable path forward will require collaboration and dialogue between AI companies, content creators, policymakers, and the public. Striking a balance between fostering AI innovation and protecting creators’ rights is essential. Empowering Creators: Ultimately, the goal should be to create a system that empowers creators and ensures they are fairly compensated for their work in the AI era. This could involve new licensing models, technological solutions, and policy frameworks. The urgent clash between Meta and French publishers is a pivotal moment in the ongoing conversation about AI, copyright, and the future of digital content. It’s a story that will continue to unfold, with significant implications for the tech world, the creative industries, and everyone navigating the rapidly evolving digital landscape.

41539942,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710777,1741788024,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Over—It’s Just Changing, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-run-isnt-over-its-just-changing/,"In a period marked by extraordinary polarization, market participants find themselves torn between two opposing camps: one steadfastly predicting that the current dip is merely a setup for an impending altcoin rally, and the other resolute that the broader crypto bull run has already reached its conclusion. In a post on X, Koroush Khaneghah, Founder of Zero Complexity Trading, stated, “Right now is the most divided timeline I’ve ever seen. Bulls believe this is the last dip before an Altseason. Bears think bull run is over.” According to Khaneghah, “It’s becoming more challenging to ‘predict’ cycle stages as crypto matures.” He highlights developments that did not appear in previous cycles, including a shift from a traditional altseason to a memecoin season, Ethereum (ETH) still not breaking its all-time highs, and Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing its ATH and moving beyond $100K+ (an outcome absent in earlier cycles) Two Scenarios For Crypto 1. This Cycle Is Different From Others Khaneghah points to growing institutional involvement—an element noticeably absent in earlier bull markets. He cites data suggesting that BlackRock is currently holding nearly $52 billion worth of BTC (via Arkham). In his view, this significantly boosts the long-term buy pressure for Bitcoin, leading to potentially shallower pullbacks since “institutions will keep buying.” Related Reading: Economic Turmoil: Crypto Market Loses 25% Of Value As Recession Worries Mount Because of heightened institutional interest, Khaneghah expects BTC dominance to continue rising. This dynamic could change how capital rotates into altcoins: “In this cycle, altcoins have seen Capital Dispersion. Meaning, more assets are in the market and liquidity is spread across multiple sectors, stopping any ONE sector from pumping hard.” He contrasts the memecoin market with DeFi. In the previous cycle, the memecoin market was roughly half the size of DeFi. In this cycle, memecoin market capitalization has equaled that of DeFi. If this scenario holds, Khaneghah believes BTC will remain the focal point for major moves while altcoins experience more fragmented, micro bull runs. “This means previous bull run playbooks won’t apply and you simply have to trade rotations,” he notes. 2. The Bull Run Is Not Over Khaneghah observes that BTC has only run 1.6x above the previous cycle highs before pulling back, calling it “not what a normal blow-off top/bubble looks like.” From a historical standpoint, BTC has frequently retraced by 40-50% from its ATH prior to surging higher. In the current cycle, BTC has only retraced about 26% from its peak, suggesting the possibility of more upside if past patterns repeat. A common bull-run trigger, according to many analysts, is ETH surpassing its prior cycle high—something yet to occur, given that ETH has not yet breached $4,000. Khaneghah posits that this lag might indicate a delayed altseason and a much longer overall cycle than expected. Related Reading: White House Summit: Trump Reaffirms Commitment To Making America The Crypto Capital For altcoins to regain momentum, Khaneghah sees the ETH/BTC pair as a critical indicator. A bottom in ETH/BTC, combined with a rotation of capital from memecoins into other utility sectors such as DeFi and RWA (Real World Assets), could reignite altcoin rallies. Khaneghah concludes that traders need not be fixated on either the bull or bear side: “If you’re a trader, you don’t have to marry a bias or commit to scenario 1 or 2. If BTC dominance continues, trade BTC by longing strength and shorting weakness. -If alts start to bottom, shift capital there and buy the strongest coins.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,786.

SOL whales have begun to exit their position in the formerly promising asset as they begin turning their investments toward a new stealth competitor which is establishing its market position. Traditional price trend analysis of Solana continues as the primary focus while new stories highlight an innovative ERC20 coin which brings a disruptive fresh approach to digital payments and asset utility. Solana Price Prediction And What This Means For Short-term SOL Prices Current Solana Price Prediction models paint a sobering picture for SOL. The crypto token Solana sells for $125 at present which represents a major decrease compared to its peak values during earlier in January this year. The token's market capitalization experienced a 38% decrease during the recent month and trading volumes remain volatile because investors show rising caution. Solana faces an uncertain future according to analysts because its scalability problems and loss of investor faith could push down its Solana Price Prediction for the next quarter. The market rose by 15% after Trump declared on March 2 that SOL would be added to the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve . However, the crypto market began showing significant instability after then due to the unimpressive aftermath of the US crypto summit. Multiple market analysts have reported shifting trader sentiments because some bearish analysts Solana price predictions expect SOL to reach $80. The top SOL holders have decided to transfer their investment funds into promising new altcoins such as Remittix. The market conditions remain unpredictable for traders who focus on short-term SOL investments. The $140.62 SOL prediction value for April 9 shows potential yet decreasing daily address activity on the network suggests reasons for caution. The price appreciation of Solana faces possible restrictions due to market competition and price instability. Investors must assess these developments with high levels of attention as alternatives like Remittix are creeping up. Remittix Boasts Impressive Market Dynamics Capable Of Rivalling Solana In 2025 Investor attention toward Remittix has surged rapidly despite the low enthusiasm for Solana. This new contender has entered the crypto scene as the best crypto to buy while remaining a low-cap gem. The Defi company, Remittix, focuses on solving essential problems in cross-border remittance transfers and crypto-to-FIAT conversions. The technology base of this system has been optimized for rapid and efficient operations to deliver an entirely dissimilar value proposition than conventional blockchain protocols. Analysis of this disruptive asset reveals that its market price stands at $0.0734 as market interest about it continues to rise. The early presale rounds attracted substantial capital inflows amounting to $13.8 as at today March 11, 2025. Remittix shows promising growth potential because it has an intuitive platform based on innovative technology. Solana May Not Have The Spark Remittix Investors Have Been Promised; PayFi Coin ready To Surge To $2 Remittix appeals to users because it connects established financial networks with distributed systems. The combination of its comprehensive compliance structure together with its strategic merchant partnerships creates a solid platform for quick large-scale implementation. The current Solana Price Prediction trends show negative short-term potential but forward-thinking innovations like Remittix are reshaping the future of digital payments. Investors seeking to benefit from the upcoming breakthrough can seize the emerging Remittix opportunity which presents both remarkable potential and a perfect timing to reshape digital finance operations in our current fast-moving economy.

At its current price of about $0.0734, RTX is expected to climb to $7 in the next quarter, which may lead it to surpass existing cryptocurrencies Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). Cardano (ADA): Steady Progress Amidst Market Fluctuations The Cardano blockchain network developed its scalability features while working on connecting different networks. ADA traded at $0.7210 during March 11, 2025 following a 4% market recovery from its 7% value decrease on the preceding day. Various analysts predict ADA will increase to $1.70 soon due to technological upgrades and growing market interest. Analysts predict ADA might reach $8 during the upcoming market cycle because they believe in its significant future growth potential. ADA's smart contract functionality, which allows developers to construct decentralized applications (dApps), is a fundamental element that enhances its growth potential. The expansion of the ecosystem progresses as new projects and strategic partnerships establish more substantial market presence. Cardano remains prominent in the market, but its growth may not soon achieve the same explosive potential as that of RTX. Ripple (XRP): Navigating Regulatory Challenges Ripple’s XRP ledger system completed more than 70 million transactions to establish itself as reliable and scalable technology with robust stability. XRP maintains its value at $2.12 because it faces strong influence from institutions adopting its technology with ongoing regulatory changes affecting the market. The future market value of XRP could reach $8 if regulatory authorities approve its usage and the platform attracts additional users according to market predictions. The price trajectory of XRP faces potential disruptions from unresolved legal challenges. Ripple’s network continues to lead cross-border payment solutions while financial institutions investigate its underlying technology despite facing regulatory challenges. XRP has the potential for substantial price growth if Ripple addresses its regulatory issues. XRP faces potential long-term competition challenges against RTX's revolutionary remittance practices. Remittix (RTX): A Disruptive Force in Remittances Remittix uses blockchain technology to deliver faster and more affordable cross-border transactions than those provided by conventional financial systems. RTX targets inefficiencies within existing remittance services to create a seamless user experience worldwide. Early-stage buyers of RTX tokens during the ongoing presale have capitalized on the low entry price of $0.0734, which has attracted substantial interest. The robust investor interest demonstrates strong belief in Remittix's ability to revolutionize the remittance market. RTX stands to secure a significant portion of the international remittance market because it provides users with cost-effective and efficient money transfer solutions. In contrast, global remittance volumes exceed $700 billion each year. RTX provides almost immediate transaction processing times while maintaining fees that are much lower than those of traditional payment systems. The platform transforms the industry by removing intermediary roles and using decentralized blockchain technology. RTX will likely achieve its $7 price point through ongoing expansion and key strategic partnerships. RTX’s Path to a $7 Valuation Investor interest combined with greater adoption and supportive market circumstances drives the expected price increase for RTX. The sale of more than 450 million RTX tokens during the presale phase reveals strong market confidence in RTX’s future potential. The demand for RTX tokens should grow significantly due to increased adoption and more financial institutions adopting RTX’s blockchain-based remittance services. RTX holds negotiations with significant payment providers to incorporate its technology into current remittance networks, which will likely boost adoption. The upcoming crypto bull run and growing institutional demand for blockchain financial solutions place RTX in an ideal position for rapid growth. Conclusion Aiming to revolutionize cross-border payments, Remittix emerges as an essential player in the cryptocurrency market. The $7 price prediction demonstrates its ability to surpass well-known competitors, including Cardano and Ripple. RTX is the top investment choice due to its practical application, successful presale results, and global expansion strategy. As ADA and XRP progress and provide market value, RTX distinguishes itself with its revolutionary remittance solutions which attract investors looking for rapid growth potential. RTX stands to gain the most during the upcoming cryptocurrency bull run while providing early adopters with remarkable investment returns.

The community is divided on the likelihood of an early settlement of the case. Meanwhile, experts unveil five potential outcomes for the Ripple vs SEC case, fueling further debate. Let’s break down the potential outcomes of the XRP lawsuit and their implications for the Ripple ecosystem. XRP Lawsuit Resolution: Things To Know Though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed several crypto lawsuits over the past few weeks, the settlement of the Ripple case remains uncertain. Experts argue that an early settlement is unlikely to happen. All Things XRP, a leading XRP advocacy platform on X, outlined five potential scenarios for the lawsuit’s resolution, providing more clarity to the matter. In an X post , All Things XRP unveiled five possible outcomes for the protracted XRP lawsuit. These include the SEC dropping its appeal, a reduced penalty, the appeal court reversing the decision, the fine being upheld but the injunction lifted, and the SEC completely dropping the case. Each outcome has a different likelihood of happening, ranging from 15% to 35%. Will US SEC Withdraw Appeal in the Ripple vs SEC Case? Aligning with many expert predictions, All Things XRP highlighted the possibility that the SEC might withdraw its appeal under new leadership, potentially paving the way for a resolution in the Ripple case. However, the XRP advocate added that the existing $125 million fine and the injunction on institutional XRP sales, as ruled by Judge Torres, would still be in place. Experts consider this outcome plausible, with a likelihood of 35%, as policy shifts are possible, but the injunction’s persistence complicates the situation. Reduced Penalty and Court Decision Reversal As All Things XRP noted, there’s a 30% chance that Ripple could negotiate a reduced penalty with the SEC. For example, the $125 million fine could be lowered to $75 million as part of a potential settlement. However, here too, the injunction remains a significant obstacle, as dissolving it would require court approval. The analyst suggested that Paul Atkins, once confirmed as SEC Chair, might advocate for this approach. Interestingly, there is also a possibility of overturning Judge Analisa Torres’ XRP ruling, but with only 20% likelihood. The analyst predicted that the Second Circuit might uphold the SEC’s appeal, classifying programmatic XRP sales as securities under the Howey Test. This could lead to a hefty fine of over $500 million and an expanded injunction. Prominent legal experts like Jeremy Hogan and MetaLawMan pointed out these intricacies as major obstacles to the lawsuit’s early end. XRP Lawsuit Conclusion: Can Injunction be Lifted with Fine Upheld? According to All Things XRP, Ripple’s cross-appeal could ultimately uphold the $125 million fine imposed by Judge Torres. In addition, Ripple may convince the court to drop the injunction if it shows there’s no ongoing securities law violations. Notably, this would pave the way for institutional sales to resume. With a 25% likelihood, this outcome hinges on Ripple’s argument impressing the court and tackling the injunction’s concerns. SEC To Abandon the Ripple vs SEC Case With the least probability, the SEC might abandon its case against Ripple, effectively nullifying the $125 million fine and seeking court approval to dissolve the injunction. This outcome, though unlikely, could emerge amidst a broader deregulatory shift. But it would still require court approval, making its likelihood a mere 15%. Recently, lawyer Jeremy Hogan commented that a March resolution is possible in the XRP lawsuit with the injunction concerns dealt with later.

The decision to retract tariffs on Canadian metals came after Canada’s announcement that it wouldn’t go ahead with its plan of retaliating against the US. Canada had earlier decided to impose a 25% tax on the electricity it sells to the US. Moreover, a meeting has been scheduled for Thursday with the agenda of reaffirming the trade pact between the US, Canada, and Mexico. This could also be a good sign for the crypto economy, seeing as Trump’s tariff announcements were one of the biggest catalysts in driving down crypto prices. The Crypto Market Is Currently in a Correction – And It’s Healthy Glassnode, an onchain analytics firm, reported that the current selling pressure in $BTC is being driven by ‘top buyers.’ These are investors who bought the cryptocurrency at the $109K high. The ongoing panic selling might suggest otherwise, but the truth is that this is how markets move – fleshed-out periods of downward/sideways movement after a long rally. Correction, in other words. Although we’re seeing short-term investors liquidating $BTC to cover even riskier leveraged bets, long-term bulls (institutions, people like Michael Saylor, and even entire countries like El Salvador) are buying more and not sweating the monthly price action. One look at Bitcoin’s weekly chart and there’s hardly any arguing about crypto’s overall bullish outlook. $BTC is currently showing as many as three prominent bullish signs: Good support at the 50% Fibonacci level Even better support on the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average). This is a strong confluence. It’s forming a textbook-perfect hammer candlestick pattern, which is typically associated with market bottoms. Once everyone gets the liquidity they need, $BTC will be used as a hedge, alongside gold, real estate, and other safe commodities. This means now’s a great time to beef up your crypto portfolio with some fundamentally strong tokens that can ride Bitcoin’s upcoming rally. In this article, we’ve highlighted a few of the best cryptos you should consider purchasing. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy to Get Behind Bitcoin’s Growth Although Trump’s recent tariff announcements might have been the reason Bitcoin slid further down, a deep correction after such a long rally was always on the cards. You can rest assured that Bitcoin will get a breather sooner rather than later, following which we can see heavy accumulation zones acting as demand zones and shooting $BTC to new highs. Now is therefore the best time to back Bitcoin’s fundamentally strong narrative and invest in a coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . After all, it’s the first-ever and the only meme coin that gives free (and real) $BTC to token holders. These giveaways (via airdrops) will take place every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. By linking its $BTC airdrops to the underlying crypto’s price, BTC Bull Token has more or less ensured its place among the top trending cryptos . All you have to do to claim your $BTC rewards is hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet – one of the best crypto wallets going around. Additionally, there will also be regular token burn events, ensuring $BTCBULL never falls out of favor with the market. The BTC Bull Token presale is currently live and thriving, having already raised over $3.5M. You can buy 1 $BTCBULL for just $0.002405. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Crypto of the Best Wallet App There’s a reason crypto projects like BTC Bull Token have opted for Best Wallet as their crypto wallet of choice. That’s because it’s extremely secure and easy to use, as well as laced with features that were so far unheard of in the crypto space. Thanks to its comprehensive suite of features, Best Wallet is on its way to capturing over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026. Luckily for smart crypto investors like you, the app has a native token – Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . For instance, it’s the only crypto wallet that allows its users to buy meme coin presales directly from within the app. Combined with the fact that an in-house security team evaluates every single token, you’ll not only benefit from increased convenience but also security – no more worrying about scam tokens or phishing websites. Investing in the $BEST presale won’t just put you in a pole position to benefit from Best Wallet’s growth, but it also comes with a few special perks. These include lower transaction fees and higher staking rewards, as well as the earliest access to high-potential presales. You can become an early investor in Best Wallet by buying $BEST for just $0.0243. The project has so far piled close to $11M, which is proof of the potential it has. 3. XRP ($XRP) – Crypto Focused On Financial Transactions 2025 has brought about a new dawn for XRP. First, the SEC removed its long-drawn lawsuit on the crypto from its website, hinting at the possibility of XRP finally gaining regulatory clarity. Bitwise CEO Matt Hougan said yesterday that once the lawsuit is officially dropped (or settled), XRP could rope in more institutional partnerships and expand its application in cross-border payments. This will then increase investor interest in the token and result in a significant price appreciation. $XRP is currently trading at $2.18 , making it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . It’s also worth noting that XRP is one of the five cryptocurrencies to be included in the US Crypto Reserve announced by the POTUS Donald Trump himself. The announcement resulted in a whopping 30% increase in XRP’s price, following which it overtook $USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Conclusion Trump taking his foot off the tariff pedal could just be the first sign of him feeling the heat of a potential recession. Even though it’s positive news, the market has a long way to go before the possibility of a recession is completely behind it. This means that while both the best cryptos and stocks are currently available at massive discounts as we’re comfortably in ‘buy the dip’ territory, you must exercise extreme caution while investing. We urge you to do your own research before investing because the markets are highly volatile.
