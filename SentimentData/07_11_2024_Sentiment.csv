In a series of posts on X on Wednesday, November 6, Kang asserted that NEIRO is poised for exponential growth in the coming months. Better Than Dogecoin? “With a Trump win, NEIRO as the natural successor to Doge is on a path to billions over the next few months,” Kang wrote. He further elaborated, “Hard to think of better coins to hold post a Trump/Elon win than NEIRO. As the natural successor to Doge, its path to a Doge/Shib like run and eventual flippening debates are pre-ordained. Doge is great, but new dogs are even better.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Kang was among the first industry experts to designate Dogecoin as the premier “Trump trade” in the crypto market—a strategy for investors betting on a Trump victory. On October 15, he noted: “One of the most interesting ways to express a ‘Trump Victory’ trade would probably be owning DOGE (and other memes). Not only do you have high odds of a Doge ETF but the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would be making headlines every week and be pushed forward by Trump.” This perspective gained traction among several crypto analysts who identified Dogecoin as the leading proxy for anticipating a Trump win. The association stems from Elon Musk’s proposal to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.) under a Trump administration to reduce the bloated US government spending. Since Kang’s initial post on October 15, the Dogecoin price has surged by over 70%, climbing from $0.1158 to above $0.20 at press time. In contrast, NEIRO experienced a significant downturn of approximately 22% during the same period. After reaching its all-time high of $0.002333 on October 15, NEIRO dipped but has recently shown signs of recovery, rising 42% in the last 48 hours to trade at $0.001786. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge Kang’s endorsement of NEIRO has sparked a debate within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Crypto Stream (@CryptoStreamHub) questioned the trend of industry leaders promoting meme coins, commenting under Kang’s post: “When did it become normalized for the industry leaders to shill Memecoins, honest question? Raoul Pal started, yesterday I heard Arthur Hayes shill GOAT and now Kang is shilling NEIRO. Not wanna criticize that, I genuinely wonder when we made the pivot.” Another analyst, CryptoGugu (@Silivabrota), expressed skepticism about NEIRO’s potential and warned of an underlying market manipulation: “Guys please stop comparing NEIRO with DOGE. DOGE is the real deal NEIRO looking more like a liquidity grab scheme right now. Since the mm has been replaced chart looking awful. Mm only going up and down chasing liquidity, whales only dumping. Something needs to change asap or NEIRO will continue bleeding.” At press time, NEIRO traded at $0.001786.

With a remarkable rally surpassing $75,000, Bitcoin is experiencing considerable momentum, driven primarily by market sentiment surrounding the US elections. A crypto analyst who had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s rise to $75,000 has now set a new price target for the pioneer cryptocurrency, anticipating further bullish movement. Analyst Set $170,000 Price ATH For The Bitcoin Price TradingShot, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has released a brief Bitcoin analysis report, referencing historical trends to predict a new all-time high of $170,000 for Bitcoin. Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from 2022 to the present, the analyst disclosed that on August 5, Bitcoin was testing the 1-week Moving Average (MA50), a level that has never been reached since March 12, 2003. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? In previous market cycles, this crucial level was the absolute supporting trendline that signaled a potential bull market. TradingShot revealed that after almost 20 years, the Bitcoin price was finally able to hold this key trendline not once but twice, leading to its last-week rally that saw its price testing the $73,800 mark. The analyst also highlighted that this price surge was an incredibly bullish move, indicating a strong market for Bitcoin. Moreover, the $73,800 Bitcoin price increase occurred just two days before the US Presidential elections, a period historically known to trigger explosive rallies for Bitcoin. Market expert Crypto Rover on X (formerly Twitter) notes that Bitcoin has experienced a total average price pump of 1,563% following the previous US elections. In 2016, Bitcoin rallied 2,714%, exceeding $15,000 after the US Presidential elections. Similarly, in 2020, the cryptocurrency soared over 400%, surpassing $40,000 after the elections. Now, Bitcoin is clearly on a significant uptrend after the just-concluded US presidential elections on November 4. Given the timing of these rallies, TradingShot has suggested that a similar pattern may be repeating, implying that Bitcoin could be entering a period of explosive growth. Based on chart analysis and Fibonacci levels, the analyst has projected a new target of $170,000 for Bitcoin, representing approximately 1.618 Fibonacci extensions from its current ATH. With the Bitcoin price currently trading at $73,715, having given up some gains, a surge to $170,000 would represent a 130,55% increase. BTC Finally Hits Anticipated Price Discovery With Bitcoin finally reaching a new ATH after months of speculation and anticipation, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has disclosed that this surge signals the cryptocurrency’s entry into its price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought A Bitcoin price discovery refers to how the market determines the current value or price based on supply and demand dynamics. Despite the new achievement, Martinez has revealed that investors are attempting to short Bitcoin by liquidating their holdings and cashing out profits. As a result, the analyst predicts that if Bitcoin goes back to the $75,550 price high, $210 million could be liquidated from the market.
