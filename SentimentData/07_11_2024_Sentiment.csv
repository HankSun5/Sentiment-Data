In a series of posts on X on Wednesday, November 6, Kang asserted that NEIRO is poised for exponential growth in the coming months. Better Than Dogecoin? “With a Trump win, NEIRO as the natural successor to Doge is on a path to billions over the next few months,” Kang wrote. He further elaborated, “Hard to think of better coins to hold post a Trump/Elon win than NEIRO. As the natural successor to Doge, its path to a Doge/Shib like run and eventual flippening debates are pre-ordained. Doge is great, but new dogs are even better.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Kang was among the first industry experts to designate Dogecoin as the premier “Trump trade” in the crypto market—a strategy for investors betting on a Trump victory. On October 15, he noted: “One of the most interesting ways to express a ‘Trump Victory’ trade would probably be owning DOGE (and other memes). Not only do you have high odds of a Doge ETF but the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would be making headlines every week and be pushed forward by Trump.” This perspective gained traction among several crypto analysts who identified Dogecoin as the leading proxy for anticipating a Trump win. The association stems from Elon Musk’s proposal to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.) under a Trump administration to reduce the bloated US government spending. Since Kang’s initial post on October 15, the Dogecoin price has surged by over 70%, climbing from $0.1158 to above $0.20 at press time. In contrast, NEIRO experienced a significant downturn of approximately 22% during the same period. After reaching its all-time high of $0.002333 on October 15, NEIRO dipped but has recently shown signs of recovery, rising 42% in the last 48 hours to trade at $0.001786. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge Kang’s endorsement of NEIRO has sparked a debate within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Crypto Stream (@CryptoStreamHub) questioned the trend of industry leaders promoting meme coins, commenting under Kang’s post: “When did it become normalized for the industry leaders to shill Memecoins, honest question? Raoul Pal started, yesterday I heard Arthur Hayes shill GOAT and now Kang is shilling NEIRO. Not wanna criticize that, I genuinely wonder when we made the pivot.” Another analyst, CryptoGugu (@Silivabrota), expressed skepticism about NEIRO’s potential and warned of an underlying market manipulation: “Guys please stop comparing NEIRO with DOGE. DOGE is the real deal NEIRO looking more like a liquidity grab scheme right now. Since the mm has been replaced chart looking awful. Mm only going up and down chasing liquidity, whales only dumping. Something needs to change asap or NEIRO will continue bleeding.” At press time, NEIRO traded at $0.001786.

With a remarkable rally surpassing $75,000, Bitcoin is experiencing considerable momentum, driven primarily by market sentiment surrounding the US elections. A crypto analyst who had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s rise to $75,000 has now set a new price target for the pioneer cryptocurrency, anticipating further bullish movement. Analyst Set $170,000 Price ATH For The Bitcoin Price TradingShot, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has released a brief Bitcoin analysis report, referencing historical trends to predict a new all-time high of $170,000 for Bitcoin. Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from 2022 to the present, the analyst disclosed that on August 5, Bitcoin was testing the 1-week Moving Average (MA50), a level that has never been reached since March 12, 2003. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? In previous market cycles, this crucial level was the absolute supporting trendline that signaled a potential bull market. TradingShot revealed that after almost 20 years, the Bitcoin price was finally able to hold this key trendline not once but twice, leading to its last-week rally that saw its price testing the $73,800 mark. The analyst also highlighted that this price surge was an incredibly bullish move, indicating a strong market for Bitcoin. Moreover, the $73,800 Bitcoin price increase occurred just two days before the US Presidential elections, a period historically known to trigger explosive rallies for Bitcoin. Market expert Crypto Rover on X (formerly Twitter) notes that Bitcoin has experienced a total average price pump of 1,563% following the previous US elections. In 2016, Bitcoin rallied 2,714%, exceeding $15,000 after the US Presidential elections. Similarly, in 2020, the cryptocurrency soared over 400%, surpassing $40,000 after the elections. Now, Bitcoin is clearly on a significant uptrend after the just-concluded US presidential elections on November 4. Given the timing of these rallies, TradingShot has suggested that a similar pattern may be repeating, implying that Bitcoin could be entering a period of explosive growth. Based on chart analysis and Fibonacci levels, the analyst has projected a new target of $170,000 for Bitcoin, representing approximately 1.618 Fibonacci extensions from its current ATH. With the Bitcoin price currently trading at $73,715, having given up some gains, a surge to $170,000 would represent a 130,55% increase. BTC Finally Hits Anticipated Price Discovery With Bitcoin finally reaching a new ATH after months of speculation and anticipation, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has disclosed that this surge signals the cryptocurrency’s entry into its price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought A Bitcoin price discovery refers to how the market determines the current value or price based on supply and demand dynamics. Despite the new achievement, Martinez has revealed that investors are attempting to short Bitcoin by liquidating their holdings and cashing out profits. As a result, the analyst predicts that if Bitcoin goes back to the $75,550 price high, $210 million could be liquidated from the market.

Despite this rally, ETH still trades below a crucial resistance level, keeping the price in check since early August. This resistance, a critical barrier, must be cleared for Ethereum to regain its bullish momentum fully. Analysts are watching closely, with top crypto expert Inmortal sharing a recent technical analysis that suggests Ethereum could be gearing up for a significant breakout. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst According to Inmortal’s analysis, ETH appears to be building strength, and a push above this resistance could unlock the potential for a sustained rally. The market’s response to Trump’s win, particularly as he is seen as a pro-crypto candidate, has boosted sentiment, and many now anticipate increased volatility and upside for Ethereum. Investors are now eyeing ETH’s next moves, with any break above the current resistance likely to signal the beginning of a stronger upward trend. As Ethereum inches closer to this key level, market participants are preparing for what could be a defining moment in ETH’s performance this cycle. Ethereum Pushing Key Supply Ethereum is pushing to break a critical resistance at $2,750, a level that has kept ETH under pressure since early August. This resistance has been a strong barrier; breaking above it is essential for confirming a sustained rally. Top crypto analyst and investor Immortal recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, where he outlined a $3,400 price target for ETH if it successfully clears this key resistance. In his analysis, Inmortal emphasized that Ethereum, often dubbed the “most hated coin” in the current market, is worth paying close attention to despite its recent underperformance. Many investors have expressed frustration with ETH’s lagging momentum compared to other assets, making a breakout above $2,750 a potential game-changer for sentiment and price action. The coming days will be pivotal as the market digests the impact of Donald Trump’s election victory and prepares for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. Trump’s win has already created bullish momentum across the crypto market, and Ethereum’s breakout could capitalize on this shift in sentiment. However, volatility may remain high, and any unexpected news from the Fed could impact ETH’s trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? If ETH can hold above $2,750 and continue pushing higher, the $3,400 target outlined by Inmortal could come within reach, marking a strong recovery phase for Ethereum. For now, the crypto community will be watching closely, as this breakout level can potentially define Ethereum’s performance in the months ahead. ETH Technical Analysis Ethereum is trading at $2,620 after a solid 12% surge from recent lows at $2,355. This price movement has given bulls hope that a rally may be on the horizon. However, ETH must break above the key $2,750 resistance level for the bullish momentum to continue and reclaim price action. This level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), a crucial indicator of long-term strength. A breakout above this level and a successful retest would signal a market sentiment shift, confirming that ETH is on track to regain bullish control. The 200-day EMA is often viewed as a significant support level once the price holds above it. If Ethereum manages to close above this level and maintain the price, it could spark further upside movement. On the other hand, if Ethereum fails to break above $2,750 and struggles to hold, it would signal a failed breakout.

Bulls must remain vigilant as the coming days will be critical for confirming Ethereum’s next move.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $75,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise above the $76,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Extends Rally Bitcoin price started a fresh surge above the $73,500 level. BTC even cleared the $75,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $76,457 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $76,000 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $72,747 swing low to the $76,457 high. However, the price is still in a positive zone above the $73,500 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $74,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $75,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $75,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $76,000 level. A clear move above the $76,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $76,500. A close above the $76,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $78,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $78,800 resistance level. Are Dips Supported In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $76,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $75,250 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $74,150 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $72,747 swing low to the $76,457 high. The next support is now near the $73,500 zone.

The price is trading above $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,730 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it settles above $2,850 and $2,880. Ethereum Price Extends Surge Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,550 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $2,550 and $2,650 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. It even surged above the $2,720 level in the past few sessions, beating BTC.

As a result, most of the market saw a green daily close, with Solana (SOL) recording a 15.8% surge in the last 24 hours and regaining a key support level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gearing Up For Massive Bullish Wave Following 8% Daily Surge, 110% Rally Ahead? Solana Dethrones BNB As 4th Largest Crypto The result of the US elections gave the crypto market the long-awaited boost many investors and market watchers expected. In the early hours of Wednesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surged about 8.6% toward its new ATH of $75,358. This surge, fueled by the victory of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump and a mostly crypto-friendly Congress over US Vice President Kamala Harris, ignited a bullish rally across the market. Solana followed BTC’s lead and jumped over 15% to turn the $180 level into support. Moreover, the cryptocurrency reached its highest price since July, nearing the $190 resistance level. SOL’s daily activity skyrocketed in the last 24 hours, rising 210% to a $10.7 billion daily trading volume. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency saw a 14.66% increase in market capitalization, surging to an $88.1 billion market cap. As a result, Solana flipped Binance Coin (BNB)’s $85 billion market cap, dethroning BNB as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by this metric. This performance fueled investors’ bullish sentiment on the cryptocurrency, with some market watchers predicting a bullish wave towards Q1’s highs. Is SOL Getting Ready For $400? Solana was deemed one of the strongest cryptocurrencies during Q3’s market retraces, holding above its breakout levels while most altcoins struggled. Following last night’s performance, crypto Trader Koz called SOL’s chart “one of the absolute best-looking charts out there.” The cryptocurrency’s surge above the $180 mark represents a breakout from an 8-month consolidation range that started after Solana hit its yearly high of $202. Similarly, World of Charts considers SOL as ‘looking more bullish than before.” The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency finally broke above the upper line of a bullish flag pattern after nearly breaking above it in late October. World of Charts suggested that after the successful breakout, a massive bullish wave is around the corner. To the analyst, this wave could ultimately send Solana’s price toward a new ATH of $400. Moreover, crypto analyst Jelle highlighted the breakout, stating that SOL is ready to retest the yearly highs. Related Reading: PolitiFi Memecoins Soar: Trump-Themed Tokens Rally 30% Ahead Of US Elections A reclaim of the $200 mark, not seen since March, could propel the cryptocurrency above its ATH of $260 in the coming weeks. However, it is key that Solana holds the $180 mark to continue its bullish ascend, as a rejection from this zone could see SOL’s price pullback to the $160 support. SOL trades at $186.9, a 4.12% and 27.56% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

The first major resistance is near the $0.5650 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5720. A clear move above the $0.5720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.5920 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5580 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5500 level. The next major support is near the $0.5450 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5450 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5350 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5220 zone.

This surge in price has raised hopes that Ethereum may be gearing up for a fresh bull run. However, this optimism is tempered by cautionary notes from market analysts who closely observe the stance of Ethereum’s futures market. Related Reading: Ethereum Volatility Soon? Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits Rising Futures Metrics: A Double-Edged Sword According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, key metrics such as the Ethereum futures market’s open interest and funding rates indicate heightened participation and a generally positive market sentiment. The open interest reflects the total number of outstanding futures contracts, while funding rates provide insight into the cost of holding a long or short position. Shayan pointed out that these indicators have steadily risen in recent weeks, suggesting a renewed interest in Ethereum trading. This increase in participation aligns with the broader price movements and highlights a growing enthusiasm among futures traders betting on Ethereum’s continued upward momentum. However, while increased participation and positive funding rates often indicate a strong market, they also come with inherent risks. Shayan emphasized that although neither metric has reached levels that would be considered dangerously high, there remains a potential for heightened volatility. Overly high optimism in the futures market could lead to an imbalance, making Ethereum vulnerable to sudden and severe price swings. The CryptoQuant analyst explained that a sudden spike in open interest and funding rates might trigger what is known as a “long liquidation cascade.” This occurs when leveraged traders are forced to sell their positions due to adverse price movements, which can lead to a sharp decline in market value. Such liquidations can quickly erode investor confidence and drive prices lower. Regardless, the analyst suggested that the current open interest levels and funding rates suggest there is still room for growth. Navigating Potential Ethereum Volatility Given the current market conditions, Shayan offered prudent advice to Ethereum market participants. He recommended that investors closely monitor open interest and funding rates as key market sentiment indicators. According to the analyst, by keeping a watchful eye on these metrics, investors can better manage their risk exposure and be prepared for any sudden changes in the market.

So far, the asset’s value has seen a nearly 10% spike in the past day before experiencing a slight correction, trading at $74,037 at the time of writing—a decline of approximately 1.1% from its peak earlier today. The dramatic price increase has prompted widespread discussion within the cryptocurrency community, with prominent analysts offering their insights on the next move of Bitcoin.

CryptoBullet, a well-known market analyst on X, focused on Bitcoin’s dominance index (BTC.D) about a technical indicator called the TD Sequential. In a recent post on X, the analyst wrote, “Is BTC Dominance finally topping out? BTC.D is printing the second TD-9 Sell on the 2W timeframe this cycle.” The TD Sequential is a technical analysis tool used to identify potential trend reversals. According to CryptoBullet, the current cycle shows similarities to previous years, where a second TD-9 signal often marks a significant reversal. He highlighted past patterns from 2018, 2019, and 2021, suggesting that a similar trend could unfold in 2024, with Bitcoin dominance potentially nearing its peak.

However, he noted that a sustained close above $75,400 could negate this bearish outlook and potentially push Bitcoin’s price to a new high of $78,000.

This on-chain metric measures whether Bitcoin is undervalued or overvalued relative to its historical price levels. According to MAC.D, the MVRV ratio suggests that Bitcoin has not yet reached an “overheating stage,” indicating further upside potential.

Analysts are now projecting that Bitcoin could reach new heights of $100,000 before the presidential inauguration, which is just over two months away. Trump’s Election Signals Shift Toward Pro-Crypto Policies With Trump’s administration firmly established, CNBC reports that Bitcoin has already reached an all-time high of $75,500, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment starting in 2025. The combination of Republican control of both the Senate and the White House is expected to bolster support for Trump’s pro-crypto initiatives, leading to further price discovery for the market’s biggest digital asset. Related Reading: Uniswap Surges Toward $8.74 – Can UNI Push Through To New Heights? Trump has made several key promises that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape. One of the most notable is the establishment of a national Bitcoin stockpile, positioning the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” He has also committed to ensuring that all future Bitcoin mined in the country contributes to this national reserve. Moreover, Trump has vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the current chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who has faced criticism for his aggressive regulatory approach under the Biden administration. Gensler’s tenure has seen numerous lawsuits targeting major players in the crypto space, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple Labs, resulting in nearly half a billion dollars in legal fees for those companies. Trump’s proposed crypto policy is designed to stimulate growth and adoption within the United States, with Bitcoin positioned as a central element in his strategy to tackle the national debt, which currently stands at $36 trillion. His administration’s plans have been echoed by pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, who introduced legislation to designate Bitcoin as a national reserve asset. This initiative was discussed during her remarks at the 2024 National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where Trump also made a notable appearance, further solidifying his commitment to the sector. Bitcoin On Track For $100,000 Given these developments, CNBC notes that “multiple analysts” are forecasting Bitcoin could reach the $100,000 mark before Trump’s inauguration, especially if he follows through with his promise to create a national Bitcoin stockpile. The US government already possesses over $15 billion in Bitcoin from asset seizures over the years, providing a solid foundation for this initiative. In addition to Bitcoin’s rally, stocks of US-based firms such as Coinbase and Robinhood have seen significant gains in recent days. Coinbase (COIN) shares surged by 25.73%, while Robinhood (HOOD) jumped nearly 18%, reflecting the industry’s renewed confidence in a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Jumps 10%+: Is More Upside Ahead? Research from Cooper Research aligns with these optimistic projections, particularly regarding the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. The firm previously estimated that ETFs could manage nearly 1 million Bitcoins by the time of the election, and currently hold approximately 986,000 BTC. Their analysis suggests that if trends continue, Bitcoin could indeed reach $100,000 by January 20, when Trump is set to be inaugurated, especially if ETFs increase their holdings to around 1.1 million BTC. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $74,750, having retreated from its current record high of $75,500 set during Wednesday’s trading session.

Scheduled for 2:00 PM ET are both the Fed Interest Rate Decision and the FOMC Statement, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference following at 2:30 PM ET. These events are poised to have significant implications for cryptocurrencies and broader financial markets. What The Crypto Market Can Expect Market participants overwhelmingly anticipate a rate cut. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, 97.5% expect the Federal Reserve to implement a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut. This expectation aligns with recent economic indicators and reflects a consensus that the Fed will continue its cautious monetary easing. “The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points at the November 7 meeting. This aligns with market expectations and follows a weaker-than-expected nonfarm payroll report,” Althea Spinozzi, Head of Fixed Income Strategy at Saxo Bank, notes. Related Reading: ‘Crypto Has Already Won’, Regardless Of Trump Or Harris Win: Bitwise CIO The Fed is likely to maintain a measured approach, emphasizing gradual rate cuts over abrupt policy shifts. Chair Powell is expected to underscore a data-dependent and restrained policy stance, focusing on the nuanced dynamics of the current economic landscape. Spinozzi adds, “The Fed is likely to continue its measured approach, emphasizing gradual rate cuts rather than drastic policy shifts. Chair Jerome Powell is expected to highlight a data-dependent and restrained policy stance.” While headline inflation appears to be easing, core components suggest persistent pressures. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.4% year-over-year in September, the lowest since February 2021. However, critical sectors like shelter and services continue to see elevated prices. Shelter prices are up 4.9% year-over-year, and services excluding energy rose by 4.7%. “The core PCE inflation rate—a key Fed measure—has stabilized at an annualized 2.3% over both three- and six-month averages but continues to run above the Fed’s 2% target,” Spinozzi highlights. Persistent inflation in these sectors could exert upward pressure on overall inflation, complicating the Fed’s efforts to achieve its target. The labor market remains robust despite recent disruptions from hurricanes and strikes. The unemployment rate stands firm at 4.1%, and temporary layoffs have declined in October. Wage growth is showing signs of cooling; the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for Q3 surprised to the downside at 0.8% quarter-over-quarter, the softest since Q2 2021. Year-over-year, the ECI remains elevated at 3.9%, significantly above the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) average of 2.16%. Weekly jobless claims are also well below the post-GFC average, indicating sustained labor market strength. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run Overall, the US economy has exhibited unexpected robustness. Third-quarter GDP grew by 2.8% annualized, and personal consumption rose by 3.7%, the strongest quarter since early 2023. However, concerns about the sustainability of this growth persist. Real disposable income has softened, and household savings are declining, potentially limiting future consumer spending. Adding to the complexity is the US presidential election. The victory by Donald Trump could significantly influence fiscal policies, thereby impacting the Fed’s longer-term rate path. “The Federal Reserve will be mindful of how its actions and commentary could influence financial markets that may already be experiencing quite volatile conditions,” James Knightley, Chief International Economist at ING, remarks. For crypto traders, Jerome Powell’s commentary during the FOMC press conference on anticipated inflationary effects stemming from the Trump election is the key focus. Experts expect that the Trump presidency could lead to policies that underpin inflation, such as tax cuts and increased fiscal spending, potentially forcing the Fed to keep rates elevated. Despite the political backdrop, the Fed is expected to proceed with the rate cut. ING analysts suggest, “Even after September’s 50bp rate cut, monetary policy is in restrictive territory, and the Fed has scope to keep cutting rates back to a more neutral level to give the economy a little more breathing space to continue growing strongly.” The current target range for the Fed funds rate is 4.75% to 5%, well above the estimated “neutral” level of 3% to 3.5%. The consensus is that the Fed has room to normalize its policy, especially with the labor market cooling. The crypto market will be closely monitoring not just the rate decision—which appears largely priced in—but also the Fed’s commentary on inflation, economic growth, and the potential impacts of the presidential election. Any indications from Chair Powell regarding future policy shifts could have significant implications for the Bitcoin and crypto markets. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $75,080.

Legendary Trader Reveals,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/how-high-can-bitcoin-go-in-2025-legendary-trader/,"Legendary trader Peter Brandt, with nearly five decades of experience in trading since 1975, has shared a bullish forecast for the Bitcoin price trajectory in 2025. Taking to X, Brandt stated: “Bitcoin $BTC is now in the sweet spot of the bull market halving cycle that should top in the $130k to $150K range next Aug/Sep. I measure cycles differently than most.” How High Can Bitcoin Go In 2025? Brandt’s analysis is rooted in the historical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s halving cycles. His chart, covering Bitcoin’s price action from early 2022 with projections into 2026, highlights two significant periods of 518 days each. These periods represent critical phases in Bitcoin’s market behavior, representing the cyclical nature of its price movements. A notable technical pattern identified in his chart is the breakout from a broadening wedge. This formation, characterized by diverging support and resistance lines, suggests increasing market volatility as prices make progressively higher highs and lower lows. The successful breakout from this pattern is considered a strong bullish signal. Related Reading: CNBC Projects Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Before Presidential Inauguration – Details In a detailed blog post from June titled “The Beautiful Symmetry of Past Bitcoin Bull Market Cycles,” Brandt elaborated on the significance of halving events. He observed that the halving dates have “represented the half-way points of past bull market cycles,” showing an almost perfect symmetry within these cycles. Specifically, the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle to the halving dates has been nearly equal to the number of weeks from the halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs. Based on this symmetrical pattern, Brandt posits that if the sequence continues, “the next bull market cycle high should occur in late Aug/early Sep 2025.” He suggests that the highs of past bull markets align well with an inverted parabolic curve, and if this tendency persists, “the high of this bull market cycle could be in the $130,000 to $150,000 range.” Related Reading: Economist Predicts ‘Blow-Off Top’ For Bitcoin At $123,000 Post-Trump Win Despite his optimistic projection, Brandt maintains a cautious stance. He emphasizes that “no method of analysis is fool-proof” and admits to avoiding being “dogmatic about any idea.” While this view is his preferred analysis, he acknowledges it is not his only interpretation. Brandt notes that he continues to place a 25% probability that Bitcoin’s price has already topped for this cycle. Should Bitcoin fail to make a decisive new all-time high and decline below $55,000, he would raise the probability of an “Exponential Decay.” The crypto community has been actively engaging with Brandt’s analysis. Popular crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) responded on X, agreeing with Brandt’s top estimation and highlighting the importance of accurately calling the market top. Astronomer remarked: “I think you’re spot on with that top estimation Peter! As for calling the bottom, now it is our duty to call the top ideally in one single try. The terminal price does that very well. I have 6 other metrics in place. If they all line up, it is a sell. Location at $160,000.” In a further exchange, an X user inquired about the implications for the Bitcoin to gold (BTC/GLD) ratio, suggesting it might imply a much higher price. Brandt responded, “Eventually, yes. But let’s take one step at a time without become too dogmatic.” At press time, BTC traded at $74,940.

However, the breakout has yet to be confirmed, leaving room for excitement and caution. Prominent analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on Solana, highlighting that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of breaking out from a massive bullish pattern. According to Runefelt, if the breakout holds, this setup can propel SOL toward a $300 target in the coming months. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sets $3,400 Target Once ETH Breaks Key Resistance – Details The days ahead will be critical for SOL as market sentiment and trading volume determine whether this push is a sustained rally or a bull trap. For Solana to confirm this breakout, it must maintain its upward momentum and establish support above the previous resistance. Investors are closely watching these levels, as a failure to hold could lead to a retracement. However, if SOL can solidify its position, it could begin a powerful rally toward new highs. The outcome will shape Solana’s trajectory as it attempts to secure a place among the top-performing assets in the crypto market. Solana Testing Crucial Supply Solana is currently testing a critical supply level, a zone that will either drive SOL to new highs or send it back into consolidation. After pushing above the $185 mark—a key price level that now needs to hold as support—Solana is poised for a significant move. According to top analyst Carl Runefelt, who shared his technical analysis on X, Solana appears to be breaking out from a massive Symmetrical Triangle, a well-known bullish chart pattern. In his view, a confirmed breakout above this level could trigger a rapid surge to $300, a move that he believes would “destroy bears” and reinvigorate bullish sentiment. However, the coming days will be crucial in determining Solana’s direction, especially as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision is set to be announced today. If the Fed signals a rate cut or maintains current rates, it could fuel the rally by boosting risk-on sentiment in the market. A favorable environment from the Fed could lead to increased buying pressure on SOL, pushing it beyond its recent highs. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Short Liquidations Send BTC Above ATH – Trump Win Sets A Bullish Environment Conversely, if the $185 level fails to hold, SOL might re-enter a consolidation phase, temporarily stalling the upward momentum. For now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s decision and how it might impact broader market sentiment, which will play a critical role in determining whether Solana’s bullish trajectory continues. A successful breakout here would not only confirm strength but could set the stage for Solana to challenge $300 in the coming months. SOL Technical Analysis Solana is currently testing the final resistance at $190, a crucial level that could pave the way for a challenge to its yearly highs around $210. For the bullish momentum to remain intact, SOL needs to break above and hold this level as support. However, achieving this may take several days as the market continues to digest the impact of Donald Trump’s victory and awaits the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. If SOL fails to break above the $190 resistance, a consolidation phase between $180 and $190 could be healthy for price action. This range would allow the market to reassess and stabilize before making another attempt at breaking higher. However, it’s important that the price remains above the $180 mark during this consolidation. If SOL holds above this level, the uptrend can continue, with a potential push toward yearly highs.

On the other hand, if the price drops below $180, it could signal a shift in momentum, putting the current uptrend at risk. For now, bulls must maintain control by keeping SOL above $180 while the broader market awaits the Fed’s decision, which could impact risk sentiment and Solana’s next move.
