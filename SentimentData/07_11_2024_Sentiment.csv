In a series of posts on X on Wednesday, November 6, Kang asserted that NEIRO is poised for exponential growth in the coming months. Better Than Dogecoin? “With a Trump win, NEIRO as the natural successor to Doge is on a path to billions over the next few months,” Kang wrote. He further elaborated, “Hard to think of better coins to hold post a Trump/Elon win than NEIRO. As the natural successor to Doge, its path to a Doge/Shib like run and eventual flippening debates are pre-ordained. Doge is great, but new dogs are even better.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Kang was among the first industry experts to designate Dogecoin as the premier “Trump trade” in the crypto market—a strategy for investors betting on a Trump victory. On October 15, he noted: “One of the most interesting ways to express a ‘Trump Victory’ trade would probably be owning DOGE (and other memes). Not only do you have high odds of a Doge ETF but the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would be making headlines every week and be pushed forward by Trump.” This perspective gained traction among several crypto analysts who identified Dogecoin as the leading proxy for anticipating a Trump win. The association stems from Elon Musk’s proposal to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.) under a Trump administration to reduce the bloated US government spending. Since Kang’s initial post on October 15, the Dogecoin price has surged by over 70%, climbing from $0.1158 to above $0.20 at press time. In contrast, NEIRO experienced a significant downturn of approximately 22% during the same period. After reaching its all-time high of $0.002333 on October 15, NEIRO dipped but has recently shown signs of recovery, rising 42% in the last 48 hours to trade at $0.001786. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge Kang’s endorsement of NEIRO has sparked a debate within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Crypto Stream (@CryptoStreamHub) questioned the trend of industry leaders promoting meme coins, commenting under Kang’s post: “When did it become normalized for the industry leaders to shill Memecoins, honest question? Raoul Pal started, yesterday I heard Arthur Hayes shill GOAT and now Kang is shilling NEIRO. Not wanna criticize that, I genuinely wonder when we made the pivot.” Another analyst, CryptoGugu (@Silivabrota), expressed skepticism about NEIRO’s potential and warned of an underlying market manipulation: “Guys please stop comparing NEIRO with DOGE. DOGE is the real deal NEIRO looking more like a liquidity grab scheme right now. Since the mm has been replaced chart looking awful. Mm only going up and down chasing liquidity, whales only dumping. Something needs to change asap or NEIRO will continue bleeding.” At press time, NEIRO traded at $0.001786.

With a remarkable rally surpassing $75,000, Bitcoin is experiencing considerable momentum, driven primarily by market sentiment surrounding the US elections. A crypto analyst who had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s rise to $75,000 has now set a new price target for the pioneer cryptocurrency, anticipating further bullish movement. Analyst Set $170,000 Price ATH For The Bitcoin Price TradingShot, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has released a brief Bitcoin analysis report, referencing historical trends to predict a new all-time high of $170,000 for Bitcoin. Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from 2022 to the present, the analyst disclosed that on August 5, Bitcoin was testing the 1-week Moving Average (MA50), a level that has never been reached since March 12, 2003. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? In previous market cycles, this crucial level was the absolute supporting trendline that signaled a potential bull market. TradingShot revealed that after almost 20 years, the Bitcoin price was finally able to hold this key trendline not once but twice, leading to its last-week rally that saw its price testing the $73,800 mark. The analyst also highlighted that this price surge was an incredibly bullish move, indicating a strong market for Bitcoin. Moreover, the $73,800 Bitcoin price increase occurred just two days before the US Presidential elections, a period historically known to trigger explosive rallies for Bitcoin. Market expert Crypto Rover on X (formerly Twitter) notes that Bitcoin has experienced a total average price pump of 1,563% following the previous US elections. In 2016, Bitcoin rallied 2,714%, exceeding $15,000 after the US Presidential elections. Similarly, in 2020, the cryptocurrency soared over 400%, surpassing $40,000 after the elections. Now, Bitcoin is clearly on a significant uptrend after the just-concluded US presidential elections on November 4. Given the timing of these rallies, TradingShot has suggested that a similar pattern may be repeating, implying that Bitcoin could be entering a period of explosive growth. Based on chart analysis and Fibonacci levels, the analyst has projected a new target of $170,000 for Bitcoin, representing approximately 1.618 Fibonacci extensions from its current ATH. With the Bitcoin price currently trading at $73,715, having given up some gains, a surge to $170,000 would represent a 130,55% increase. BTC Finally Hits Anticipated Price Discovery With Bitcoin finally reaching a new ATH after months of speculation and anticipation, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has disclosed that this surge signals the cryptocurrency’s entry into its price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought A Bitcoin price discovery refers to how the market determines the current value or price based on supply and demand dynamics. Despite the new achievement, Martinez has revealed that investors are attempting to short Bitcoin by liquidating their holdings and cashing out profits. As a result, the analyst predicts that if Bitcoin goes back to the $75,550 price high, $210 million could be liquidated from the market.

Despite this rally, ETH still trades below a crucial resistance level, keeping the price in check since early August. This resistance, a critical barrier, must be cleared for Ethereum to regain its bullish momentum fully. Analysts are watching closely, with top crypto expert Inmortal sharing a recent technical analysis that suggests Ethereum could be gearing up for a significant breakout. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst According to Inmortal’s analysis, ETH appears to be building strength, and a push above this resistance could unlock the potential for a sustained rally. The market’s response to Trump’s win, particularly as he is seen as a pro-crypto candidate, has boosted sentiment, and many now anticipate increased volatility and upside for Ethereum. Investors are now eyeing ETH’s next moves, with any break above the current resistance likely to signal the beginning of a stronger upward trend. As Ethereum inches closer to this key level, market participants are preparing for what could be a defining moment in ETH’s performance this cycle. Ethereum Pushing Key Supply Ethereum is pushing to break a critical resistance at $2,750, a level that has kept ETH under pressure since early August. This resistance has been a strong barrier; breaking above it is essential for confirming a sustained rally. Top crypto analyst and investor Immortal recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, where he outlined a $3,400 price target for ETH if it successfully clears this key resistance. In his analysis, Inmortal emphasized that Ethereum, often dubbed the “most hated coin” in the current market, is worth paying close attention to despite its recent underperformance. Many investors have expressed frustration with ETH’s lagging momentum compared to other assets, making a breakout above $2,750 a potential game-changer for sentiment and price action. The coming days will be pivotal as the market digests the impact of Donald Trump’s election victory and prepares for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. Trump’s win has already created bullish momentum across the crypto market, and Ethereum’s breakout could capitalize on this shift in sentiment. However, volatility may remain high, and any unexpected news from the Fed could impact ETH’s trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? If ETH can hold above $2,750 and continue pushing higher, the $3,400 target outlined by Inmortal could come within reach, marking a strong recovery phase for Ethereum. For now, the crypto community will be watching closely, as this breakout level can potentially define Ethereum’s performance in the months ahead. ETH Technical Analysis Ethereum is trading at $2,620 after a solid 12% surge from recent lows at $2,355. This price movement has given bulls hope that a rally may be on the horizon. However, ETH must break above the key $2,750 resistance level for the bullish momentum to continue and reclaim price action. This level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), a crucial indicator of long-term strength. A breakout above this level and a successful retest would signal a market sentiment shift, confirming that ETH is on track to regain bullish control. The 200-day EMA is often viewed as a significant support level once the price holds above it. If Ethereum manages to close above this level and maintain the price, it could spark further upside movement. On the other hand, if Ethereum fails to break above $2,750 and struggles to hold, it would signal a failed breakout.

Bulls must remain vigilant as the coming days will be critical for confirming Ethereum’s next move.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $75,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise above the $76,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Extends Rally Bitcoin price started a fresh surge above the $73,500 level. BTC even cleared the $75,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $76,457 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $76,000 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $72,747 swing low to the $76,457 high. However, the price is still in a positive zone above the $73,500 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $74,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $75,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $75,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $76,000 level. A clear move above the $76,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $76,500. A close above the $76,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $78,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $78,800 resistance level. Are Dips Supported In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $76,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $75,250 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $74,150 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $72,747 swing low to the $76,457 high. The next support is now near the $73,500 zone.

The price is trading above $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,730 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it settles above $2,850 and $2,880. Ethereum Price Extends Surge Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,550 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $2,550 and $2,650 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. It even surged above the $2,720 level in the past few sessions, beating BTC.

As a result, most of the market saw a green daily close, with Solana (SOL) recording a 15.8% surge in the last 24 hours and regaining a key support level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gearing Up For Massive Bullish Wave Following 8% Daily Surge, 110% Rally Ahead? Solana Dethrones BNB As 4th Largest Crypto The result of the US elections gave the crypto market the long-awaited boost many investors and market watchers expected. In the early hours of Wednesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surged about 8.6% toward its new ATH of $75,358. This surge, fueled by the victory of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump and a mostly crypto-friendly Congress over US Vice President Kamala Harris, ignited a bullish rally across the market. Solana followed BTC’s lead and jumped over 15% to turn the $180 level into support. Moreover, the cryptocurrency reached its highest price since July, nearing the $190 resistance level. SOL’s daily activity skyrocketed in the last 24 hours, rising 210% to a $10.7 billion daily trading volume. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency saw a 14.66% increase in market capitalization, surging to an $88.1 billion market cap. As a result, Solana flipped Binance Coin (BNB)’s $85 billion market cap, dethroning BNB as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by this metric. This performance fueled investors’ bullish sentiment on the cryptocurrency, with some market watchers predicting a bullish wave towards Q1’s highs. Is SOL Getting Ready For $400? Solana was deemed one of the strongest cryptocurrencies during Q3’s market retraces, holding above its breakout levels while most altcoins struggled. Following last night’s performance, crypto Trader Koz called SOL’s chart “one of the absolute best-looking charts out there.” The cryptocurrency’s surge above the $180 mark represents a breakout from an 8-month consolidation range that started after Solana hit its yearly high of $202. Similarly, World of Charts considers SOL as ‘looking more bullish than before.” The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency finally broke above the upper line of a bullish flag pattern after nearly breaking above it in late October. World of Charts suggested that after the successful breakout, a massive bullish wave is around the corner. To the analyst, this wave could ultimately send Solana’s price toward a new ATH of $400. Moreover, crypto analyst Jelle highlighted the breakout, stating that SOL is ready to retest the yearly highs. Related Reading: PolitiFi Memecoins Soar: Trump-Themed Tokens Rally 30% Ahead Of US Elections A reclaim of the $200 mark, not seen since March, could propel the cryptocurrency above its ATH of $260 in the coming weeks. However, it is key that Solana holds the $180 mark to continue its bullish ascend, as a rejection from this zone could see SOL’s price pullback to the $160 support. SOL trades at $186.9, a 4.12% and 27.56% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

The first major resistance is near the $0.5650 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5720. A clear move above the $0.5720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.5920 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5580 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5500 level. The next major support is near the $0.5450 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5450 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5350 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5220 zone.

This surge in price has raised hopes that Ethereum may be gearing up for a fresh bull run. However, this optimism is tempered by cautionary notes from market analysts who closely observe the stance of Ethereum’s futures market. Related Reading: Ethereum Volatility Soon? Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits Rising Futures Metrics: A Double-Edged Sword According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, key metrics such as the Ethereum futures market’s open interest and funding rates indicate heightened participation and a generally positive market sentiment. The open interest reflects the total number of outstanding futures contracts, while funding rates provide insight into the cost of holding a long or short position. Shayan pointed out that these indicators have steadily risen in recent weeks, suggesting a renewed interest in Ethereum trading. This increase in participation aligns with the broader price movements and highlights a growing enthusiasm among futures traders betting on Ethereum’s continued upward momentum. However, while increased participation and positive funding rates often indicate a strong market, they also come with inherent risks. Shayan emphasized that although neither metric has reached levels that would be considered dangerously high, there remains a potential for heightened volatility. Overly high optimism in the futures market could lead to an imbalance, making Ethereum vulnerable to sudden and severe price swings. The CryptoQuant analyst explained that a sudden spike in open interest and funding rates might trigger what is known as a “long liquidation cascade.” This occurs when leveraged traders are forced to sell their positions due to adverse price movements, which can lead to a sharp decline in market value. Such liquidations can quickly erode investor confidence and drive prices lower. Regardless, the analyst suggested that the current open interest levels and funding rates suggest there is still room for growth. Navigating Potential Ethereum Volatility Given the current market conditions, Shayan offered prudent advice to Ethereum market participants. He recommended that investors closely monitor open interest and funding rates as key market sentiment indicators. According to the analyst, by keeping a watchful eye on these metrics, investors can better manage their risk exposure and be prepared for any sudden changes in the market.
