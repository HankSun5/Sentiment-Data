Galaxy Digital secures FCA approval, expands institutional trading reach in the UK Leon Marshall, chief executive officer of Galaxy Europe, said that the approval is a pivotal achievement for the Galaxy group, as it allows them to deliver innovative trading solutions to institutional clients while maintaining the highest regulatory standards. He noted: “London is a critical financial hub, and this authorisation allows us to deepen our presence in the UK, aligning with our mission to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem.” This FCA authorization represents a significant trading milestone for Galaxy Digital . It contributes to the firm’s established reputation for pioneering trading solutions for an institutional client base while satisfying stringent regulatory requirements. The approval contributes to Galaxy Digital’s growing regulatory footprint. The Company, which is headquartered in New York and has offices in Chicago, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, has a client base that includes over 1,300 institutional trading counterparties. Galaxy Digital expands as the UK strengthens its crypto-friendly stance Galaxy Digital is also planning to expand its workforce to meet the demand for digital asset services. With its roughly 40-employee team based in London, these developments align with the UK’s relatively forward-looking approach to the regulation of crypto assets, making the UK a destination for high investment and innovation. ​ Galaxy sees the FCA license as a major milestone that will enhance the company’s compliance efforts. It also positions the digital asset and blockchain firm to meet rising demand from the rapidly expanding institutional investor market. Marshall says the UK government has created a thriving environment for transformative technologies like digital assets. He believes the country is on the right track, with a strong push to attract innovation capital. He added that this clarity is drawing top talent, investment, and innovation to the region, bolstered by the nation’s deep talent pool, world-class academic institutions, and entrepreneurial spirit. Galaxy Digital recently made headlines after the New York Attorney General revealed a $200 million settlement over its involvement with LUNA. The firm also attracted bullish sentiment with its announcement of a 15-year artificial intelligence hosting deal with CoreWeave. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital’s derivatives trading license approval by the FCA comes amid a growing wave of institutional interest in digital assets. Traditional finance companies have also sought the FCA’s approval as crypto asset firms in the UK. One of the notable companies on this list is asset management giants like BlackRock.

After a five-year wait, CoinList , a prominent name in the cryptocurrency exchange and launchpad arena, is making a sensational comeback to the U.S. market. For those who’ve felt locked out due to political and regulatory hurdles, this news is nothing short of a breath of fresh air. But what exactly does this mean for you, and why should you be excited? Let’s dive into the details of CoinList’s triumphant return and explore the opportunities it unlocks. Why is CoinList US Returning Now? The big question on everyone’s mind is, why now? For half a decade, U.S.-based users have been on the sidelines, unable to access CoinList’s services. The platform cited political circumstances and regulatory issues as the reasons for their absence. Navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation in the United States has been a significant challenge for many cryptocurrency platforms. However, it seems the tides are turning, or at least, CoinList believes they have found a viable path forward. While specific details regarding the changed circumstances remain under wraps, this relaunch strongly suggests a more favorable regulatory environment or perhaps a refined strategy by CoinList to operate within the existing framework. This return signals a potentially positive shift in the accessibility of cryptocurrency platforms for US users. It suggests that despite the hurdles, there are pathways for platforms like CoinList to offer their services while adhering to regulatory requirements. This could pave the way for other platforms to reconsider or expand their operations in the US market, fostering greater competition and innovation. CoinList: More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Exchange For those unfamiliar, CoinList isn’t just another cryptocurrency exchange . It’s a platform renowned for its role as a launchpad for promising new crypto projects. Think of it as a springboard that propels innovative blockchain ventures into the crypto sphere. CoinList has a track record of hosting token sales for some of the most successful and well-known projects in the crypto space. This includes names like Filecoin, Solana, and Flow, all of which gained significant traction and are now major players in the industry. Here’s what makes CoinList stand out: Launchpad Expertise: CoinList specializes in identifying and launching high-potential crypto projects. Their rigorous vetting process aims to bring quality projects to their community. Early Access Opportunities: Participating in token sales on CoinList often provides early access to tokens at potentially favorable prices before they hit mainstream exchanges.

With its return to the US, US investors now regain access to this unique platform and the opportunities it offers. This is particularly exciting for those looking to get in on the ground floor of promising crypto projects. Token Sale Alert: DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) To mark its U.S. relaunch, CoinList is immediately jumping into action with a token sale for the DoubleZero Foundation (2Z). According to reports from The Block, this sale is scheduled to run from April 2nd to April 22nd. This isn’t just a symbolic event; it’s a real opportunity for accredited investors in the U.S. to participate in a new token offering right out of the gate. Key details of the DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) Token Sale: Aspect Details Project DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) Platform CoinList Sale Dates April 2nd – April 22nd Eligibility Accredited Investors in the U.S. If you are an accredited investor in the U.S. and are looking to explore new investment opportunities in the crypto space, this token sale on CoinList US is something you should definitely investigate further. Remember to conduct thorough research on the DoubleZero Foundation and the 2Z token to make an informed investment decision. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Investors? CoinList’s return is a significant win for US investors .

CoinList’s return opens doors to future token sales and project launches, providing US investors with more diverse investment options within the crypto ecosystem. Increased Competition: CoinList’s presence in the US market can foster healthy competition among cryptocurrency exchanges and launchpads, potentially leading to better services and more innovative offerings for users. Positive Market Signal: This move could be interpreted as a positive signal regarding the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US, potentially encouraging further growth and adoption. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and investing in token sales carries risks. Always conduct your own due diligence, understand the projects you are investing in, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities The cryptocurrency industry in the US has been navigating a complex and often unclear crypto regulation environment. Different agencies have varying perspectives, and the rules are still evolving. This has led to uncertainty and challenges for platforms operating in the space, as evidenced by CoinList’s previous withdrawal from the US market. CoinList is Back in the USA! CoinList’s return suggests that either the regulatory climate is becoming more accommodating, or platforms are finding innovative ways to comply and operate within the existing rules. This could involve strategies such as focusing on accredited investors initially, implementing robust KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) procedures, and carefully structuring token sales to comply with securities regulations. While challenges remain, CoinList’s re-entry is a positive sign. It indicates that despite the regulatory hurdles, there are opportunities for growth and expansion within the US crypto market. This could encourage more platforms to engage with regulators, seek clarity, and work towards establishing a sustainable and compliant crypto ecosystem in the United States. Conclusion: A New Chapter for CoinList and US Crypto CoinList’s return to the U.S. market after a five-year hiatus marks a significant and exciting development for the American cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a triumphant comeback that not only benefits US investors by providing them with access to a leading launchpad and cryptocurrency exchange , but also signals a potentially more favorable environment for crypto innovation in the United States.

Historical market trends offer insights into how SHIB price could react if Ripple (XRP) price races towards the $5 mark in the months ahead. Will Ripple (XRP) Rally Impact Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price? Ripple’s XRP remains one of the most relevant crypto altcoins in 2025, with market watchers speculating on out it potential long-term price trajectory could impact prominent memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Ripple (XRP) Price Action, April 2, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple price is currently consolidating above the $2 level according to CoinMarketCap data. If it reaches the $5 milestone, it would mark a significant achievement, exceeding its current all time high of $3.84 recorded back in 2018. Based on recent market reports, XRP’s potential growth drivers in 2025 include institutional adoption from Spot ETF filings, regulatory clarity from the ongoing US Stablecoin Bill review by the US Congress, and expanding use cases for Ripple’s RLUSD blockchain-based payment solutions. A rally to $5 would push XRP’s market capitalization beyond $250 billion, potentially sparking renewed institutional interest in the broader crypto market. But, historically, when large-cap altcoins experience parabolic gains, capital rotations into mid-cap and small-cap assets, such as memecoins like Shiba Inu, tend to follow. Historical Correlation Between XRP and Shiba Inu Shiba Inu price action has often shown a tendency to react to major market shifts, particularly during bullish altcoin cycles. In the 2021 bull run, SHIB experienced an explosive rally alongside XRP and other major altcoins, fueled by increased retail participation and speculative trading. This trend repeated in 2024, when SHIB price surged by more than 100% in Q3 2024 after Donald Trump won the US elections in November. Shiba Inu prices is current holding steady above the $0.000012 mark as of Wednesday, April 2. If XRP price reaches $5, it could signal an extended altcoin season, leading to increased demand for speculative assets like SHIB. Additionally, memecoins often benefit from surges in retail enthusiasm, social media trends, and whale accumulation. However, SHIB’s price action will also depend on independent factors, including burn rate efficiency, ecosystem developments, and overall sentiment in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Price Projections If XRP Hits $5 At press time on April 2, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000012, with a market capitalization of $7.14 billion. If XRP’s surge triggers broader altcoin momentum, SHIB could see notable upside. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action, April 2, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Here are possible scenarios for Shiba Inu price forecast based on historical trends and capital flow dynamics: Conservative Target: $0.000015 – $0.000017, if SHIB experiences a moderate reaction from XRP’s gains, supported by increased risk appetite in altcoins. Moderate Bullish Target: $0.000020 – $0.000025, if memecoins gain traction alongside XRP, and increased whale accumulation occurs) Parabolic Scenario: $0.000035, if SHIB benefits from a major jump in speculative trading from large investors along with persistent token burns. Key Market Risks Ahead While an XRP rally to $5 could provide positive momentum for Shiba Inu, several external factors will influence its trajectory: Bitcoin’s Market Direction: BTC’s performance often dictates overall market sentiment. Shiba Inu Burn Rate: A sustained burn mechanism can create supply shocks, positively impacting price. Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rate decisions and regulatory clarity could affect investor risk appetite. Social Media Hype & Whale Activity: SHIB’s price remains sensitive to retail-driven momentum and large transactions from whales. In Summary If XRP price reaches $5, it could trigger an altcoin rally, potentially benefiting Shiba Inu Inu price action. While historical data suggests SHIB price could gain from heightened market speculation, its trajectory will depend on broader crypto market trends, fundamental developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and continued investor interest. Along with XRP price action, strategic Shiba Inu traders would watch key resistance levels around $0.000015, for confirmation, while also monitoring Bitcoin’s price movement, and broader macroeconomic signals to gauge SHIB’s potentia price breakout scenarios.

The announcement came during what he labeled “Liberation Day,” when he unveiled a plan to apply baseline tariffs of 10% to all countries and higher rates on selected nations. The latest 34% US tariffs on China add to an existing 20% charge tied to fentanyl trafficking and to tariffs already on items such as solar panels. This means many imports from China may face rates above 50%. Trump described the new approach as a way to make foreign nations pay “for the privilege of selling in the US market.” He argued that while the United States could have matched tariff rates dollar for dollar, his administration chose a lower figure to show restraint. “The tariffs wil l be not a full reciprocal,” he said. “I could have done that yes, it would have been tough for a lot of countries. We didn’t want to do that.” Trump announcing the list of countries for reciprocal US tariffs on “Liberation Day”. Source: Fox 35 Orlando, Youtube In his remarks, Trump emphasized that China has not always provided fair access to American goods and services. “They charge us, we charge them less, so how can anybody be upset?” he said. He suggested that in earlier years, the US had been more successful in trade but had lost ground recently. “We had a great country four years ago in terms of the economics, and we were doubling up on China. Nobody was going to catch us but so much of it slipped away in the last four years under Biden,” he said. Trump recalled that seven years ago, the United States collected “hundreds and billions of dollars” in tariffs from China and said Chinese leaders understood why Washington felt it needed to take firm action. “President Xi, he understood. They all understand that we are gonna have to go through tough love maybe. They are ripping us off, and they understood it,” he said. China has taken steps to restrict local companies from investing in the US According to a Bloomberg report , China’s National Development and Reform Commission instructed several of its branches to suspend registrations and approvals for any firms planning to invest in the US. The exact timing of these steps and the duration of the suspension remain unclear. China has long placed certain limits on overseas investments for reasons linked to national security and concerns about capital outflows, but these new restrictions come at a time of heightened trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Official data put Chinese outbound investments into the US at $6.9 billion in 2023. It is not apparent whether existing commitments or major financial holdings, such as China’s US Treasury purchases, would be affected. Although this new restriction is mainly focused on corporate investment in the US, it throws another element of uncertainty into global trade as firms look for ways to move production or strike alternative deals to avoid the effects of new barriers. The situation further complicates relations between China and the US, especially with the freshly announced 34% tariffs. China couldn’t dodge US tariffs In an apparent last-ditch effort to ease tensions, China’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily, published an article highlighting the benefits that US farmers and technology companies have gained from trade with China. The piece, credited to “Zhong Sheng,” a pen name that translates to “Voice of China,” underlined how US agricultural imports have helped American growers and addressed China’s own demand. This commentary arrived before Trump’s announcement of global tariffs. Observers noted that the piece was the second in a series looking at China-US ties, timed alongside the president’s plan to finalize his reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Bloomberg reported that some saw the article as a way for Beijing to remind Washington of the economic upsides of working with China. John Gong, once a consultant to China’s Commerce Ministry and now a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said: “This article appears to be Beijing’s last effort to avert Trump’s tariffs against China in the hope of changing his mind.” China has hinted towards further retaliation in trade tariffs A previous article on Monday showcased how China’s market scale and production abilities benefited high-profile American companies like Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. While the piece argued for cooperation and mutual gains, it also laid out areas where China could retaliate. Beijing has already targeted US agricultural and energy goods in response to the 20% blanket tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese products earlier this year. Authorities also investigated Alphabet Inc.’s Google and placed US gene-sequencing company Illumina Inc. on a blacklist of entities under special scrutiny. At the diplomatic level, China has been vocal in its criticism of the tariffs, with its top envoy calling on Trump to remove them. Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to the Russian state-run outlet RIA Novosti on Tuesday, saying the US duties cited China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis without adequate evidence. “If the US side persists in exerting pressure and even continues to engage in blackmail, China will resolutely counteract it,” Wang stated. Analysts caution that these moves could be the start of prolonged trade disagreements as both nations show signs of readiness for further escalation. Some expect more Chinese efforts to protect local industries and control where capital flows. In contrast, others believe Washington may add new duties or expand enforcement actions against products that Trump deems unfairly traded. For now, the 34% reciprocal tariff stands out as a steep figure, though Trump insists it is lower than what he could have imposed to match China’s rates.

42821856,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145735,1743634201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Intriguing Twist: Elon Musk’s Shocking Exit from Public Office After DOGE Role,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/elon-musk-public-office-doge/,"In a surprising turn of events, the cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the news that tech mogul Elon Musk will be stepping down from any potential future in public office. This revelation comes on the heels of his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that, while perhaps unconventional, had many speculating about Musk’s broader political ambitions. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s recent statement on X, as reported by Sina Finance, has definitively put these speculations to rest. But what does this mean for the future of Dogecoin, the crypto market, and Musk’s influence within these spheres? Let’s dive into the details. Elon Musk’s Departure from Public Office: A Definitive Stance The announcement, delivered via social media and traditional news outlets, leaves no room for ambiguity: Elon Musk will not be transitioning into a career in public service after his stint at DOGE. This confirmation aligns with previous assertions from both Musk himself and former President Trump, painting a consistent picture of Musk’s intentions. While his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) might have sparked curiosity and debate, it appears to be a unique chapter rather than a prelude to a political saga. Here’s a quick rundown of the key points: Official Confirmation: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Musk’s exit on X. Consistent Messaging: Musk and former President Trump previously indicated Musk’s lack of interest in public office. DOGE Role Limited: Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency was a specific role, not a stepping stone to further political positions. Focus on Private Sector: This announcement reinforces Musk’s continued dedication to his private ventures and technological pursuits. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin? Given Elon Musk’s well-known affinity for Dogecoin, it’s natural to wonder how his decision to stay out of public office might impact the popular meme-coin. Musk’s tweets and endorsements have historically sent Dogecoin’s price on rollercoaster rides. While his political decisions might seem indirectly related to cryptocurrency, Musk’s overall influence on public sentiment and market trends is undeniable. His focus remaining in the private sector, particularly with companies like Tesla and SpaceX, could mean continued, albeit perhaps less politically charged, engagement with Dogecoin and the broader crypto space. Analyzing the Impact on the Cryptocurrency Landscape The broader cryptocurrency market is always sensitive to news involving influential figures like Elon Musk. While this announcement isn’t directly crypto-related policy, it does clarify Musk’s direction. Some might have anticipated a scenario where Musk could leverage a public office to influence crypto regulations or policies. With that possibility now off the table, the market may adjust its expectations. However, Musk’s influence as a tech innovator and business leader remains potent. His companies’ potential adoption of cryptocurrencies, or his continued commentary on digital assets, will likely continue to shape market sentiment. Consider these aspects: Factor Potential Impact on Crypto Musk not in public office Reduced speculation of direct political influence on crypto policy by Musk. Musk’s continued private sector focus Potential for ongoing crypto integration within his companies (Tesla, SpaceX, etc.). Musk’s social media presence Likely to remain a significant, albeit potentially less politically angled, driver of crypto market sentiment. Public Office and the Road Not Taken The concept of public office often conjures images of political power and policy-making influence. For someone like Elon Musk, known for disrupting industries and challenging norms, the idea of entering this arena was intriguing to many. His DOGE role, however unconventional, seemed to flirt with this possibility. Now, with the confirmation of his exit, we see a clear path chosen – one that remains rooted in the entrepreneurial and technological realms rather than the political one. This decision might be seen as a strategic move to maximize his impact through innovation and business, areas where he has already established a formidable presence. Navigating the Crypto Market After the Announcement The crypto market is known for its volatility and responsiveness to news and trends. While Musk’s decision isn’t a direct market catalyst in itself, it removes one layer of uncertainty – the ‘what if’ of Musk in politics. Investors and enthusiasts can now refocus on other fundamental factors driving the market, such as technological advancements, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Dogecoin, in particular, might see some recalibration as the market digests this news and assesses the future drivers of its value, independent of potential political affiliations of its most prominent supporter. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Monitor Market Reactions: Keep an eye on how Dogecoin and the broader crypto market react in the days following this announcement. Focus on Fundamentals: Shift focus to the underlying technology, adoption rates, and regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t rely solely on celebrity endorsements or political speculation when making investment decisions in the crypto space. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with credible news sources and market analysis to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Musk’s Future Path and Crypto’s Trajectory Elon Musk’s decision to forgo public office clarifies his trajectory and removes a layer of speculation from the cryptocurrency narrative. While his influence on Dogecoin and the crypto market remains significant, it will likely continue to be exerted through his private ventures and public commentary rather than political channels. For the crypto community, this news underscores the importance of focusing on the core principles and developments within the blockchain and digital asset space. The market will continue to evolve, driven by innovation, adoption, and regulatory frameworks, with or without the direct political involvement of figures like Elon Musk. The future remains exciting and full of potential, even as certain paths are clarified and others remain open.

The registration, announced on Tuesday , comes after a multi-year process that required exchanges to meet higher standards for investor protection and governance. Kraken said it worked closely with Canadian regulators during this pre-registration phase, upgrading its compliance systems and internal controls to meet expectations set by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). To lead its Canadian expansion, Kraken named Cynthia Del Pozo as general manager for North America. Del Pozo, a fintech and operations veteran, will oversee strategy, regulatory engagement and business development across the region. “Canada is at a turning point for crypto adoption,” said Del Pozo in a statement, pointing to growing interest from both retail and institutional investors. A recent survey cited by Kraken found that 30% of Canadian investors currently hold crypto assets. Kraken also announced it will offer free Interac e-Transfer deposits for Canadian users, a move aimed at reducing friction for newcomers to the platform. The exchange claims it doubled its team and user base in Canada over the last two years and now manages over $2 billion CAD in client assets.

42822281,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ey-updates-ethereum-scaler-nightfall-zk-rollup,1743634800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,EY updates privacy L2 as nixed Tornado Cash sanctions ease fears,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ey-updates-ethereum-scaler-nightfall-zk-rollup?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Big Four accounting firm EY, formerly Ernst & Young, has changed its enterprise-focused Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Nightfall to a zero-knowledge rollup design as it says corporate clients are more comfortable with privacy solutions with easing US sanctions. EY said in an April 2 announcement that Nightfall’s new source code, “Nightfall_4,” simplifies the network’s architecture and offers near-instant transaction finality on Ethereum while making it more accessible to users than its previous optimistic rollup-based version. EY’s global blockchain leader, Paul Brody, told Cointelegraph that switching to a ZK-rollup model “means instant finality, but it also makes operations simpler since you don’t need a challenger node to secure the network,” which verifies the correctness of transactions. The move away from optimistic rollups means Nightfall users won’t need to challenge potentially incorrect transactions on Ethereum and wait out the challenging period, leading to faster transaction finality. No such feature is present with zero-knowledge rollups, meaning that a transaction becomes final as soon as it is added into a Nightfall block, EY said. It is the fourth major update to Nightfall since EY launched the business-focused Ethereum layer 2 in 2019. Nightfall enables the firm’s business partners to transfer tokens privately using Ethereum’s security while being cheaper than the base network. It also uses a technology that binds a verified identity to a public key through digital signatures to try to stem counterparty risk. Nixed Tornado Cash sanctions “helped people feel comfortable” Brody said the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions on the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash “had a chilling effect on legitimate business user interest.” “Even though we long ago took steps to make Nightfall unattractive to bad actors, since it cannot be used anonymously, the removal of OFAC sanctions has really helped people feel comfortable that using a privacy technology will not be risky,” he added. Nightfall’s code is open source on GitHub but remains a permissioned blockchain for EY’s customer base, competing with the likes of the IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and the Consensus-built Quorum. Brody said that EY’s blockchain team is working toward “a single environment that supports payments, logic, and composability.” Currently, the firm requires Nightfall and Starlight, a tool that can change smart contract code to enable zero-knowledge proofs “to enable complex multiparty business agreements under privacy,” he added. “We’ll spend some time supporting Nightfall_4 deployments initially,” Brody said. “Then we’ll move on to the development of Nightfall_5.” Magazine: What are native rollups?

Despite previous recovery attempts, sellers remain dominant, preventing any meaningful upside momentum. If SOL fails to hold this key support, it could trigger a wave of panic selling, accelerating losses and exposing the price to deeper declines. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, all eyes are on whether bulls can stage a defense or if bears will finally break through, setting the stage for further downside. Solana Ongoing Bearish Trend In Focus The Solana price chart is currently displaying a bearish triangle formation, signaling a continuation of the downward trend. Initially, SOL attempted to break out above the upper boundary of the triangle, but the breakout lacked strong bullish momentum, leading to a swift rejection. This failure to sustain an upward move pushed the asset back toward the lower boundary of the triangle, where the $118 support level now comes into focus. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Steady After Decline—Breakout or More Downside? With continued selling pressure, Solana could face an extended bearish move, breaking below its current key support level and accelerating its decline. A confirmed breakdown beneath the bearish triangle would lead to a drop toward $118, the first major support zone. However, if the bearish momentum intensifies, this level may not hold. Below $118, the next significant support lies at $99, where some buyers could attempt to slow the decline. Should this level fail to provide stability, SOL could slide toward $79, a crucial psychological and technical support zone. Continued weakness in market sentiment may push the price even lower, with $58 coming into play. For now, bulls must step in to defend these levels, or Solana risks an extended bearish phase. Can $118 Spark Up Bullish Again The $118 support level has emerged as a critical zone for SOL, with many traders watching closely to see if it can trigger a bullish turnaround. Historically, this level has acted as a strong demand zone, where buyers stepped in to absorb selling pressure and push prices higher. If similar market behavior plays out, SOL could see a rebound from this point. Related Reading: Solana Bears Eye $113 Target If Ascending Structure Breaks Down – Details According to CURB, in an X post on March 15, he forecasted that Solana’s price eyes decline to the $118 support level before experiencing a potential rebound. He believes that strong demand in this zone could trigger a significant price surge to the $1,000 mark in the long run. Fundamental factors, such as positive news on Solana’s ecosystem, increased network adoption, or improved overall market sentiment, could also act as catalysts for a price recovery. A surge in buying volume, particularly from whales and institutional investors, is likely to provide the momentum needed to shift market sentiment.

42822193,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145799,1743634858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary DTCC Platform Unveils Tokenized Collateral Management for a Secure Financial Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dtcc-platform-tokenized-collateral/,"In a groundbreaking move poised to reshape the landscape of institutional finance, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a premier post-trade market infrastructure provider, has officially launched its highly anticipated platform for tokenized collateral management . This development, first highlighted by Solid Intel on X, signals a significant step forward in the integration of blockchain technology within traditional financial systems. Are you ready to witness how this innovation could redefine efficiency and security in the world of collateral? What is Tokenized Collateral Management and Why is DTCC’s Platform a Game Changer? Before we delve into the specifics of DTCC’s new offering, let’s understand the core concept. Tokenized collateral management essentially involves representing traditional financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or even real estate, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This process unlocks a host of benefits, primarily by enhancing the efficiency, transparency, and speed of collateral management. Why is this important? In traditional finance, managing collateral—assets pledged to secure loans or trades—can be a cumbersome and often slow process. It involves multiple intermediaries, manual paperwork, and can be prone to operational inefficiencies. Tokenization aims to streamline this by: Reducing settlement times: Transactions on a blockchain are typically faster than traditional settlement systems, potentially moving from T+1 or T+2 to near real-time. Improving operational efficiency: Automation through smart contracts can minimize manual intervention, reducing errors and operational costs. Enhancing transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency provides a clear and auditable record of collateral movements and ownership. Expanding accessibility: Tokenization can potentially fractionalize assets, making them more accessible as collateral and opening up new liquidity pools. DTCC, as a critical infrastructure in the financial markets, stepping into this space is a powerful endorsement of blockchain adoption in mainstream finance. Their platform isn’t just another experiment; it’s a strategic move that could set a new industry standard. Exploring the Benefits of the DTCC Platform for Tokenized Collateral The launch of DTCC’s platform is not just about keeping up with technological trends; it’s about addressing real-world challenges in collateral management. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Description Impact Increased Efficiency Automated processes and faster settlement reduce operational drag. Lower costs, faster transaction cycles. Enhanced Security Blockchain’s cryptographic security strengthens the integrity of collateral data. Reduced risk of fraud and data breaches. Improved Liquidity Tokenization can unlock previously illiquid assets as potential collateral. Greater flexibility in collateral usage and potentially lower borrowing costs. Greater Transparency Immutable blockchain records offer a clear audit trail of collateral movements. Improved regulatory compliance and trust among participants. Imagine a scenario where a financial institution needs to quickly mobilize collateral to meet margin requirements. With a DTCC platform for tokenized assets, this process could be significantly accelerated and simplified compared to the traditional methods that involve manual reconciliations and slower transfer mechanisms. This speed and efficiency are paramount in today’s fast-paced financial markets. Challenges and Considerations for Institutional Crypto Adoption While the potential of tokenized collateral management is immense, the path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is not without its hurdles. What are some of the challenges that DTCC and the broader industry might face? Regulatory Clarity: Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are crucial for the widespread adoption of tokenized assets. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, which can create complexities for global institutions. Interoperability: For tokenized collateral to be truly effective, platforms need to be interoperable. Ensuring seamless interaction between different blockchain networks and legacy systems is a technical challenge. Scalability: As adoption grows, blockchain networks must be able to handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising speed or cost. Scalability solutions are continuously evolving. Security Risks: While blockchain is inherently secure, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or custody solutions can pose risks. Robust security protocols and best practices are essential. Market Education and Acceptance: Widespread adoption requires educating market participants about the benefits and mechanics of tokenized collateral and overcoming any skepticism or resistance to change. DTCC’s initiative is a significant step in addressing these challenges head-on. By providing a robust and regulated platform, they are paving the way for greater comfort and confidence in using digital assets for collateral purposes within the institutional space. Examples of Tokenized Collateral in Action While DTCC’s platform is a recent development, the concept of tokenized collateral is already gaining traction in various forms. Here are a few examples to illustrate its potential: Stablecoins as Collateral: Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, are increasingly used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Their price stability makes them attractive for this purpose. Tokenized Securities: Companies are beginning to tokenize traditional securities like stocks and bonds. These tokenized securities can then be used as collateral in lending and borrowing activities. Real-World Assets (RWAs) Tokenization: Beyond financial instruments, real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and art are being tokenized. This opens up vast new possibilities for collateralization, although it’s still in early stages. DTCC’s platform is geared towards institutional clients, focusing initially on securities. However, the underlying technology and principles can be applied to a much broader range of asset classes as the ecosystem matures. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance? The launch of DTCC’s tokenized collateral management platform is more than just news; it’s a signal of a fundamental shift in how financial infrastructure is evolving. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: For Financial Institutions: Start exploring the potential of tokenized collateral and assess how it can enhance your operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve risk management. Engage with platforms like DTCC’s to understand the practical implications. For Technology Providers: Focus on developing interoperable and secure solutions that support the growing demand for tokenized asset infrastructure. Regulatory compliance and scalability should be top priorities. For Regulators: Proactively develop clear and balanced regulatory frameworks that foster innovation in tokenized assets while mitigating potential risks. Collaboration with industry players is crucial. For Investors: Keep an eye on the developments in institutional crypto and tokenization. Understand the potential investment opportunities that may arise as this space matures. The move by DTCC is a powerful validation of the transformative potential of blockchain technology in finance. It’s a clear indication that blockchain adoption is no longer a fringe concept but a mainstream evolution. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Tokenized Financial Ecosystem DTCC’s launch of its platform for tokenized collateral management is a watershed moment. It represents a significant leap towards a more efficient, transparent, and secure financial ecosystem. While challenges remain, the benefits of tokenization are becoming increasingly undeniable. This initiative by a market infrastructure giant like DTCC will undoubtedly accelerate the adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology within traditional finance, paving the way for a future where tokenized assets are commonplace. The revolution in collateral management is here, and it’s being driven by the power of tokenization.

The debate highlights tensions between corporate ambitions and public advisory work. The issue prompts reconsideration of role definitions in government advisory positions. Tesla founder Elon Musk will reportedly step away from his new role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the coming months, NBC News and Politico reported Wednesday. Is Elon Musk Stepping Back From DOGE? According to Politico’s April 2 report , three sources close to President Donald Trump revealed that the president and Elon Musk have discussed plans for the X CEO to step back from his government role. The billionaire entrepreneur will reportedly refocus on running his multiple businesses. Just last month, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields alleged that Musk would stay until his “mission” at DOGE was “completed.” A February Politico report cited an anonymous insider who claimed that the controversial tech billionaire was “here to stay” despite widespread public scrutiny. SCOOP: Pres Trump has told his inner circle & members of his Cabinet that @elonmusk will be stepping back in the coming weeks from his current role Trump remains pleased w/ Musk & DOGE, but both men have decided in recent days that it will soon be time for Musk to return… — Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) April 2, 2025 As a special government employee, Musk is only allowed to work 130 days out of 365, with the South African-born engineer expected to reach that limit either next month or June. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took to X Wednesday to deny the claims, calling the scoop “garbage.” “Elon Musk and President Trump have both *publicly* stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,” she wrote. However, a senior White House official confirmed to NBC News Wednesday afternoon that Trump had discussed Musk’s departure at a March 24 Cabinet meeting. While the status of Elon Musk’s government position remains unclear, his involvement with the Trump administration has already created consequences for his businesses. X CEO Faces Backlash Over DOGE Policies, Tesla Attacked Musk has faced broad pushback commercially for his role alongside the Trump administration, with several Tesla charging stations, vehicles, and dealerships attacked in recent months. During a Wisconsin town hall on Sunday, Elon Musk addressed how his political involvement has affected his businesses. He also clarified that despite the acronym’s similarity to the cryptocurrency , the federal government does not plan to use Dogecoin. “My Tesla stock, and the stock of everyone who owns Tesla, has roughly halved,” he said at the event hosted by his crypto-friendly America PAC . “I mean, it’s a big deal.” The post Conflicting Reports Emerge Over Elon Musk Stepping Down From DOGE appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-02 23:03:34

And what if some are already stacking their gains while others still scroll, searching? The digital battleground for dominance is heating up, and three names are rising faster than most: Qubetics , Toncoin, and Litecoin, one of the best crypto for quick profit. Each brings something rare to the table: speed, scalability, and a chance for early community members to secure serious profits. And right now, the right move could make all the difference. Just look at Toncoin (TON). A surge past the $4 resistance level has flipped heads in the derivatives market, triggering a 35.86% jump in open interest. Litecoin (LTC) is testing the patience of long-term holders. After slipping below the $97.12 support, it hovers in uncertain territory, possibly drifting toward $57.70 if current patterns persist. But here’s where things get wild: Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t here to play catch-up—it’s here to change the rules. By confronting real-life failures in cross-border transfers, inefficient smart contracts, and fragmented systems. It’s more than just a presale—it’s a signal that the future is already forming. Qubetics ($TICS): The Infrastructure Crypto Built for Life Qubetics delivers something blockchain desperately needs—seamless interoperability. Not theoretical. Actual plug-and-play connections across chains, systems, and devices. Picture a logistics platform in Brazil instantly syncing transactions from multiple vendors—Ethereum-based, Solana-based, and even legacy payment APIs—without gas fee traps or hour-long confirmations. Or imagine a freelancer in Chile finally getting paid across chains, settled in seconds, minus middlemen. This isn’t hype; it’s structured utility. One of Qubetics’ most powerful strengths lies in its adaptive consensus layer, designed to align with both public and private networks. This helps traditional businesses plug into crypto infrastructure without costly backend overhauls. That’s like giving a 90s car a self-driving system—and having it work flawlessly. Through advanced sharding mechanisms and modular infrastructure, Qubetics minimizes congestion and keeps data throughput fast and secure. What a $1,000 in Qubetics Looks Like—And Why Waiting Might Cost More Than You Think Imagine dropping just $1,000 into Qubetics ($TICS) today. At the current crypto presale price of $0.1430, that grabs around 6,993 tokens. Now picture this—if $TICS hits just $1, that $1,000 becomes $6,993. At $5, you’re staring at $34,965. Stretch that to $10, and the figure climbs to $69,930. If it hits $15, that same initial entry could grow into a stunning $104,895. These numbers aren’t pulled from thin air—they’re based on actual projections tied to Qubetics’ structured growth model. With more than 24,200 holders, over $15.8 million already raised, and 506 million tokens sold as of April 2, 2025, the momentum isn’t coming—it’s already accelerating. And with every new presale stage, the price ticks up. The window for maximum profit is narrowing fast. In crypto, hesitation isn’t harmless—it’s expensive. For those looking for the best crypto for quick profit, Qubetics offers more than just potential. It offers timing. And right now, that timing couldn’t be sharper. Toncoin (TON): Bullish Charts, Big Bets, and a Fresh Breakout Toncoin’s push beyond the $4 line this April isn’t just technical noise. It signals renewed confidence. The open interest spike—up 35.86% in just 24 hours—tells a story of serious capital repositioning. People aren’t just watching; they’re acting. The RSI, sitting at 60, suggests there’s still breathing room before things get overheated. And the MACD’s bullish crossover? That’s more fuel in the tank. The TON network itself continues evolving under the Telegram ecosystem, giving it the type of built-in distribution others only dream of. With tools like TON DNS and TON Payments already gaining traction in Venezuela and El Salvador, the project feels grounded—not in ideology, but in use. Developers are integrating dApps on TON’s scalable architecture, while casual users benefit from its low transaction costs and high-speed transfers. While not a presale coin like Qubetics, Toncoin is carving its own route to mass adoption. Those entering now are positioning themselves in a strong uptrend, especially if it breaks past $4.62. For those seeking the best crypto for quick profit, TON’s upward trajectory makes it hard to ignore. Time, though, is rarely this generous twice. Litecoin (LTC): Digital Silver Faces Critical Pressure Litecoin has earned its reputation as digital silver—reliable, consistent, and battle-tested. But even legends stumble. Dropping below the $97.12 support level has raised alarms. The next test sits way lower, near $57.70. It’s a big gap, and the LTC community is watching closely. Still, seasoned market participants know: when others hesitate, real opportunities unfold. Litecoin continues to serve practical purposes. Its ultra-low fees make it a favorite for fast, cross-border microtransactions. In Argentina and Cuba, where fiat volatility runs high, LTC is still used by local merchants and digital freelancers. That real-life relevance keeps Litecoin in the conversation, even during market dips. However, this isn’t a hype cycle moment—it’s a grind phase. And in that grind, entries could lead to major rebounds. Litecoin may not be flashy, but its infrastructure is proven. For those looking to balance their portfolio with a project that’s stood the test of time, LTC still holds appeal. As a contender for the best crypto for quick profit, it may trail Qubetics and Toncoin in short-term hype—but sometimes, patience pays bigger than speed. Why These 3 Projects Matter Now More Than Ever Crypto isn’t about luck—it’s about timing and information. Qubetics offers raw potential with a proven model, wrapped in a smart presale structure. Toncoin is surging with real strength, fueled by growing adoption and bullish technicals. Litecoin, while under pressure, remains a staple—steady, reliable, and quietly essential in regions that need fast and stable payments. This April 2025 window is short—and wide open. Whether it’s Qubetics’ game-ready interoperability, Toncoin’s bullish wave, or Litecoin’s time-tested network, these aren’t coins to ignore. They’re engines. And right now, the throttle is up. For community members seeking the best crypto for quick profit , the next move should be strategic—not delayed. Dive deep, decide fast, and take your place ahead of the shift.

Qubetics is built for interoperability and real-world problem-solving, making it attractive for early buyers. Its $0.1430 presale price offers massive upside potential. Why is Toncoin gaining momentum in April 2025? Toncoin recently broke the $4 resistance, with a 35.86% rise in open interest. Technical indicators point to continued bullish momentum, increasing market confidence. Is Litecoin still a good crypto to hold despite recent dips?

The ACT team emphasized the crash was market-driven, not due to project flaws. This incident has raised concerns about the risks of sudden exchange policy changes on token stability. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT), a token associated with the eponymous project focused on artificial intelligence, released a post-mortem about the fall of their token on Wednesday.. On Tuesday, the token experienced a sudden and severe price drop, plunging 58% from $0.19 to $0.08 in less than an hour. According to CoinGecko data , the token’s market capitalization shed $96 million. ACT Team Addresses Crash, Says Liquidations Triggered Sell-Off The sharp decline coincided with Binance’s update to leverage and margin tiers for multiple tokens, including ACT. The adjustment triggered a wave of liquidations, with blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reporting that a whale was liquidated for $3.79 million at $0.1877. The impact of these liquidations intensified selling pressure across the market. In response, Act I addressed the community, assuring that the project was investigating the situation and working with the relevant parties, before then releasing this latest report. Post Mortem Dear ACT Community, Over the past 24 hours, the ACT token experienced a significant and sudden price drop. We want to address the incident transparently and provide context. As you know, we are a community-driven project with no centralized leadership, and our… — Act I : The AI Prophecy (@ACTICOMMUNITY) April 2, 2025 According to the team, Binance’s leverage adjustments were announced with short notice, forcing traders and market makers with large positions to close or downsize, leading to cascading sell-offs. Binance’s preliminary findings indicated that four users, including three VIP traders and one non-VIP, collectively sold over $1 million worth of ACT on the Binance spot market, accelerating the price decline. Act I emphasized that the crash was not due to any internal failure or fundamental flaw in the project. “No single party appears to have profited disproportionately from this sequence of trades,” the team stated. It also clarified that the full circulating supply of ACT is live on the open market, meaning centralized exchanges like Binance cannot restrict user behavior once tokens are held in personal accounts. Despite the turbulence, Act I reaffirmed its commitment to its long-term mission of integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized ecosystems. “Although we are unable to directly impact the price of the token, we remain focused on our core mission: to build real AI infrastructure for Web3,” the team stated. Regardless of recent price action, $ACT 's vision extends far beyond market fluctuations. While volatility is inevitable in crypto markets, our team's commitment to building remains unwavering. Our mission has never changed: to serve as the definitive bridge between AI & crypto… — Act I : The AI Prophecy (@ACTICOMMUNITY) April 2, 2025 The project plans to present its developments at Token2049 later this month. Act I acknowledged the frustration among its holders but remained steadfast in its goals. “This incident, while difficult, does not change our fundamentals, our partnerships, or our long-term vision,” the statement read. “If anything, it has made us double down on decentralization, transparency, and resilience.” As the project works to regroup after this market event, the token’s price continues to face pressure in the broader market. ACT Token Bleeds 70% in a Week, CZ Urges AI Projects to Build First The sell-off in Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) has intensified, with the token plunging 37.4% in the past hour and down 70.8% over the last week, according to CoinGecko . Source: CoinGecko Currently trading at $0.05643, ACT has lost nearly 94% from its all-time high of $0.9198, though it remains 340% above its lowest price. Market activity has also declined, with 24-hour trading volume dropping 21.6% to $477.7 million. Amid the turmoil, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has weighed in on the broader AI and crypto intersection, criticizing AI projects that prioritize token launches over real utility . In a post on X, CZ stated that “many AI agent developers focus too much on their token rather than the agent’s actual usefulness.” Too many AI agent developers focus too much on their token and not enough on the agent's usefulness. I recommend making a really good agent first. Only launch a token when there is product-market fit. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) April 2, 2025 He urged teams to build a strong product first and only introduce a token after achieving product-market fit. His remarks echo previous criticisms of AI-focused crypto projects. On March 17, he argued that while crypto can serve as the currency for AI, most AI agents don’t need their own tokens. Looking forward, he suggested charging fees in existing cryptocurrencies so AI project teams could focus on real-world adoption instead of token performance. The ACT token crash shows the delicate interplay between exchange policies, market dynamics, and project fundamentals in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While factors like leverage adjustments can trigger immediate price movements, long-term project viability ultimately depends on delivering real utility. As the dust settles on this particular event, the broader conversation about responsible tokenomics and the relationship between centralized exchanges and token projects is likely to intensify across the industry.

This claim led to a sharp drop in the price of FDUSD, which was supposed to be pegged at $1, dropping to as low as $0.87. While the token has since recovered somewhat, it has not fully returned to its intended $1 parity. Following the market backlash, Sun issued a new statement reiterating his concerns about First Digital Trust (FDT) and its operations. In his latest statements, Sun claimed that FDT had failed to meet customer fund repayments and was effectively insolvent. Despite this, he claimed that the company continued to operate as a public trust in Hong Kong, suggesting significant legal loopholes. Expressing strong concerns about the integrity of Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem, Sun said: “As seen in the case of FDT, there appear to be obvious loopholes in the trust industry in Hong Kong to circumvent financial and banking regulations. These will not only pose a risk to the public, but also jeopardise Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial centre.” He called on regulators and law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong to take decisive action to address these issues and prevent further financial risks to the public. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Makes First Official Statement on FDUSD Drop In addition to raising regulatory concerns, Sun noted that TUSD stablecoin Techteryx is actively pursuing legal action against FDT: “I am determined to support Techteryx and ensure that all scammers are held under the full force of the law. Never again should they be allowed to defraud the public under the guise of a licensed entity in Hong Kong or elsewhere.” At the time of writing, the FDUSD price is trading at $0.9795 and is extremely volatile.

We would like to remind you that all cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, are high risk and that there is a high risk of losing all invested money, including the principal.

We’re in the golden age of digital memes-as-assets between Arctic Pablo Coin’s mystical expedition and the meme coin frenzy driven by projects like Fartcoin and Dogwifhat. Investors are chasing the top new meme coins to join now—not tomorrow, not next week, but right now—as early entries offer mind-blowing returns that traditional markets can’t imagine. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) leads this wave, a project that isn’t just a coin—it’s an adventure wrapped in mystery, scarcity, and some serious ROI juice. It’s unlike anything the meme coin world has seen before. Think frozen tundras, forgotten treasures, and a snowmobile-riding explorer who’s out to share the wealth. Arctic Pablo Coin – Unlock Hidden Mysteries and 9,084.48% ROI Potential In the land where glaciers whisper ancient secrets and snowstorms shield long-lost treasure, Arctic Pablo surges ahead with a mission unlike any other meme coin. He’s not just minting tokens—he’s revealing the undiscovered. The current chapter? Glacial Glade—the 17th hidden location in a saga that has captivated early investors. Forget “phases.” Arctic Pablo’s presale unfolds like a quest. With every location Pablo reaches, a new treasure trove of opportunities opens up. Those who joined him early have already seen wild gains—and now, at just $0.000087, the window to secure 5,747,125 APCs for a $500 investment is wide open. And once it hits its launch price of $0.008, that same investment could grow to $45,977. That’s the kind of life-changing math meme coin hunters dream of. And it gets better. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about fast flips. With 66% APY staking, investors can stake their APC and earn passive rewards while being part of an ever-expanding legend. All staked tokens will be vested for two months from launch, ensuring a stable and rewarding ecosystem. Arctic Pablo features weekly token burns to maintain long-term growth, slicing away unsold tokens to increase scarcity and boost value. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), it supports various payment methods—from BTC and ETH to SOLANA and XRP—making it wildly accessible. No traditional stages. No boring roadmaps. Just a storytelling-driven economy where Pablo charts new territories, unearthing ROI opportunities and captivating a community that’s all-in on the journey. Top new meme coins to join now ? Arctic Pablo is not just on the list—it’s rewriting the rules. This might be the last moment to join before the price jumps with the next location. Every new step forward means fewer tokens, higher demand, and a bigger price tag. Get in before the story changes. Fartcoin – Blowing Up in All the Right Ways Not every meme coin needs to take itself seriously. And Fartcoin ($FART)? It’s the loudest example. In a market full of polished whitepapers and stiff branding, Fartcoin cuts through the noise with its unapologetically immature humor—and somehow, it’s working like magic. Fartcoin took the crypto world by storm, launching on the Ethereum blockchain with an irreverent and clever mission: to become the king of comedy coins. With a max supply of 69,000,000,000 FARTs, it’s clear they’re leaning hard into the meme culture. And with over $15 million in trading volume during its peak debut week, the market is responding. Unlike other joke coins, Fartcoin has built a loyal, rowdy community fueling its growth on socials like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Discord. They’re turning fart memes into fuel for financial gain, creating viral challenges, and even teasing a P2E fart battle game that’s reportedly in the works. Dogwifhat – When the Internet’s Favorite Pup Meets Market Madness Dogwifhat (WIF) isn’t just a meme coin. It’s a movement powered by the internet’s collective obsession with Shiba Inu aesthetics, chaotic humor, and the ever-ironic “dog with a hat” meme. What started as a joke became one of the fastest-growing Solana meme coins, and it’s still running hot. Dogwifhat skyrocketed after listing on major exchanges, including Binance and OKX, giving it a huge liquidity boost. It reached a market cap of over $2 billion at its peak, positioning itself as one of the most successful meme coins launched recently. With a community-driven approach, Dogwifhat keeps its roadmap loose but ambitious. It’s all about virality and vibes, from meme contests to merchandise drops and community grants. Holders don’t just support a token—they become part of a cultural moment constantly evolving in real-time. Final Thoughts: The Meme Coin Moment Is Now Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is experiencing an unprecedented boom. Between the mystical journey of Arctic Pablo Coin, the chaotic comedy of Fartcoin, and the viral dog-energy of Dogwifhat, there’s never been a better moment to explore the top new meme coins to join now.

Cuomo, a New York-registered attorney, advised OKX on legal issues stemming from the probe sometime after August 2021 when he resigned as New York overnor, Bloomberg reported on April 2, citing people familiar with the matter. “He spoke with company executives regularly and counseled them on how to respond to the criminal investigation,” Bloomberg said. The Seychelles-based firm pled guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business in violation of US Anti-Money Laundering laws on Feb. 24 and agreed to pay $84 million worth of penalties while forfeiting $421 million worth of fees earned from mostly institutional clients. The breaches occurred from 2018 to 2024 despite OKX having an official policy preventing US persons from transacting on its crypto exchange since 2017, the Department of Justice noted at the time. A spokesperson for Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, told Bloomberg that Cuomo has been providing private legal services representing individuals and corporations on a variety of matters since resigning as New York governor. “He has not represented clients before a New York city or state agency and routinely recommends former colleagues for positions,” Azzopardi added. OKX reportedly wasn’t willing to comment on its relationships with outside firms. Cuomo also influenced OKX to make executive appointments: Bloomberg Cuomo, who is now running for mayor of New York City, also advised OKX to appoint his friend US Attorney Linda Lacewell to OKX’s board of directors, Bloomberg said. Lacewell, a former superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, was added to the board in 2024 and was named OKX’s new chief legal officer on April 1, according to a recent company statement. Source: Linda Lacewell Related: New York bill aims to protect crypto investors from memecoin rug pulls After the investigation concluded, OKX said it would seek out a compliance consultant to remedy the issues stemming from the federal probe and bolster its regulatory compliance program. “Our vision is to make OKX the gold standard of global compliance at scale across different markets and their respective regulatory bodies,” OKX CEO Star Xu said in a Feb. 24 X post.

Pi Coin is falling rapidly, SUI is slowly recovering, and BlockDAG is moving forward with strong traction. While Pi Coin battles to maintain credibility during a massive token unlock, and SUI gains momentum from possible institutional backing, BlockDAG is steadily delivering on its goals. With the Beta Testnet now active, a $60K prize pool launched, and over $210.5 million collected in presale stages, BDAG is showing real-world progress. Unlike the uncertainty surrounding Pi and SUI, BlockDAG’s structure, with its engaged community and growing testnet utilities, places it ahead. The question now isn’t whether BDAG will rise, but how far it can go. Pi Coin’s Price Crash: Can It Recover After the Token Release? Pi Coin is currently seeing a steep decline, with a 30% drop this week pushing it down the charts and out of the top 30. The price now stands at $0.77—far below its recent high, cutting billions from its overall market value. Experts believe it may fall further, with $0.60 as the next crucial level. The market is bracing for a supply spike as 105.96 million Pi Coins are expected to be released within 30 days. A major unlock of 6.8 million is scheduled for April 3, raising concerns of more selling pressure. Another source of concern is the lack of a Binance listing, despite ongoing support from the Pi community. Yet, some traders believe a reversal could be on the horizon. Technical indicators suggest a potential surge, and if momentum flips, Pi Coin may climb back near $5. With current low prices, some are considering this a dip worth buying. SUI’s Price Recovery: Will It Continue Climbing After $2.40? SUI is gaining attention again with a 10% rise this week, crossing the important $2.40 mark. After hitting a recent low of $1.96, it has bounced back, driven by growing institutional interest and speculation about a possible SUI ETF. This Wednesday, SUI briefly reached $2.65 before pulling back, pointing to strong upward pressure. Experts suggest that a break from its long-standing wedge formation could fuel further gains. If it stays above $2.40, the next levels to watch are $2.80 and possibly its January peak of $5.37. SUI has a track record of major moves after such technical breakouts. With large firms showing interest, the possibility of another price jump is back on the table. For many, the current rally is a signal to act before the next potential run-up. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Launch: Reward Pool Live as Mainnet Nears BlockDAG (BDAG) has crossed a major development milestone by activating its Beta Testnet, as presented in its third Keynote. This step brings the project closer to its mainnet rollout. To add to the progress, BlockDAG has unveiled a $60,000 reward pool, encouraging participation from its already large base of over 170,000 members. The presale is now in Batch 27, offering BDAG at $0.0248. So far, more than 210.5 million dollars have been raised, and over 19 billion BDAG coins have been purchased. Those who bought at the initial $0.001 price point have already seen a 2,380% potential return, placing BDAG among the strongest presale performers in recent history. Performance-wise, the Beta Testnet has doubled in speed compared to its alpha stage. New updates include an improved blockchain explorer and a user-friendly Token & NFT Wizard that allows anyone to build tokens without coding knowledge. According to CEO Antony Turner, this testnet phase plays a key role in refining the network before the official mainnet release. What sets BlockDAG apart is its approach to rewarding active users. Top contributors, whether they’re miners, high-balance holders, or frequent wallet users, receive recognition and benefits. The platform is growing quickly, boasting over 800,000 users on the X1 Miner App and more than 400,000 in the TG Tap Miner Game. With presale funds now above $210.5 million, BlockDAG is setting itself up as one of the most strategically prepared blockchain projects, pointing to a major mainnet launch expected in 2025. Final Remarks! Speed and progress matter in crypto, and BlockDAG is moving faster than the rest. Pi Coin continues to face high selling volumes, while SUI is still building on early signs of recovery. In contrast, BDAG’s Beta Testnet is already up and running, rewarding participants and fine-tuning its platform ahead of its 2025 mainnet launch. The $60K Testnet reward pool isn’t just an incentive—it’s a way to test and strengthen the system under real usage. Combined with 800K+ X1 Miner users and presale funding that now exceeds $210.5M, BlockDAG is not just another altcoin contender—it’s shaping up to be the leading project to watch. While Pi and SUI work to regain momentum, BlockDAG continues to push forward.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 889,000 YouTube subscribers that the S&P 500 may continue to show weakness in April, which, based on historical precedence, may result in ETH also declining. “What I’m wondering is what happens if you do see the S&P 500 continue to show weakness into early to mid-April? Remember, we said there’s going to be weakness by the stock market between February OPEX (Option Expiration Week) and March OPEX. We got that, but I also said there’s a possibility that it could extend into early to mid-April as well before there’s a larger counter-trend rally. And the reasons for that could be due to tariff uncertainty on April 2nd. It could also just simply be due to, there’s a lot of macro data coming out in early to mid-April that I think the markets are going to be interested in. And one of the reasons I think the markets are going to be interested in it is because with all these tariffs, it could potentially have an effect on inflation.” Cowen says ETH may drop to its logarithmic trendline, potentially as low as $1,044, amid recessionary pressures, before reclaiming the $3,000 level as support. “I’m just looking over here at ETH/USD [on the weekly chart], and I see a triple top, and I just have to wonder does it ultimately culminate in a recession, where everyone thinks that by the time the recession is declared it’s over, but the reality is the market was pricing it in well ahead of time, so that you get this big drop and then a big move out of it. We’ve been talking about that for a while, and it’s the whole idea that ETH goes home.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube ETH is trading for $1,909 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.

NEAR Protocol and Aptos are advancing with enhancements in scalability and developer support, but tend to require a technical knack from users. BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart by integrating user-friendly tools such as the X1 Miner App, TG Tap Miner game, and no-code token wizards, simplifying entry for most. While NEAR and Aptos focus on performance enhancements, BlockDAG is dedicated to making crypto accessible, bridging the gap between enthusiasts and the general public in ways not yet fully accomplished by the competition. NEAR: Pioneering Sharding and User Benefits NEAR Protocol operates as a sharded Layer 1 blockchain optimized for speed, scalability, and user-friendliness. Its Proof-of-Stake consensus paired with Nightshade sharding processes thousands of transactions each second at low cost and almost immediate finality. This setup not only ensures a fluid developer experience but also strong dApp functionality. NEAR further prioritizes user accessibility through human-readable accounts and straightforward onboarding processes. For those engaged early with NEAR, the rewards have been significant. In the past year, its token value has increased from $2.72 to about $4.90 by March 2025—a rise of 80%. Meanwhile, its market cap has soared to approximately $5.77 billion, ranking NEAR among the top 30 cryptocurrencies worldwide. With ongoing expansions in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world applications, NEAR is continually attracting interest. Predictions suggest a potential rise to $8.21 by year”s end, strengthening confidence in its future and technological prowess. Aptos: High-Performance Layer 1 with Solid Basics Aptos stands as a Layer 1 blockchain engineered for supreme throughput, minimal latency, and enhanced security. It employs the Move programming language—originally crafted at Meta—affording developers secure, adaptable smart contract options. Aptos distinguishes itself with its parallel processing engine and swift transaction finalization, marking it as an effective platform for dApps and business applications. From a financial perspective, Aptos has maintained positive growth. Its token has appreciated about 17% over the past year, hitting near $13.00 in March 2025. Analysts expect the token could peak at $15.23 by the end of the year, with an average of about $13.34, indicating potential growth exceeding 50%. With its consistent progress and strong backing from venture capitalists, Aptos continues to capture attention, positioning itself as a formidable contender against major players like Ethereum and Solana. Its sustained development and increasing ecosystem engagement underscore Aptos as a stable choice in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Makes Crypto Easy for Everyone BlockDAG is redefining how we interact with blockchain technology, aiming to make participating in crypto as straightforward as using your favorite mobile app. Central to this approach are user-friendly tools designed to welcome not only tech-savvy users but everyone. For example, the X1 Miner App , now boasting 800,000 users, simplifies mining BDAG coins to just a few smartphone taps. Similarly, the TG Tap Miner game, available via Telegram, attracts users with its easy play-to-earn model, engaging over 400,000 players who earn while they play. Furthermore, BlockDAG is eliminating the complexities of digital creation. With its no-code token wizard, anyone can create tokens and NFTs without any coding knowledge—perfect for crafting community tokens or launching new collectibles with ease. The impact of these innovations is evident in the numbers. With over 19 billion coins already sold and more than $210 million raised in the presale, BlockDAG”s appeal is undeniable. The price per coin in Batch 27 is $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase for early participants from Batch 1. This shift in approach signals a new era where blockchain is not just accessible but also fun and profitable, paving the way for a diverse and inclusive decentralized future. Making Blockchain Easy for All Despite their advanced capabilities, platforms like NEAR and Aptos primarily cater to developers and experienced crypto users, excelling in speed and scalability but not in ease of use. BlockDAG is changing the game by prioritizing simplicity. With innovations like the X1 App for straightforward mobile mining , the TG Tap Miner game for easy crypto earning, and no-code solutions for token creation, BlockDAG is democratizing blockchain technology. In the race for widespread blockchain adoption, the platform that simplifies technology to make it most accessible will likely lead the way.

FLOKI and Popcat (POPCAT) have seen viral success thanks to meme culture and growing communities. But now, a new contender has entered the arena: Dragoin ($DDGN) . Unlike its Solana and BNB-based peers, Dragoin is blazing its own trail on Ethereum, combining Game of Thrones-inspired fantasy, a live Telegram-based game, and real token utility. Here’s why Dragoin’s public sale—now live at just $0.0000292—could be the meme coin bet of the year, with the potential to outperform even the likes of FLOKI and POPCAT in 2025. Dragoin’s Public Sale Is Live: 6,700% ROI Potential Sparks Buying Frenzy Forget buying into hype after the peak—Dragoin gives you the rare chance to enter early. The public sale is now live, with $DDGN priced at $0.0000292 in Stage 1. With a final launch price of $0.002, early buyers could see a 6,700% return if the token hits its target. That’s not speculation—it’s baked into the presale structure, which spans 25 stages, each one raising the token price while reducing availability. To add more fuel to the fire, all unsold tokens will be permanently burned—no rollovers, no second chances. That built-in deflation mechanism creates an urgency few meme coins can offer. It’s simple: if you wait, you’ll pay more. If you miss out, the opportunity’s gone for good. This deflationary model is designed to favor those who move fast—a stark contrast to coins like FLOKI and POPCAT, where massive circulating supplies can dilute returns. Dragoin isn’t just a coin—it’s a full-blown interactive experience. Players can hatch their own dragons and guide them through a Telegram-based game, dodging obstacles and earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s one of the few meme coins that delivers real-time utility before it hits exchanges. With upcoming roadmap milestones including expanded gameplay, leaderboard competitions, and exchange listings in Q3 2025, Dragoin is building momentum—not just with memes but with engagement. In an era where most meme coins are passive holdings, Dragoin gives users a reason to participate every day. This interactivity is attracting growing social chatter—and history proves social volume is a key trigger for major rallies in the meme coin world. Just look at what happened with FLOKI and PEPE: once the internet took notice, prices soared. FLOKI: Multi-Chain Growth, But Headwinds Ahead FLOKI Inu started as a joke, but it”s now grown into a recognizable brand with real market presence. Its multi-chain functionality—on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain—has been a key strength. Recent data shows FLOKI is trading around $0.00005964, up over 31% in the past month, with analysts forecasting a 2025 range between $0.000066 and $0.000333. The upcoming Valhalla metaverse upgrade in Q1 2025 could give FLOKI a fresh boost. But despite strong derivatives sentiment and a bullish Fear & Greed Index, FLOKI’s large market cap means exponential gains like 1000x are far less likely today than during its early days. Popcat (POPCAT): Viral Sensation, But Treading Water Popcat launched in December 2023 on Solana, built around the viral image of a cat named Oatmeal. At its peak in November 2024, POPCAT reached $2.08—a remarkable climb from its low valuation. Currently trading near $1.65, the coin has already rewarded early backers with over 400% returns. Analysts now forecast POPCAT could reach $2.79 in 2025, and even $5.87 by 2030, depending on adoption and sentiment. But as meme coin fatigue sets in across Solana, growth may slow. Network congestion, token saturation, and declining DEX volumes on Solana are creating headwinds. Which Meme Coin Will Dominate 2025? FLOKI has proven it can build a long-term brand. Popcat gave the market a viral hit. But Dragoin is giving investors what they really want right now—an early-stage chance at outsized returns, backed by real engagement and a play-to-earn model that’s already live. If you missed FLOKI at $0.000005 or POPCAT under $1, this is your shot to catch the next big one early. Dragoin’s public sale is live. The burn is real. The dragons are flying. Grab your $DDGN now—before the next stage hits and prices rise again.

Trump’s new blanket tariffs target a long list of nations and go further than many analysts expected, sparking widespread economic uncertainty and volatility in both traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin’s price has plummeted from a 24-hour high of $87,790 down to $82,223 at time of publishing, with $518 billion in liquidations hitting BTC and the digital asset market at large in the last day, according to CoinGlass. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,000 points in after-hours trading, the S&P 500 futures have dropped by 3.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures have dropped 4.2%. Trump has signed an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, effective April 5th, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. At a Rose Garden address, Trump said the reciprocal tariffs are designed to address decades of unfair trade practices and restore economic fairness for the United States.

After experiencing significant volatility and undergoing a consolidation due to recent price declines, technical indicators now show support for XRP’s bullish outlook. As a result, the analyst has provided a short—and long-term price target for the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Projected To Reverse To $3.5 According to ‘Setupsfx’, a crypto analyst on TradingView, XRP is now in a bullish reversal phase, meaning its price is expected to break out of its recent downturn and rise to new highs. Based on the expert’s chart analysis of XRP, the cryptocurrency is predicted to see an explosive increase to $3.5 following the end of its consolidation phase. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support The chart indicates that the price of XRP is expected to rise to $3.5 in the coming months. However, from a fundamental analysis perspective, the analyst believes XRP is not limited to this bullish price target and could potentially surpass it to exceed current all-time highs of $3.84. While the TradingView expert’s analysis of XRP maintains a neutral stance, implying uncertainty in the trend, he has also emphasized the cryptocurrency’s strong potential for growth. Hence, XRP could experience significant upward movement if market conditions align favorably and investor sentiment and confidence strengthen. For his short-term price target, the crypto analyst forecasts that XRP could rally to a level above $3.5. He advises traders who intend to hold their positions for a short period to aim for this price level, as it could be a strategic exit point before a potential pullback. Notably, the analyst’s long-term price target for XRP has been set at $4.0 or higher. Considering XRP’s price is currently trading at $2.09, a surge to $4 would represent an almost 100% increase in its price. Technical Elements Supporting Bullish Reversal In his chart analysis, Setupsfx highlights XRP’s price action in a 12-hour time frame, showcasing key movements, trends, and technical elements that support his bullish projection. These elements include liquidity and IMB zones, which are areas where price action is expected due to pending orders. Related Reading: XRP Price To $110?

The appearance of strong low wicks further indicates that buyers are regaining control of the market. Finally, the TradingView analyst has indicated that the altcoin has already undergone a three-point trendline rejection, which means it has tested and rejected a resistance level multiple times. The expert’s price chart also provides an ideal entry point for both short and long-term traders, marked at $1.8. A stop loss has also been placed significantly lower around $1.2 to minimize potential losses.
