Galaxy Digital secures FCA approval, expands institutional trading reach in the UK Leon Marshall, chief executive officer of Galaxy Europe, said that the approval is a pivotal achievement for the Galaxy group, as it allows them to deliver innovative trading solutions to institutional clients while maintaining the highest regulatory standards. He noted: “London is a critical financial hub, and this authorisation allows us to deepen our presence in the UK, aligning with our mission to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem.” This FCA authorization represents a significant trading milestone for Galaxy Digital . It contributes to the firm’s established reputation for pioneering trading solutions for an institutional client base while satisfying stringent regulatory requirements. The approval contributes to Galaxy Digital’s growing regulatory footprint. The Company, which is headquartered in New York and has offices in Chicago, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, has a client base that includes over 1,300 institutional trading counterparties. Galaxy Digital expands as the UK strengthens its crypto-friendly stance Galaxy Digital is also planning to expand its workforce to meet the demand for digital asset services. With its roughly 40-employee team based in London, these developments align with the UK’s relatively forward-looking approach to the regulation of crypto assets, making the UK a destination for high investment and innovation. ​ Galaxy sees the FCA license as a major milestone that will enhance the company’s compliance efforts. It also positions the digital asset and blockchain firm to meet rising demand from the rapidly expanding institutional investor market. Marshall says the UK government has created a thriving environment for transformative technologies like digital assets. He believes the country is on the right track, with a strong push to attract innovation capital. He added that this clarity is drawing top talent, investment, and innovation to the region, bolstered by the nation’s deep talent pool, world-class academic institutions, and entrepreneurial spirit. Galaxy Digital recently made headlines after the New York Attorney General revealed a $200 million settlement over its involvement with LUNA. The firm also attracted bullish sentiment with its announcement of a 15-year artificial intelligence hosting deal with CoreWeave. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital’s derivatives trading license approval by the FCA comes amid a growing wave of institutional interest in digital assets. Traditional finance companies have also sought the FCA’s approval as crypto asset firms in the UK. One of the notable companies on this list is asset management giants like BlackRock.

After a five-year wait, CoinList , a prominent name in the cryptocurrency exchange and launchpad arena, is making a sensational comeback to the U.S. market. For those who’ve felt locked out due to political and regulatory hurdles, this news is nothing short of a breath of fresh air. But what exactly does this mean for you, and why should you be excited? Let’s dive into the details of CoinList’s triumphant return and explore the opportunities it unlocks. Why is CoinList US Returning Now? The big question on everyone’s mind is, why now? For half a decade, U.S.-based users have been on the sidelines, unable to access CoinList’s services. The platform cited political circumstances and regulatory issues as the reasons for their absence. Navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation in the United States has been a significant challenge for many cryptocurrency platforms. However, it seems the tides are turning, or at least, CoinList believes they have found a viable path forward. While specific details regarding the changed circumstances remain under wraps, this relaunch strongly suggests a more favorable regulatory environment or perhaps a refined strategy by CoinList to operate within the existing framework. This return signals a potentially positive shift in the accessibility of cryptocurrency platforms for US users. It suggests that despite the hurdles, there are pathways for platforms like CoinList to offer their services while adhering to regulatory requirements. This could pave the way for other platforms to reconsider or expand their operations in the US market, fostering greater competition and innovation. CoinList: More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Exchange For those unfamiliar, CoinList isn’t just another cryptocurrency exchange . It’s a platform renowned for its role as a launchpad for promising new crypto projects. Think of it as a springboard that propels innovative blockchain ventures into the crypto sphere. CoinList has a track record of hosting token sales for some of the most successful and well-known projects in the crypto space. This includes names like Filecoin, Solana, and Flow, all of which gained significant traction and are now major players in the industry. Here’s what makes CoinList stand out: Launchpad Expertise: CoinList specializes in identifying and launching high-potential crypto projects. Their rigorous vetting process aims to bring quality projects to their community. Early Access Opportunities: Participating in token sales on CoinList often provides early access to tokens at potentially favorable prices before they hit mainstream exchanges.

With its return to the US, US investors now regain access to this unique platform and the opportunities it offers. This is particularly exciting for those looking to get in on the ground floor of promising crypto projects. Token Sale Alert: DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) To mark its U.S. relaunch, CoinList is immediately jumping into action with a token sale for the DoubleZero Foundation (2Z). According to reports from The Block, this sale is scheduled to run from April 2nd to April 22nd. This isn’t just a symbolic event; it’s a real opportunity for accredited investors in the U.S. to participate in a new token offering right out of the gate. Key details of the DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) Token Sale: Aspect Details Project DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) Platform CoinList Sale Dates April 2nd – April 22nd Eligibility Accredited Investors in the U.S. If you are an accredited investor in the U.S. and are looking to explore new investment opportunities in the crypto space, this token sale on CoinList US is something you should definitely investigate further. Remember to conduct thorough research on the DoubleZero Foundation and the 2Z token to make an informed investment decision. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Investors? CoinList’s return is a significant win for US investors .

CoinList’s return opens doors to future token sales and project launches, providing US investors with more diverse investment options within the crypto ecosystem. Increased Competition: CoinList’s presence in the US market can foster healthy competition among cryptocurrency exchanges and launchpads, potentially leading to better services and more innovative offerings for users. Positive Market Signal: This move could be interpreted as a positive signal regarding the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US, potentially encouraging further growth and adoption. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and investing in token sales carries risks. Always conduct your own due diligence, understand the projects you are investing in, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities The cryptocurrency industry in the US has been navigating a complex and often unclear crypto regulation environment. Different agencies have varying perspectives, and the rules are still evolving. This has led to uncertainty and challenges for platforms operating in the space, as evidenced by CoinList’s previous withdrawal from the US market. CoinList is Back in the USA! CoinList’s return suggests that either the regulatory climate is becoming more accommodating, or platforms are finding innovative ways to comply and operate within the existing rules. This could involve strategies such as focusing on accredited investors initially, implementing robust KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) procedures, and carefully structuring token sales to comply with securities regulations. While challenges remain, CoinList’s re-entry is a positive sign. It indicates that despite the regulatory hurdles, there are opportunities for growth and expansion within the US crypto market. This could encourage more platforms to engage with regulators, seek clarity, and work towards establishing a sustainable and compliant crypto ecosystem in the United States. Conclusion: A New Chapter for CoinList and US Crypto CoinList’s return to the U.S. market after a five-year hiatus marks a significant and exciting development for the American cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a triumphant comeback that not only benefits US investors by providing them with access to a leading launchpad and cryptocurrency exchange , but also signals a potentially more favorable environment for crypto innovation in the United States.

Historical market trends offer insights into how SHIB price could react if Ripple (XRP) price races towards the $5 mark in the months ahead. Will Ripple (XRP) Rally Impact Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price? Ripple’s XRP remains one of the most relevant crypto altcoins in 2025, with market watchers speculating on out it potential long-term price trajectory could impact prominent memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Ripple (XRP) Price Action, April 2, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple price is currently consolidating above the $2 level according to CoinMarketCap data. If it reaches the $5 milestone, it would mark a significant achievement, exceeding its current all time high of $3.84 recorded back in 2018. Based on recent market reports, XRP’s potential growth drivers in 2025 include institutional adoption from Spot ETF filings, regulatory clarity from the ongoing US Stablecoin Bill review by the US Congress, and expanding use cases for Ripple’s RLUSD blockchain-based payment solutions. A rally to $5 would push XRP’s market capitalization beyond $250 billion, potentially sparking renewed institutional interest in the broader crypto market. But, historically, when large-cap altcoins experience parabolic gains, capital rotations into mid-cap and small-cap assets, such as memecoins like Shiba Inu, tend to follow. Historical Correlation Between XRP and Shiba Inu Shiba Inu price action has often shown a tendency to react to major market shifts, particularly during bullish altcoin cycles. In the 2021 bull run, SHIB experienced an explosive rally alongside XRP and other major altcoins, fueled by increased retail participation and speculative trading. This trend repeated in 2024, when SHIB price surged by more than 100% in Q3 2024 after Donald Trump won the US elections in November. Shiba Inu prices is current holding steady above the $0.000012 mark as of Wednesday, April 2. If XRP price reaches $5, it could signal an extended altcoin season, leading to increased demand for speculative assets like SHIB. Additionally, memecoins often benefit from surges in retail enthusiasm, social media trends, and whale accumulation. However, SHIB’s price action will also depend on independent factors, including burn rate efficiency, ecosystem developments, and overall sentiment in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Price Projections If XRP Hits $5 At press time on April 2, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000012, with a market capitalization of $7.14 billion. If XRP’s surge triggers broader altcoin momentum, SHIB could see notable upside. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action, April 2, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Here are possible scenarios for Shiba Inu price forecast based on historical trends and capital flow dynamics: Conservative Target: $0.000015 – $0.000017, if SHIB experiences a moderate reaction from XRP’s gains, supported by increased risk appetite in altcoins. Moderate Bullish Target: $0.000020 – $0.000025, if memecoins gain traction alongside XRP, and increased whale accumulation occurs) Parabolic Scenario: $0.000035, if SHIB benefits from a major jump in speculative trading from large investors along with persistent token burns. Key Market Risks Ahead While an XRP rally to $5 could provide positive momentum for Shiba Inu, several external factors will influence its trajectory: Bitcoin’s Market Direction: BTC’s performance often dictates overall market sentiment. Shiba Inu Burn Rate: A sustained burn mechanism can create supply shocks, positively impacting price. Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rate decisions and regulatory clarity could affect investor risk appetite. Social Media Hype & Whale Activity: SHIB’s price remains sensitive to retail-driven momentum and large transactions from whales. In Summary If XRP price reaches $5, it could trigger an altcoin rally, potentially benefiting Shiba Inu Inu price action. While historical data suggests SHIB price could gain from heightened market speculation, its trajectory will depend on broader crypto market trends, fundamental developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and continued investor interest. Along with XRP price action, strategic Shiba Inu traders would watch key resistance levels around $0.000015, for confirmation, while also monitoring Bitcoin’s price movement, and broader macroeconomic signals to gauge SHIB’s potentia price breakout scenarios.

The announcement came during what he labeled “Liberation Day,” when he unveiled a plan to apply baseline tariffs of 10% to all countries and higher rates on selected nations. The latest 34% US tariffs on China add to an existing 20% charge tied to fentanyl trafficking and to tariffs already on items such as solar panels. This means many imports from China may face rates above 50%. Trump described the new approach as a way to make foreign nations pay “for the privilege of selling in the US market.” He argued that while the United States could have matched tariff rates dollar for dollar, his administration chose a lower figure to show restraint. “The tariffs wil l be not a full reciprocal,” he said. “I could have done that yes, it would have been tough for a lot of countries. We didn’t want to do that.” Trump announcing the list of countries for reciprocal US tariffs on “Liberation Day”. Source: Fox 35 Orlando, Youtube In his remarks, Trump emphasized that China has not always provided fair access to American goods and services. “They charge us, we charge them less, so how can anybody be upset?” he said. He suggested that in earlier years, the US had been more successful in trade but had lost ground recently. “We had a great country four years ago in terms of the economics, and we were doubling up on China. Nobody was going to catch us but so much of it slipped away in the last four years under Biden,” he said. Trump recalled that seven years ago, the United States collected “hundreds and billions of dollars” in tariffs from China and said Chinese leaders understood why Washington felt it needed to take firm action. “President Xi, he understood. They all understand that we are gonna have to go through tough love maybe. They are ripping us off, and they understood it,” he said. China has taken steps to restrict local companies from investing in the US According to a Bloomberg report , China’s National Development and Reform Commission instructed several of its branches to suspend registrations and approvals for any firms planning to invest in the US. The exact timing of these steps and the duration of the suspension remain unclear. China has long placed certain limits on overseas investments for reasons linked to national security and concerns about capital outflows, but these new restrictions come at a time of heightened trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Official data put Chinese outbound investments into the US at $6.9 billion in 2023. It is not apparent whether existing commitments or major financial holdings, such as China’s US Treasury purchases, would be affected. Although this new restriction is mainly focused on corporate investment in the US, it throws another element of uncertainty into global trade as firms look for ways to move production or strike alternative deals to avoid the effects of new barriers. The situation further complicates relations between China and the US, especially with the freshly announced 34% tariffs. China couldn’t dodge US tariffs In an apparent last-ditch effort to ease tensions, China’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily, published an article highlighting the benefits that US farmers and technology companies have gained from trade with China. The piece, credited to “Zhong Sheng,” a pen name that translates to “Voice of China,” underlined how US agricultural imports have helped American growers and addressed China’s own demand. This commentary arrived before Trump’s announcement of global tariffs. Observers noted that the piece was the second in a series looking at China-US ties, timed alongside the president’s plan to finalize his reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Bloomberg reported that some saw the article as a way for Beijing to remind Washington of the economic upsides of working with China. John Gong, once a consultant to China’s Commerce Ministry and now a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said: “This article appears to be Beijing’s last effort to avert Trump’s tariffs against China in the hope of changing his mind.” China has hinted towards further retaliation in trade tariffs A previous article on Monday showcased how China’s market scale and production abilities benefited high-profile American companies like Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. While the piece argued for cooperation and mutual gains, it also laid out areas where China could retaliate. Beijing has already targeted US agricultural and energy goods in response to the 20% blanket tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese products earlier this year. Authorities also investigated Alphabet Inc.’s Google and placed US gene-sequencing company Illumina Inc. on a blacklist of entities under special scrutiny. At the diplomatic level, China has been vocal in its criticism of the tariffs, with its top envoy calling on Trump to remove them. Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to the Russian state-run outlet RIA Novosti on Tuesday, saying the US duties cited China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis without adequate evidence. “If the US side persists in exerting pressure and even continues to engage in blackmail, China will resolutely counteract it,” Wang stated. Analysts caution that these moves could be the start of prolonged trade disagreements as both nations show signs of readiness for further escalation. Some expect more Chinese efforts to protect local industries and control where capital flows. In contrast, others believe Washington may add new duties or expand enforcement actions against products that Trump deems unfairly traded. For now, the 34% reciprocal tariff stands out as a steep figure, though Trump insists it is lower than what he could have imposed to match China’s rates.

42821856,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145735,1743634201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Intriguing Twist: Elon Musk’s Shocking Exit from Public Office After DOGE Role,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/elon-musk-public-office-doge/,"In a surprising turn of events, the cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the news that tech mogul Elon Musk will be stepping down from any potential future in public office. This revelation comes on the heels of his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that, while perhaps unconventional, had many speculating about Musk’s broader political ambitions. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s recent statement on X, as reported by Sina Finance, has definitively put these speculations to rest. But what does this mean for the future of Dogecoin, the crypto market, and Musk’s influence within these spheres? Let’s dive into the details. Elon Musk’s Departure from Public Office: A Definitive Stance The announcement, delivered via social media and traditional news outlets, leaves no room for ambiguity: Elon Musk will not be transitioning into a career in public service after his stint at DOGE. This confirmation aligns with previous assertions from both Musk himself and former President Trump, painting a consistent picture of Musk’s intentions. While his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) might have sparked curiosity and debate, it appears to be a unique chapter rather than a prelude to a political saga. Here’s a quick rundown of the key points: Official Confirmation: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Musk’s exit on X. Consistent Messaging: Musk and former President Trump previously indicated Musk’s lack of interest in public office. DOGE Role Limited: Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency was a specific role, not a stepping stone to further political positions. Focus on Private Sector: This announcement reinforces Musk’s continued dedication to his private ventures and technological pursuits. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin? Given Elon Musk’s well-known affinity for Dogecoin, it’s natural to wonder how his decision to stay out of public office might impact the popular meme-coin. Musk’s tweets and endorsements have historically sent Dogecoin’s price on rollercoaster rides. While his political decisions might seem indirectly related to cryptocurrency, Musk’s overall influence on public sentiment and market trends is undeniable. His focus remaining in the private sector, particularly with companies like Tesla and SpaceX, could mean continued, albeit perhaps less politically charged, engagement with Dogecoin and the broader crypto space. Analyzing the Impact on the Cryptocurrency Landscape The broader cryptocurrency market is always sensitive to news involving influential figures like Elon Musk. While this announcement isn’t directly crypto-related policy, it does clarify Musk’s direction. Some might have anticipated a scenario where Musk could leverage a public office to influence crypto regulations or policies. With that possibility now off the table, the market may adjust its expectations. However, Musk’s influence as a tech innovator and business leader remains potent. His companies’ potential adoption of cryptocurrencies, or his continued commentary on digital assets, will likely continue to shape market sentiment. Consider these aspects: Factor Potential Impact on Crypto Musk not in public office Reduced speculation of direct political influence on crypto policy by Musk. Musk’s continued private sector focus Potential for ongoing crypto integration within his companies (Tesla, SpaceX, etc.). Musk’s social media presence Likely to remain a significant, albeit potentially less politically angled, driver of crypto market sentiment. Public Office and the Road Not Taken The concept of public office often conjures images of political power and policy-making influence. For someone like Elon Musk, known for disrupting industries and challenging norms, the idea of entering this arena was intriguing to many. His DOGE role, however unconventional, seemed to flirt with this possibility. Now, with the confirmation of his exit, we see a clear path chosen – one that remains rooted in the entrepreneurial and technological realms rather than the political one. This decision might be seen as a strategic move to maximize his impact through innovation and business, areas where he has already established a formidable presence. Navigating the Crypto Market After the Announcement The crypto market is known for its volatility and responsiveness to news and trends. While Musk’s decision isn’t a direct market catalyst in itself, it removes one layer of uncertainty – the ‘what if’ of Musk in politics. Investors and enthusiasts can now refocus on other fundamental factors driving the market, such as technological advancements, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Dogecoin, in particular, might see some recalibration as the market digests this news and assesses the future drivers of its value, independent of potential political affiliations of its most prominent supporter. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Monitor Market Reactions: Keep an eye on how Dogecoin and the broader crypto market react in the days following this announcement. Focus on Fundamentals: Shift focus to the underlying technology, adoption rates, and regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t rely solely on celebrity endorsements or political speculation when making investment decisions in the crypto space. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with credible news sources and market analysis to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Musk’s Future Path and Crypto’s Trajectory Elon Musk’s decision to forgo public office clarifies his trajectory and removes a layer of speculation from the cryptocurrency narrative. While his influence on Dogecoin and the crypto market remains significant, it will likely continue to be exerted through his private ventures and public commentary rather than political channels. For the crypto community, this news underscores the importance of focusing on the core principles and developments within the blockchain and digital asset space. The market will continue to evolve, driven by innovation, adoption, and regulatory frameworks, with or without the direct political involvement of figures like Elon Musk. The future remains exciting and full of potential, even as certain paths are clarified and others remain open.

The registration, announced on Tuesday , comes after a multi-year process that required exchanges to meet higher standards for investor protection and governance. Kraken said it worked closely with Canadian regulators during this pre-registration phase, upgrading its compliance systems and internal controls to meet expectations set by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). To lead its Canadian expansion, Kraken named Cynthia Del Pozo as general manager for North America. Del Pozo, a fintech and operations veteran, will oversee strategy, regulatory engagement and business development across the region. “Canada is at a turning point for crypto adoption,” said Del Pozo in a statement, pointing to growing interest from both retail and institutional investors. A recent survey cited by Kraken found that 30% of Canadian investors currently hold crypto assets. Kraken also announced it will offer free Interac e-Transfer deposits for Canadian users, a move aimed at reducing friction for newcomers to the platform. The exchange claims it doubled its team and user base in Canada over the last two years and now manages over $2 billion CAD in client assets.

42822281,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ey-updates-ethereum-scaler-nightfall-zk-rollup,1743634800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,EY updates privacy L2 as nixed Tornado Cash sanctions ease fears,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ey-updates-ethereum-scaler-nightfall-zk-rollup?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Big Four accounting firm EY, formerly Ernst & Young, has changed its enterprise-focused Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Nightfall to a zero-knowledge rollup design as it says corporate clients are more comfortable with privacy solutions with easing US sanctions. EY said in an April 2 announcement that Nightfall’s new source code, “Nightfall_4,” simplifies the network’s architecture and offers near-instant transaction finality on Ethereum while making it more accessible to users than its previous optimistic rollup-based version. EY’s global blockchain leader, Paul Brody, told Cointelegraph that switching to a ZK-rollup model “means instant finality, but it also makes operations simpler since you don’t need a challenger node to secure the network,” which verifies the correctness of transactions. The move away from optimistic rollups means Nightfall users won’t need to challenge potentially incorrect transactions on Ethereum and wait out the challenging period, leading to faster transaction finality. No such feature is present with zero-knowledge rollups, meaning that a transaction becomes final as soon as it is added into a Nightfall block, EY said. It is the fourth major update to Nightfall since EY launched the business-focused Ethereum layer 2 in 2019. Nightfall enables the firm’s business partners to transfer tokens privately using Ethereum’s security while being cheaper than the base network. It also uses a technology that binds a verified identity to a public key through digital signatures to try to stem counterparty risk. Nixed Tornado Cash sanctions “helped people feel comfortable” Brody said the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions on the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash “had a chilling effect on legitimate business user interest.” “Even though we long ago took steps to make Nightfall unattractive to bad actors, since it cannot be used anonymously, the removal of OFAC sanctions has really helped people feel comfortable that using a privacy technology will not be risky,” he added. Nightfall’s code is open source on GitHub but remains a permissioned blockchain for EY’s customer base, competing with the likes of the IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and the Consensus-built Quorum. Brody said that EY’s blockchain team is working toward “a single environment that supports payments, logic, and composability.” Currently, the firm requires Nightfall and Starlight, a tool that can change smart contract code to enable zero-knowledge proofs “to enable complex multiparty business agreements under privacy,” he added. “We’ll spend some time supporting Nightfall_4 deployments initially,” Brody said. “Then we’ll move on to the development of Nightfall_5.” Magazine: What are native rollups?

Despite previous recovery attempts, sellers remain dominant, preventing any meaningful upside momentum. If SOL fails to hold this key support, it could trigger a wave of panic selling, accelerating losses and exposing the price to deeper declines. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, all eyes are on whether bulls can stage a defense or if bears will finally break through, setting the stage for further downside. Solana Ongoing Bearish Trend In Focus The Solana price chart is currently displaying a bearish triangle formation, signaling a continuation of the downward trend. Initially, SOL attempted to break out above the upper boundary of the triangle, but the breakout lacked strong bullish momentum, leading to a swift rejection. This failure to sustain an upward move pushed the asset back toward the lower boundary of the triangle, where the $118 support level now comes into focus. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Steady After Decline—Breakout or More Downside? With continued selling pressure, Solana could face an extended bearish move, breaking below its current key support level and accelerating its decline. A confirmed breakdown beneath the bearish triangle would lead to a drop toward $118, the first major support zone. However, if the bearish momentum intensifies, this level may not hold. Below $118, the next significant support lies at $99, where some buyers could attempt to slow the decline. Should this level fail to provide stability, SOL could slide toward $79, a crucial psychological and technical support zone. Continued weakness in market sentiment may push the price even lower, with $58 coming into play. For now, bulls must step in to defend these levels, or Solana risks an extended bearish phase. Can $118 Spark Up Bullish Again The $118 support level has emerged as a critical zone for SOL, with many traders watching closely to see if it can trigger a bullish turnaround. Historically, this level has acted as a strong demand zone, where buyers stepped in to absorb selling pressure and push prices higher. If similar market behavior plays out, SOL could see a rebound from this point. Related Reading: Solana Bears Eye $113 Target If Ascending Structure Breaks Down – Details According to CURB, in an X post on March 15, he forecasted that Solana’s price eyes decline to the $118 support level before experiencing a potential rebound. He believes that strong demand in this zone could trigger a significant price surge to the $1,000 mark in the long run. Fundamental factors, such as positive news on Solana’s ecosystem, increased network adoption, or improved overall market sentiment, could also act as catalysts for a price recovery. A surge in buying volume, particularly from whales and institutional investors, is likely to provide the momentum needed to shift market sentiment.

42822193,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145799,1743634858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary DTCC Platform Unveils Tokenized Collateral Management for a Secure Financial Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dtcc-platform-tokenized-collateral/,"In a groundbreaking move poised to reshape the landscape of institutional finance, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a premier post-trade market infrastructure provider, has officially launched its highly anticipated platform for tokenized collateral management . This development, first highlighted by Solid Intel on X, signals a significant step forward in the integration of blockchain technology within traditional financial systems. Are you ready to witness how this innovation could redefine efficiency and security in the world of collateral? What is Tokenized Collateral Management and Why is DTCC’s Platform a Game Changer? Before we delve into the specifics of DTCC’s new offering, let’s understand the core concept. Tokenized collateral management essentially involves representing traditional financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or even real estate, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This process unlocks a host of benefits, primarily by enhancing the efficiency, transparency, and speed of collateral management. Why is this important? In traditional finance, managing collateral—assets pledged to secure loans or trades—can be a cumbersome and often slow process. It involves multiple intermediaries, manual paperwork, and can be prone to operational inefficiencies. Tokenization aims to streamline this by: Reducing settlement times: Transactions on a blockchain are typically faster than traditional settlement systems, potentially moving from T+1 or T+2 to near real-time. Improving operational efficiency: Automation through smart contracts can minimize manual intervention, reducing errors and operational costs. Enhancing transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency provides a clear and auditable record of collateral movements and ownership. Expanding accessibility: Tokenization can potentially fractionalize assets, making them more accessible as collateral and opening up new liquidity pools. DTCC, as a critical infrastructure in the financial markets, stepping into this space is a powerful endorsement of blockchain adoption in mainstream finance. Their platform isn’t just another experiment; it’s a strategic move that could set a new industry standard. Exploring the Benefits of the DTCC Platform for Tokenized Collateral The launch of DTCC’s platform is not just about keeping up with technological trends; it’s about addressing real-world challenges in collateral management. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Description Impact Increased Efficiency Automated processes and faster settlement reduce operational drag. Lower costs, faster transaction cycles. Enhanced Security Blockchain’s cryptographic security strengthens the integrity of collateral data. Reduced risk of fraud and data breaches. Improved Liquidity Tokenization can unlock previously illiquid assets as potential collateral. Greater flexibility in collateral usage and potentially lower borrowing costs. Greater Transparency Immutable blockchain records offer a clear audit trail of collateral movements. Improved regulatory compliance and trust among participants. Imagine a scenario where a financial institution needs to quickly mobilize collateral to meet margin requirements. With a DTCC platform for tokenized assets, this process could be significantly accelerated and simplified compared to the traditional methods that involve manual reconciliations and slower transfer mechanisms. This speed and efficiency are paramount in today’s fast-paced financial markets. Challenges and Considerations for Institutional Crypto Adoption While the potential of tokenized collateral management is immense, the path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is not without its hurdles. What are some of the challenges that DTCC and the broader industry might face? Regulatory Clarity: Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are crucial for the widespread adoption of tokenized assets. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, which can create complexities for global institutions. Interoperability: For tokenized collateral to be truly effective, platforms need to be interoperable. Ensuring seamless interaction between different blockchain networks and legacy systems is a technical challenge. Scalability: As adoption grows, blockchain networks must be able to handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising speed or cost. Scalability solutions are continuously evolving. Security Risks: While blockchain is inherently secure, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or custody solutions can pose risks. Robust security protocols and best practices are essential. Market Education and Acceptance: Widespread adoption requires educating market participants about the benefits and mechanics of tokenized collateral and overcoming any skepticism or resistance to change. DTCC’s initiative is a significant step in addressing these challenges head-on. By providing a robust and regulated platform, they are paving the way for greater comfort and confidence in using digital assets for collateral purposes within the institutional space. Examples of Tokenized Collateral in Action While DTCC’s platform is a recent development, the concept of tokenized collateral is already gaining traction in various forms. Here are a few examples to illustrate its potential: Stablecoins as Collateral: Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, are increasingly used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Their price stability makes them attractive for this purpose. Tokenized Securities: Companies are beginning to tokenize traditional securities like stocks and bonds. These tokenized securities can then be used as collateral in lending and borrowing activities. Real-World Assets (RWAs) Tokenization: Beyond financial instruments, real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and art are being tokenized. This opens up vast new possibilities for collateralization, although it’s still in early stages. DTCC’s platform is geared towards institutional clients, focusing initially on securities. However, the underlying technology and principles can be applied to a much broader range of asset classes as the ecosystem matures. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance? The launch of DTCC’s tokenized collateral management platform is more than just news; it’s a signal of a fundamental shift in how financial infrastructure is evolving. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: For Financial Institutions: Start exploring the potential of tokenized collateral and assess how it can enhance your operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve risk management. Engage with platforms like DTCC’s to understand the practical implications. For Technology Providers: Focus on developing interoperable and secure solutions that support the growing demand for tokenized asset infrastructure. Regulatory compliance and scalability should be top priorities. For Regulators: Proactively develop clear and balanced regulatory frameworks that foster innovation in tokenized assets while mitigating potential risks. Collaboration with industry players is crucial. For Investors: Keep an eye on the developments in institutional crypto and tokenization. Understand the potential investment opportunities that may arise as this space matures. The move by DTCC is a powerful validation of the transformative potential of blockchain technology in finance. It’s a clear indication that blockchain adoption is no longer a fringe concept but a mainstream evolution. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Tokenized Financial Ecosystem DTCC’s launch of its platform for tokenized collateral management is a watershed moment. It represents a significant leap towards a more efficient, transparent, and secure financial ecosystem. While challenges remain, the benefits of tokenization are becoming increasingly undeniable. This initiative by a market infrastructure giant like DTCC will undoubtedly accelerate the adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology within traditional finance, paving the way for a future where tokenized assets are commonplace. The revolution in collateral management is here, and it’s being driven by the power of tokenization.

The debate highlights tensions between corporate ambitions and public advisory work. The issue prompts reconsideration of role definitions in government advisory positions. Tesla founder Elon Musk will reportedly step away from his new role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the coming months, NBC News and Politico reported Wednesday. Is Elon Musk Stepping Back From DOGE? According to Politico’s April 2 report , three sources close to President Donald Trump revealed that the president and Elon Musk have discussed plans for the X CEO to step back from his government role. The billionaire entrepreneur will reportedly refocus on running his multiple businesses. Just last month, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields alleged that Musk would stay until his “mission” at DOGE was “completed.” A February Politico report cited an anonymous insider who claimed that the controversial tech billionaire was “here to stay” despite widespread public scrutiny. SCOOP: Pres Trump has told his inner circle & members of his Cabinet that @elonmusk will be stepping back in the coming weeks from his current role Trump remains pleased w/ Musk & DOGE, but both men have decided in recent days that it will soon be time for Musk to return… — Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) April 2, 2025 As a special government employee, Musk is only allowed to work 130 days out of 365, with the South African-born engineer expected to reach that limit either next month or June. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took to X Wednesday to deny the claims, calling the scoop “garbage.” “Elon Musk and President Trump have both *publicly* stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,” she wrote. However, a senior White House official confirmed to NBC News Wednesday afternoon that Trump had discussed Musk’s departure at a March 24 Cabinet meeting. While the status of Elon Musk’s government position remains unclear, his involvement with the Trump administration has already created consequences for his businesses. X CEO Faces Backlash Over DOGE Policies, Tesla Attacked Musk has faced broad pushback commercially for his role alongside the Trump administration, with several Tesla charging stations, vehicles, and dealerships attacked in recent months. During a Wisconsin town hall on Sunday, Elon Musk addressed how his political involvement has affected his businesses. He also clarified that despite the acronym’s similarity to the cryptocurrency , the federal government does not plan to use Dogecoin. “My Tesla stock, and the stock of everyone who owns Tesla, has roughly halved,” he said at the event hosted by his crypto-friendly America PAC . “I mean, it’s a big deal.” The post Conflicting Reports Emerge Over Elon Musk Stepping Down From DOGE appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-02 23:03:34

And what if some are already stacking their gains while others still scroll, searching? The digital battleground for dominance is heating up, and three names are rising faster than most: Qubetics , Toncoin, and Litecoin, one of the best crypto for quick profit. Each brings something rare to the table: speed, scalability, and a chance for early community members to secure serious profits. And right now, the right move could make all the difference. Just look at Toncoin (TON). A surge past the $4 resistance level has flipped heads in the derivatives market, triggering a 35.86% jump in open interest. Litecoin (LTC) is testing the patience of long-term holders. After slipping below the $97.12 support, it hovers in uncertain territory, possibly drifting toward $57.70 if current patterns persist. But here’s where things get wild: Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t here to play catch-up—it’s here to change the rules. By confronting real-life failures in cross-border transfers, inefficient smart contracts, and fragmented systems. It’s more than just a presale—it’s a signal that the future is already forming. Qubetics ($TICS): The Infrastructure Crypto Built for Life Qubetics delivers something blockchain desperately needs—seamless interoperability. Not theoretical. Actual plug-and-play connections across chains, systems, and devices. Picture a logistics platform in Brazil instantly syncing transactions from multiple vendors—Ethereum-based, Solana-based, and even legacy payment APIs—without gas fee traps or hour-long confirmations. Or imagine a freelancer in Chile finally getting paid across chains, settled in seconds, minus middlemen. This isn’t hype; it’s structured utility. One of Qubetics’ most powerful strengths lies in its adaptive consensus layer, designed to align with both public and private networks. This helps traditional businesses plug into crypto infrastructure without costly backend overhauls. That’s like giving a 90s car a self-driving system—and having it work flawlessly. Through advanced sharding mechanisms and modular infrastructure, Qubetics minimizes congestion and keeps data throughput fast and secure. What a $1,000 in Qubetics Looks Like—And Why Waiting Might Cost More Than You Think Imagine dropping just $1,000 into Qubetics ($TICS) today. At the current crypto presale price of $0.1430, that grabs around 6,993 tokens. Now picture this—if $TICS hits just $1, that $1,000 becomes $6,993. At $5, you’re staring at $34,965. Stretch that to $10, and the figure climbs to $69,930. If it hits $15, that same initial entry could grow into a stunning $104,895. These numbers aren’t pulled from thin air—they’re based on actual projections tied to Qubetics’ structured growth model. With more than 24,200 holders, over $15.8 million already raised, and 506 million tokens sold as of April 2, 2025, the momentum isn’t coming—it’s already accelerating. And with every new presale stage, the price ticks up. The window for maximum profit is narrowing fast. In crypto, hesitation isn’t harmless—it’s expensive. For those looking for the best crypto for quick profit, Qubetics offers more than just potential. It offers timing. And right now, that timing couldn’t be sharper. Toncoin (TON): Bullish Charts, Big Bets, and a Fresh Breakout Toncoin’s push beyond the $4 line this April isn’t just technical noise. It signals renewed confidence. The open interest spike—up 35.86% in just 24 hours—tells a story of serious capital repositioning. People aren’t just watching; they’re acting. The RSI, sitting at 60, suggests there’s still breathing room before things get overheated. And the MACD’s bullish crossover? That’s more fuel in the tank. The TON network itself continues evolving under the Telegram ecosystem, giving it the type of built-in distribution others only dream of. With tools like TON DNS and TON Payments already gaining traction in Venezuela and El Salvador, the project feels grounded—not in ideology, but in use. Developers are integrating dApps on TON’s scalable architecture, while casual users benefit from its low transaction costs and high-speed transfers. While not a presale coin like Qubetics, Toncoin is carving its own route to mass adoption. Those entering now are positioning themselves in a strong uptrend, especially if it breaks past $4.62. For those seeking the best crypto for quick profit, TON’s upward trajectory makes it hard to ignore. Time, though, is rarely this generous twice. Litecoin (LTC): Digital Silver Faces Critical Pressure Litecoin has earned its reputation as digital silver—reliable, consistent, and battle-tested. But even legends stumble. Dropping below the $97.12 support level has raised alarms. The next test sits way lower, near $57.70. It’s a big gap, and the LTC community is watching closely. Still, seasoned market participants know: when others hesitate, real opportunities unfold. Litecoin continues to serve practical purposes. Its ultra-low fees make it a favorite for fast, cross-border microtransactions. In Argentina and Cuba, where fiat volatility runs high, LTC is still used by local merchants and digital freelancers. That real-life relevance keeps Litecoin in the conversation, even during market dips. However, this isn’t a hype cycle moment—it’s a grind phase. And in that grind, entries could lead to major rebounds. Litecoin may not be flashy, but its infrastructure is proven. For those looking to balance their portfolio with a project that’s stood the test of time, LTC still holds appeal. As a contender for the best crypto for quick profit, it may trail Qubetics and Toncoin in short-term hype—but sometimes, patience pays bigger than speed. Why These 3 Projects Matter Now More Than Ever Crypto isn’t about luck—it’s about timing and information. Qubetics offers raw potential with a proven model, wrapped in a smart presale structure. Toncoin is surging with real strength, fueled by growing adoption and bullish technicals. Litecoin, while under pressure, remains a staple—steady, reliable, and quietly essential in regions that need fast and stable payments. This April 2025 window is short—and wide open. Whether it’s Qubetics’ game-ready interoperability, Toncoin’s bullish wave, or Litecoin’s time-tested network, these aren’t coins to ignore. They’re engines. And right now, the throttle is up. For community members seeking the best crypto for quick profit , the next move should be strategic—not delayed. Dive deep, decide fast, and take your place ahead of the shift.

Qubetics is built for interoperability and real-world problem-solving, making it attractive for early buyers. Its $0.1430 presale price offers massive upside potential. Why is Toncoin gaining momentum in April 2025? Toncoin recently broke the $4 resistance, with a 35.86% rise in open interest. Technical indicators point to continued bullish momentum, increasing market confidence. Is Litecoin still a good crypto to hold despite recent dips?

The ACT team emphasized the crash was market-driven, not due to project flaws. This incident has raised concerns about the risks of sudden exchange policy changes on token stability. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT), a token associated with the eponymous project focused on artificial intelligence, released a post-mortem about the fall of their token on Wednesday.. On Tuesday, the token experienced a sudden and severe price drop, plunging 58% from $0.19 to $0.08 in less than an hour. According to CoinGecko data , the token’s market capitalization shed $96 million. ACT Team Addresses Crash, Says Liquidations Triggered Sell-Off The sharp decline coincided with Binance’s update to leverage and margin tiers for multiple tokens, including ACT. The adjustment triggered a wave of liquidations, with blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reporting that a whale was liquidated for $3.79 million at $0.1877. The impact of these liquidations intensified selling pressure across the market. In response, Act I addressed the community, assuring that the project was investigating the situation and working with the relevant parties, before then releasing this latest report. Post Mortem Dear ACT Community, Over the past 24 hours, the ACT token experienced a significant and sudden price drop. We want to address the incident transparently and provide context. As you know, we are a community-driven project with no centralized leadership, and our… — Act I : The AI Prophecy (@ACTICOMMUNITY) April 2, 2025 According to the team, Binance’s leverage adjustments were announced with short notice, forcing traders and market makers with large positions to close or downsize, leading to cascading sell-offs. Binance’s preliminary findings indicated that four users, including three VIP traders and one non-VIP, collectively sold over $1 million worth of ACT on the Binance spot market, accelerating the price decline. Act I emphasized that the crash was not due to any internal failure or fundamental flaw in the project. “No single party appears to have profited disproportionately from this sequence of trades,” the team stated. It also clarified that the full circulating supply of ACT is live on the open market, meaning centralized exchanges like Binance cannot restrict user behavior once tokens are held in personal accounts. Despite the turbulence, Act I reaffirmed its commitment to its long-term mission of integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized ecosystems. “Although we are unable to directly impact the price of the token, we remain focused on our core mission: to build real AI infrastructure for Web3,” the team stated. Regardless of recent price action, $ACT 's vision extends far beyond market fluctuations. While volatility is inevitable in crypto markets, our team's commitment to building remains unwavering. Our mission has never changed: to serve as the definitive bridge between AI & crypto… — Act I : The AI Prophecy (@ACTICOMMUNITY) April 2, 2025 The project plans to present its developments at Token2049 later this month. Act I acknowledged the frustration among its holders but remained steadfast in its goals. “This incident, while difficult, does not change our fundamentals, our partnerships, or our long-term vision,” the statement read. “If anything, it has made us double down on decentralization, transparency, and resilience.” As the project works to regroup after this market event, the token’s price continues to face pressure in the broader market. ACT Token Bleeds 70% in a Week, CZ Urges AI Projects to Build First The sell-off in Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) has intensified, with the token plunging 37.4% in the past hour and down 70.8% over the last week, according to CoinGecko . Source: CoinGecko Currently trading at $0.05643, ACT has lost nearly 94% from its all-time high of $0.9198, though it remains 340% above its lowest price. Market activity has also declined, with 24-hour trading volume dropping 21.6% to $477.7 million. Amid the turmoil, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has weighed in on the broader AI and crypto intersection, criticizing AI projects that prioritize token launches over real utility . In a post on X, CZ stated that “many AI agent developers focus too much on their token rather than the agent’s actual usefulness.” Too many AI agent developers focus too much on their token and not enough on the agent's usefulness. I recommend making a really good agent first. Only launch a token when there is product-market fit. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) April 2, 2025 He urged teams to build a strong product first and only introduce a token after achieving product-market fit. His remarks echo previous criticisms of AI-focused crypto projects. On March 17, he argued that while crypto can serve as the currency for AI, most AI agents don’t need their own tokens. Looking forward, he suggested charging fees in existing cryptocurrencies so AI project teams could focus on real-world adoption instead of token performance. The ACT token crash shows the delicate interplay between exchange policies, market dynamics, and project fundamentals in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While factors like leverage adjustments can trigger immediate price movements, long-term project viability ultimately depends on delivering real utility. As the dust settles on this particular event, the broader conversation about responsible tokenomics and the relationship between centralized exchanges and token projects is likely to intensify across the industry.

This claim led to a sharp drop in the price of FDUSD, which was supposed to be pegged at $1, dropping to as low as $0.87. While the token has since recovered somewhat, it has not fully returned to its intended $1 parity. Following the market backlash, Sun issued a new statement reiterating his concerns about First Digital Trust (FDT) and its operations. In his latest statements, Sun claimed that FDT had failed to meet customer fund repayments and was effectively insolvent. Despite this, he claimed that the company continued to operate as a public trust in Hong Kong, suggesting significant legal loopholes. Expressing strong concerns about the integrity of Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem, Sun said: “As seen in the case of FDT, there appear to be obvious loopholes in the trust industry in Hong Kong to circumvent financial and banking regulations. These will not only pose a risk to the public, but also jeopardise Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial centre.” He called on regulators and law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong to take decisive action to address these issues and prevent further financial risks to the public. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Makes First Official Statement on FDUSD Drop In addition to raising regulatory concerns, Sun noted that TUSD stablecoin Techteryx is actively pursuing legal action against FDT: “I am determined to support Techteryx and ensure that all scammers are held under the full force of the law. Never again should they be allowed to defraud the public under the guise of a licensed entity in Hong Kong or elsewhere.” At the time of writing, the FDUSD price is trading at $0.9795 and is extremely volatile.

We would like to remind you that all cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, are high risk and that there is a high risk of losing all invested money, including the principal.

We’re in the golden age of digital memes-as-assets between Arctic Pablo Coin’s mystical expedition and the meme coin frenzy driven by projects like Fartcoin and Dogwifhat. Investors are chasing the top new meme coins to join now—not tomorrow, not next week, but right now—as early entries offer mind-blowing returns that traditional markets can’t imagine. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) leads this wave, a project that isn’t just a coin—it’s an adventure wrapped in mystery, scarcity, and some serious ROI juice. It’s unlike anything the meme coin world has seen before. Think frozen tundras, forgotten treasures, and a snowmobile-riding explorer who’s out to share the wealth. Arctic Pablo Coin – Unlock Hidden Mysteries and 9,084.48% ROI Potential In the land where glaciers whisper ancient secrets and snowstorms shield long-lost treasure, Arctic Pablo surges ahead with a mission unlike any other meme coin. He’s not just minting tokens—he’s revealing the undiscovered. The current chapter? Glacial Glade—the 17th hidden location in a saga that has captivated early investors. Forget “phases.” Arctic Pablo’s presale unfolds like a quest. With every location Pablo reaches, a new treasure trove of opportunities opens up. Those who joined him early have already seen wild gains—and now, at just $0.000087, the window to secure 5,747,125 APCs for a $500 investment is wide open. And once it hits its launch price of $0.008, that same investment could grow to $45,977. That’s the kind of life-changing math meme coin hunters dream of. And it gets better. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about fast flips. With 66% APY staking, investors can stake their APC and earn passive rewards while being part of an ever-expanding legend. All staked tokens will be vested for two months from launch, ensuring a stable and rewarding ecosystem. Arctic Pablo features weekly token burns to maintain long-term growth, slicing away unsold tokens to increase scarcity and boost value. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), it supports various payment methods—from BTC and ETH to SOLANA and XRP—making it wildly accessible. No traditional stages. No boring roadmaps. Just a storytelling-driven economy where Pablo charts new territories, unearthing ROI opportunities and captivating a community that’s all-in on the journey. Top new meme coins to join now ? Arctic Pablo is not just on the list—it’s rewriting the rules. This might be the last moment to join before the price jumps with the next location. Every new step forward means fewer tokens, higher demand, and a bigger price tag. Get in before the story changes. Fartcoin – Blowing Up in All the Right Ways Not every meme coin needs to take itself seriously. And Fartcoin ($FART)? It’s the loudest example. In a market full of polished whitepapers and stiff branding, Fartcoin cuts through the noise with its unapologetically immature humor—and somehow, it’s working like magic. Fartcoin took the crypto world by storm, launching on the Ethereum blockchain with an irreverent and clever mission: to become the king of comedy coins. With a max supply of 69,000,000,000 FARTs, it’s clear they’re leaning hard into the meme culture. And with over $15 million in trading volume during its peak debut week, the market is responding. Unlike other joke coins, Fartcoin has built a loyal, rowdy community fueling its growth on socials like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Discord. They’re turning fart memes into fuel for financial gain, creating viral challenges, and even teasing a P2E fart battle game that’s reportedly in the works. Dogwifhat – When the Internet’s Favorite Pup Meets Market Madness Dogwifhat (WIF) isn’t just a meme coin. It’s a movement powered by the internet’s collective obsession with Shiba Inu aesthetics, chaotic humor, and the ever-ironic “dog with a hat” meme. What started as a joke became one of the fastest-growing Solana meme coins, and it’s still running hot. Dogwifhat skyrocketed after listing on major exchanges, including Binance and OKX, giving it a huge liquidity boost. It reached a market cap of over $2 billion at its peak, positioning itself as one of the most successful meme coins launched recently. With a community-driven approach, Dogwifhat keeps its roadmap loose but ambitious. It’s all about virality and vibes, from meme contests to merchandise drops and community grants. Holders don’t just support a token—they become part of a cultural moment constantly evolving in real-time. Final Thoughts: The Meme Coin Moment Is Now Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is experiencing an unprecedented boom. Between the mystical journey of Arctic Pablo Coin, the chaotic comedy of Fartcoin, and the viral dog-energy of Dogwifhat, there’s never been a better moment to explore the top new meme coins to join now.

Cuomo, a New York-registered attorney, advised OKX on legal issues stemming from the probe sometime after August 2021 when he resigned as New York overnor, Bloomberg reported on April 2, citing people familiar with the matter. “He spoke with company executives regularly and counseled them on how to respond to the criminal investigation,” Bloomberg said. The Seychelles-based firm pled guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business in violation of US Anti-Money Laundering laws on Feb. 24 and agreed to pay $84 million worth of penalties while forfeiting $421 million worth of fees earned from mostly institutional clients. The breaches occurred from 2018 to 2024 despite OKX having an official policy preventing US persons from transacting on its crypto exchange since 2017, the Department of Justice noted at the time. A spokesperson for Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, told Bloomberg that Cuomo has been providing private legal services representing individuals and corporations on a variety of matters since resigning as New York governor. “He has not represented clients before a New York city or state agency and routinely recommends former colleagues for positions,” Azzopardi added. OKX reportedly wasn’t willing to comment on its relationships with outside firms. Cuomo also influenced OKX to make executive appointments: Bloomberg Cuomo, who is now running for mayor of New York City, also advised OKX to appoint his friend US Attorney Linda Lacewell to OKX’s board of directors, Bloomberg said. Lacewell, a former superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, was added to the board in 2024 and was named OKX’s new chief legal officer on April 1, according to a recent company statement. Source: Linda Lacewell Related: New York bill aims to protect crypto investors from memecoin rug pulls After the investigation concluded, OKX said it would seek out a compliance consultant to remedy the issues stemming from the federal probe and bolster its regulatory compliance program. “Our vision is to make OKX the gold standard of global compliance at scale across different markets and their respective regulatory bodies,” OKX CEO Star Xu said in a Feb. 24 X post.

Pi Coin is falling rapidly, SUI is slowly recovering, and BlockDAG is moving forward with strong traction. While Pi Coin battles to maintain credibility during a massive token unlock, and SUI gains momentum from possible institutional backing, BlockDAG is steadily delivering on its goals. With the Beta Testnet now active, a $60K prize pool launched, and over $210.5 million collected in presale stages, BDAG is showing real-world progress. Unlike the uncertainty surrounding Pi and SUI, BlockDAG’s structure, with its engaged community and growing testnet utilities, places it ahead. The question now isn’t whether BDAG will rise, but how far it can go. Pi Coin’s Price Crash: Can It Recover After the Token Release? Pi Coin is currently seeing a steep decline, with a 30% drop this week pushing it down the charts and out of the top 30. The price now stands at $0.77—far below its recent high, cutting billions from its overall market value. Experts believe it may fall further, with $0.60 as the next crucial level. The market is bracing for a supply spike as 105.96 million Pi Coins are expected to be released within 30 days. A major unlock of 6.8 million is scheduled for April 3, raising concerns of more selling pressure. Another source of concern is the lack of a Binance listing, despite ongoing support from the Pi community. Yet, some traders believe a reversal could be on the horizon. Technical indicators suggest a potential surge, and if momentum flips, Pi Coin may climb back near $5. With current low prices, some are considering this a dip worth buying. SUI’s Price Recovery: Will It Continue Climbing After $2.40? SUI is gaining attention again with a 10% rise this week, crossing the important $2.40 mark. After hitting a recent low of $1.96, it has bounced back, driven by growing institutional interest and speculation about a possible SUI ETF. This Wednesday, SUI briefly reached $2.65 before pulling back, pointing to strong upward pressure. Experts suggest that a break from its long-standing wedge formation could fuel further gains. If it stays above $2.40, the next levels to watch are $2.80 and possibly its January peak of $5.37. SUI has a track record of major moves after such technical breakouts. With large firms showing interest, the possibility of another price jump is back on the table. For many, the current rally is a signal to act before the next potential run-up. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Launch: Reward Pool Live as Mainnet Nears BlockDAG (BDAG) has crossed a major development milestone by activating its Beta Testnet, as presented in its third Keynote. This step brings the project closer to its mainnet rollout. To add to the progress, BlockDAG has unveiled a $60,000 reward pool, encouraging participation from its already large base of over 170,000 members. The presale is now in Batch 27, offering BDAG at $0.0248. So far, more than 210.5 million dollars have been raised, and over 19 billion BDAG coins have been purchased. Those who bought at the initial $0.001 price point have already seen a 2,380% potential return, placing BDAG among the strongest presale performers in recent history. Performance-wise, the Beta Testnet has doubled in speed compared to its alpha stage. New updates include an improved blockchain explorer and a user-friendly Token & NFT Wizard that allows anyone to build tokens without coding knowledge. According to CEO Antony Turner, this testnet phase plays a key role in refining the network before the official mainnet release. What sets BlockDAG apart is its approach to rewarding active users. Top contributors, whether they’re miners, high-balance holders, or frequent wallet users, receive recognition and benefits. The platform is growing quickly, boasting over 800,000 users on the X1 Miner App and more than 400,000 in the TG Tap Miner Game. With presale funds now above $210.5 million, BlockDAG is setting itself up as one of the most strategically prepared blockchain projects, pointing to a major mainnet launch expected in 2025. Final Remarks! Speed and progress matter in crypto, and BlockDAG is moving faster than the rest. Pi Coin continues to face high selling volumes, while SUI is still building on early signs of recovery. In contrast, BDAG’s Beta Testnet is already up and running, rewarding participants and fine-tuning its platform ahead of its 2025 mainnet launch. The $60K Testnet reward pool isn’t just an incentive—it’s a way to test and strengthen the system under real usage. Combined with 800K+ X1 Miner users and presale funding that now exceeds $210.5M, BlockDAG is not just another altcoin contender—it’s shaping up to be the leading project to watch. While Pi and SUI work to regain momentum, BlockDAG continues to push forward.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 889,000 YouTube subscribers that the S&P 500 may continue to show weakness in April, which, based on historical precedence, may result in ETH also declining. “What I’m wondering is what happens if you do see the S&P 500 continue to show weakness into early to mid-April? Remember, we said there’s going to be weakness by the stock market between February OPEX (Option Expiration Week) and March OPEX. We got that, but I also said there’s a possibility that it could extend into early to mid-April as well before there’s a larger counter-trend rally. And the reasons for that could be due to tariff uncertainty on April 2nd. It could also just simply be due to, there’s a lot of macro data coming out in early to mid-April that I think the markets are going to be interested in. And one of the reasons I think the markets are going to be interested in it is because with all these tariffs, it could potentially have an effect on inflation.” Cowen says ETH may drop to its logarithmic trendline, potentially as low as $1,044, amid recessionary pressures, before reclaiming the $3,000 level as support. “I’m just looking over here at ETH/USD [on the weekly chart], and I see a triple top, and I just have to wonder does it ultimately culminate in a recession, where everyone thinks that by the time the recession is declared it’s over, but the reality is the market was pricing it in well ahead of time, so that you get this big drop and then a big move out of it. We’ve been talking about that for a while, and it’s the whole idea that ETH goes home.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube ETH is trading for $1,909 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.

NEAR Protocol and Aptos are advancing with enhancements in scalability and developer support, but tend to require a technical knack from users. BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart by integrating user-friendly tools such as the X1 Miner App, TG Tap Miner game, and no-code token wizards, simplifying entry for most. While NEAR and Aptos focus on performance enhancements, BlockDAG is dedicated to making crypto accessible, bridging the gap between enthusiasts and the general public in ways not yet fully accomplished by the competition. NEAR: Pioneering Sharding and User Benefits NEAR Protocol operates as a sharded Layer 1 blockchain optimized for speed, scalability, and user-friendliness. Its Proof-of-Stake consensus paired with Nightshade sharding processes thousands of transactions each second at low cost and almost immediate finality. This setup not only ensures a fluid developer experience but also strong dApp functionality. NEAR further prioritizes user accessibility through human-readable accounts and straightforward onboarding processes. For those engaged early with NEAR, the rewards have been significant. In the past year, its token value has increased from $2.72 to about $4.90 by March 2025—a rise of 80%. Meanwhile, its market cap has soared to approximately $5.77 billion, ranking NEAR among the top 30 cryptocurrencies worldwide. With ongoing expansions in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world applications, NEAR is continually attracting interest. Predictions suggest a potential rise to $8.21 by year”s end, strengthening confidence in its future and technological prowess. Aptos: High-Performance Layer 1 with Solid Basics Aptos stands as a Layer 1 blockchain engineered for supreme throughput, minimal latency, and enhanced security. It employs the Move programming language—originally crafted at Meta—affording developers secure, adaptable smart contract options. Aptos distinguishes itself with its parallel processing engine and swift transaction finalization, marking it as an effective platform for dApps and business applications. From a financial perspective, Aptos has maintained positive growth. Its token has appreciated about 17% over the past year, hitting near $13.00 in March 2025. Analysts expect the token could peak at $15.23 by the end of the year, with an average of about $13.34, indicating potential growth exceeding 50%. With its consistent progress and strong backing from venture capitalists, Aptos continues to capture attention, positioning itself as a formidable contender against major players like Ethereum and Solana. Its sustained development and increasing ecosystem engagement underscore Aptos as a stable choice in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Makes Crypto Easy for Everyone BlockDAG is redefining how we interact with blockchain technology, aiming to make participating in crypto as straightforward as using your favorite mobile app. Central to this approach are user-friendly tools designed to welcome not only tech-savvy users but everyone. For example, the X1 Miner App , now boasting 800,000 users, simplifies mining BDAG coins to just a few smartphone taps. Similarly, the TG Tap Miner game, available via Telegram, attracts users with its easy play-to-earn model, engaging over 400,000 players who earn while they play. Furthermore, BlockDAG is eliminating the complexities of digital creation. With its no-code token wizard, anyone can create tokens and NFTs without any coding knowledge—perfect for crafting community tokens or launching new collectibles with ease. The impact of these innovations is evident in the numbers. With over 19 billion coins already sold and more than $210 million raised in the presale, BlockDAG”s appeal is undeniable. The price per coin in Batch 27 is $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase for early participants from Batch 1. This shift in approach signals a new era where blockchain is not just accessible but also fun and profitable, paving the way for a diverse and inclusive decentralized future. Making Blockchain Easy for All Despite their advanced capabilities, platforms like NEAR and Aptos primarily cater to developers and experienced crypto users, excelling in speed and scalability but not in ease of use. BlockDAG is changing the game by prioritizing simplicity. With innovations like the X1 App for straightforward mobile mining , the TG Tap Miner game for easy crypto earning, and no-code solutions for token creation, BlockDAG is democratizing blockchain technology. In the race for widespread blockchain adoption, the platform that simplifies technology to make it most accessible will likely lead the way.

FLOKI and Popcat (POPCAT) have seen viral success thanks to meme culture and growing communities. But now, a new contender has entered the arena: Dragoin ($DDGN) . Unlike its Solana and BNB-based peers, Dragoin is blazing its own trail on Ethereum, combining Game of Thrones-inspired fantasy, a live Telegram-based game, and real token utility. Here’s why Dragoin’s public sale—now live at just $0.0000292—could be the meme coin bet of the year, with the potential to outperform even the likes of FLOKI and POPCAT in 2025. Dragoin’s Public Sale Is Live: 6,700% ROI Potential Sparks Buying Frenzy Forget buying into hype after the peak—Dragoin gives you the rare chance to enter early. The public sale is now live, with $DDGN priced at $0.0000292 in Stage 1. With a final launch price of $0.002, early buyers could see a 6,700% return if the token hits its target. That’s not speculation—it’s baked into the presale structure, which spans 25 stages, each one raising the token price while reducing availability. To add more fuel to the fire, all unsold tokens will be permanently burned—no rollovers, no second chances. That built-in deflation mechanism creates an urgency few meme coins can offer. It’s simple: if you wait, you’ll pay more. If you miss out, the opportunity’s gone for good. This deflationary model is designed to favor those who move fast—a stark contrast to coins like FLOKI and POPCAT, where massive circulating supplies can dilute returns. Dragoin isn’t just a coin—it’s a full-blown interactive experience. Players can hatch their own dragons and guide them through a Telegram-based game, dodging obstacles and earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s one of the few meme coins that delivers real-time utility before it hits exchanges. With upcoming roadmap milestones including expanded gameplay, leaderboard competitions, and exchange listings in Q3 2025, Dragoin is building momentum—not just with memes but with engagement. In an era where most meme coins are passive holdings, Dragoin gives users a reason to participate every day. This interactivity is attracting growing social chatter—and history proves social volume is a key trigger for major rallies in the meme coin world. Just look at what happened with FLOKI and PEPE: once the internet took notice, prices soared. FLOKI: Multi-Chain Growth, But Headwinds Ahead FLOKI Inu started as a joke, but it”s now grown into a recognizable brand with real market presence. Its multi-chain functionality—on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain—has been a key strength. Recent data shows FLOKI is trading around $0.00005964, up over 31% in the past month, with analysts forecasting a 2025 range between $0.000066 and $0.000333. The upcoming Valhalla metaverse upgrade in Q1 2025 could give FLOKI a fresh boost. But despite strong derivatives sentiment and a bullish Fear & Greed Index, FLOKI’s large market cap means exponential gains like 1000x are far less likely today than during its early days. Popcat (POPCAT): Viral Sensation, But Treading Water Popcat launched in December 2023 on Solana, built around the viral image of a cat named Oatmeal. At its peak in November 2024, POPCAT reached $2.08—a remarkable climb from its low valuation. Currently trading near $1.65, the coin has already rewarded early backers with over 400% returns. Analysts now forecast POPCAT could reach $2.79 in 2025, and even $5.87 by 2030, depending on adoption and sentiment. But as meme coin fatigue sets in across Solana, growth may slow. Network congestion, token saturation, and declining DEX volumes on Solana are creating headwinds. Which Meme Coin Will Dominate 2025? FLOKI has proven it can build a long-term brand. Popcat gave the market a viral hit. But Dragoin is giving investors what they really want right now—an early-stage chance at outsized returns, backed by real engagement and a play-to-earn model that’s already live. If you missed FLOKI at $0.000005 or POPCAT under $1, this is your shot to catch the next big one early. Dragoin’s public sale is live. The burn is real. The dragons are flying. Grab your $DDGN now—before the next stage hits and prices rise again.

Trump’s new blanket tariffs target a long list of nations and go further than many analysts expected, sparking widespread economic uncertainty and volatility in both traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin’s price has plummeted from a 24-hour high of $87,790 down to $82,223 at time of publishing, with $518 billion in liquidations hitting BTC and the digital asset market at large in the last day, according to CoinGlass. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,000 points in after-hours trading, the S&P 500 futures have dropped by 3.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures have dropped 4.2%. Trump has signed an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, effective April 5th, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. At a Rose Garden address, Trump said the reciprocal tariffs are designed to address decades of unfair trade practices and restore economic fairness for the United States.

After experiencing significant volatility and undergoing a consolidation due to recent price declines, technical indicators now show support for XRP’s bullish outlook. As a result, the analyst has provided a short—and long-term price target for the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Projected To Reverse To $3.5 According to ‘Setupsfx’, a crypto analyst on TradingView, XRP is now in a bullish reversal phase, meaning its price is expected to break out of its recent downturn and rise to new highs. Based on the expert’s chart analysis of XRP, the cryptocurrency is predicted to see an explosive increase to $3.5 following the end of its consolidation phase. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support The chart indicates that the price of XRP is expected to rise to $3.5 in the coming months. However, from a fundamental analysis perspective, the analyst believes XRP is not limited to this bullish price target and could potentially surpass it to exceed current all-time highs of $3.84. While the TradingView expert’s analysis of XRP maintains a neutral stance, implying uncertainty in the trend, he has also emphasized the cryptocurrency’s strong potential for growth. Hence, XRP could experience significant upward movement if market conditions align favorably and investor sentiment and confidence strengthen. For his short-term price target, the crypto analyst forecasts that XRP could rally to a level above $3.5. He advises traders who intend to hold their positions for a short period to aim for this price level, as it could be a strategic exit point before a potential pullback. Notably, the analyst’s long-term price target for XRP has been set at $4.0 or higher. Considering XRP’s price is currently trading at $2.09, a surge to $4 would represent an almost 100% increase in its price. Technical Elements Supporting Bullish Reversal In his chart analysis, Setupsfx highlights XRP’s price action in a 12-hour time frame, showcasing key movements, trends, and technical elements that support his bullish projection. These elements include liquidity and IMB zones, which are areas where price action is expected due to pending orders. Related Reading: XRP Price To $110? Bollinger Bands Creator Reveals Why It Will Become A Market Leader The analyst also highlights an accumulation phase, as XRP has been consolidating at lower levels, signaling the possibility of a potential breakout. The appearance of strong low wicks further indicates that buyers are regaining control of the market. Finally, the TradingView analyst has indicated that the altcoin has already undergone a three-point trendline rejection, which means it has tested and rejected a resistance level multiple times. The expert’s price chart also provides an ideal entry point for both short and long-term traders, marked at $1.8. A stop loss has also been placed significantly lower around $1.2 to minimize potential losses.

MUTM has already surpassed $6 million in funding, with more than 7,700 holders taking their positions early, and at just $0.025 in phase four of its presale, the time is now! That’s why investors are piling into Phase 4 before it sells out, as they expect a 20% price move to $0.03 for the next stage. The math is simple for newcomers: a $530 at this price could expand to $530,000 if MUTM only achieves a portion of its projected targets post-launch. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Unlike meme coins or some other over-hyped asset, Mutuum Finance provides real utility offering decentralized lending and borrowing. Their unique model introduces mtTokens, which are a product of deposited assets in mpTokens and which automatically start accruing interest after their creation, allowing liquidity providers to earn passive income. Overcollateralized loans are used by borrowers to see to it that the system is stable. That real world functionality is what differentiates MUTM from 100% speculative plays. It has a built-in buy pressure mechanism, which increase its appeal. A part of the platform proceeds are used to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens on the market and then distributed among the stakers. That creates a constant demand, which brings growth in price in the long run. Given such a strong economic architecture, experts forecast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surging past $1 after launch, representing life-changing gains for early supporters. Presale Momentum Builds Phase 4 is filling up quickly, with the following phase poised to raise the price to $0.03—a 20% jump from the existing $0.025. If purchased now, that guarantees instant 140% profit at the official listing price (0.06 USDT). But the true opportunity is after launch. Or if the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) breaks conservatively over post-listing estimate $1.50, early investors would be able to profit from up to 5900% gains. A Certik audit of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project’s smart contract is in progress, providing another layer of legitimacy. This news will send investor confidence to a whole new height, an official confirmation on Mutuum Finance social channels will be made once confirmed. Pepe (PEPE) and Ethereum (ETH) On the Losing End Though Pepe (PEPE) spins off meme culture and Ethereum (ETH) stands on the blockchain short list, neither can serve the rotor-based growth attractively presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). PEPE is volatile, so it is a risky bet, while ETH’s high entry price is limiting explosive gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) needs no new marketing in 2025, which is why at sub-$0.05 in presale it could be the even smarter play. As Phase 4 marches toward its conclusion, time is running out for early investors to lock in even the tightest prices for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The 20% jump in the next phase will squeeze margins for latecomers. With the project fundamentals and aggressive buy-back system, this entry point may be one that you do not want to miss, as it could lead to generational wealth. Last Chance: Will You Do It, or Will You Hate Yourself Later Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an all-in-one financial solution, and it’s paving the way for a new decentralized economy. The numbers don’t lie: a $530 investment today could potentially be 100x by the end of 2025. With presale selling out stage by stage and exchange listings on the horizon, it’s time to act.

The public presale has just gone live, and crypto buyers are getting in quickly. With its Game of Thrones-style theme, a live Telegram game that pays users, and an entry price of only $0.0000292, Dragoin is turning heads fast—and those who get in early could be looking at up to 6,700% in returns. What makes Dragoin different is how it combines meme appeal with real utility. It’s not just another token riding hype. Right from day one, users can play and earn $DDGN, all while joining a growing, gamified community. There are 25 presale stages in total, and the current price is the lowest it will ever be—making Stage 1 the ideal time to join. Dragoin Picks Up Speed as a Top Meme Coin for 2025 The excitement around Dragoin isn’t just for show—it’s being driven by timing, features, and a clear use case. As more people discover the presale, it’s not just the theme they’re drawn to—it’s what Dragoin delivers. From seasoned investors to newcomers in the meme coin space, the appeal is wide. Dragoin stands out by blending crypto with storytelling. Every presale stage is named after a memorable Game of Thrones event, giving each stage a sense of purpose and energy. But there’s more to it than clever names. The project’s structure rewards early buyers and creates urgency as prices increase. Here’s why people are paying attention: Play & Earn: The Telegram Game That Pays in $DDGN Dragoin focuses on getting users involved. Anyone can play the Telegram-based mini-game right away—no downloads or apps needed. Just jump in, guide your dragon through challenges, and earn tokens along the way. It’s easy, fun, and actually pays you to play. This kind of engagement builds interest fast. The game gives $DDGN real purpose and makes it more than a buy-and-hold coin. As more players join and earn, the token’s ecosystem grows stronger—and demand goes up. Plus, early buyers get access to staking, decision-making votes, and exclusive game perks, giving them extra reasons to stick around. What really draws attention is Dragoin’s deflationary model. All unsold tokens in every stage get burned for good. That means the token supply shrinks while demand rises—giving extra strength to its price over time. The supply is capped, the game is active, and the burn is already happening. Stage 1 Is the Cheapest Entry—Don’t Miss Your Window Dragoin’s presale is broken into 25 stages, each one priced higher than the last. That means those buying in Stage 1 are getting the best deal. Once it sells out, the price goes up, and there’s no going back. As the project gains steam and tokens get burned, that low entry disappears fast. Buying is simple. Use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet to buy with ETH, USDT, or BNB. No KYC, no paperwork—just a quick, easy way to join before the next price jump. Right now, every minute matters. Dragoin is trending on Telegram and meme coin discussion boards, and interest is rising quickly. The sooner you act, the better your spot when the token launches in Q4. Buy Before the Burn—This Could Be the Start of Something Big Dragoin is changing the game for meme coin launches. It’s not just a flashy token—it’s an active project where users play, earn, and connect. With a working game, a shrinking token supply, and up to 6,700% ROI potential, the first stage of this presale could be a turning point for early buyers. The presale is open now, and savvy investors are already locking in their spots. Don’t wait to hear about Dragoin’s success after it’s too late. Buy now, before the next stage kicks in—because once the burn hits and prices climb, your chance to get in early will be long gone.

With multiple nations including India and the United Kingdom (UK), now weighing retaliatory responses, BTC price remains at risk as safety trades drive Gold (XAU) price to all time highs near $3,200. Trump’s Tariff Sends Global Markets into Turmoil The Bitcoin price took a sharp dive, hitting lows of $82,000 on April 2, 2025, as financial markets reeled from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement. During his ‘ Liberation Day ’ speech, Trump revealed aggressive reciprocal tariff rates on numerous trade partners, declaring it a long-overdue correction to America’s trade imbalances. The new tariffs, which include a 26% “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on Indian imports, 20% on European Union goods, and 34% on Chinese exports, have ignited concerns about escalating global trade tensions. Key details from Trump’s tariff speech In a highly charged speech at the White House, Trump emphasised that new trade policy, aimed at counteracting what Trump calls “unfair trade practices,” imposes significant tariffs on major trading partners. The key highlights include: China: 34% European Union: 20% South Korea: 25 India: 26% Japan: 24% United Kingdom: 10% Taiwan: 32% Vietnam: 46% Trump particularly criticised India, citing its high tariffs on U.S. goods. “India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. They charge us 52%. For years, we charged them almost nothing. The Prime Minister just left. He’s a great friend of mine, but I said, ‘You are a friend of mine, but you are not treating us right” US President Donald Trump, April 2, 2025 Market Reaction: Gold hits new all-time highs as BTC Faces Instant Sell-off The cryptocurrency market reacted swiftly, with Bitcoin leading the decline. Within hours of the announcement, Bitcoin price tumbled to $82,200, erasing gains from the previous days, when prices surged as high as $87,400 on Wednesday. Bitcoin Price Action After Announced New Tariffs, April 2 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Investors fear that the aggressive tariff stance could disrupt global economic stability, reducing liquidity in speculative assets like Bitcoin and drive demand towards safe-haven assets such as Gold ( XAU ). Gold (XAU) Price Action After Trump Announced New Tariffs, April 2 2025 | Source: KitcoNews Validating this stance Gold price surged to new all time highs above $3,150, within hours of Trump’s tariff announcement. Historically, Bitcoin has often benefited from its status as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, since Trump’s inauguration, BTC has exhibited close correlation to US Stocks, due to to heavy involvement of the US government and the direct exposure from Wall Street big wigs like Blackrock and Michael Saylor’s Strategy (Fomerly known as Microstrategy). Consequently, Bitcoin price is likely to track US Stocks’ movements in the coming weeks, according to Martrixsport Bitcoin Price Forecast: What’s Next After Finding Support at $82,000? Bitcoin price is stabilising near $83,178 after testing the $82,000 support level, but technical indicators on the BTC price forecast charts suggest bearish pressure still persists. First, the Bollinger Bands indicate contracting volatility, with the price nearing the lower band at $80,871. A break below this could open the door to further losses. Meanwhile, the VWAP at $82,886 suggests Bitcoin is hovering near a key liquidity zone, with buyers defending this area. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSDT The MACD indicator is bearish, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, reinforcing downside risks. The histogram remains negative, indicating weakening momentum. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the 20-day moving average at $84,498, sellers could push it towards $80,000. Conversely, a close above $84,498 may trigger a short-term rebound, targeting the upper Bollinger Band at $88,125. However, with declining volume and weakening bullish momentum, the upside scenario remains uncertain. Bitcoin price forecast remains cautiously bearish unless buyers reclaim key resistance levels. A break below $82,000 could intensify selling, aligning Bitcoin with broader market uncertainty following Trump’s tariff announcement.

Binance is proceeding with the decentralized listing program but Pi Network is noticeably absent from the raft of cryptocurrencies. Pi Network Fails To Make Binance List Pi Network enthusiasts are in limbo following the absence of the token in Binance’s Vote to List initiative. According to a press release , Binance has opened voting for its second Vote to List initiative. This time, 12 tokens are up for community voting, with Binance proceeding to spot-list successful tokens. Apart from vote count, Binance says it will consider trading demand, a risk assessment, and a compliance check to decide on tokens that will make the listing. The selected tokens include VIRTUAL, BIGTIME, UXLINK, MORPHO, GRASS, ATH, WAL, SAFE, ZETA, IP, ONDO, and PLUME. While the first focused on memecoin, the second iteration beams a searchlight on utility tokens cutting across several verticals. Back in March, Binance excluded Pi Network from its first edition of the Vote to List initiative. Binance has clarified that only BNB-based projects will be allowed to participate in the Vote to List initiative, dousing optimism for Pi Network enthusiasts. When Will Binance List The Asset? Despite Pi missing out on the Vote to List program, there is still a ray of hope for community members. Binance can list Pi via a direct listing in the future but a timeline is unavailable. Experts say a lack of transparency by The PiCoreTeam (PCT) is a reason why Binance has not listed Pi Network. Particularly, the exchange took swipes at the PCT for failing to give proper disclosures on the Pi Network’s locking and burning mechanism. Pi Network secured a major listing on the BTCC Exchange, bringing the token closer to being listed on mainstream exchanges. While a listing hovers on the horizon for Pi, the PCT’s domain auction is gathering steam with over 200,000 bids. Pi price has been largely underwhelming over the last day, losing nearly 5%. Pi trades at $0.6646 to drop below the $0.7 mark for the first time in over a month.

The Trump administration has hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5 , with some countries facing even larger rates, such as China facing a 34% tariff, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. During an April 2 speech in the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said the US is charging countries “approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.” 🚨 @POTUS signs an Executive Order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. It's LIBERATION DAY in America! pic.twitter.com/p7UnfE617B — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) April 2, 2025 The crypto market briefly went up at the news of a 10% sweeping tariff, but once the full scope became known, it dipped with bleeding across the board. Bitcoin ( BTC ) had been staging a rally, reaching a session high at $88,500 but dropped 2.6% back to around $82,876. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data shows Ether ( ETH ) dropped over 6% from $1,934 to $1,797 following the tariff announcements and the total crypto market cap dropped 5.3% to $2.7 trillion. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 25, classed as extreme fear, in its latest April 2 update. However, prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 0.8% to $83,205. While Ether regained 1.2% to take back $1,810. The crypto Fear & Greed Index score has returned an average rating of fear for the last week but has now dipped to extreme fear. Source: Alternative.me Stock markets didn't fare much better; trading resource The Kobeissi Letter said in an April 2 post to X that the stock market index S&P 500 erased over $2 trillion in market cap, working out to be roughly $125 billion per minute. Trump tariffs could bring certainty to markets Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the brief surge was a case of “uncertainty relief,” then a sell-off as the full tariff details were released. “On BTC Markets, trading volume surged 46% as local traders scrambled to reposition. Big players took profit on the spike, while smaller investors hesitated,” she said in a statement. Source: Daan Crypto Trades She added that if China or the European Union “hit back hard,” expect another round of panic selling . US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response, which could provide a “ceiling” and certainty for markets. David Hernandez, a crypto investment specialist at crypto asset manager 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that markets experienced significant volatility during Trump’s speech, but the clarity could be a good thing in the long term. “Although the tariff rates were slightly higher than expectations, the announcement provided much-needed clarity on the scope and scale of the policy,” he said. Related: 70% chance of crypto bottoming before June amid trade fears: Nansen “Markets thrive on certainty, and with speculation now largely removed, institutional investors may see an opportunity over the coming days to take advantage of compressed valuations.” Hernandez says global responses will be key for the market going forward, speculating that Mexico and key East Asian economies, including China, South Korea, and Japan, could be evaluating countermeasures.

Solana and Avalanche have made big moves—Solana with its hybrid PoH-PoS model and Avalanche with its multi-chain setup. Both offer speed, modularity, and impressive adoption figures. But while they rack up headlines and returns, BlockDAG is taking a different route. Its Beta Testnet focuses on practical testing, not promises. With $210.5 million raised and 19 billion coins already sold, BlockDAG’s live testing phase is less a teaser and more a readiness trial for mainnet. Solana: Ultra-Fast Network Building Momentum Solana relies on a mix of Proof of History and Proof of Stake to keep transactions fast and fees low. It handles more than 65,000 transactions per second, putting it among the top contenders for blockchain speed. Those who joined Solana’s $0.22 seed round in 2020 saw huge gains as it surged past $200 in earlier bull markets. From March 2024 to March 2025, Solana jumped from $20 to over $175—an increase of more than 750%. Its daily active addresses have grown 450%, and in January 2025 alone, it brought in $250M in fee revenue—outpacing Ethereum. Solana now counts over 3.25 million users and leads in developer activity, drawing in DeFi and NFT builders alike. It’s pushing hard to stay a top choice for scalable blockchain use. Avalanche: Flexible Layer-1 with a Big Year Behind It Avalanche, developed by Ava Labs, uses a three-chain system—X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain—to keep things scalable and efficient. Its Snowman consensus protocol delivers near-instant finality, helping it support more traffic. Early buyers who got AVAX at $0.50 during its 2020 sale saw big returns when the token passed $60 in early 2025. From March 2024 to March 2025, AVAX gained nearly 250%, thanks to upgrades like Avalanche9000. That update made launching subnet blockchains easier, bringing more developers to the ecosystem. Daily transactions went up more than 300% year-over-year, and total value locked (TVL) more than doubled. Avalanche’s flexible approach to blockchain design is attracting both enterprises and DeFi teams looking to build real-world solutions. BlockDAG’s Beta Is a Stress Test, Not a Showcase Launched on March 28, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet isn’t just a technical preview—it’s a live-fire testing ground. Designed to stress every layer of the network, the testnet pushes for over 15,000 daily transactions and 200 active mining nodes, exposing weak points and measuring decentralization in real time. It also puts token logistics under the microscope, simulating the vesting and distribution process for more than 110,000 presale buyers—making sure everything works before mainnet goes live. Behind the scenes, a 24/7 Freshdesk pipeline logs issues and escalates them directly to dev teams for rapid response. What’s backing this no-room-for-error rollout? A huge wave of support. BlockDAG has already raised $210.5 million in presale funds, selling over 19 billion coins. At a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27, early adopters have seen a 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. Bottom line: this phase isn’t about theory—it’s real-time validation under pressure. Stress-Tested vs. Live-Deployed Solana and Avalanche have proven they can grow fast and scale high—but both are already deep into live deployments. BlockDAG, in contrast, is focusing on proving its reliability first. From vesting simulations for more than 110,000 wallets to performance benchmarks across thousands of transactions and mining operations, the Beta Testnet is built around real validation. With a 2,380% return since Batch 1 and strong community engagement, BlockDAG is prioritizing long-term reliability over short-term headlines. And when the mainnet finally launches, that careful testing may prove to be its biggest asset.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Close To Neutral Region The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking These Levels Could Be The Catalyst For Next Bull Run, Analyst Says To determine this sentiment, the index uses data on five factors: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The metric makes use of a numeric scale running from zero to hundred for representing this estimated mentality. All values above 53 correlate to a sentiment of greed, while those under 47 that to fear. The territory between these cutoffs represents a net-neutral mentality. Now, here is what the current Bitcoin sentiment is like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 44 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of fear. This crowd despair is only slightly dominant, though, as the metric is just three units away from the neutral zone. The same wasn’t the case just yesterday, however, as the indicator held a value of 34, firmly placing it in the fear region. Below is a chart that shows how the index’s value has developed during the past year. Looks like the metric has seen a sharp improvement compared to a few days ago | Source: Alternative From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was around the neutral zone in the final week of March, but the price plunge that came during the last couple of days of the month led to a rapid deterioration of sentiment. At its lowest, the indicator touched the 26 mark during the plummet. This value was so deep into the fear region that it was on the entryway to a special zone called the extreme fear (25 and under). Historically, Bitcoin and other digital assets have tended to move in the direction that the crowd least expects. The probability of such a contrary move rises, and the stronger investor sentiment becomes, so extreme fear is where bottoms are likely to take place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Down, But Whale Wallets Quietly Climb to 4-Month High During the recent plunge, the index didn’t enter into this zone, but it did come close, which may be why BTC’s price was able to reach a local bottom. Since the low, the asset has made some recovery and has now broken past $85,000. With investor sentiment no longer being strong in any direction following this recovery, the cryptocurrency might be roughly equally probable to move in either direction. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $85,000, down almost 4% in the last seven days.

The two Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. have raised concerns about former President Donald Trump’s financial ties to the cryptocurrency sector. They urged acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda in an April 2 letter to preserve all WLFI records and share details with Congress. They fear that Trump’s financial stake in the company might maneuver regulations in the crypto business. The legislators are especially worried that Trump’s administration will lean on the SEC to reach favorable decisions for crypto companies that benefit him and his family. The letter stated: “The financial interest that the Trump family has in World Liberty Financial presents an unprecedented conflict of interest that has the potential to shape the Trump Administration’s oversight — or absence of oversight — of the cryptocurrency industry.” They contend that government agencies — the SEC is just one of them — must not be swayed by personal business interests. Experts have concerns about Trump’s crypto plans Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency has ballooned recently, with lawmakers expressing worry. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) recently issued a stablecoin named USD1 on several major blockchain networks. Since January, Trump has launched various crypto approaches, including a national cryptocurrency stockpile that would serve as a government reserve to hold large proportions of digital currency. He has also launched the TRUMP memecoin, a cryptocurrency connected to the political brand he can use to raise money or rally his base. Lawmakers worry that Trump’s rising power in the crypto sphere could result in policy shifts that directly profit him. The risk here, in particular, is that he could advocate for WLFI’s stablecoin to be adopted for government transactions, enabling his family to profane directly from public funds. Representative Maxine Waters voiced those concerns in a hearing on April 2 in the House Financial Services Committee, saying that without adequate oversight, Trump could set up WLFI’s stablecoin as an official mode of payment for government services. That, she contended, raised significant ethical concerns because it would enable Trump and his family members to profit financially from the government policies enacted during his presidency. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have urged more transparency about Trump’s financial transactions in the cryptocurrency industry in response to these concerns. They have formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to retain records of any communications with Trump’s family regarding WLFI and any back-and-forths with Trump campaign donors connected to crypto firms. They also seek documentation relating to changes in SEC policies surrounding cryptocurrency since Trump took office. They are concerned that the SEC will be an independent regulator without political influence and that financial policy does not put Trump’s business interests ahead of the public good. The SEC is changing its leadership and crypto regulations Since Trump was inaugurated, the SEC has undergone significant leadership turnover, which has changed the agency’s approach to virtual currency regulation. Under Trump, with Mark Uyeda as acting SEC chair, the agency shelved investigations and enforcement actions against multiple crypto companies. Some companies employ executives who donated to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. This has raised concerns that political and financial interests are polluting the SEC and distracting it from its mission of implementing financial laws fairly. Now, Trump is formally nominating Paul Atkins as the next permanent chair of the SEC. Famous for his pro-business orientation and deregulatory outlook, Atkins is a controversial pick to supervise financial markets. His nomination was scheduled to be voted on by the Senate Banking Committee on April 3. If confirmed by the full Senate, he will become the official chair of the SEC. It was important that the American people know — whether their money markets were being regulated objectively, or whether decisions were being made regarding regulatory issues for the financial benefit of the president’s family,” their letter concluded.

With its presale already surpassing $14.3 million and a growing reputation for utility in the real world, Remittix is attracting serious attention. The project’s crypto-to-fiat payment system solves a serious global need, making it stand out in a market dominated by hype-driven projects. As ETH and MATIC traders continue to double down, RTX is gradually becoming the most recommended token to purchase in 2025. Ethereum Price: ETH Must Reclaim $2,300 to Confirm a Bullish Reversal Ethereum has endured a rough ride over the past year. While BTC is up by 18% in the same period, ETH has remained nearly 50% below its previous high, leaving early adopters to anticipate a rebound. For ETH holders, the frustration has been building, but analysts like Ali Martinez believe the story is not yet over. According to his recent analysis, Ethereum needs to return to the $2,100 price mark and then the $2,300 price region before it can trigger the bulls. Until the asset returns to those levels, it may continue to experience sideways movement. ETH’s last attempt to break the level came on March 9 when the asset hit $2,100 briefly before slipping to $1,754, a move that triggered the bulls in the short term before testing the resistance zones. For Ethereum to register an upward price movement, the asset needs to move above the $2,300 price mark. Some analysts are still hopeful, while others like Rookie suggest Ethereum price could still drop as low as $1,200 by the middle of the year before recovering. In the current market, both outcomes are likely, which is why many Ethereum and Polygon investors are splitting their assets, looking for new layer-1 tokens with a big upside potential. Polygon Struggles to Recover as Bearish Pattern Persists Polygon is currently facing one of the toughest market stretches in years, with long time traders suddenly cautious about the market. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently mentioned that POL has remained in a descending triangle for a long time, a sign that shows that the bears have been in the market for the past four years. Despite several attempts to rebound, the $0.32 support eventually gave way in late february, confirming that another slight drop could send the token to as low as $0.04. The drop will represent an 86% drop from the token’s previous levels, a situation that has made many traders reconsider their positions. The recent trading activity has not helped the confidence in the market either. POL showed a brief rise, but quickly returned to a tight range between $0.2035 and $0.2136. With the volume drying up and no buying pressure, investors are seeing monthly losses, with the asset down 35% in the last 30 days and 70% in the year. Recovery looks far-fetched unless a new catalyst enters the market. For now, the market behavior shows that the bears are still in control. In response to these market conditions, early investors in polygon alongside Ethereum holders are seeking fresh opportunities in the market, and one name keeps coming up: Remittix (RTX). With POL presently stuck in a zone, Remittix is looking like the best alternative that experienced POL investors never knew they needed. The asset offers them potential and real use cases that POL, which is still struggling presently, should be delivering. Remittix Gains Momentum With Over $14.3 Million Raised in Presale Among the many tokens that have been catching the attention of investors in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is standing out, not because of its hype, but for its innovation. Now priced at $0.0734 with about $14.3 million already raised and 525 million tokens sold, Remittix is attracting serious attention. The project is not focusing on flashy tech or untested narrative, as it wants to solve a big global problem: real-time, affordable, cross-border payments. And that is what early Ethereum and Polygon investors are betting on. Unlike speculative tokens like Arbitrum or unproven ones like Celestia, Remittix has already its niche as a PayFi platform with purpose. The project allows users to instantly convert crypto into fiat currencies for bank deposits, removing high fees and long delays that affect traditional payment systems. Whether it’s an NGO sending urgent funds across continents or freelancers moving payments between wallets and bank accounts, Remittix makes the process easy. This kind of utility is what early Polygon and Ethereum investors saw in the projects, and that is why they are moving to RTX. While most tokens remain in their experimental phase or are stuck with the resistance levels, Remittix offers something better: a working model that delivers speed, cost efficiency, and a better way to reach the unbanked. Early ETH and MATIC Holders Bet Big on Remittix As April continues to unfold and the market shows a cautious sign, traders are now carefully selecting their preferred tokens. They are no longer chasing every new chain or meme coin. Instead, they are moving funds to projects that offer value and with the power to last long in the market and Remittix checks all the boxes. It has already become the most talked about presale in Ethereum and Polygon circles, and with demand increasing, many believe that RTX could be the best-performing new token of the year.

With meme coins lighting up social feeds and portfolio dashboards alike, 2025 is shaping up to be another breakout year for high-risk, high-reward tokens. From the hilarious to the oddly philosophical, coins like Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), Book of Meme ($BOME), and Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT) are riding viral waves. But behind the scenes, an exclusive meme coin presale is stealing the spotlight among crypto insiders—and it’s called Troller Cat ($TCAT). While Dogs ($DOGS), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), Degen ($DEGEN), Comedian ($BAN), and Simon’s Cat ($CAT) compete in the open market, Troller Cat is still in stealth mode, quietly building hype through a private whitelist-only entry. Those watching the best meme coin presale scene closely already know getting in early can make all the difference. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT): The Private Presale That Could Define 2025’s Meme Run Troller Cat isn’t just a crypto project—it’s a movement. A digital trickster loaded with community mischief and layered utility, $TCAT is built on Ethereum and surrounded by heavy buzz. The project combines meme culture with tokenomics that reward early believers, and it’s designed to be deflationary by nature. From its rebellious branding to its loyal Discord-driven community, Troller Cat could claw its way into the spotlight once the presale ends. Here’s the big play: Troller Cat is currently in a private meme coin presale phase, available only through whitelist access. That means early investors can grab $TCAT at pre-launch pricing—with whispers of a play-to-earn Game Center and high-yield staking on the horizon. This project could grow more valuable over time because tokens will reportedly be burned as users play, reducing supply. The community is already rallying around this early access event. Sign up now to avoid being late to the game. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s not even live yet, but Troller Cat is already on track to become the best meme coin presale of 2025. 2. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY): The Calm Meme Coin in a Chaotic Crypto World Some meme coins go hard; CHILLGUY takes the opposite route. Built around laid-back vibes and a lifestyle of nonchalant winning, CHILLGUY embodies a new generation of meme tokens where attitude is everything. With a clean aesthetic and massive meme potential, this coin speaks to crypto traders tired of chaos and craving something a little cooler. The token has taken off on social media, helped by simple but effective visuals and organic meme engagement. The project team also teases casual NFT drops and gamified interactions without overpromising. Why This Coin Made It to the List: CHILLGUY is the most relaxed yet oddly magnetic meme coin of 2025. 3. Book of Meme ($BOME): Turning Meme History into On-Chain Legacy Book of Meme is a meme coin philosophy wrapped in the blockchain. BOME stands out for documenting, archiving, and tokenizing memes into on-chain legacy. It positions itself as the holy grail of meme lore—a decentralized archive for internet culture. Beyond concept, the project is building out tools that make meme minting, sharing, and staking possible within its ecosystem. This isn’t just about laughs; it’s about legacy. BOME also actively partners with other meme communities to ensure cultural preservation and crypto synergy. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Memes deserve a blockchain museum, and BOME is building one. 4. Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT): Where AI, Lore, and Crypto Collide ACT is the intersection of crypto memes and speculative fiction. It combines AI-generated storylines with crypto-powered characters to offer a truly narrative-driven token experience. Each holder contributes to the unfolding plotline—a decentralized story economy fueled by ACT tokens. While the tech is still evolving, its concept of merging storytelling and meme culture has already turned heads. The token is gaining traction on niche storytelling forums and among Web3 creators. Why This Coin Made It to the List: ACT is a narrative-driven meme coin with real storytelling chops. 5. Dogs ($DOGS): The Meme Coin With a Tail-Wagging Mission The dog meme never dies—and DOGS knows it. This project capitalizes on the endless love for canine tokens but shakes it up by supporting dog rescue initiatives through its DAO. It’s wholesome, meme-worthy, and well-timed for Gen Z and Millennial dog lovers. Thanks to its influencer-packed launch and real-world charity tie-ins, DOGS has grown rapidly. The roadmap includes NFT adoption certificates and metaverse dog parks. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DOGS brings heart to the meme market, proving memes can matter. 6. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Crude, Loud, and Surprisingly Effective Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. FARTCOIN is absurdly monetized. It’s loud, it’s crude, and it’s oddly refreshing. The coin has built a hilarious presence on TikTok and X with prank campaigns, funny sound NFTs, and community stunts. FARTCOIN doesn’t try to be serious, and that’s its strength. It delivers raw meme power to a crowd that craves entertainment over formality. Why This Coin Made It to the List: FARTCOIN proves that humor is still useful in the meme coin universe. 7. Degen ($DEGEN): Where High Risk Meets Meme Glory DEGEN is the meme coin that salutes its wildest holders. Built by traders, for traders, DEGEN is all about high-risk, high-reward play. It taps into trader culture with hilarious self-aware memes and a brutally honest tone. The community thrives on chaos—they love the volatility and wear it like a badge. The roadmap includes leaderboard trading games and a “Degen of the Week” spotlight. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DEGEN embraces the rollercoaster of crypto and builds a tribe around it. 8. Comedian ($BAN): Where Crypto and Comedy Share the Stage BAN is what happens when a stand-up set meets DeFi. It’s a meme coin dedicated to comedy, parodying everything from Web3 buzzwords to influencer scams. $BAN memes are some of the most creative in the space.

Eventual approvals in both the overall House and Senate would let lawmakers start melding the two versions into a unified piece of legislation that could get a final nod. Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump have aimed toward an August goal in getting the effort completed. Though the crypto industry and their most reliable Republican allies in Congress were happy to welcome many Democrats to the yes side on moving the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) out of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, the Democrats on the panel consistently raised concerns about Trump's connections to the industry and stablecoins. Still, five Democrats joined 27 Republicans on the committee to advance the bill after a marathon markup session. A week before the House committee focused on the bill in Wednesday's markup — a session in which lawmakers make changes and debate amendments on legislation — the Trump-tied World Liberty Financial (WLFI) announced it's supporting its own stablecoin (USD1). Trump has been highly active in crypto, including in selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and memecoin $TRUMP, even as he pushes for crypto-friendly policies at the federal level. U.S. regulation of stablecoins — generally dollar-tied tokens, such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC — is one of the two top policy priorities for the industry. And committee Chairman French Hill argued on the industry's behalf that ""innovation needs guardrails, not roadblocks."" Republican members declined to discuss President Trump's industry involvement in any explicit terms. When Waters and other Democrats pushed amendments to block the potential conflicts raised by the president's business interests and his direct authority over regulators who would make decisions about stablecoins, they were rejected by the panel's Republicans, who repeatedly called such protections ""unnecessary."" ""We don't discriminate on entrepreneurs based on who they are and where they come from,"" Hill said. If the government wants clear guardrails around this space, he repeatedly argued, the best move is to pass the bill that establishes oversight. Representative Maxine Waters, the senior Democrat on the panel, said that Trump ""leveraged the power of the presidency to establish multiple crypto schemes to enrich himself and his family,"" calling it a ""display of greed."" ""He's unlike any other issuer, because he's the president of the United States,"" said Representative Stephen Lynch, the ranking Democrat on the panel's digital assets subcommittee, who argued Trump would be in a position to sign off on any government help needed by his own business interests were they to fail. ""If this was a Democratic president who was trying to do this, the Republicans' hair would be on fire, and rightly so. This should not be happening."" Another Democrat, Illinois Representative Sean Castin, argued that Tron's Justin Sun has put tens of millions of dollars into WLFI for no clear return other than its relationship to the Trump family. He contended that government officials tied to stablecoins could be influenced by foreign investors in a way that's hidden from public scrutiny. The Democratic arguments failed to move the committee's Republican majority, so no new amendments stuck to the effort. Supporters have said this House version is largely parallel to the Senate's. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican, said the House version properly maintains sufficient authority in the hands of state regulators, which offers a ""lighter touch, at times."" ""We have an administration that is ready to embrace these products, and the time is now,"" Huizenga said. This was one of a few bills before the House Financial Services Committee dealing with crypto-tied topics. Another piece of legislation debated on Wednesday was one that would form a cross-government group of law-enforcement agencies to address illicit crypto use and another that would ban U.S.-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC). Lawmakers also voted on dozens of amendments to the stablecoin bill before voting to advance the bill itself, prompting Rep. Lynch to joke that the panel may have set a record for the most failed votes in a row. The cross-government bill, the Financial Technology Protection Act, passed with unanimous support, 49-0. The anti-CBDC bill passed with 27 votes, with 22 lawmakers voting against. Though lawmakers initially had issues with their electronic voting system, they began making good time after starting votes near 10:30 p.m. ET – nearly 12.5 hours after the markup began. Voting on all five bills wrapped up by 11:15 p.m. ET. As the stablecoin bill continues to move forward, Trump is also poised to sign the first pro-crypto congressional action: a resolution that erases an Internal Revenue Service rule that targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. The president is expected to sign the resolution, though he hasn't announced a schedule to do so.

Neuralink is looking for people with quadriplegia — those who are not able to use their arms or legs — to sign up for a clinical trial, it said in an April 2 post on X, the social media platform also owned by Musk. As of January, Neuralink has said that three patients have been implanted with a device. All are quadriplegic and are testing a small brain implant that tracks neural activity to control a computer or smartphone as part of a clinical trial called the Precise Robotically Implanted Brain-Computer Interface, or PRIME study. Neuralink is one of several companies and academic institutions developing and testing so-called brain-computer interfaces, which vary from small wire-like implants as part of clinical trials to non-invasive devices akin to a hat. Source: Neuralink Neuralink’s website says its clinical PRIME study, which will take around six years, is looking for quadriplegics with spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to use their thoughts to control a computer. Musk also heads vehicle maker Tesla and is the Trump administration's government cost-cutting czar . He has said he wants Neuralink to move beyond just allowing humans to operate computers by thinking and wants to help “give people superpowers.” First Neuralink patient reports no side effects after a year Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink's first patient, said in a March 28 X post that he’s “had no negative side effects, neither physically nor psychologically” in the year after receiving his brain implant. Arbaugh, a quadriplegic, demoed his brain chip about a year ago by controlling a computer cursor to play chess and surf the web. https://t.co/OMIeGGjYtG — Neuralink (@neuralink) March 20, 2024 Arbaugh said he’s now using his brain chip “for all sorts of things” and guessed he’s using it for over 10 hours a day.

This steep drop follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s Apr. 2 announcement of aggressive new “ Liberation Day ” tariffs, which unsettled both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Trump’s policy sets a 10% baseline tariff on imports, with much higher rates for specific countries. China is now subject to a 54% tariff, which combines a new 34% rate with an existing 20% duty. A 20% rate will be imposed on the European Union, while Vietnam (46%), Taiwan (32%), India (26%), and Japan (24%) will also be affected by increased rates. However, Canada and Mexico are exempt from the 10% baseline tariff and additional reciprocal levies for now. The 10% tariff would only be imposed if Trump withdraws the 25% duties that are currently in place on these nations, which were put in place initially because of concerns about drug trafficking and crime.

Although investors responded with skepticism, he claimed that the measure would protect American industries and result in lower prices for consumers. Following Trump’s tariffs announcement, U.S. stock markets plummeted, with Dow futures dropping over 1,000 points and significant losses in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Crypto markets followed suit. The broader crypto market cap shrank 4% to $2.7 trillion, as per crypto.news price tracker . Bitcoin ( BTC ) initially spiked to $88,500 as Trump took the stage but quickly dropped to $83,073, down 2% in the last 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies also saw losses. Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 4% to $1,816, while Solana ( SOL ) dropped 5.2% to $119. The sell-off triggered $514 million in 24 liquidations, with $290 million coming from long positions, according to Coinglass data . Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, noted via X that while the market has reacted negatively to the the “Liberation Day” tariffs, the market would be “out of the woods” if Bitcoin stays above $76,500 until U.S. tax day on April 15.

However, newer, more efficient blockchain projects are emerging, offering lower fees, faster transactions, and greater scalability. This has caused ETH and SOL to drop by 50% and 37%, respectively, in the last year, pushing investors to reconsider their positions. One hidden crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quickly gaining traction and could outperform both Ethereum and Solana. This innovative project offers AI-powered investment tools and real-world asset integration. Could it be the next market leader? Why Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Struggle to Maintain Their Lead Ethereum and Solana, two leading blockchain platforms, have struggled to keep dominating the rapidly evolving market. Their challenges have created opportunities for emerging competitors to gain traction. Ethereum suffers from scalability issues, high gas fees, institutional hesitation, governance inefficiencies, and fierce competition from emerging blockchains. Ethereum’s scalability issues have led to high transaction fees and frustrating users and developers. While Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum aim to mitigate these problems, they have not fully resolved the network’s inefficiencies. Slow decision-making within Ethereum’s decentralized governance model has delayed critical upgrades, such as sharding, which is essential for improving scalability. This has weakened its ability to adapt quickly to market demands. Solana’s biggest challenge is its network stability issues. Solana has faced repeated outages that undermine its reliability as a blockchain platform. These disruptions have raised questions about its ability to handle large-scale adoption. There are also centralization risks, capital outflows, and competition from multi-chain platforms. These Ethereum and Solana struggles are pushing investors to newer cryptos that address their shortcomings and offer more tangible value, like RCOF. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Crypto Quickly Gaining Traction Compared to Ethereum and Solana, RCO Finance is emerging as a strong alternative that provides ingenious solutions and transforms how investors interact with the market.

Which Of These Could 50x By August According To Top Crypto Analysts",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-solana-or-remittix-which-of-these-could-50x-by-august-according-to-top-crypto-analysts/,"As crypto markets regain momentum, investors are asking which tokens could deliver the next breakout. While Cardano and Solana remain top-tier contenders with solid ecosystems, a surprising challenger has entered the race Remittix (RTX) . With over $14.3 million raised in presale and a practical solution for cross-border payments, analysts are now tipping Remittix as the dark horse with the highest upside. Could this underdog project outpace the giants and deliver 50x returns by August? Cardano Struggles Below Key Resistance as Bears Take Control Cardano has hit a technical snag, and top analysts are watching closely as the price shows signs of weakness. After a strong attempt to break above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average near $0.73, ADA was firmly rejected falling nearly 7% in just a week. That 200-day EMA aligns almost perfectly with a key resistance level around $0.74, making it a critical ceiling the bulls have failed to break. Cardano price briefly recovered towards $0.69 on Tuesday, but has fallen back below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement from the crypto’s August low of $0.27 to the December high of $1.32. Now trading at $0.67 , Cardano price risks an extended correction that could send it down to the February 28 low of $0.58, marking a further 13% drop from its current level. ADA’s near-term picture raises questions in a market where investors are eyeing high-upside plays. Can it be 50x by August? Unlikely, according to many analysts, who argue that Cardano’s upside is capped unless it breaks out of this technical slump and finds new momentum. Solana Holds Strong at $129 as Network Activity Climbs Solana is holding steady at around $128.7 after a modest 1.3% gain in the past 24 hours, but what’s happening under the surface may matter more than the price action. With on-chain activity growing and fresh technical proposals on the table, analysts are beginning to ask whether Solana could be gearing up for something bigger. A newly introduced proposal to increase the block limit to 60 million compute units (CUs) would significantly expand the network’s capacity boosting scalability without raising account-level constraints. For developers and users alike, this move signals that Solana isn’t just surviving, it’s upgrading for long-term dominance. Beyond the tech, stablecoin adoption on Solana continues to soar. Circle minted an additional $250 million in USDC this week alone, bringing the total minted in 2025 to a staggering $11.5 billion. That kind of growth across DeFi, payments and other financial primitives is a strong sign that Solana’s infrastructure is gaining real-world traction. Adding fuel to the momentum, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Solana just hit a new all-time high with 11.12 million unique addresses on the network, another signal of rising user engagement. Martinez also notes that if SOL pushes past $140 , it could trigger a short squeeze, with $69 million in short positions at risk of liquidation. That pressure could quickly flip into a sharp rally, especially if market sentiment turns more bullish. Analysts Tip Remittix to Outpace Cardano and Solana by August While major altcoins like Cardano and Solana continue to capture headlines, a growing number of analysts are betting on a lesser-known contender Remittix (RTX) as the one with the highest upside potential. With over 525 million tokens sold and $14.3 million raised in presale, Remittix is already rewarding early participants with returns above 1000%, despite broader market volatility. Priced at just $0.0734, RTX has emerged as the top pick for investors seeking real-world use cases and scalable impact. Remittix isn’t just another DeFi project chasing the next trend, it solves a multi-trillion-dollar problem with a focused approach. Its cross-border payment system converts over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies in minutes, cutting out days of wait time and excessive banking fees. In a remittance market worth over $190 trillion annually, this kind of efficiency isn’t just innovative, it’s game-changing. Remittix’s tech integrates directly into merchant platforms through its Pay API, allowing businesses to accept crypto and receive fiat instantly. Traders Eye Remittix as the Top 50x Candidate This Year While Cardano and Solana are respected for their tech foundations, much of their projected growth depends on developer activity and future network upgrades. Remittix , by contrast, is already delivering utility. Its public ledger infrastructure adds transparency and security to every transaction, offering practical value to crypto purists and newcomers alike. The timing could not be better. As altcoin price action grows choppier, investors are rotating into projects with a clearer route to adoption. Cardano’s future hinges on ecosystem upgrades. Solana’s depends on managing scalability and staying ahead of congestion. Remittix is already pushing live payments into the real world and analysts think that could lead to a 50x explosion by August if its momentum continues. In a market where speculation often trumps substance, Remittix is flipping the narrative. And that’s why many are starting to believe RTX won’t just compete with Cardano and Solana, it could surpass them altogether.

Global DDoS activity increased by 12.7% in the second half of 2024 compared to the first half, totaling almost 9 million attacks, according to the firm. A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal web traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. The largest increases have been in Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions, with around 30% and 20% increases from the first half, respectively. Netscout reported that there were a total of 7.9 million DDoS attacks in the first half of 2024, with a combined total of 16.8 million for the full year, up almost 30% from the 13 million attacks the firm recorded in 2023. Attackers have been using the internet disruption tool to “exploit moments of national vulnerability to amplify chaos and erode trust in institutions,” the researchers said. The report described DDoS attacks as “precision-guided digital weapons” capable of disrupting infrastructure at critical moments, highlighting how they have been deployed during sociopolitical conflicts, elections, protests and policy disputes. Weekly DDoS statistics, 2024. Source: Netscout AI is supercharging DDoS attacks DDoS-for-hire services, including booters and stressors, are “more powerful than ever,” they added, as cyber criminals leverage AI and automation to bypass CAPTCHA, with automation “advancing toward capabilities such as behavior mimicry and real-time attack adjustments.” The researchers concluded that DDoS attacks “are no longer just about raw bandwidth,” adding that they are “adaptive, persistent, and deeply embedded in modern cyber and geopolitical conflicts.” “The shift to high-powered enterprise infrastructure, turnkey reconnaissance, the rise of AI-enhanced automation and the expansion of DDoS-for-hire services mean that attackers are evolving faster than ever.” The role of DDoS attacks is evolving, Corero Network Security chief technology officer Ashley Stephenson told Forbes recently, adding, “By automating tasks that were once labor-intensive or required specialized skills, AI lowers the barrier to entry for attackers.” Related: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: Chainalysis A DDoS attack targeted Elon Musk’s social media platform X in August, aimed at disrupting his interview with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Miner volume share has spiked to 15% in 2023, highlighting a shift in Bitcoin adoption and a lack of on-chain usage. Despite Bitcoin's price correction, the global hash rate continues to rise, exacerbating the economic challenges for miners due to decreasing block subsidies. Even though WGMI is clearly allocating more toward miners that are prioritizing HPC/AI services, the largest holdings are still highly reliant on mining for top line revenue. When I last wrote about the CoinShares Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) for Seeking Alpha, the fund was trading near $22 per share. In a little over two months, WGMI shares have a negative total return approaching 40% and have drastically under-performed both the US equity market and the top digital asset by market cap: Data by YCharts In my late January article covering the fund, I highlighted the potential headwinds facing the mining-turned-HPC companies in the public markets. The takeaways from that piece were largely hypothetical. So in this update, we'll dig a little deeper into the raw data and highlight some very real headwinds these companies face through their primary revenue segment - mining Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Miner Volume Share Is Spiking In the chart below, I've taken out data for both 2009 and 2010 because they skew the chart due to how little adoption of Bitcoin there was at that time. The average miner share of volume was almost 95% in 2009 and 60% in 2010. By 2011, that average fell all the way to 19.3%. This metric should theoretically fall over time as users engage with the network to a larger degree. IntoTheBlock, Author's Chart During the 8 years between 2012 and 2019, miner share of volume averaged 13.2%. Miner volume share then dropped all the way to 3.6% in 2022. This was very much viewed as normal and beneficial to the broader network. Again, in an environment where Bitcoin adoption continues to grow on-chain, miner share of volume should go down. However, in the last three years, we've seen the opposite happen. The average for 2023 spiked up to 11.5%. Last year, the average hit 15% - the highest miner volume share reading since 2015. And through the first quarter of 2025 it doesn't look like all that much has changed. This is indicative of a larger problem that I have been pointing out through Seeking Alpha articles for at least the last year; namely, that off-chain 'adoption' of Bitcoin moves BTC-based activities largely off-chain. This squeezes the miners who have an economic incentive to secure the blockchain. Hashprice Keeps Falling CoinMetrics In spite of a Bitcoin price that has corrected from all-time highs, global mean hash rate continues to grind higher month after month. At the end of March the 30-Day Average mean hash rate was 817 EH/s. Dollar-denominated hash price ended the month at a little over $46 per PHS/Day. This is within sniffing distance of an all-time low, which would almost certainly be triggered by a deeper drop in the price of BTC: 5 Year BTC Hash Price (HashRateIndex) The fundamental problem is that the block subsidy from mining goes down over time. Thus, transaction fees must ultimately become a larger share of mining rewards than the block subsidy. IntoTheBlock, Author's Chart During Q1-25, daily revenue from transaction fees averaged 1.35% - this was the lowest level since Q3-2018. On April 1st, the median transaction fee on the Bitcoin network was 36 cents. It's perhaps easy to hand wave away the lack of fees paid by Bitcoin users as 'FUD,' but someone must pay to secure this network. If it isn't users paying directly, it's somebody else. And what we've seen over the last few years is the ability of public mining companies to raise capital through debt and dilution to fund rapid exahash growth while operating at steep losses. This squeezes out home miners and hobbyist miners and presents long term centralization risks. Most WGMI Stocks Still Primarily Mine BTC Ultimately, there probably has to be a balance between network usability and network profitability since such a large share of global exahash is operated by publicly listed mining companies. That figure generally falls somewhere between 20-25% of global exahash. While we certainly wouldn't want median fees to be so high that most on-chain holders would be priced out of using the network, we also need miners to have an incentive to hash. As I've laid out in a prior WGMI article , the fund's management seems keenly aware of the problematic economics of mining and has very much shifted toward a more HPC-based holding allocation than a pure-play mining allocation. Meaning, WGMI has a larger allocation to miners with large HPC/AI ambitions rather than those that have steadfastly remained focused on mining. We can see this even more clearly through the change in the top holdings in just the last two months: WGMI Top Ten Holdings (Seeking Alpha) For instance, CleanSpark ( CLSK ) - a company focused on mining - was a top 5 WGMI holding back in late-January and now it doesn't even crack the top 10 despite having the fifth largest mining market cap and second largest exahash capacity in the public markets. For a fund that claims to allocate to Bitcoin miners, this is quite telling. Furthermore NVIDIA ( NVDA ), a company that doesn't mine Bitcoin at all, is now a top 5 holding with a 5.3% allocation in a Bitcoin mining-themed ETF. Despite what I view as a clear pivot in strategy from mining to HPC services, WGMI's top holdings are still very much reliant on BTC mining for top line revenue: Year Ended December 2024 Self-Mining Revenue Total Revenue % From Self-Mining IREN Ltd ( IREN ) $113.5* $116.5* 97.4%* Core Scientific $408.7 $510.7 80.0% Riot Platforms $321.0 $376.7 85.2% Cipher Mining $151.30 $151.30 100.0% Source: Company Filings, revenue in millions. *3 months ended December 2024 I'm not including NVDA in this table for obvious reasons. But the table speaks for itself; despite plans to grow HPC/AI services, these companies still generated the overwhelming majority of their top line revenue from Bitcoin mining. Core Scientific generated just 6% of its total revenue from HPC hosting last year. Data by YCharts Those stocks in the chart above collectively account for 48.6% of WGMI AUM and yet none of them were able to produce a positive operating income in 2024. To be fair, the verdict is technically still out on IREN, but the sector trend is clear. Closing Takeaways WGMI a confusing fund. Bitcoin mining is in the name of the fund and most of the large holdings generate most of their top line revenue from Bitcoin mining - yet there is clearly allocation favor being given to the companies that want to get into HPC/AI or are already in those spaces to a small degree. The fact that most of these companies still derive their revenue from mining anyway should not be ignored due to the worsening fundamentals of that business. Hash rate keeps grinding higher, hash price grinds lower, and fees paid to miners through real usage keeps eroding. It's a fairly brutal setup and not one that I would say justifies a position in the fund.",BTC-USD|WGMI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-03 03:21:35

ETH is now trimming all gains and remains below the $1,880 resistance zone. Ethereum failed to stay above the $1,850 and $1,880 levels. The price is trading below $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,865 and $1,890 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Fails Again Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,800 support zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,920 resistance zone. However, the bears are active near the $1,950 zone. A high was formed at $1,955 and the price trimmed most gains. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $1,781 and the price is now consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,781 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,850 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,865 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,781 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,920 level. A clear move above the $1,920 resistance might send the price toward the $1,950 resistance. An upside break above the $1,950 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,865 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level. The first major support sits near the $1,780 zone. A clear move below the $1,780 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,680 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,620.

In an Apr. 3 update on the company’s blog, Binance stated it had reviewed First Digital USD’s ( FDUSD ) reserve data twice, once after the February attestation report was released and again recently to ensure accuracy. As of Mar. 1, FDUSD had $2.05 billion in reserves, according to the audit, which was carried out by Prescient Assurance. These reserves, which are kept in fixed deposits and U.S. Treasuries, are greater than the amount of stablecoin in circulation and guarantee a 1:1 redemption with USD. The update comes after Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun accused the stablecoin’s issuer, First Digital Trust, of being insolvent, causing FDUSD to momentarily lose its peg and drop by 5%. Sun called for regulatory action, criticized Hong Kong’s financial system, and advised investors to withdraw their funds.

Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) April 2, 2025 You might also like: Fidelity launches no-fee crypto IRA for US investors His claims caused panic selling, which led to FDUSD’s price dropping as low as $0.87 before recovering. In response, FDT refuted the claims, claiming that Sun’s remarks were deceptive and that FDUSD is fully backed. The company insisted the issue was unrelated to FDUSD and instead linked to a dispute involving TrueUSD ( TUSD ), another stablecoin it manages. FDT also accused Sun of launching a smear campaign against its business and has threatened to take legal action against him. Given that Binance owns roughly 94% of the supply of FDUSD, the situation has sparked worries about the exchange’s exposure. Some industry analysts have pointed out the risks of relying on a single stablecoin for key trading pairs. As of the time of press, FDUSD seems to have stabilized, trading at $0.99 despite market volatility. Binance intends to carry out another review after the next attestation report is published in two weeks and has reiterated its commitment to keeping an eye on the FDUSD’s stability.

Despite the initial surge in price, the cryptocurrency has faced a decline of 3.7% in the past week and nearly 10% in the past month, signaling a period of stagnation in its upward momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $84,263, raising questions about the future trajectory of the asset as investors await a clear direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reverses Losses—Analysts Say $100K Is On The Horizon The Dead Cross: A Signal for a Potential Price Drop? BilalHuseynov, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, has offered valuable insights into Bitcoin’s current market behavior. In his latest post, titled “Will Bitcoin Drop Anymore?”, he sheds light on key on-chain metrics that may help predict the next movement in Bitcoin’s price. His analysis revolves around the behavior of two important metrics: Realized Cap and Thermo Cap, particularly focusing on their recent crossover, which could have significant implications for Bitcoin’s price direction. Huseynov explains that the Realized Cap metric, which tracks Bitcoin’s total value based on its last movement price, gives a more accurate representation of the network’s economic value. On the other hand, Thermo Cap measures the total capital introduced into the BTC network through mining. When Thermo Cap crosses below Realized Cap — known as a “Dead Cross” — it signals that Bitcoin might be heading toward a price decline. Huseynov points out that this situation is unfolding and predicts that BTC’s price could drop to as low as $75,000 if the second Dead Cross materializes. Is The Bitcoin Market Condition Still Healthy? In addition to Huseynov analysis, another CryptoQuant’s analyst Banker has provided insight into the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, which tracks the movement of long-dormant BTC. Since March 2025, the CDD 60-day moving average has remained low, indicating that long-term holders are not selling their Bitcoin in large quantities. This behavior is often a sign of confidence among seasoned investors, suggesting that they believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Watch This Key Price The absence of major CDD spikes indicates that the market is not experiencing extreme price volatility, which could signal a period of consolidation or eventual upward momentum as selling pressure remains low.

Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing with anticipation— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves in its presale, Celestia is rolling out groundbreaking developments, and Terra Classic is stirring excitement among investors. As the market heats up, each of these projects is making significant strides, but one stands out for its unique presale model and explosive ROI potential. Celestia recently unveiled updates on modular blockchain scalability, while Terra Classic continues its revival efforts, drawing attention from seasoned investors.

With an entry price of just $0.000087 and an ROI potential of 9,084.48% at launch, investors are scrambling to secure their stake before the next price hike. This article will cover the latest developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic. Arctic Pablo Coin: Token Burns Driving Long-Term Value | Best Crypto To Invest One of the most powerful mechanisms behind Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model is its aggressive token burn strategy. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. Once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, ensuring a consistent reduction in supply and increasing scarcity over time. This burn process is fully recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency. With scarcity driving value, Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn model is strategically designed to enhance investor confidence and long-term price appreciation. The project’s structured approach aims to create a sustainable economic model, setting it apart as the Best Crypto To Invest in right now. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Glacial Glade Reached – Time Is Running Out | Best Crypto To Invest The presale journey of Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached its 17th phase, Glacial Glade, where APC is priced at just $0.000087. Investors who enter at this stage stand to gain an ROI of over 9,084.48% by the time the token lists at $0.008. Over $2 million has already been raised, proving strong investor confidence. Unlike traditional presales with rigid stages, Arctic Pablo Coin introduces a unique location-based presale model. As APC “travels” through different locations, the price steadily increases. This means that the current entry price won’t last long—once Glacial Glade concludes, the price will rise again. With the next phase imminent, hesitation could mean missing out on one of the most lucrative investment opportunities in 2025. Many investors are securing their positions now, ensuring they lock in the best possible price before the meme coin presale moves forward. Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the Best Crypto To Invest before it moves to the next phase. Celestia’s Game-Changing Modular Blockchain Expansion Celestia continues to redefine blockchain scalability with its modular approach. The latest update introduces enhanced data availability layers, making transactions faster and more efficient for developers building on the platform. With the growing adoption of modular blockchain solutions, Celestia is cementing itself as a leader in innovation. As more projects integrate Celestia’s technology, its impact on the broader crypto ecosystem is becoming increasingly evident. Terra Classic’s Community-Led Revival Gains Momentum Terra Classic has seen a renewed push from its community, focusing on network upgrades and a revitalized burn mechanism. The latest proposal aims to restore investor confidence by implementing governance changes that enhance network stability. With ongoing discussions on reducing token supply and attracting new developers, Terra Classic is proving that its revival is far from over. As more stakeholders rally behind the project, its resurgence could shape the future of decentralized finance. Final Words While Celestia’s advancements in modular blockchain and Terra Classic’s revival efforts make them noteworthy, Arctic Pablo Coin is dominating the conversation with its groundbreaking presale model. With Glacial Glade marking its 17th phase and a price of $0.000087, the window for early investors is closing fast.

In a series of tweets on X, the exec called “tarriffing Layer 2s” “one of the most toxic ideas” for the blockchain’s future. Ye Zhang Opposes L2 Fees Zhang argued that such a move would trade long-term scalability and ecosystem growth for short-term revenue, a strategy he believes is better suited to centralized corporations than to Ethereum’s decentralized model. He went on to highlight that Ethereum’s true strength lies not in extracting revenue through protocol fees but in its potential to serve as the central asset across a growing number of rollups. With Ethereum already a dominant force in ecosystems like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync, Zhang suggested that more rollups would lead to greater adoption of ETH, expanding its role as a store of value. He warned that imposing fees on Layer 2s could drive developers away and leave Ethereum with limited scalability and relevance in the long run. “Ethereum doesn’t need to extract – it needs to enable. Ship faster, scale blobs 1000x more, scale execution to some degree. Make Ethereum DA attractive, ideally provide more value beyond security (interoperability, other shared components, liquidity bridges). Empower more aligned players.” Value Leakage Concerns While Zhang contended that Ethereum should focus on enabling Layer 2 expansion over imposing fees, the broader economic picture presents a growing challenge. As execution moves off-chain, Ethereum’s core network has seen a sharp decline in fee revenue, which, in turn, has raised concerns about value leakage. As reported by CryptoPotato , Ethereum’s fee generation has plummeted from nearly $30 million in March 2024 to just $500,000 a year later, as Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base capture most of the economic benefits. The shift has also impacted ETH’s burn rate, which led to a rise in net issuance and an increase in inflation to 0.79%.

Bessent, speaking Wednesday to Bloomberg Television, said, “I wouldn’t try to retaliate. As long as you don’t retaliate this is the high end of the number.” His comments came shortly after Trump unveiled a minimum 10% tariff on all exporters to the United States, plus additional duties on about 60 nations with the biggest trade imbalances with the US. The 10% tariff would take effect at midnight Saturday, followed by the higher, customized duties by 12:01 a.m. on April 9. According to the administration’s plan, certain partners are now facing far steeper penalties. China was singled out for a tariff of at least 54% on many goods. The European Union, Vietnam, and other major exporters will also see rates above 10% when the policy goes into effect. Bessent suggested these levels might stay where they are if other governments avoid countermeasures: “This is the high end of the number barring retaliation,” he said. “As far as negotiations go—we’ll see.” Trump during the speech on “Liberation Day”. Source: Fox 5 Atlanta Those existing tariffs will remain. Neither country will be subject to the new tariff schedule as long as the current measures stay in force. Products covered by the USMCA agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term, will remain exempt. The president has long argued that tariffs can be used to restore American manufacturing strength and protect US businesses, even though many economists fear this approach could set off rounds of retaliation. After World War II, the US and allies worked for decades to reduce duties and encourage trade, viewing international commerce as a safeguard against future conflicts. Trump’s latest move goes in the other direction, raising the prospect of higher costs for importers and possible retaliation by foreign capitals. The stock market responded quickly to the announcements According to Bloomberg’s report , major stock benchmarks lost at least 2% in the hours after the announcement, as investors and traders had been hoping for a less severe plan. Automaker shares slid in after-hours trading in New York before recovering some ground, while crude oil prices in New York opened around 2% lower. Analysts pointed out that the US relies on oil imports from Europe for its East Coast refineries, though it also exports some crude to other countries. Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, expressed alarm at the scale of the administration’s move. She called the new tariffs “much worse than we feared” and warned of major consequences for how goods flow around the globe. Questions remain about how the new rates will actually be administered. China bears the heaviest burden, while Canada and Mexico are exempted from additional tariffs On top of the 34% levy tied to Trump’s “reciprocal” plan, China already faces a 20% tariff due to fentanyl trafficking, as well as separate duties on items such as solar panels. Combined, these surcharges mean many imports from China could exceed a 50% duty. Trump has claimed those numbers are still not fully “reciprocal,” though the administration has not explained in detail how it arrived at the 54% figure. Bloomberg Economics estimates suggest that a 54% rate could cut China’s exports to the US by up to 90% by 2030. The European Union, according to White House documents, will face a 20% tariff. and Vietnam’s figure is set at 46%. Other countries singled out for higher rates include Japan at 24%, South Korea at 25%, India at 26%, Cambodia at 49%, and Taiwan at 32%. BREAKING: U.S. REVEALS RECIPROCAL TARIFF RATES LIST pic.twitter.com/52bCf73wuU — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) April 2, 2025 Canada and Mexico, the two neighbors, appear safe from the latest list for now because of the already existing 25% tariffs. In the event those measures are ended, any items not covered by USMCA provisions would see a 12% tariff. The White House statement made it clear that USMCA-compliant goods would remain free of the new levies. Trump called these tariffs “kind reciprocal,” saying that many foreign markets are still far more closed to US exports than America is to their goods. He also hinted that the US may lower its new tariffs if other countries reduce their own import barriers and stop what he calls currency manipulation. Administration officials have insisted that the tariffs will bring factories back to the US and generate job opportunities. Critics counter that the higher import costs will be painful for consumers and businesses. The president’s team, for its part, has asked the public to be patient, saying the final gains will outweigh any short-term problems. “We’ll see where it goes from here,” Bessent said, suggesting that any next steps would be slow. Other nations have signaled they are open to trade discussions, but the administration wants to “let things settle for a while” before deciding on its next move. Trump didn’t spare his ‘friend’ Modi’s government from tariffs India also got slapped with high tariff rates despite being a major US trading partner. Trump mentioned that he has good personal ties with India’s Prime Minister, and his ties didn’t affect the tariff outcome for India. The country is now facing a 25% tariff on imports, higher than the EU, Japan, and South Korea. However, it is certainly less than China and Vietnam. Nevertheless, these tariffs for India are a setback for the Indian government, which tried to dodge the tariffs by offering sweeping concessions on issues aligning with Trump’s agenda. Trump said at the White House earlier today, “India, very, very tough. Very, very tough.” He added, “The prime minister just left, and he’s a great friend of mine. But I said, you’re a friend of mine, but you’re not treating us right. They charge us 52%.” According to one Indian government official, it’s just a “mixed bag” and not really a setback for the country. Ajay Sahi, the director general at the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, said, “Our competitors like Vietnam and Cambodia have been hit harder than us.” He added, “solace in the fact that we are already engaged with the US” on a trade agreement.

42832494,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145800,1743652828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary OpenAI Plan: Expert Group to Advise on Crucial Nonprofit Goals Amidst For-Profit Transition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-expert-group-nonprofit-goals/,"In a significant move that has the AI and cryptocurrency worlds buzzing, OpenAI, the powerhouse behind groundbreaking AI models, is taking a strategic step to solidify its philanthropic mission. As the company navigates a complex transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit structure, it’s seeking guidance to ensure its charitable arm remains impactful. This news highlights the increasing intersection of cutting-edge technology and social responsibility, a topic of keen interest to crypto enthusiasts who believe in leveraging innovation for a better future. Expert Group to Shape OpenAI Nonprofit Goals OpenAI is not just developing advanced AI; it’s also deeply considering its societal impact. The company has announced the formation of an expert group specifically tasked with advising its philanthropic endeavors. This initiative comes at a pivotal moment as OpenAI prepares to shift from its original nonprofit foundation to a for-profit model. This group of experts is designed to provide critical insights into the most pressing challenges faced by nonprofits today, ensuring that OpenAI’s philanthropy is both effective and relevant. Here’s what we know about this crucial development: Expert Consultation: OpenAI is convening a diverse group of experts from various sectors including health, science, education, and public services. Focus on Urgent Issues: The group’s primary goal is to identify and understand the most urgent and intractable problems that nonprofits are currently grappling with. California Focus: While global in scope, there will be a particular emphasis on incorporating feedback from leaders and communities within OpenAI’s home state of California. Timeline: The expert group will be announced in April and is expected to deliver its insights to OpenAI’s board of directors within 90 days. Board Consideration: The OpenAI board will then consider these insights as it works to evolve the OpenAI nonprofit, with a target completion date well before the end of 2025. Why is OpenAI Focusing on AI Philanthropy Now? The timing of this initiative is particularly noteworthy. OpenAI, initially founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, has seen its operational needs and ambitions grow exponentially. The development of sophisticated AI models requires significant capital, leading OpenAI to evolve its structure to attract external investment. This evolution included creating a unique for-profit arm controlled by the nonprofit, allowing for investments from venture capitalists and major players like Microsoft, while capping profits for investors and employees. However, the ultimate goal, as indicated in OpenAI’s recent blog post, is a full transition of its existing for-profit structure into a traditional corporation with ordinary shares. This transition would involve the nonprofit ceding control in exchange for billions of dollars – resources earmarked for, presumably, AI philanthropy. The establishment of this expert advisory group underscores OpenAI’s commitment to strategically deploying these resources for maximum societal benefit. It’s a clear signal that as OpenAI’s for-profit ventures grow, so too will its dedication to leveraging AI for good through its nonprofit arm. The Stakes in OpenAI Transition and the Future of OpenAI The urgency to complete this transition is not just about strategic growth; it’s also tied to financial obligations. OpenAI faces a critical deadline: if the for-profit conversion isn’t successful by the end of the year, at least one major backer, SoftBank, has the option to claw back billions of dollars in pledged capital. This financial pressure adds another layer of complexity to OpenAI’s strategic planning and highlights the high stakes involved in this organizational metamorphosis. Key Challenges and Considerations: Balancing Profit and Purpose: Successfully navigating the transition to a for-profit model while maintaining a strong commitment to nonprofit goals is a delicate balancing act. Effective Philanthropy: Ensuring that the billions channeled into the nonprofit arm are used effectively to address urgent global issues requires careful planning and expert guidance. Stakeholder Alignment: Aligning the interests of various stakeholders – from investors and employees in the for-profit entity to beneficiaries of the nonprofit initiatives – is crucial for long-term success. Regulatory and Public Scrutiny: As AI becomes increasingly powerful and pervasive, OpenAI’s actions will be under intense scrutiny from regulators and the public, especially concerning ethical considerations and societal impact. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the AI and Crypto Space? For those in the cryptocurrency and AI sectors, OpenAI’s move offers several key takeaways: Increased Focus on AI Ethics and Social Impact: OpenAI’s emphasis on expert-led philanthropy signals a broader trend towards integrating ethical considerations and social impact into AI development. This is a space where blockchain and crypto technologies, with their emphasis on decentralization and transparency, can play a significant role. Opportunities for Collaboration: The formation of an expert group opens doors for collaboration between AI researchers, nonprofit organizations, and potentially, blockchain-based philanthropic platforms. Investment in AI for Good: The potential influx of billions into AI philanthropy could spur innovation in using AI to address global challenges, creating new investment and development opportunities in the ‘AI for Good’ space. Model for Tech Companies: OpenAI’s approach could serve as a model for other tech companies looking to balance commercial success with social responsibility, particularly as AI becomes more integral to society. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for OpenAI and AI Philanthropy OpenAI’s initiative to convene an expert group to advise on its nonprofit goals is a strategic and forward-thinking move. As the company embarks on a significant organizational transition, ensuring its philanthropic arm is robust and impactful is paramount. This development underscores the growing importance of aligning technological innovation with societal benefit, a principle that resonates deeply within the cryptocurrency community. The insights from this expert group will not only shape the future direction of OpenAI’s philanthropy but could also set a new benchmark for how AI companies engage with and contribute to the greater good. The future of OpenAI and AI philanthropy is poised for a revolutionary transformation, and the world will be watching closely.

Reports recently surfaced suggesting that the tech mogul was preparing to step down from his intriguing role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). But hold your horses, crypto enthusiasts! Musk himself has stepped into the digital arena to vehemently deny these claims, branding them as nothing more than ‘fake news’. Let’s dive into this unfolding story and dissect what it means for the crypto community and beyond. Elon Musk and DOGE: Unpacking the ‘Fake News’ Frenzy The initial reports, which spread like wildfire across crypto news platforms and social media, hinted at a supposed transition in leadership at D.O.G.E. Given Musk’s already packed schedule overseeing Tesla, SpaceX, and now X (formerly Twitter), the news, while surprising, wasn’t entirely out of the realm of possibility for some. However, Musk wasted no time in setting the record straight. In a characteristically concise and impactful post on X, he declared the reports as unequivocally ‘fake news’. This swift denial has sent ripples through the crypto world, leaving many to question the origin and intent behind the initial reports. Was it a misunderstanding, a deliberate attempt to stir controversy, or simply unfounded speculation? Whatever the case, Musk’s direct response underscores the power of social media in today’s fast-paced information age, particularly within the volatile and often rumor-driven crypto market. What is the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) Anyway? For those new to this narrative, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) might sound like a formal governmental body. However, it’s crucial to understand the context. D.O.G.E. is not a real government department. It’s more of a playful, albeit significant, title associated with Elon Musk’s involvement in, and perhaps influence on, certain governmental or regulatory discussions, particularly concerning technology and innovation. The acronym itself is a clear nod to Dogecoin (DOGE), the cryptocurrency that Musk has famously championed. This tongue-in-cheek naming highlights Musk’s unconventional approach and his ability to blend serious technological endeavors with internet culture and humor. It’s a strategy that resonates strongly with the crypto community, which often embraces memes and online trends. The Backstory: Musk, Trump, and D.O.G.E. – Real or Rhetorical? The narrative around Musk and D.O.G.E. gained traction following public statements from both Musk and former U.S. President Donald Trump. They jointly indicated that Musk would eventually step down from his ‘assignment’ once it was completed. This statement, while vague, fueled speculation about the nature of Musk’s role and the ‘department’ itself. Adding another layer to the story, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also posted on X, seemingly confirming Musk’s eventual departure. It was in response to Leavitt’s post that Musk directly replied, dismissing the stepping down reports as ‘fake news’. This interaction further complicates the narrative and raises questions about the intended message from the White House and the subsequent interpretation by various news outlets. Why Does This ‘Fake News’ Matter to the Crypto World? Elon Musk’s pronouncements carry significant weight in the crypto market. His tweets and statements have often triggered dramatic price movements in cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin. Therefore, any news related to Musk, especially concerning his involvement (or perceived involvement) in crypto-related initiatives or even jokingly named departments like D.O.G.E., is closely watched by investors and enthusiasts. Here’s why this ‘fake news’ incident is noteworthy for the crypto community: Market Volatility: Misinformation, especially concerning influential figures like Musk, can exacerbate the already volatile nature of the crypto market. False reports can lead to panic selling or irrational buying, causing price swings. Investor Sentiment: Musk’s endorsements and actions often shape investor sentiment towards specific cryptocurrencies. ‘Fake news’ can cloud this sentiment, making it harder for investors to make informed decisions. DOGE’s Price Action: Dogecoin, being directly referenced in the D.O.G.E. acronym, is particularly sensitive to news related to Musk and this ‘department’. Any perceived shift in Musk’s involvement could impact DOGE’s price and market dynamics. Credibility of Crypto News: Incidents like these highlight the importance of verifying crypto news sources. In a space rife with rumors and speculation, discerning credible information from ‘fake news’ is crucial. Navigating Crypto News: How to Spot Real from Fake In the fast-paced and often sensational world of crypto news, it’s vital to develop a discerning eye. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the information landscape and identify credible crypto news from ‘fake news’: Tip Description Verify the Source Check the reputation of the news outlet. Are they known for reliable reporting? Cross-reference information with multiple reputable sources. Look for Official Statements Whenever possible, seek official statements from the individuals or organizations involved. In this case, Musk’s X post is a direct official denial. Be Wary of Sensational Headlines ‘Fake news’ often uses sensational or clickbait headlines to attract attention. Be critical of overly dramatic or unbelievable claims. Check for Evidence Reliable news reports are based on evidence and factual reporting. Be skeptical of articles that lack sources or rely on anonymous claims. Community Scrutiny The crypto community is often quick to debunk ‘fake news’. Check crypto forums and social media for community discussions and fact-checking efforts. The Future of DOGE and Musk’s Crypto Influence While the immediate ‘fake news’ claims have been addressed by Musk, the broader questions about his role and influence in the crypto space remain. His continued engagement with Dogecoin, his commentary on other cryptocurrencies, and his interactions with governmental figures all contribute to his significant impact on the market. Whether D.O.G.E. remains a playful moniker or evolves into something more tangible in the realm of crypto policy or technology, one thing is clear: Elon Musk’s pronouncements will continue to be a major factor in the crypto narrative. For investors and enthusiasts, staying informed, verifying information, and understanding the nuances of Musk’s statements are crucial for navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: The Unfolding Drama of Crypto and ‘Fake News’ The saga of Elon Musk and the ‘fake news’ surrounding his supposed departure from D.O.G.E. serves as a potent reminder of the information dynamics within the crypto world. In an era where news travels at lightning speed and misinformation can spread rapidly, critical thinking and diligent verification are your best tools. As the crypto market continues to mature and attract wider attention, expect more twists, turns, and yes, even ‘fake news’. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always question the narrative. The world of crypto is anything but boring, and the Elon Musk D.O.G.E. episode is just another chapter in its fascinating, ongoing story.

The regulatory body decided to drop its appeal, marking the end of over four years of legal disputes. This decision means Ripple no longer faces SEC challenges, giving the company and its supporters a sense of relief. The appeal had been filed in January, following a series of cases where judges ruled in Ripple’s favor. Despite Former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation in January , the agency continued with the appeal, which frustrated Ripple and the broader crypto community. The SEC had claimed Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted securities violations , but the judge ruled otherwise, stating XRP is not a security. However, the entire community is now eagerly awaiting confirmation from the SEC. While the SEC has recently confirmed that it has dropped cases against Kraken and Cumberland, Ripple’s case has not yet been officially confirmed. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price To Revisit $2 Before ‘Final Blastoff’ , Why is April 3 Important?

Then, on April 9th, a US House crypto hearing is likely to help clarify regulations for digital assets. Recently, the SEC and Gemini requested a 60-day pause in their lawsuit to explore a potential resolution. The SEC had sued Gemini in January 2023, alleging that the company offered unregistered securities through its Earn product. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42833965,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145825,1743655251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Tariff Attack: Trump Accuses Korea of Trade Injustice,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-korea-tariff-attack/,"In a stunning move that has sent ripples through international trade circles, former President Donald Trump has reignited the tariff debate, this time setting his sights on South Korea. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Trump didn’t mince words, accusing Korea of imposing unfair tariffs on American goods and highlighting what he perceives as imbalanced trade practices. For those keeping a close eye on global economics and its potential spillover into the volatile cryptocurrency market, Trump’s statements are a stark reminder of how geopolitical tensions can quickly escalate and impact market sentiment. Let’s delve into the specifics of Trump’s accusations and what they could mean for global trade and beyond. Trump’s Tariff Tirade: Decoding the Accusations During his address, Trump focused heavily on the automotive industry and agricultural imports , specifically rice. He asserted that a staggering 81% of Korean cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured in Korea itself, implying a lack of reciprocity. Furthermore, he claimed that Korea effectively slaps a 50% tariff on American rice, making it incredibly difficult for U.S. farmers to compete in the Korean market. Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s key accusations: Korean Auto Imports: Trump highlighted the high percentage of Korean-made cars imported into the U.S., suggesting an imbalance in the automotive trade relationship. Rice Tariffs: He specifically called out the alleged 50% tariff on U.S. rice entering Korea, portraying it as a significant barrier to American agricultural exports. Broader Criticism: Trump broadened his critique to include Thailand, Vietnam, and India, accusing them of also maintaining high tariffs on U.S. products, signaling a wider dissatisfaction with global trade practices. To put these claims into perspective, it’s important to understand the existing trade framework between the U.S. and South Korea. The two nations have a significant Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) in place, designed to reduce tariffs and facilitate smoother trade . Trump, however, has consistently expressed skepticism about the benefits of such agreements, often advocating for what he terms ‘reciprocal tariffs ‘. What Exactly Are Tariffs and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the world of international economics, let’s quickly define tariffs . Simply put, a tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imported goods and services. Governments use tariffs for various reasons, including: Protecting Domestic Industries: By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs can make domestically produced goods more competitive, theoretically safeguarding local jobs and industries. Generating Revenue: tariffs can be a source of revenue for the government, although this is often a secondary goal compared to protectionism. Retaliation: tariffs can be used as a tool to retaliate against another country’s trade practices that are deemed unfair or harmful. This is often seen in trade disputes. National Security: In certain strategic sectors, tariffs might be imposed to reduce reliance on foreign imports for national security reasons. However, tariffs are not without their downsides. They can lead to: Increased Consumer Prices: When tariffs are imposed, the cost of imported goods often increases, which can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Reduced Consumer Choice: Higher prices on imported goods can also reduce consumer choice, as people may be less willing or able to purchase them. Retaliatory Tariffs: Imposing tariffs can provoke retaliatory tariffs from other countries, leading to trade wars where multiple countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods, harming global trade and economic growth. Supply Chain Disruptions: tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, making it more difficult and expensive for businesses to source components and materials. Korea’s Perspective and the Reality of Trade It’s crucial to consider that trade relationships are complex and multi-faceted. While Trump paints a picture of unfair tariffs imposed by Korea, the reality might be more nuanced. Korea, like any nation, has its own trade policies designed to protect its domestic industries and promote economic growth. For example, regarding automotive imports , while a significant portion of Korean cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured in Korea, many American car brands also have a strong presence in the Korean market. Furthermore, the KORUS FTA has aimed to reduce tariffs on automobiles and other goods, promoting bilateral trade . Regarding rice, agricultural tariffs are a sensitive issue globally. Many countries, including the U.S. to some extent, protect their agricultural sectors through various measures. Korea, with its emphasis on food security and a significant agricultural population, likely has its own reasons for maintaining tariffs on rice imports . The exact figure of a 50% tariff on U.S. rice, as claimed by Trump, would need further verification and contextual understanding of Korea’s agricultural trade policy. The Ripple Effect: How Trade Disputes Impact Global Markets and Crypto Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts care about trade disputes and tariffs ? The answer lies in the interconnectedness of global markets. International trade is a major driver of economic growth, and disruptions to trade flows can create economic uncertainty. This uncertainty often translates into market volatility, which can significantly impact all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s how trade tensions can affect the crypto market: Economic Uncertainty: trade disputes and the potential for trade wars create economic uncertainty. Investors tend to become risk-averse during uncertain times, which can lead to sell-offs in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Currency Fluctuations: tariffs and trade tensions can lead to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations can impact the value of cryptocurrencies, particularly when paired against fiat currencies. Inflationary Pressures: tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of imported goods. Inflation can, in turn, influence central bank policies and investor sentiment, indirectly affecting the crypto market. Safe Haven Assets: In times of economic turmoil, some investors may seek refuge in assets perceived as safe havens. While Bitcoin is sometimes touted as a digital gold or safe haven, its behavior during periods of trade -related uncertainty has been mixed. Navigating the Trade Winds: What Can We Learn? Trump’s recent remarks on tariffs serve as a potent reminder that trade policy remains a dynamic and potentially volatile area. For anyone involved in global markets, including the cryptocurrency space, staying informed about trade developments is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of trade policy news and announcements from major economies. Follow reputable news sources and economic analysis to understand the potential impact of trade disputes. Diversify Investments: Diversification is key in any investment strategy, but it’s particularly important when facing economic uncertainty. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto or traditional assets. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment and investor reactions to trade news. Market sentiment can often be a leading indicator of short-term price movements. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that trade disputes are often cyclical. While they can create short-term volatility, the global economy and trade relationships are constantly evolving. Maintain a long-term perspective when making investment decisions. Conclusion: Trade Tensions and the Ever-Evolving Global Landscape President Trump’s criticism of tariffs on U.S. goods and Korean auto imports highlights the ongoing complexities and sensitivities surrounding international trade . While the immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market may be indirect, the broader economic uncertainty generated by trade disputes can certainly influence market sentiment and investor behavior. As the global trade landscape continues to evolve, staying informed, adaptable, and maintaining a balanced perspective will be essential for navigating the choppy waters of international economics and the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

On Wednesday, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on imports from 180 nations , including higher taxes on trading partners identified as worst offenders, such as China and the European Union. Trump imposed a new 34% tariff on goods from China in addition to the existing 20% tax, bringing the total levy to 54%, the highest for any nation. Meanwhile, the latest action did not affect Canada and Mexico. Observers say the ball is now in China's court, and the nature of its retaliation could determine the market reaction. ""Everything now depends on China. If China devalues the Yuan in response to today's large, additional US tariffs, that sets off a global risk-off that hits EMs first and then - if it persists - spills back to the US. China has so far kept a very low profile. That may now end,"" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance, said on X . Early Thursday, Beijing urged the U.S. to lift tariffs while vowing retaliation immediately. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan dropped to a seven-week low of 7 RMB/USD alongside losses in the Asian equities and an impending death cross on bitcoin (BTC). Letting the yuan depreciate, which makes Chinese goods more attractive in international markets, is one way to counter Trump's tariffs. That said, it could spell trouble for carry (currency) trades and scare financial markets, as observed in 2015 and 2018. Besides, potential intervention by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to stall a rapid yuan decline can boost the dollar index, inadvertently weighing over risk assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. It's no coincidence that Asian equities traded in the red at press time, with Japan's Nikkei hitting an eight-month low. The U.S. stock futures fell over 2%, pointing to risk-off mode. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $83,300, having dropped from $88,000 to $82,500 following Trump's tariffs announcement, according to CoinDesk market data. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the cryptocurrency's spot price appears on track to cross below its 200-day SMA, confirming what is known as the ""death cross"" bearish technical pattern. Though it has a mixed record of predicting price trends, the latest cross happening against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions warrants attention – more so, as options pricing now shows bias for puts or downside protection out to the June end expiry, according to Deribit and Amberdata.",Markets|Bitcoin|Yuan|Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 04:46:44

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few low-cap DeFi tokens offering just that — real-world function, visible progress, and an entry point that suggests strong upside potential in 2025. At $0.025, MUTM stands out not because of hype — but because of what’s happening under the hood. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently deep into its presale phase, and interest has been building fast. Over $6 million has already been raised, and the project now boasts a base of more than 7,700 early holders. That’s not just momentum — it’s a sign of growing trust in the long-term direction of the platform. What makes this especially noteworthy is the quality of the participants. Many of those getting in early are experienced crypto investors — people who’ve previously backed large-scale projects like Solana and Cardano during their early stages. The fact that they’re now looking to Mutuum shows that it’s more than just another speculative token. It’s being recognized for its long-term potential and structural design. Mutuum Finance is not a meme or hype-driven project. It’s being built as a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing crypto assets, with systems that allow both passive earning and flexible borrowing. Users who supply assets to the protocol receive tokenized representations of their deposits, known as mtTokens. These aren’t just placeholders — they accumulate value over time as interest builds, making them ideal for those looking to put their crypto to work instead of letting it sit idle. Borrowers, on the other hand, can unlock liquidity by providing more collateral than they borrow — a common structure that protects the system while giving users fast access to capital without having to sell their holdings. What truly sets Mutuum apart is how utility and ecosystem health are baked into the protocol’s model. The platform is integrating a buy-and-distribute mechanism that takes a portion of revenue generated by protocol activity and uses it to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. Those tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, ensuring that users who contribute to the protocol are rewarded directly and consistently. This approach encourages long-term participation while aligning incentives with platform growth. It’s not just a reward system — it’s a cycle that supports the token’s value as adoption increases. Another reason investors are moving quickly: this isn’t a “build later” kind of project. The team behind Mutuum is planning to launch a beta version of the platform around the token’s public release. That means early holders will be stepping into a live product environment — not waiting months or years for development to catch up. This kind of early access to functionality gives the token real purpose from day one and positions it to start capturing value right out of the gate. Mutuum Finance is currently priced at $0.025, but everything about its structure, steady progress, and expanding community signals that this entry point may not last much longer. With key features set to roll out soon, strong momentum in the presale, and growing interest from seasoned investors, MUTM is positioning itself as more than just another DeFi token — it’s shaping up to be one of the most strategic opportunities in the market right now.

While emphasizing that current market sentiment remains in what he calls a “boredom phase,” Egrag’s technical breakdown highlights several critical levels that may define the token’s trajectory this month. XRP Price Prediction For April Egrag’s chart, constructed on a monthly time frame (XRP/USDT), underscores an anticipated April candle that could see a substantial price swing. The visual forecast places XRP in a position where both upper and lower bounds may be “wick-tested” before the month concludes. According to the analyst, a potential downside wick may pull the price back into the $1.90–$1.79 region. Egrag describes this process as a short-lived “wick,” indicating that if XRP tests these lows, it may not spend significant time there. Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst On the other end of the spectrum, the chart suggests that a spike toward $2.80–$3.00 is also possible during April. Similar to the low-range testing, any move within this zone would likely form a wick, marking a brief probe of higher price territory. “We will also test the upper range at $2.80-$3.00, which will also be a wicking process,” the analyst states. One of the most striking points on the chart is a potential 62–70% rally measured from the lowest point of the downside wick (around the $1.79–$1.90 area). The analyst highlights that this upside, if materialized, could be swift once certain technical thresholds are broken. “We could see an upside of 62-70% from the lowest point of the downside wick,” Egrag writes. Several price notations on the chart (such as $2.00, $2.05, $2.17, and $2.44) hint that XRP may oscillate around the $2 handle. Egrag’s mentions the possibility of a final stop near $2 before a more explosive move: “After revisiting the $2 region one last time, we could see a significant blastoff in this cycle!” Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Dips Below The 200-Day MA – Trend Shift Underway? Egrag also reiterates a theme he has mentioned in previous analyses: many market participants grew frustrated after the post-SEC-case price action failed to meet their expectations of an instant surge. The analyst attributes the current range-bound conditions to a “boredom phase” driven by waning interest and mental fatigue among traders. He warns that only “the mentally strong” will endure this period of minimal excitement and sideways trading. For those who remain confident in the broader utility of XRP, Egrag suggests that accumulating during these doldrums might be more beneficial than attempting to time every short-term fluctuation. “Do nothing except buy if you can, and sit on your ass. Do you really think XRP will change the world and they will give it to you on a golden plate? We are now in a phase where only the mentally strong will survive,” the analyst concludes. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1465.

After the announcement, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana dropped by 4%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, pushing the total crypto market capitalization down by nearly 5%. The coins have seen some recovery after hitting these lows. However, one project continued to show resilience. Bitcoin Pepe ‘s presale has seen continued momentum over the past weeks. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs President Donald Trump confirmed sweeping reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners, marking a major escalation in his trade policy. The new levies aim to match the trade barriers faced by American exporters, with tariffs reaching as high as 54% on Chinese imports, 20% on the European Union, 26% on India, and 24% on Japan. Markets reacted sharply, with US stocks reversing earlier gains. Dow futures plunged 1,007 points, or 2.3%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 3.4% and 4.2%, respectively, reflecting investor concerns over economic fallout and potential retaliation from affected nations. Multinational stocks tumbled after hours, with Nike and Apple each down 7%. Retailers reliant on imports were hit hardest—Five Below fell 15%, Dollar Tree lost 11%, and Gap slid 8.5%. Tech stocks also saw sharp declines, with Nvidia dropping 4.5% and Tesla down 6%. Bitcoin Pepe’s sustained momentum Bitcoin Pepe has defied the downturn in the broader crypto market, maintaining strong momentum since its presale launch in mid-February. Bitcoin Pepe is drawing attention with an explosive presale, raising over $5.9 million in just weeks. Early investors have seen steady gains, with projections suggesting cumulative returns could surpass 300% by the end of its 30-stage presale. The Bitcoin Pepe presale has rapidly gained traction, progressing through its first seven stages with strong investor interest. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe blends Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability. An anticipated exchange listing in the second quarter of 2025 could further drive its price, reinforcing its position as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale details Bitcoin Pepe is bringing the viral meme culture to the most trusted crypto platform. It is introducing the PEP-20 token standard, allowing investors to launch meme coins directly on the Bitcoin network. This unique infrastructure has attracted strong interest from investors looking to accumulate BPEP tokens ahead of its public debut. Bitcoin Pepe follows a 30-stage presale model, with prices rising approximately 5% at each phase. Launched at $0.021, it has climbed to $0.0295 in stage 8, set to increase to $0.031 in the next phase. By the presale’s conclusion, BPEP could reach $0.0864, offering early investors potential gains exceeding 300%. With strong fundamentals, increasing traction, and favourable market conditions, Bitcoin Pepe is well-positioned to benefit from the next crypto rally.

This marks the second time the world’s largest exchange has ignored Pi, shutting down hopes of an imminent listing. Meanwhile, Pi Network’s price is taking a beating, dropping to its lowest level in over a month. Pi Network Price Crashes Hard With Binance leaving Pi out of its listing program, the token has tumbled to $0.7012, marking a fresh low since February 25. Pi Network is now down a staggering 76% from its all-time high, wiping out around $14 billion in market value. Once valued at nearly $20 billion, Pi’s market cap has now shrunk to just $4.76 billion, raising concerns among investors. Why Binance Keeps Saying No to Pi Binance recently launched the second phase of its Vote to List initiative, where users vote for which tokens they want listed on the exchange. This time around, 12 tokens made the cut, including VIRTUAL, BIGTIME, ONDO, and UXLINK, with Binance set to pick winners based on vote count, trading demand, risk assessment, and compliance checks. But the Pi Network is nowhere in sight, and there’s a big reason behind it. Binance has made it clear that only BNB-based projects qualify for this program, automatically disqualifying Pi. Moreover, the PiCoreTeam (PCT) has been criticized for lacking transparency, especially regarding how Pi tokens are locked and burned. Binance wants clear disclosures before listing Pi, but so far, the PCT has not provided enough details. Is There Still Hope for a Binance Listing? Despite missing out on Binance’s Vote to List, Pi Network still has a chance to land on the exchange through a direct listing in the future. However, Binance has given no timeline , leaving Pi enthusiasts guessing. In the meantime, Pi Network did secure a listing on BTCC Exchange , bringing it a step closer to wider adoption. Additionally, Pi’s domain auction is seeing a lot of action, with over 200,000 bids, proving that the community is still engaged. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: 125K Sellers at PiFest, Yet Pi Coin Nears All-Time Lows After 60% Drop , Community Questions Binance’s Priorities Selçuk TOPAL, Ph.D., criticized Binance for ignoring Pi Network while supporting meme coins with liquidity incentives. He argued that if Binance valued real innovation, it would back research-driven projects instead of hype-based tokens. He also questioned why Binance’s investor protection fund (SAFU) isn’t consistently applied. Further, he raised concerns about Binance’s leadership, suggesting its vision might be more about PR than real progress. What’s Next for Pi Network? Pi’s price has dropped 5% in the past 24 hours, now struggling to stay above $0.6646. With Binance still hesitant and Pi’s value slipping, all eyes are on the PiCoreTeam to improve transparency and push for mainstream exchange listings. Until then, Pi holders will have to wait and see if Binance finally gives the green light. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ADA is consolidating near $0.650 and remains at risk of more losses. ADA price failed to recover above the $0.70 resistance zone. The price is trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.6720 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.70 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Again In the past few days, Cardano saw a recovery wave from the $0.6350 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to climb above the $0.680 and $0.6880 resistance levels. However, the bears were active above the $0.70 zone. A high was formed at $0.7090 and the price corrected most gains. There was a move below the $0.650 level. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.6720 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. A low was formed at $0.6356 and the price is now consolidating losses near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7090 swing high to the $0.6356 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.6720 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7090 swing high to the $0.6356 low. The first resistance is near $0.6950. The next key resistance might be $0.700. If there is a close above the $0.70 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.7420 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.7650 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6720 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.6420 level. The next major support is near the $0.6350 level. A downside break below the $0.6350 level could open the doors for a test of $0.620.

As ADA struggles to maintain momentum, a new contender is rising fast: Remittix (RTX) . This practical crypto-to-fiat payment solution has already raised over $14.3 million in presale and is gaining strong investor backing. With exchange listings expected soon, experts believe Remittix could surge 50x by July, making it a compelling alternative for ADA holders. Cardano faces heavy pressure as analysts predict drop below $0.30 Cardano news today shows that ADA has slipped by 12% over the past week, retreating from $0.7707 to $0.6768 , and the pressure isn’t easing. Despite moments of optimism, some analysts are now forecasting a deeper correction ahead. One leading expert has issued a stark warning that ADA could plunge below $0.30 by June if market conditions continue to deteriorate. While bullish sentiment once hinged on Cardano’s potential partnerships and ecosystem growth, short-term reality paints a different picture. Even news of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, exploring a partnership with Ripple to onboard the $RLUSD stablecoin hasn’t reversed the declining trend. Although the collaboration could eventually inject liquidity into the ecosystem, it may come too late to stop ADA’s near-term slide. Resistance at $0.72 remains firm and without significant volume or broader market strength; ADA could face a steep drop. With uncertainty looming over ADA’s next move, many early Cardano investors are reallocating funds toward more promising plays like Remittix (RTX). The up-and-coming PayFi project is gaining traction for its real-world utility, and Cardano news today suggests Remittix could 50x by July, making it a compelling hedge for those bracing for continued downside in ADA. As Cardano teeters near crucial support levels, eyes are shifting toward newer, utility-focused tokens with explosive growth potential. Experts predict Remittix could 50x by July with listings ahead While Cardano battles bearish momentum and experts warn of a potential slide below $0.30 by June, a growing number of crypto investors are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) , a project showing none of ADA’s current weakness. Remittix isn’t built on speculation or hype; it’s gaining traction because it solves an actual global problem. With international money transfers still plagued by high fees, slow processing, and outdated infrastructure, Remittix offers a modern fix. It allows users to convert crypto into fiat and send it directly to bank accounts in over 30 currencies without relying on legacy systems like SWIFT or Western Union. What makes Remittix especially appealing right now is its timing. The token remains in presale at $0.0734, but it has already attracted over $14.3 million in investment and distributed 525 million tokens to early adopters. Unlike many flashy coins that disappear as quickly as they rise, Remittix was built with long-term impact in mind. It integrates fiat on-ramps and KYC compliance from day one, aligning itself with global financial regulations and preparing for large-scale partnerships in traditional finance. Analysts believe this strong foundation is exactly why Remittix could surge 50x by July, particularly as Q2 exchange listings draw closer. With tokenomics designed to reward early holders and a product tailored for real-world utility, RTX continues to separate itself from the flood of gimmick-driven altcoins that fade in bear cycles. Cardano declines as Remittix emerges as a practical market leader While ADA’s short-term outlook grows shakier facing technical resistance and macroeconomic pressure, Remittix is showing the qualities that veteran investors seek: momentum, practicality, and scalability. Institutional interest has already begun to flow in, with fintech veterans and crypto insiders quietly backing the project during its early funding rounds. Their confidence points to one thing: Remittix isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a payment solution designed to work now and thrive later. As ADA holders contemplate their next move, Remittix is shaping up to be the better bet for 2025 and beyond.

While Stellar and Hedera once dominated the headlines, a plethora of investors are now rushing to Remittix’s innovative solution to cross-border payments. The new thinking signals a shift in dynamic in an industry that tends to prefer established names. Here, we explain why Remittix could surpass legacy networks in utility, growth potential and risk-adjusted returns and what this means for Stellar and Hedera going forward. Remittix’s Edge Over Stellar Remittix is special in the sense that it focuses on real-world tangible solutions. While Stellar , trading at $0.2677 (down 1.76%) with a market cap of $8.24 billion, once enabled instant transfers but may no longer be as promising, Remittix addresses a $190 trillion remittance market by making speed and low cost its number one priority, logging each transfer on a public ledger for greater transparency far beyond what traditional wire services provide. Source: Tradingview Local banking rails shorten multi-day wait times to hours, outdoing what Stellar is capable of with risky corporate partnerships or layer-2 scaling. Remittix’s auditing, liquidity locks and renounced contract also enhance security, reassuring investors who prefer less complicated, consumer-focused tech. Remittix’s Advantage Over Hedera Likewise, Hedera is around $0.1671 (0.76% lower) with a market capitalization of $7.05 billion and based on hype about the past but unable to retain a strong grasp. Remittix, though, addresses cross-border payments head-on in a way that satisfies merchants, freelancers and families sending funds abroad. Source: Tradingview Removing typical multi-day wires, Remittix turns transactions into as fast as near-instant exchanges. Its public ledger also promotes transparency, trumping private transactions or business pilots traditionally linked with Hedera. Security remains paramount: auditing, liquidity locks and renounced contracts minimize the potential for fraud. For most, Remittix’s consumer model trump’s Hedera’s more gradual path to adoption. Why Investors Skeptical of Stellar and Hedera’s Future While both Hedera and Stellar have solid consensus mechanisms, recent statistics present mixed trends. Stellar’s 15.74% increase in daily volume to $174.58 million may reflect renewed interest or temporary speculation. Hedera’s 9.67% volume increase to $204.28 million likewise indicates some action but not necessarily long-term trend upward. Critics point to limited user-facing dApps on such chains, questioning their potential for exponential adoption. For Stellar, the challenge is one of differentiating from newer competitors. Hedera, with its award-winning hashgraph architecture, has yet to take advantage of enterprise partnerships with tangible market surges. Enthusiastic holders remain, but market appetite for rapid returns has overshadowed steady, incremental growth. While neither platform appears to be a goner, the genesis of altcoins with fresher tales or more contemporary solutions is hogging the spotlight. The majority of those who once championed older blockchains are having second thoughts, in light of the evolving nature of crypto tech. If Remittix can keep breaking barriers, Stellar and Hedera might have a more difficult climb to remain in contention. Remittix: A $14.3m+ Presale with Real Possibilities Firing up the hype, Remittix brought in more than $14.3 million in presale, selling more than 525 million tokens for $0.0734. Compared to hype-only tokens, it satisfies a gargantuan cross-border market plagued by days-long wires and hidden fees. Through its connection of crypto and fiat rails, Remittix decreases settlement time to hours from days, which is why it is attractive to freelancers, migrant workers, and e-commerce operators, among others. Picture a Mexican freelance graphic designer billing a client in Singapore. Instead of struggling with exchange rates and days-long delays, they receive payment in stablecoins that are swapped into pesos almost in real-time by Remittix’s system. That seamless experience trumps old wire paths, bringing the project an extra measure of credibility beyond marketing hyperbole. It’s a theme that sounds good to fidgety individuals eager for real crypto utility. Small business adoption adds another layer. Remittix’s pay API offers merchants the option of accepting cryptocurrencies while paying out in fiat. This solution circumvents volatility problems, a barrier that previously dissuaded mainstream businesses from getting their hands on crypto. Most see Remittix as bridging the gap between everyday commerce and blockchain speed, thereby sidestepping the more theoretical tales of older chains like Stellar and Hedera. Balancing Legacy vs. Innovation The contrast with behemoths like Stellar or Hedera points to a broader shift in crypto. While previous networks set the groundwork for fast transfers and business partnerships, they haven’t always sealed the deal in mass user adoption. Remittix has an easy, consumer-friendly mission that resonates immediately particularly in a world that’s hungry for streamlined payments. Stellar, which was once celebrated for connecting bankless communities to digital finance, now finds itself competing with a wave of solutions that improve or outdo its model. Hedera, with corporate sponsorship, is questioned as to whether token value can be driven by large-scale institutional transactions alone. Wish to become a part of Remittix’s presale wave?

For several hours across April 2 and 3, Bitcoin core developers and researchers were unable to interact on Google Groups after Google banned the group for spam. “Bitcoin Development Mailing List has been identified as containing spam, malware, or other malicious content,” Google’s warning stated at the time. The Bitcoin Development Mailing List’s warning before the ban was lifted. Source: Google Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop told Cointelegraph that the ban may have been triggered by individuals or bots mass-reporting the Bitcoin mailing list from multiple accounts. It’s a common tactic by attackers looking to ban or censor a community, Bishop said, noting that similar incidents occur on YouTube, X and TikTok fairly often. “So it’s possible that this whole thing might have been triggered through something like that. It might have just been someone clicking those links on a massive scale to report it.” Google Workspace Support’s X account confirmed that the issue had been resolved on April 3 at 2:23 am UTC in response to one of the Bitcoin mailing list’s other moderators, Ruben Somsen. Bitcoin advocate and head of Block Inc, Jack Dorsey, also called attention to the ban, urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to investigate the issue. Related: Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto may be wealthier than Bill Gates Mailing lists typically involve one moderator email sending information to subscribers in a group to discuss and collaborate on a topic or shared interest. The Bitcoin mailing list is used by Bitcoin core developers and researchers to discuss potential protocol changes to Bitcoin, which secures more than $1.6 trillion worth of value for network users around the world. It has become one of the main Bitcoin mailing lists since the network’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, shared Bitcoin’s white paper on the Cryptography Mailing List on Oct. 31, 2008. Bitcoin mailing list moderators plan to stay on Google Groups Despite the incident, Bishop said the Bitcoin mailing list moderators have no intention of moving away from communicating via email: “The reality of the situation is that this particular mailing list has always been email, and so the contributors that discuss Bitcoin protocol development through email, in order to provide continuity of service, you have to replace it with email.” The Bitcoin mailing list officially migrated to Google Groups in February 2024. Source: Bryan Bishop Before that, the mailing list was hosted on the Linux Foundation, Oregon State University Open Source Lab’s infrastructure and SourceForge.net.

However, Bitcoin price managed to hold $82K despite the US event-driven sell-off. With this strength from BTC, here are two macroeconomic events to watch out for this week that could further impact BTC price. Trump’s Liberation Day and Reciprocal Tariffs End, Bitcoin Price Holds $82K On April 2, President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on more than 100 trading partners like China, India, European Union and so on. This move has rattled the US & Crypto markets alike. While the US stock market saw $1.3 trillion in liquidations, cryptocurrencies saw more than $500 million in liquidations with Bitcoin price crashing 7.21% from $88.5K to $82.1. Trump Reciprocal Tariffs Despite this news-based sell-off, BTC’s value holding above $82K, which signals strength. However, this could come undone as two key macroeconomic events are yet to unfold this week that could rock Bitcoin and broader crypto markets. Key Macroeconomic Events To Watch This Week Although Trump’s Liberation Day and sweeping tariffs are behind us, investors must be cautious due to the upcoming macroeconomic events. Two key events that could influence Bitcoin price and crypto market moves include – Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) and Fed Chair Powell’s Speech on April 4. Although the ADP jobs data came in higher than expected, the forecast for March NFP data is 80K, much lower than the previous data of 151K. This would put further pressure on the Fed, which could perhaps be addressed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on April 4. The CME Fed Watch Tool shows a 78.5% probability that the target interest rate will remain the same at 4.25% to 4.50%. However, the probability table shows a 61.3% chance that the Fed could cut rates by 25 basis points in June 2025. What’s Next for Bitcoin (BTC)? BitMEX founder and recently pardoned by Trump, Arthur Hayes, added that, “if BTC can hold $76.5k now and on US tax day April 15, we’re out of danger.” RektProof, a popular crypto trader, shared his thoughts . Based on his Bitcoin price forecast , there could be a deviation in BTC price either below $81K up to $76K, which will be a great buying opportunity. BTC/USDT 12-hour chart On the contrary, if Bitcoin does not sweep lower, says RektProof, BTC could climb higher and sweep the $82K to $91K, which would also provide an opportunity to short the markets. Either way, the outlook from RektProof remains uncertain with and short-sighted due to the current market conditions and upcoming events that could easily influence moves.

Expert Insights on Market Volatility appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market experienced heightened volatility in the past 24 hours, triggering significant liquidations. The total crypto market cap slipped 2% to hover about $2.68 trillion on Thursday, April 3, during the mid-Eastern financial market trading session. As a result, more than $490 million was rekt in the past 24 hours from over 160k traders, mostly involving long traders. The largest liquidation order in the past 24 hours happened on the Binance exchange involving ETH/USDT valued at around $12 million. Major Forces Behind Today’s Crypto Market Drop Trade Tensions from U.S. Tariffs and Inflation Fears On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump concluded the Make America Wealthy Again event with an average 10 percent increase in reciprocal tariffs . Among the most hit by the new reciprocal tariffs are European countries and nations associated with the BRICS movement, led by China, and South Africa. As the ""Make America Wealthy Again Event"" concluded, markets held losses. Then, the White House posted a full list of tariffs on X, as shown below. This sent futures to a new low with the S&P 500 now indicated to open in correction territory. So, what does this all mean? pic.twitter.com/xnmsprXsxI — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 2, 2025 Although the Trump administration will side at least $600 billion per year from the new tariffs, experts project an increase in inflation to around 5 percent. Heavy Selloff in the Stock Market The mainstream adoption of crypto assets by institutional investors and retail traders has significantly increased the correlation of digital assets with the stock market. In the past 24 hours, following the announcement of the reciprocal tariffs by the United States, the S&P 500 futures erased around $2 trillion of market cap in 15 minutes. As a result, the crypto market was prone to taking a bearish hit amid heightened levels of further selloff. Technical Fears In the past few days, Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market in forming a rising wedge pattern, in the four-hour time frame. With Bitcoin price having been rejected above $87k in the past few days, a crypto correction was imminent, led by Ethereum (ETH). .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In West Virginia, lawmakers are advancing a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill aimed at increasing financial sovereignty and hedging against the potential rollout of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms has secured a $300 million loan from Macquarie Group to finance the development of its high-performance computing (HPC) data centers, signaling a broader industry shift toward AI infrastructure and diversified revenue streams amid post-halving pressures. West Virginia’s Bold Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill Aims to Secure Financial Sovereignty and Hedge Against CBDC Future West Virginia is positioning itself at the forefront of a growing movement in the United States to bring Bitcoin into the financial arsenal of state governments. In a recent interview, State Senator Chris Rose emphasized that the state’s newly proposed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill is not merely an investment strategy but a proactive step toward financial sovereignty and resistance to what he calls a creeping centralization of money in the form of a potential US central bank digital currency (CBDC). Excerpt of West Virginia Bitcoin reserve bill (Source: West Virginia Legislature ) Senator Rose, a Republican representing West Virginia’s 13th District, explained that the bill was crafted with the explicit intent of protecting the financial autonomy of the state and its citizens. “You hear these rumors that there are people at the federal government that will want to have a central bank digital currency,” Rose said. “And people don’t want that. People want decentralized currency. They want freedom.” The proposed legislation, introduced earlier this year in February, would allow the West Virginia state treasury to allocate up to 10% of its long-term public funds into a combination of precious metals like gold and silver, stablecoins, and digital assets. However, there’s a significant qualifier: any digital asset selected must have maintained a market capitalization of at least $750 million over the preceding 12 months. By these metrics, the only digital asset currently eligible is Bitcoin (BTC). The market capitalization filter is an intentional move by Senator Rose to avoid exposing state funds to riskier crypto assets or “meme coins,” which are infamous for their speculative price swings and lack of underlying utility. Rose added that Bitcoin adoption at the state level would grant West Virginia greater financial independence and “a little more state sovereignty.” Risk and Reward: Balancing Public Funds Exposure The bill proposes that the 10% allocation would be drawn from two key financial pillars of the state: The pensions fund The severance tax fund These funds are responsible for long-term financial commitments, making them more suitable for holding non-liquid, potentially volatile assets like Bitcoin. The bill deliberately excludes West Virginia’s petty cash fund, which manages daily operational expenses. Rose further explained that the 10% cap was selected to introduce Bitcoin to the state’s balance sheet without triggering fear among those unfamiliar with digital assets. “It’s a good way to cap that where they feel comfortable, but also give us at least a decent exposure as well,” he added. According to Rose, the bill has garnered positive feedback from key figures within the state government, including Governor Patrick Morrisey. The Governor, known for his pro-technology and crypto-forward policies, has envisioned a future economy in West Virginia powered in part by blockchain innovations. Rose also confirmed he consulted the state treasurer prior to introducing the bill to ensure institutional alignment. However, not everyone is convinced. Some lawmakers and financial experts, including those cited by WVNews , have raised concerns over Bitcoin’s high volatility and historical price swings. Critics argue that while Bitcoin may serve as a long-term hedge against inflation and centralized financial control, its unpredictable short-term movements could put public funds at risk. West Virginia is not alone in this legislative experiment. According to Bitcoin Laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 US states. However, the majority have either stalled in committees or had key provisions stripped. Only three states—Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas—have seen meaningful progress in moving these bills forward. Bitcoin: An Investment and a Political Statement For Senator Rose and his supporters, however, the bill is about more than just a portfolio diversification strategy—it’s a political message against federal overreach and centralized control. The bill’s progress could serve as a bellwether for how far US states are willing to go to integrate decentralized digital assets into public finance systems and challenge the increasing conversation surrounding a potential Federal Reserve-backed CBDC. As debate continues within the legislature, the outcome of West Virginia’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill could set an important precedent—not just for crypto adoption, but for the balance of financial power between state and federal governments in the digital age. Bitfarms Secures $300 Million Loan from Macquarie to Develop High-Performance Computing Data Centers In other news, leading Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms has secured a significant financial lifeline as it continues its strategic pivot toward high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. On April 2, Bitfarms announced it has entered into a $300 million loan agreement with global financial services giant Macquarie Group, a move designed to fund the development of its ambitious Panther Creek HPC data center project in Pennsylvania. The deal sheds light on the shifting dynamics of the Bitcoin mining industry as major players like Bitfarms look to diversify revenue streams amid the rapidly changing crypto market landscape and the exponential demand for AI computing capacity. Under the agreement, Macquarie’s private debt facility will provide an initial $50 million in funding to jumpstart the Panther Creek project. The remaining $250 million will be released in stages as Bitfarms hits predetermined development milestones at the site. According to Bitfarms’ announcement, the Panther Creek facility will ultimately boast nearly 500 megawatts of capacity, powered by a diversified energy mix. The company believes the project will attract a wave of interest from HPC tenants, including AI firms and cloud computing clients, once construction is fully underway. Bitfarms’ expansion into the HPC and AI sectors is part of a broader trend within the Bitcoin mining industry, as companies grapple with tighter profit margins in the wake of the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event. The reduction in Bitcoin block rewards has forced miners to search for alternative, more stable revenue streams. The surge in AI-driven data processing needs has presented a unique opportunity. GPU infrastructure originally intended for crypto mining is now being retooled for AI and HPC workloads, which offer significantly higher profit margins. According to Hive Digital executives, AI applications can generate upwards of $2.00 per hour per machine, compared to a mere $0.12 per hour from traditional Bitcoin mining. While the Panther Creek project offers long-term upside, Bitfarms acknowledged in its latest quarterly report that it faces regulatory hurdles in expanding its energy infrastructure. The company noted that the timeline to receive the necessary approvals could range anywhere from 12 to 36 months, potentially delaying full operational capacity. To address short-term capacity concerns, Bitfarms is banking on its recent $125 million acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, which is expected to significantly bolster its operational power base while Panther Creek remains under development. Additionally, the company has recently sold its Paraguay site to Hive Digital for $85 million, signaling a broader strategic shift to consolidate operations in the United States and Canada while refocusing on HPC and AI opportunities. HODLing Bitcoin as a Hedge Despite its diversification strategy, Bitfarms remains firmly committed to Bitcoin as a long-term investment. The company reported mining 654 BTC in Q4 2024 at an average all-in cash cost of $60,800 per Bitcoin. Rather than liquidating its entire output, Bitfarms has opted to hold a significant portion of its mined Bitcoin , a practice known as HODLing within the crypto community. Currently, Bitfarms holds 1,152 BTC, making it one of the top 25 publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies in the world. Other major miners have adopted similar strategies. Hive Digital has increased its Bitcoin holdings to 2,620 BTC, while MARA Holdings has amassed an industry-leading 46,374 BTC and announced plans for a $2 billion stock offering to further expand its Bitcoin reserves. Bitfarms is not alone in its move toward HPC and AI. Industry peers such as Core Scientific, Hut8, Hive Digital, and Bit Digital have all begun to pivot portions of their operations away from pure Bitcoin mining toward AI-focused services. Hive Digital, for example, has reallocated part of its fleet of Nvidia GPUs—originally purchased for crypto mining—toward running AI applications and data-intensive workloads. The shift is widely seen as a defensive play in the face of shrinking Bitcoin mining rewards, increased energy costs, and growing regulatory scrutiny across global markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-03 05:30:00

Market expert Ali Martinez revealed that a roughly 250% rally for the dog-themed meme coin to the $0.5 level looms. However, this bull run is possible given that the meme token holds above key support at $0.16. DOGE price exchanged hands at $0.1662 as of press time, igniting optimism over a rally ahead. Dogecoin Price Eyes Over 250% Gains; Top Analyst Highlights Conditions Ali Martinez on April 3 revealed that the $0.16 price level presents itself as a ‘make-or-break’ point for Dogecoin price via a post on X . According to him, if the price holds this level, a potential rally to $0.57 awaits, which is up nearly 256% from the current level. However, failing to hold this level could result in a drop to $0.06, per the analyst. As a result, the key support level remains much-eyed by market watchers as the meme coin currently trades near it. Source: Ali Charts, X As mentioned above, the price is trading at $0.1662 with an intraday loss of over 3%. It bottomed and peaked at $0.1624 and $0.1787 over the past day, preventing losing support of $0.16. In an upshot, market watchers eye the token optimistically, expecting a sustained movement and thereby, a rally. What Are The Next Resistance Levels For Dogecoin Price? In another X post shared previously, the same analyst highlighted vital resistance levels for the dog-themed meme coin . Notably, the price faces two key resistance barriers at $0.18 and $0.21. Source: Ali Charts, X A sustained breakthrough above these resistance levels paves the way for a +250% bull run for DOGE price. In the wake of these price dynamics, crypto traders and investors are now glued to the meme coin’s price chart and await a trajectory shift. Derivatives Data Sparks Speculations However, Coinglass data has sparked contrary investor speculations by showcasing a decline in futures OI. DOGE futures OI was down over 3% to $1.56 billion today. This stat underscored slightly reduced investor interest in the meme token despite bullish predictions. Besides, the derivatives volume witnessed a 40% jump to $5.24 billion, adding a layer of intrigue to the market sentiment. Crypto market traders and investors expect short-term volatility amid the dynamic market stats, whilst long-term prospects remain bullish. Also, a Dogecoin price prediction by CoinGape revealed that the technical chart on the weekly time frame showcases a bullish engulfing pattern.

Only a short period after Trump announced the tariffs at the White House Rose Garden on April 2, some X users claim they were able to duplicate the same tariff plan with a rudimentary prompt using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “I was able to duplicate it in ChatGPT,” NFT collector DCinvestor told his 260,000 followers on X following the Donald Trump announcement of reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries on April 2. “It also told me that this idea hadn’t been formalized anywhere before, and that it was something it came up with,” he added, referring to the chatbot’s ability to calculate the tariff rates. “FFS. Trump admin is using ChatGPT to determine trade policy,” he added. Of course, the similarities between the artificial intelligence-generated tariff plan and Trump’s plan could also be simply coincidental. DCInvestor’s observation came in response to crypto trader Jordan Fish, also known as Cobie, who also asked ChatGPT using the prompt: “What would be an easy way to calculate the tariffs that should be imposed on other countries so that the US is on even playing fields when it comes to trade deficit. Set a minimum of 10%.” ChatGPT response to question on tariff calculations. Source: Cobie Journal of Public Economics editor Wojtek Kopczuk also experimented with ChatGPT , which generated the same results. “I think they asked ChatGPT to calculate the tariffs from other countries, which is why the tariffs make absolutely no fucking sense,” he said . Author Krishnan Rohit postulated on X that this “might be the first large-scale application of AI technology to geopolitics.” ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok all give the same answer to the question on how to impose tariffs easily, he observed. Trump's reciprocal tariffs lead to crypto dip Founder and CEO of supply chain logistics platform Flexport, Ryan Petersen, said his firm had reverse-engineered the formula the Trump administration used to generate the reciprocal tariffs. “It’s quite simple, they took the trade deficit the US has with each country and divided it by our imports from that country,” An editor at The Yale Review, James Surowiecki, said something similar, “they just took our [US] trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us.” Related: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which come into effect on April 5, have hit all countries with a 10% levy, with some nations facing even larger rates, such as China with a 34% tariff, Japan with 24%, and the European Union with 20%. Crypto markets reacted particularly badly, plunging 5% after the announcement as Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by $5,500 to $82,277 before recovering marginally, according to CoinGecko.

On Wednesday, 16:00 UTC, the exchange began trading the stablecoin and allowed its users to interact with it. So far, the stablecoin has already processed over $10 billion in cumulative trading volume, indicating massive momentum for the token. Kraken lists RLUSD, joining Archax, Bitso and Bitstamp In its press release, Kraken stated, “We’re thrilled to announce that RLUSD is now available for trading on Kraken!” and even detailed the asset. The exchange mentioned that the stablecoin is fully backed by a reserve of cash and cash equivalents, redeemable 1:1 for USD. It even added that the token is suitable for financial operations such as payments, global settlements, on/off ramping, and trading collateral. Kraken users can now deposit Ripple USD by heading to the funding tab on their account, selecting RLUSD, and using one of the supported networks. However, users cannot access RLUSD through their mobile Kraken application as yet. Moreover, the instant Buy feature is still unavailable for RLUSD holders until all liquidity requirements are met. But now that Kraken is on board, it adds to the token’s availability on Archax, B2C2, Bitso, Bitstamp, Bullish, Coinmena, Flowdesk, Independent Reserve, JST Digital, Keyrock, LMAX Digital, Mercado Bitcoin, Moonpay, Revolut, Uphold, and Zero Hash. Ripple adds RLUSD to its cross-border payments platform, Ripple Payments In addition to the Kraken token listing, Ripple has included its RLUSD in its enterprise-grade cross-border payments platform, Ripple Payments. Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of stablecoins at Ripple and CEO of Standard Custody & Trust Co., commented on the move, stating that RLUSD is now integrated into Ripple Payments, which offers near-global coverage through over 90 payout markets. It provides instant connections to banks, financial institutions, payment service providers, and exchanges, as well as many other entities around the world. As a result, it delivers enterprise utility right out of the box. In its press release, the company also claimed that the integration would allow for fast, low-cost, and scalable cross-border payments. So far, only a select number of users, including BKK Forex and iSend, are using the token for cross-border payments. However, Ripple plans to add more enterprise customers in the long run, especially since the token is better suited for institutional flows. A while back, Ripple also collaborated with Chainlink to add RLUSD data feeds to make the token more accessible to retail customers. Meanwhile, the stablecoin‘s market cap has surged to almost $250 million, reaching the $ 200 million mark just three months after its launch. Also, its monthly transfer volume grew from $466 million to over more than $720 million last month, a 55% increase. The token has also crossed the $10 billion trading volume mark, with most analysts crediting its listings on global exchanges and increased adoption among financial institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as the primary growth catalysts.

Trump Tariffs Rattle Markets The market slump follows US President Donald Trump’s April 2 confirmation of trade tariffs that will impact many countries across the globe. Trump announced tariffs on 185 countries at once in one of the largest tariff impositions in US history. As a result, S&P 500 futures erased around $2 trillion in market cap in under 15 minutes, reported the Kobeissi Letter. Economists described Trump’s new reciprocal tariff plan as a “tsunami” that will “slam into the global economy and have repercussions that are hard to quantify.” “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession,” said Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings. Trump has hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5, with some countries facing even higher rates, including China, which faces a 34% tariff, Vietnam 46%, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. Describing the announcement as “Liberation Day,” Trump said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the US and other countries. Moreover, imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation. “Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,” said Trump. Trump is set to sign reciprocal tariffs into effect.

This turmoil was primarily triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs, which injected uncertainty into global markets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s price dropped from a high of approximately $88,500 to around $83,400 following the tariff news. The market experienced significant liquidations totaling approximately $500 million, with $300 million occurring within the last four hours. Initially the short positions were hit, then long ones, almost equally. In just one hour, the market wiped out over $100 million in long positions. $489M Wiped Out as 159K Traders Liquidated In the past 24 hours, 159,333 traders were liquidated , the total liquidations comes in at $489.07 million. The biggest single liquidation order was $11.97 million in ETHUSDT on Binance. Of the total, $257 million came from long positions and $232.06 million from short positions. These liquidations have impacted various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. Consequently, the overall market capitalization has decreased by $200 billion since its peak during after-hours trading.​ The recent market fluctuations have been largely affected by macroeconomic factors particularly, the anticipation of Liberation day tariffs announced by Trump. These tariffs have led to a high degree of market uncertainty leading to price volatility across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for instance, has seen its price fluctuate between $73,000 and $88,000, and is currently trading around $83,500, down by 0.9%. Liquidation Day or Liberation Day? This has left X users wondering if it was really a ‘Liberation Day’ or just a ‘Liquidation Day,’ given the massive wave of liquidations that shook the market. Bitcoin plunged to $82,000 on April 2, 2025, as global markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s bold tariff move. In his ‘Liberation Day’ speech, Trump announced aggressive reciprocal tariff rates on key trade partners, calling it a much-needed fix for America’s trade issues. Despite these short-term challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Forecasts suggest that Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025, with some projections reaching as high as $500,000 if the U.S. establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve. ​",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-03 05:47:35

President Donald Trump officially levied a 25% tariff on auto imports and a minimum 10% tariff on all exporters to the U.S. Additional duties were imposed on the nation’s biggest trading partners in Asia and the European Union, with China facing a 50% hike on several goods and a 26% fee on some Indian goods. Turmoil in markets ensued with gains from the past three days wiped out in U.S. indices and cryptocurrencies. Asian markets tumbled early Thursday and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slumped to the lowest level in more than five months. Gold set yet another record high. Bitcoin inched above $87,000 as investors hoped for leaner long-term effects of the economic changes, with signs of a risk-on environment emerging at the start of the week. Majors ether (ETH) and xrp (XRP) traded above $1,900 and $2.15, respectively, with technical analysis suggesting higher moves in the near term. But the euphoria was short-lived as crypto majors dipped as much as 5% from Wednesday’s highs before gradually stabilizing. In Asian morning hours on Thursday, bitcoin traded just above $83,500 while ether traded slightly over $1,800 — effectively reversing all gains from Tuesday after a sudden drop following the Tokyo open. That caused over $230 million in liquidations on both bullish and bearish bets, data shows , in an unusual move. BTC-tracked futures registered over $172 million in long and short liquidations alone, followed by ETH futures at $120 million and smaller altcoins at $50 million. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open). Single-sided large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.

The net inflows across all US ETFs for Bitcoin stood at $220 million, recovering all of the early week selloff. It shows that markets have already factored in the impact of the Trump tariff, and institutional players see it as an opportune time to buy the lows. Bitcoin ETF Inflows on the Rise Again Following a poor start to the week with the first two days of net outflows, inflows in the spot Bitcoin ETFs have resumed once again, On Wednesday, April 2, the net inflows surged to $220 million with Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARK dominating the flows at $119 million and $130 million respectively, as per data by Farside Investors .

With the dominance of this exchange, its action often has a significant impact on the industry, especially around listing and delisting, affecting the value of digital assets and the investors’ holdings. Crypto Trader Lost $3.79M on ACT Price Crash According to the Lookonchain post , Binance’s implementation of updates to leverage and margin tiers on Acet (ACT) tokens has affected the holders significantly. As the changes took effect on April 1, 2025, investors with holdings before that were impacted. One crypto trader alone faced a $3.79M liquidation as the ACT price crashed to $0.1877. This highlights the risk of sudden adjustments in leverages, as the traders who fail to adjust their positions end up facing massive liquidation losses. Besides, this is not the only affected crypto investor. Another lost nearly $2.17M with the ACT price crash. Lookonchain reveals that the individual’s holding’s worth was $2.49M months ago, but it is worth only $320k when they reported. ACT Price Crash Persists, Should You Worry? The Binance exchange update is considered a major mistake among the community as the event led to the massive Acet price crash . With major liquidation, the ACT’s worth crashed by more than 50%. The token is still down, bearing a 15% loss on the 24-hour frame. This reveals that the selling sentiments are high, as the investors’ confidence is declining on the asset. It currently trades at $0.06137 with a market capitalization of $77.2M. Also, its trading volume is down by 56% to $1.21M, showcasing fearful investor sentiments. This serves as a reminder that investors should stay informed about market news. More importantly, manage their actions accordingly; otherwise, massive losses may happen, similar to those of the aforementioned crypto trader. Although this is a standard part of the crypto trading industry, investors must manage their risk exposure carefully. More importantly, trades should be made carefully around this token. This is because volatility is high in the current scenario, especially as Trump escalated the trade war.

Alongside Senator Elizabeth Warren, Waters also urged the SEC to preserve records related to Trump’s crypto ties, and raised concerns about regulatory influence. Meanwhile, Trump made headlines with a new executive order imposing sweeping reciprocal tariffs on imports. He proposed a shift away from income tax toward tariff-based federal revenue collection. Maxine Waters Slams Trump Over Stablecoin Ties California Representative Maxine Waters voiced strong criticism against President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the cryptocurrency sector. During an April 2 markup hearing of the US House Financial Services Committee, Waters accused Trump of using his political influence to profit from various crypto ventures, including the recent launch of a US dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by his family. Maxine Waters speaking at the markup hearing In her opening remarks, Waters argued that Trump and his associates were using the regulatory process to enrich themselves through “multiple crypto schemes.” She specifically referenced World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is a company backed by Trump’s family, that launched the USD1 stablecoin in March. Waters also mentioned Trump’s previously launched meme coin and his reported ambitions to create a national cryptocurrency stockpile as part of a larger plan to replace the US dollar with his own digital currency. Waters warned that the stablecoin bill currently under discussion could set a dangerous precedent by allowing political figures to shape financial rules that benefit their own financial interests. She suggested that Trump’s ultimate goal could be to embed his stablecoin in government systems, from social security payments to tax collection, putting national financial stability at risk. Other lawmakers agreed with her concerns, and experts raised questions about potential conflicts of interest stemming from Trump’s crypto activities. Committee Chair French Hill acknowledged that the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector complicates efforts to draft effective legislation. Waters went on to declare that she will oppose the bill unless it included provisions to prevent a sitting president from owning a stablecoin business, and also urged her colleagues not to enable these kinds of conflicts. Markup hearing (Source: YouTube ) Meanwhile, Representative Bryan Steil, who introduced the STABLE Act, focused on the need to establish clear consumer protections and did not immediately address the specific concerns that were raised about Trump’s stablecoin. The committee also reviewed amendments to the STABLE Act alongside other legislative proposals aimed at curbing illicit financial activity and preventing the issuance of a US central bank digital currency. Overall, the markup hearing was a crucial step in determining whether the bills will actually advance to a full vote in the House of Representatives. Warren and Waters Demand SEC Transparency on Trump Ties Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters also recently urged the acting chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mark Uyeda, to preserve records related to World Liberty Financial (WLFI). In a letter dated April 2, the two Democratic lawmakers raised some concerns over what they described as an “unprecedented conflict of interest,” and suggested that Trump’s financial ties to WLFI could influence regulatory decisions in favor of the crypto industry. Part of the letter that was sent to Uyeda (Source: House Financial Services Committee ) Warren and Waters pointed out that Trump’s family stake in WLFI presents a very serious risk of interfering with the SEC’s mission to protect investors and ensure fair markets. They argued that this financial relationship may incentivize the Trump administration to pressure federal agencies, including the SEC, to adopt policies that directly benefit Trump’s crypto ventures. The letter followed WLFI’s announcement that it launched a stablecoin, USD1, on both the BNB Chain and Ethereum blockchain. The lawmakers referenced this launch along with Trump’s recent cryptocurrency-related initiatives, including the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile and the release of the TRUMP meme coin, as examples of potential conflicts of interest. Warren and Waters also placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the American public deserves transparency regarding whether the SEC is acting independently or being influenced by the financial interests of the president’s family. They called on Uyeda to preserve all communications and documents between Trump, his family, and the SEC, as well as any records involving WLFI. The letter also drew attention to some of the recent changes at the SEC under Trump’s administration. Since appointing Uyeda as acting chair, the SEC reportedly dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against crypto firms, including some whose executives contributed to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Trump’s nominee to permanently lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, is set to face a Senate Banking Committee vote, with a full Senate confirmation to follow if approved. Trump Orders Reciprocal Tariffs to Protect US Economy In other Trump-related news, the President signed an executive order imposing sweeping tariffs on imports in a move that is aimed at reshaping the US economic framework. The order establishes a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from every country and introduces reciprocal tariffs based on the rates US goods face abroad. Under this policy, the US will levy tariffs equal to roughly half the amount trading partners charge on American imports. For instance, since China imposes a 67% tariff on US products, the US will now place a 34% tariff on Chinese goods. Additionally, a flat 25% tariff has been introduced on all automobile imports. Trump’s reciprocal trade tariffs (Source: YouTube ) In announcing the order, Trump framed the tariffs as a return to a historic model of economic protectionism, and even suggested that the US experienced its greatest prosperity when it relied on tariff revenue rather than income tax. He specifically referenced the period from 1789 to 1913, and claimed that the country was wealthier and more economically secure before the introduction of the federal income tax. Trump also revived a proposal from his 2024 campaign to abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replace federal revenue collection with tariffs alone. He argued that such a shift will relieve American taxpayers and eliminate the need for income-based taxation. According to data from accounting firm Dancing Numbers , the proposal could save US taxpayers between $134,809 and $325,561 over their lifetimes, depending on whether wage-based taxes at the state and local levels are also removed. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who assumed office in February, agreed with Trump’s stance, and endorsed the concept of an “External Revenue Service” funded by tariffs. Lutnick believes that tariff revenue will protect American workers and industries while reducing the financial burden on citizens, and argued that the current tax system demands too much from the public without delivering a balanced federal budget.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-03 06:14:23

A $50 million tranche of RLUSD was issued earlier this week on Tuesday, with another $50 million late Wednesday. That came as Ripple added the stablecoin to its official payments product, with payment providers BKK Forex and iSend already said to be using the stablecoin. Industry leaders expect RLUSD to further shift crypto market dynamics , where upstarts tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) could see competition from Ripple’s product. XRP Ledger-based decentralized financial (DeFi) applications could be a cohort to watch for as RLUSD gains traction on various platforms, boosting XRP token demand. RLUSD is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, offered on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain. It is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents. To maintain its peg, RLUSD relies on a 1:1 reserve system—each token matches an equivalent fiat value. Users can mint RLUSD by depositing dollars with authorized partners, who issue tokens, or burn RLUSD to redeem cash. Market arbitrage helps stabilize its price: if RLUSD trades below $1, traders buy it to redeem at par, raising demand; if above $1, they mint more, increasing supply. Security features make RLUSD appealing to institutional users. An XRP Ledger amendment in January saw a “clawback” feature go live on the network, allowing the issuer to reclaim or ""claw back"" certain tokens, such as RLUSD, from users' wallets under specific conditions. This feature is typically implemented for regulatory compliance, to recover assets in cases of fraud, illegal activities, or when tokens are sent to unintended addresses.",Markets,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|USDT|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 06:16:58

The Treasury’s Office of Financial Assets Control (OFAC) added these wallets to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list. The Houthis, an Iran-backed militant group, have launched a series of attacks on Israel and hampered global commerce by striking commercial ships in the Red Sea. The United States retaliated with airstrikes against the militant group in March 2025, and it got wide attention after U.S. officials accidentally added a journalist to a private Signal group with sensitive information about the airstrikes. U.S. targets Houthi funding network tied to Tron wallets and arms purchases According to the United States government, certain Tron wallets have been mapped to a financial network that funds Houthi operations. This network has purchased “tens of millions of dollars” worth of weapons and sensitive technology and looted Ukrainian grain. The transactions fund Houthi activity, such as armed conflicts and missile and drone strikes, and are exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Central to this financial network is a group of entities controlled by Sa’id al-Jamal, an Iran-based financier of the Houthis who has become an important backer of the group. The U.S. declared him a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2021 and sanctioned him in 2023 and 2024. Even with these constraints, he continues to employ sophisticated financial techniques—including cryptocurrency—to transfer money and resources. Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary , highlighted the importance of al-Jamal’s network to the Houthis. “The Houthis depend on Sa’id al-Jamal and his network to obtain critical supplies for their war efforts,” he said. He also said the United States was committed to restricting the Houthis’ capacity to undertake destabilizing activity in the region. Under Executive Order 13224 , the U.S. government can freeze assets and impose economic sanctions against organizations and individuals who commit, threaten, or participate in terrorism. By sanctioning these Tron wallets, the U.S. has complicated the Houthis’ ability to obtain funding via virtual currencies. U.S. expands crypto sanctions to disrupt terrorist financing networks Blockchain data shows that these sanctioned Tron wallets have existed since 2023. According to data from Tron block explorer Tokenview , most transactions in the wallets were made using USDT, a stablecoin issued by Tether. International regulators are growing concerned about how terrorist groups are turning to cryptocurrencies to fund their operations. The U.S. Treasury has already levied sanctions over crimes involving the crypto space. Last year, it sanctioned wallets connected to Russian neo-Nazi groups that had been collecting money through digital assets. In 2023, it sanctioned crypto exchanges with ties to Hamas. The new sanctions on the Houthis highlight Washington’s ongoing efforts to thwart terrorist networks around the world from using cryptocurrencies to finance their activities. These sanctions aim to freeze the wallets and cut off a crucial funding source for the Houthis. They also serve as a warning to other groups and individuals against using digital currencies for illegal activities. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has scheduled a closed-door meeting today, all eyes are on its potential implications for the Ripple vs SEC case. Notably, experts believe that the SEC’s closed-door meeting could bring regulatory clarity on XRP and broader digital assets. Let’s explore expert insights and the possible implications of today’s meeting on the XRP lawsuit and the crypto industry. XRP Lawsuit: SEC’s Meeting To Bring Regulatory Clarity The XRP community is anticipating an imminent Ripple vs SEC case settlement, especially following Brad Garlinghouse’s critical statement. As XRP lawsuit nears its end, the community awaits an official confirmation from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Reportedly, the US SEC’s closed-door meeting scheduled on April 3, 2025, would bring more clarity to the Ripple lawsuit. Market analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO suggested that the SEC would discuss the Ripple lawsuit, potentially deciding on the fate of XRP. How Will the April 3 SEC Meeting Impact XRP Lawsuit? As per expert insights, the US SEC is expected to include the XRP lawsuit as a key topic of discussion during the closed-door meeting scheduled today. The Commission is set to decide whether to drop its appeal claiming XRP is a security. This crucial vote, happening today, could determine the future of Ripple’s XRP. Further, the US House crypto hearing on April 9 is expected to focus on the structure of the crypto market. The House will discuss the necessity of introducing a solid regulatory framework for the crypto industry. Is the Ripple vs SEC Case Over? In a surprising turnaround, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC dropped its appeal in the XRP lawsuit, following which the company withdrew its cross-appeal. This significant development has sparked enthusiasm within the XRP community, anticipating a swift settlement in the prolonged Ripple vs SEC case. However, legal expert Fred Rispoli clarified that the lawsuit wasn’t over as there are still procedures pending.

Russia ‘s central bank, the Bank of Russia, is considering delaying the full launch of its central bank digital currency — known as the digital ruble — until mid-2026, as banks expected to support it face technical migration challenges, according to a Frank Media report citing unnamed banking executives. The Bank of Russia had initially planned to roll out the CBDC for mass use by July this year but later decided to push the date further. Central bank head Elvira Nabiullina said in February that the launch would take place at a later date but didn’t specify when nor the reason for the delay.

Another banking executive mentioned concerns about technical security and how the digital ruble system would function during power outages. Despite the delay, officials say the pilot program is still on track. A central bank official said at a Russian economic forum in early April that the platform’s functionality is working as expected and there haven’t been any major issues so far. They also mentioned that the number of pilot participants has grown, with individual users rising from 500 to 2,000 and businesses increasing from 30 to 50.

The DoubleZero token, called 2Z, will be offered to accredited U.S. investors and will be CoinList’s first token sale open to U.S. participants in more than five years. The last such offering was the Kadena token sale in 2019, CoinList President Scott Keto said in a statement. CoinList’s comeback comes as the Donald Trump administration has taken a more positive stance towards the crypto space. The platform exited the US market in late 2019 due to increased regulatory enforcement under the Joe Biden administration, which was seen as overly aggressive by the crypto industry. Related News: Minutes Left Now: Analysts Share Possible Reaction of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Ahead of Donald Trump's Tariff Announcement “The perceived sanctions risk and associated costs have increased radically during the Biden administration,” Keto explained. “Many projects and companies have complied, but that has not prevented an activist SEC from filing unreasonable sanctions lawsuits, many of which were summarily dismissed in 2025.” Under the current administration, the SEC has dropped numerous lawsuits, including those against major crypto firms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Ripple. Keto noted that between 2020 and 2024, several top blockchain projects, including Solana, Near, and Ondo, have opted to exclude U.S. participants from their token sales due to regulatory uncertainty. *This is not investment advice.

This analysis examines XRP’s recent behavior across the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, offering insights for traders and investors looking for potential entry points, targets, and risk management strategies. Monthly and Weekly Outlook On the monthly chart, XRP has been trapped in a consolidation range between $2.00 and $2.20. This narrow price action signals market indecision. A break above $2.20 could trigger a bullish move towards $2.50, while a drop below $2.00 might push XRP back to $1.80 support. On the weekly chart, XRP is holding above $2.02, which is key for maintaining upward momentum. Resistance at $2.94 remains the next hurdle. A move above this level could fuel a rally, while failure to maintain support at $2.02 could push the price towards $1.80, testing lower support at $1.50. Daily Analysis The daily chart shows a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, with the neckline at $2.00. A breakdown below this level could lead to a decline towards $1.50. Technical indicators, including the RSI and MACD, also suggest waning bullish momentum, reinforcing the risk of further downside. However, a breakout above $2.20 would negate this pattern and could drive XRP higher, targeting $2.50 and $2.94. Trade Setups: Entry, Take-Profit, and Stop-Loss Ideal Entry: Consider entering near $2.00 , as it aligns with strong support, offering a favorable risk-to-reward setup. Take-Profit Levels: Target $2.20 (monthly resistance), $2.50, and $2.94 for potential bullish targets. Stop-Loss: Place a stop-loss just below $1.90 to manage downside risk if support breaks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP is at a crucial crossroads. A breakout above $2.20 could signal a shift towards higher levels like $2.50 and $2.94, while a failure to hold $2.00 could send the price lower, with $1.50 as the potential target. Short-term traders can capitalize on the range between $2.00 and $2.20, while long-term investors should wait for a breakout confirmation above resistance. With proper risk management, XRP’s price action presents opportunities for both short-term and long-term strategies.

42839885,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145863,1743665128,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent SEC Investigation Demanded into Trump’s Shocking DeFi Project: Crypto Conflict of Interest?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-investigation-trump-defi-project/,"The crypto world is once again buzzing with political intrigue! In a stunning turn of events, U.S. lawmakers are demanding a closer look at a DeFi project linked to none other than the family of former President Donald Trump. Could this be another chapter in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation, or is it a politically motivated move? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and what it could mean for the future of DeFi and crypto in general. Why is a SEC Investigation into the Trump DeFi Project Being Requested? The request for a SEC investigation comes from prominent Democratic figures, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters. Both are known for their critical stance on the crypto industry and their advocacy for stronger regulatory oversight. Their concern centers around World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project reportedly associated with the Trump family. The core issue? Potential conflicts of interest arising from Donald Trump’s past and possible future political positions. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: Conflict of Interest Concerns: With Donald Trump potentially eyeing another presidential run, lawmakers are questioning whether a DeFi project connected to his family could create ethical dilemmas and potential misuse of power. Regulatory Scrutiny: Elizabeth Warren, a vocal proponent of stricter crypto regulation , has publicly stated on X (formerly Twitter) that an examination is crucial to ascertain any conflict of interest. Financial Oversight: Maxine Waters, a leading voice on the House Financial Services Committee, is also pushing for transparency and accountability in the burgeoning DeFi sector, especially when it intersects with political figures. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and its Connection to the Trump Family? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is described as a Trump DeFi project , although the exact nature and extent of the Trump family’s involvement remain somewhat unclear. Details about WLFI are still emerging, but it’s understood to be operating within the decentralized finance space. This sector is known for its innovative financial services built on blockchain technology, often outside the traditional regulatory framework. Here’s what we know so far about WLFI: Decentralized Finance Focus: WLFI operates in the DeFi space, suggesting it may offer services like lending, borrowing, or trading of digital assets without intermediaries. Trump Family Link: The connection to the Trump family is the central point of concern, prompting questions about influence and potential preferential treatment. Limited Public Information: Specific details about WLFI’s operations, team, and tokenomics are not widely publicized yet, adding to the need for greater transparency. Elizabeth Warren and the Push for Stricter Crypto Regulation Elizabeth Warren has consistently been a strong voice advocating for increased crypto regulation in the United States. Her concerns range from consumer protection and financial stability to the use of crypto in illicit activities. Her involvement in this request for an SEC investigation is not surprising given her track record. Warren’s key arguments for tighter crypto controls include: Investor Protection: She emphasizes the need to protect retail investors from the volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Systemic Risk: Warren has voiced concerns about the potential for crypto markets to pose systemic risks to the broader financial system if left unregulated. Illicit Finance: She highlights the use of crypto for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. Regulatory Gaps: Warren believes current regulations are insufficient to address the unique challenges posed by the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Potential Implications of a DeFi Conflict of Interest The allegations of a DeFi conflict of interest involving the Trump family and WLFI raise significant questions about ethics and governance in both the political and crypto spheres. If an investigation uncovers impropriety, the repercussions could be far-reaching. Consider these potential consequences: Potential Implication Description Legal and Regulatory Action If the SEC investigation finds violations, WLFI and associated individuals could face fines, penalties, and restrictions. Reputational Damage The Trump family’s brand and the credibility of the DeFi project could suffer significant damage, impacting public trust. Increased Regulatory Pressure This case could further fuel the debate for stricter crypto regulation and potentially lead to new laws and oversight mechanisms. Impact on DeFi Sector Negative publicity could temporarily dampen enthusiasm for DeFi, though it could also push for greater transparency and accountability within the industry. What Happens Next in the SEC Investigation? The next steps are crucial. The SEC will now need to consider the lawmakers’ request and decide whether to formally launch an investigation into WLFI. This process can take time, and the outcome is uncertain. Key steps to watch for: SEC Response: The SEC will likely issue a public statement acknowledging the request and outlining its next course of action. Investigation Initiation: If the SEC decides to investigate, they will gather information, interview relevant parties, and analyze WLFI’s operations. Findings and Report: The SEC will compile its findings into a report, which could be made public. Enforcement Actions (if any): Based on the findings, the SEC may pursue enforcement actions if violations are found. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts This situation serves as a stark reminder of the growing intersection between politics and cryptocurrency. For those involved or interested in the crypto space, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and policy changes impacting the crypto industry. Demand Transparency: Support projects and platforms that prioritize transparency and accountability, especially in DeFi. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in constructive conversations about responsible crypto regulation and its role in the financial system. Understand Risks: Be aware of the risks associated with DeFi and always conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any crypto project. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto and Politics? The request for an SEC investigation into the Trump DeFi project is a significant development. It highlights the increasing scrutiny facing the crypto industry and the growing concerns about potential conflicts of interest when political figures are involved. Whether this investigation leads to major repercussions or not, it underscores the need for robust crypto regulation and ethical practices within the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. The coming months will be crucial in determining the direction of this story and its lasting impact on the crypto world.

Top Reasons Behind the Crypto Dip",https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-are-down-today-top-reasons-behind-the-crypto-dip/,"The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Are Down Today? Top Reasons Behind the Crypto Dip appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, in a bearish outlook in the past 24 hours. The flagship coin dropped over 1 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $83.3k on Thursday, during the early Western financial markets. Ethereum price slipped around 2 percent in the last 24 hours to trade around $1,824 at the time of this writing. Ripple Labs’ XRP recorded similar losses to trade below $2 for the first time in April. Top Reasons Why BTC, ETH, and XRP Dropped Mixed Reactions from Whale Activities According to on-chain data analysis, long-term Bitcoin holders have acted differently from the ongoing accumulation by public companies . For the past few months, public companies have purchased 95k BTCs while long-term holders have offloaded 178k BTCs. With the notable cash outflows from the U.S. spot BTC and Ether ETFs in the past few months, the crypto market was prone to bearish sentiment . Meanwhile, Ripple diluted the XRP market with 300 million coins from its monthly unlocks, which weighed down on the potential bullish outlook. Bearish Technical Playbook Ethereum and XRP prices followed Bitcoin prices in a sudden correction, which caused a $500 million crypto liquidation in the past 24 hours. As Coinpedia previously pointed out, most of the crypto assets led by BTC have been forming a bearish continuation pattern, characterized by a rising wedge in a falling market. The crypto correlation with major stock indexes and gold markets has significantly declined in the recent past. The short-term macroeconomic uncertainty has pushed more investors to the gold market and away from tech and crypto assets. Trade Wars Increasing Odds for Recession in 2025 Following the announcement of the reciprocal tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the odds of a recession in major economies significantly surged. According to the Polymarket, the offs of a U.S. recession in 2025 surged by 32 percent to around 51 percent chance on Thursday. Although a recession is considered bullish for the crypto market, the fear of short-term bearish sentiment was palpable. Moreover, the new tariffs will significantly disrupt global supply chains, and possibly cause financial strains to middle and low-income households. What Next? The crypto market has approached a crucial pivotal moment, which could either trigger a parabolic rally in the coming months or further pain. However, the ongoing rally of gold price has signaled a potential crypto recovery in the near term. Moreover, the crypto market has experienced significant pain since the pro-crypto Trump administration took office, signaling a potential relief rally in the near term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Techteryx, which acquired TrueUSD in December 2020, entrusted First Digital Trust (FDT), a fiduciary based in Hong Kong, with managing TUSD’s reserves. However, court documents reveal that instead of adhering to the agreed-upon structure, FDT allegedly directed $456 million of the stablecoin’s assets into Aria Commodities DMCC, a separate entity based in Dubai. TrueUSD Crisis This entity, which specializes in trade finance and commodity trading, was not part of the original investment strategy. Its projects—ranging from mining operations to renewable energy ventures—were considered highly illiquid, which complicated efforts to redeem funds. FDT had been instructed to invest TUSD’s reserves into the Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF), a Cayman Islands-registered vehicle. However, the diversion of funds to Aria Commodities DMCC led to severe liquidity issues for Techteryx, which struggled to recover its investments when it attempted redemptions between mid-2022 and early 2023. Court documents outline that Techteryx faced repeated defaults and missed payments from the Aria entities, which left the stablecoin’s reserves at risk. The firm claims that these actions were misrepresentations and alleged that the funds were misappropriated, adding that the investments did not reflect Techteryx’s intentions. Matthew Brittain, who happens to be the controlling figure behind Aria CFF through Aria Capital Management, and his wife, Cecilia Brittain, who holds sole ownership of Aria Commodities DMCC, have come under scrutiny. Despite the apparent separation of the two companies, court filings suggest that the entities were closely connected. Matthew Brittain even allegedly acknowledged the financial ties between the two. As the liquidity crunch deepened in mid-2023, Techteryx turned to Justin Sun for help. The Tron founder provided emergency funding, structured as a loan, to stabilize the situation and ensure that retail redemptions could continue. This financial intervention helped Techteryx to quarantine $400 million of TUSD, effectively isolating the troubled reserves from affecting everyday users. An earlier announcement revealed that Techteryx assumed full control of TUSD in July 2023, thereby ending TrueCoin’s role in the stablecoin’s operations. The company’s subsequent legal action paints a picture of financial mismanagement and fraud, pointing to unauthorized payments and undisclosed commissions allegedly funneled to entities like “Glass Door.” Defense Meanwhile, FDT’s CEO, Vincent Chok, defended his company’s actions and claimed that FDT had merely acted in its fiduciary capacity. On the other hand, Matthew Brittain dismissed the accusations while asserting that all dealings were transparent and in compliance with the agreed terms. Last January, TUSD experienced a deviation from its $1 parity, which was attributed to sell-offs caused by whales. Reports also suggested that Binance is excluding the stablecoin from the list of cryptocurrencies eligible for staking to earn MANTA.

Why This is Good News For Mutuum Finance (MUTM)",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/in-the-latest-ripple-news-today-xrp-price-projections-show-an-imminent-50-dump-why-this-is-good-news-for-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"XRP value dropped 5.83% within 24 hours, at $2.23 and bearish momentum quickly catches up. With critical support at $1.93 failing, analysts warn of a 50% pullback toward $1.50 in a rising triangle formation coupled with weakening technical indicators. As XRP prepares for volatility investors focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in phase 4 of its presale at $0.025. Those who buy now will net a 140% profit at launch when MUTM goes live at $0.06. As capital runs from the uncertainty around XRP, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as a potential refuge, boasting 7,800 holders and 6.1 million dollars raised. XRP’s Technical Breakdown Ripple lost 4.18% of its price value to reach $2.14 before meeting vital resistance levels. The price breaking through $1.93 may ignite selling domino effects which potentially would repeat March’s 2025 low of $1.50. RSI stands at 49.54 with signs of approaching over-sold levels even though MACD currently remains negative at -0.0179. Short squeezes might occur when prices increase because the majority of traders have concentrated their short positions in the $2.14 area. Market price movements appear likely to face more bearish pressure than brief upward trends because the combination of reduced bullish momentum and a head-and-shoulders pattern signals a risk of downward price movement. Presale Momentum of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exploits the rotating patterns of the crypto market through its current strategic move. XRP’s market value keeps falling but investors search for alternative presale opportunities which provide protected growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at Phase 4 of its 11-stage presale run where tokens cost $0.025 but Phase 5 offers them for $0.03. Over 77% of all claims during Phase 4 indicate that buyers are in a rush to obtain price increases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates decentralized lending functions with a token-based system that stimulates market demand. Early token locking at $0.025 results in 140% ROI because the token will cost $0.06 on exchanges. Analysts anticipate MUTM will escalate to $3.50 within the next five months following its exchange debut because platform fee income purchases MUTM tokens which redistribute them as rewards to stakeholders. Stakers receive redistributed Tokens that create long-term buying pressure after preventing sellers from starting early. Long-term token holders receive advantages through the mtTokens protocol which link user deposits to cryptocurrency investments. Users of ETH can access interest-bearing mtETH products that enhance their investment value through accrued value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adopts a dual strategy that joins DeFi features with environmental stewardship while XRP serves as an example of an undesirable speculative cryptocurrency. Transparency is Key to Gaining Trust A final audit from CertiK for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is approaching completion as a strong confirmation measure for all investors. Project administration will announce audit outcomes directly through official channels when the assessment process finishes to display their dedication for security. The initiative stands as an aggressive opposite to Ripple since its legal challenges continue to obstruct XRP adoption. The upcoming Phase 5 will introduce the next MUTM purchasing opportunity for $0.03 before prices rise. Every phase improves the barriers to entry so new investors must pay higher costs to join. The initial phase of early adopters obtained impressive 600% paper profit returns during the initial phase of the popular presale model which mimics the explosive growth patterns of Ethereum and Solana before it. Changing Times for Crypto Investments XRP’s troubles highlight the volatility of the crypto market where even established assets can undergo sharp corrections. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a counter-narrative: A presale asset focused on DeFi fundamentals immune from the kind of speculative swings that haunt coins such as Ripple. Its $6.10 million fundraising milestone and rapid growth in holders shows alignment from both institutions and retails, making post-launch volatility skewed toward the upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a strategic hedge as Ripple slugs through bearish charts. The phase 4 presale for the project is ending soon, taking the lowest price tier with it, so don’t miss out.

42840154,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145866,1743665742,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Market Alert: Nasdaq Futures Plunge 4% – Crypto Market Impact Revealed!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nasdaq-futures-crypto-market-impact/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! The traditional markets are flashing red, and it’s time to pay attention. Nasdaq 100 futures have just nosedived a staggering 4.2%, while S&P 500 futures aren’t far behind, tumbling 3.5%. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into this developing situation and uncover the potential crypto market impact of this sudden stock market tremor. Decoding the Shocking Nasdaq Futures and S&P 500 Drop The sharp decline in Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 futures is sending shockwaves through global markets. But what exactly are these futures, and why are their movements so crucial? Futures contracts are essentially agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. They act as indicators of market sentiment and often foreshadow the direction of the actual stock market when it opens. A significant drop in futures, like the one we’re witnessing now, typically signals investor apprehension and anticipation of a downturn in the underlying stock indices. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know: Nasdaq 100 Futures: These futures track the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index, which is heavily weighted towards technology stocks. A 4.2% drop suggests significant selling pressure in the tech sector, often considered a growth and risk-on area of the market. S&P 500 Futures: Tracking the broader S&P 500 index, a 3.5% fall here indicates widespread concern across various sectors of the U.S. economy. Global Market Contagion: The U.S. stock market is a global bellwether. Significant movements here can trigger similar reactions in markets worldwide, including the cryptocurrency market. The reasons behind this sudden downturn are likely multifaceted, ranging from concerns about inflation and rising interest rates to geopolitical uncertainties. Whatever the catalyst, the immediate effect is clear: risk assets are being reassessed, and investors are exhibiting a flight to safety. The Tangible Crypto Market Impact: What to Expect? So, how does a stock market crash , or even a significant dip in futures, translate to the crypto world? The correlation between traditional markets and cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has become increasingly apparent in recent times. When traditional markets experience turbulence, the crypto market often feels the ripple effects. Here’s a look at the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effect on Crypto Investor Sentiment Negative sentiment in traditional markets can spill over to crypto, leading to increased selling pressure and price drops. Risk-off behavior becomes dominant. Liquidity Crunch During market downturns, investors may liquidate assets across the board to raise cash, impacting crypto liquidity and potentially triggering sharper price declines. Institutional Investors Institutions, now increasingly involved in crypto, often manage risk across their entire portfolio. Stock market losses might prompt them to reduce exposure in more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Correlation Play Algorithmic trading and market-making bots often operate based on correlations between different asset classes. A stock market downturn can trigger automated selling in correlated assets like crypto. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is also driven by its own unique factors, including technological developments, regulatory news, and adoption rates. While traditional market woes can exert downward pressure, they don’t dictate the entire narrative for crypto. Navigating Market Volatility: Is This a Buying Opportunity Amidst Market Volatility? Market downturns, while unsettling, can also present opportunities. The current market volatility , triggered by the futures drop, could be viewed in a few different ways by crypto investors: Potential Buying Opportunity: For long-term believers in crypto, significant price dips can be seen as chances to accumulate assets at lower prices. The adage “buy the dip” becomes relevant, but requires careful consideration and risk management. Risk Assessment: It’s a crucial time to reassess your portfolio risk. Are you overexposed to volatile assets? Do you have sufficient cash reserves? Market corrections are healthy reminders to review and adjust your investment strategy. Diversification: While crypto can be a valuable part of a portfolio, diversification across different asset classes remains key. Traditional market events highlight the importance of not putting all your eggs in one basket. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market turmoil, it’s beneficial to refocus on the fundamentals of your crypto investments. Are the underlying projects still strong? Is the adoption narrative intact? Solid projects often weather market storms better. It’s essential to approach the current situation with a balanced perspective. Panic selling based on short-term market fluctuations is often detrimental. Instead, informed decision-making, based on research and a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, is paramount. The Unpredictable Road Ahead: Staying Informed in Times of Market Uncertainty The drop in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness and inherent volatility of global markets. While the immediate stock market crash implications for crypto are negative price action, it also presents a crucial moment for investors to learn, adapt, and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining the longer-term impact of this market event. Staying informed, being prepared, and maintaining a long-term perspective are your best tools in navigating these uncertain times.

Let's do… https://t.co/ygS7hYpm7b — Taylor Barr (@taylorjbarr) April 3, 2025 The House Financial Services Committee has recently taken a significant step in regulating stablecoins, passing the STABLE Act with a 32-17 vote. The bill, introduced by Chair French Hill and Rep. Bryan Steil, aims to establish a clear framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, enforcing reserve requirements and anti-money laundering standards. Moreover, lawmakers stressed the importance of keeping pace with blockchain technology to maintain global competitiveness. Trump’s Crypto Connection Sparks Debate The STABLE Act advanced after an intense markup session, with 26 Republicans and six Democrats voting in favor. However, many Democrats expressed concern about Trump’s deep ties to stablecoins, especially after his affiliated firm, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), announced its own stablecoin (USD1). Given Trump’s history of selling NFTs and memecoins like TRUMP, they argue he could directly benefit from the regulations he may influence as president. Republican Push for Quick Action Despite the controversy, Republicans are pushing to finalize stablecoin regulations by August. Committee Chairman French Hill emphasized the need for “guardrails, not roadblocks” to bring innovation. Democrats, including Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch, countered by accusing Trump of using his presidential influence for personal gain, a charge Republicans brushed off as unnecessary. Stablecoins, CBDC Ban, and More This wasn’t the only crypto-related debate in Congress. Alongside the stablecoin bill, lawmakers discussed banning a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) and establishing a task force to combat illicit crypto activities. The Financial Technology Protection Act, aimed at tackling crypto crime, passed unanimously, while the anti-CBDC bill saw a split vote of 27-22. With the House and Senate both advancing stablecoin bills, lawmakers will now work on merging them into a single version for final approval. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to sign a resolution that overturns an IRS rule targeting DeFi, marking another win for the crypto industry. Whether stablecoin regulations will pass before the elections and what role Trump will play remains to be seen. Community Reaction Reacting to the news, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argues it would push innovation forward and keep the industry in the U.S., while lawmakers like Rep. French Hill say there’s already a long-standing consensus against it. Meanwhile, discussions on broader crypto regulations are moving forward, with Rep. Bryan Steil calling stablecoin and market structure bills “peanut butter and jelly” essential together.

For stablecoins, which aim to maintain a steady value, proving their reserves is non-negotiable. Binance, a leading crypto exchange, has once again stepped up to reinforce the stability of FDUSD, a popular stablecoin. Let’s dive into the latest announcement and understand why this is reassuring news for crypto users. Binance Reconfirms FDUSD Reserve Attestation: What Does It Mean for You? Binance has recently reiterated the accuracy of the February attestation report for FDUSD reserves. This report, an independent assessment conducted by Prescient Assurance and commissioned by FDUSD issuer FD121 Limited, offers a snapshot of FDUSD’s backing. The key takeaway? As of March 1st, 2024, at 01:00 UTC, FDUSD held over $2 billion in reserves . But what exactly constitutes these reserves? According to the report, FDUSD’s reserves are strategically held in: U.S. Treasuries : Considered among the safest and most liquid assets globally, U.S. Treasuries provide a solid foundation for the reserves. Overnight Fixed Deposits : These deposits offer liquidity and security, ensuring that funds are readily accessible when needed. Crucially, the report confirms that these robust reserves exceeded the total circulating supply of FDUSD at the time. This over-collateralization is a strong indicator of FDUSD’s stability and its ability to maintain its peg to the US dollar. Binance has not only acknowledged this data upon its initial release but has also recently verified it again, demonstrating their commitment to transparency and user confidence in crypto reserves . Adding another layer of assurance, a new attestation report for March is anticipated within the next two weeks. This continuous monitoring and reporting underscore the ongoing commitment to maintaining and verifying the integrity of FDUSD’s backing. Why is FDUSD Reserve Attestation Crucial for Stablecoin Confidence? Stablecoins, like FDUSD, play a vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They aim to provide a safe haven from the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. To achieve this, they are typically pegged to a fiat currency, most commonly the US dollar. However, this peg is only as strong as the reserves backing it. Reserve attestation reports are essential because they offer an independent verification that a stablecoin issuer holds sufficient assets to back its circulating supply. Think of it as an audit for the digital age, providing transparency and accountability. Without these attestations, questions arise about the actual backing of the stablecoin, potentially leading to a loss of confidence and, as we’ve seen in the past, even de-pegging events. In fact, FDUSD itself experienced a temporary de-pegging incident. This occurred after concerns were raised by Justin Sun regarding the capabilities of Hong Kong-based custodian First Digital Trust (FDT) to handle client fund redemptions. Such incidents highlight the sensitivity of stablecoin pegs and the importance of robust reserve management and transparent communication. Binance’s proactive approach to reserve attestation helps to mitigate these concerns and build trust in the stablecoin . The Strength of US Treasuries in FDUSD’s Backing The composition of FDUSD’s reserves is a significant factor in its perceived stability. The decision to hold a substantial portion in US Treasuries is noteworthy. Why? Because U.S. Treasuries are widely considered to be: Low-Risk : Backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, they are among the safest investments available. Highly Liquid : They can be easily bought and sold in the market, ensuring quick access to funds if needed. Stable Value : While not immune to fluctuations, they are generally less volatile compared to many other asset classes, particularly in the crypto world. By prioritizing US Treasuries and overnight fixed deposits, FDUSD positions itself as a stablecoin backed by high-quality, liquid assets. This contrasts with some other stablecoins that might rely on riskier or less transparent reserve assets. This strategic choice in reserve composition further reinforces the confidence in FDUSD’s peg and overall stability. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for FDUSD and Binance Crypto Reserves? Binance’s continued emphasis on reserve attestation for FDUSD is a positive signal for the market. The upcoming March report will provide another timely update, allowing users to monitor the ongoing health and backing of the stablecoin. This proactive approach to transparency is crucial for maintaining trust in the often-complex world of cryptocurrency. For users of FDUSD and the broader crypto community, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed : Keep an eye out for the upcoming March reserve attestation report for FDUSD. Review Attestation Reports : When choosing a stablecoin , prioritize those with regular, independent attestation reports. Understand Reserve Composition : Look into what assets are backing the stablecoin. A higher proportion of low-risk, liquid assets like US Treasuries is generally preferable. Use Reputable Exchanges : Exchanges like Binance that prioritize transparency and reserve attestation contribute to a healthier crypto ecosystem. Binance’s reconfirmation of the FDUSD reserve attestation accuracy is more than just a routine update. It’s a powerful message about the exchange’s commitment to transparency, user trust, and the stability of the crypto market. By consistently verifying and communicating the backing of FDUSD, Binance is setting a positive example for the industry and providing reassurance to crypto holders.

Get ready for ‘Nightfall_4’, the latest iteration that swaps out optimistic rollups for the cutting-edge zero-knowledge rollups . This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift designed to cater to the evolving needs of EY’s corporate clientele, especially in a landscape where privacy concerns are taking center stage. What does this mean for the future of enterprise blockchain solutions, and why are ZK rollups suddenly the talk of the town? Let’s dive in and explore this exciting development. What are Zero-Knowledge Rollups and Why Are They a Game Changer? Before we delve deeper into EY’s strategic pivot, let’s quickly break down what zero-knowledge rollups actually are and why they’re generating so much buzz. In essence, ZK rollups are a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that bundle multiple transactions together into a single transaction on the main chain. The magic lies in their ability to provide cryptographic proof of these transactions’ validity without revealing any of the transaction data itself. Think of it as proving you know the answer to a complex puzzle without showing anyone how you solved it – that’s the power of zero-knowledge! Here’s a simplified breakdown: Enhanced Privacy: The core benefit of zero-knowledge rollups is, undoubtedly, privacy. Transaction details are kept confidential, making them ideal for enterprises handling sensitive data. Scalability Boost: By processing transactions off-chain and then verifying them on-chain with succinct proofs, ZK rollups significantly increase transaction throughput compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Security Inherited from Ethereum: While operating off-chain, ZK rollups still inherit the robust security of the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring a high level of trust and reliability. Faster Transactions: Off-chain processing translates to quicker transaction speeds, a crucial factor for businesses demanding efficient operations. Compared to optimistic rollups, which rely on fraud proofs and a challenge period to ensure transaction validity, zero-knowledge rollups offer immediate finality and stronger privacy guarantees right from the outset. This makes them particularly appealing for use cases where data confidentiality is paramount. EY’s Nightfall Blockchain: A Privacy-Focused Evolution EY’s Nightfall project has always been about bringing the power of blockchain to the enterprise world, with a strong emphasis on privacy and security. Initially launched using optimistic rollups, Nightfall has now undergone a significant transformation with the introduction of zero-knowledge rollups in its latest iteration, Nightfall_4.

By embracing zero-knowledge rollups , Nightfall is positioning itself as a leading enterprise-grade blockchain privacy solution. Unpacking the Benefits of Zero-Knowledge Rollups for Nightfall Users So, what tangible benefits can businesses expect from Nightfall’s shift to zero-knowledge rollups ? Let’s break it down further: Benefit Description Impact on Businesses Unparalleled Privacy ZK rollups inherently offer stronger privacy by keeping transaction details confidential, unlike optimistic rollups. Ideal for handling sensitive corporate data, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations, and maintaining competitive confidentiality. Faster Transaction Finality Transactions on ZK rollups achieve finality almost instantly, without waiting for challenge periods. Faster business processes, quicker settlement times, and improved operational efficiency. Reduced Gas Fees By batching transactions and processing them off-chain, ZK rollups significantly reduce gas fees compared to direct Ethereum mainnet transactions. Lower operational costs for blockchain applications, making enterprise adoption more economically viable. Enhanced Security Inherits Ethereum’s robust security while adding an extra layer of privacy through zero-knowledge proofs. Increased trust and confidence in the security of blockchain solutions, mitigating risks associated with data breaches and vulnerabilities. Improved User Experience Faster and more private transactions contribute to a smoother and more efficient user experience. Increased user adoption and satisfaction, making blockchain privacy solutions more accessible and appealing to a wider range of businesses and users. These benefits collectively paint a picture of a more robust, efficient, and privacy-centric Nightfall blockchain , poised to meet the stringent demands of enterprise clients. Addressing Challenges and Looking Ahead for ZK Rollups Adoption While zero-knowledge rollups offer a compelling suite of advantages, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and the road ahead. ZK rollups are still relatively nascent technology compared to optimistic rollups. Development and implementation can be complex, requiring specialized expertise in cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs. Challenges to Consider: Complexity of Implementation: Building and deploying ZK rollups is technically challenging and requires advanced cryptographic knowledge. Computational Overhead: Generating zero-knowledge proofs can be computationally intensive, potentially impacting performance in certain scenarios, although advancements are continuously being made to mitigate this. Ecosystem Maturity: The ZK rollup ecosystem is still developing, with fewer readily available tools and developer resources compared to more established technologies. Auditability Concerns: While offering privacy, the very nature of zero-knowledge proofs can raise questions about auditability and transparency, requiring careful consideration for regulatory compliance. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind zero-knowledge rollups is undeniable. As the technology matures and development tools become more accessible, we can expect to see wider adoption across various industries. EY’s investment in ZK rollups through Nightfall_4 is a strong signal of confidence in the future potential of this technology. Nightfall Blockchain and the Growing Demand for Blockchain Privacy EY’s decision to embrace zero-knowledge rollups for Nightfall is perfectly aligned with the increasing demand for blockchain privacy solutions.

The altcoins reacted in a similar manner, with many losing up to 10% of their value since their local peaks. BTC Dumps by $6K Bitcoin’s weekend went quite sluggish as the asset failed to breach $84,000 and dropped toward $81,000 on Sunday evening and Monday. It bounced off after reaching that multi-day low and jumped toward $84,000 again but to no avail. More volatility ensued on Tuesday when BTC went from $82,400 to $85,500 within a few hours. It failed there and even plunged to $81,200 in a flash crash on Bitstamp. That was short-lived too, as the cryptocurrency started to gain real traction yesterday evening amid reports that Trump will dump Musk soon. Bitcoin shot up to a weekly high of over $88,500 within hours. However, the latest tariffs imposed by the US president against numerous countries stopped the momentum, and BTC slumped by over six grand in minutes to just over $82,000. It has recovered slightly since then and now sits above $83,000. However, its market cap has dropped to $1.650 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is still close to 60% on CG. BTCUSD.

Toncoin, Avalanche, and Solana lead the adverse trend from the larger caps, losing up to 6% on a daily scale and over 10% since yesterday’s peaks. ETH, XRP, DOGE, ADA, XLM, and LINK are also in the red, but in a slightly less painful manner. Even more violent declines come from HYPE (-10%), CRO (-11%), and PI (-7.5%). The total crypto market cap has shed about $140 billion since yesterday’s high and is down to $2.765 trillion on CG. This overall volatility has wiped out nearly $500 million in overleveraged positions as longs dominate slightly ($260 million).

Earlier this week, Ripple issued $50 million worth of RLUSD on Tuesday, followed by another $50 million on Wednesday. This surge came after Ripple added RLUSD to its official payments system, further driving enterprise utility and demand for the asset. Well-known payment provisers like BKK Forex and iSend already have already started using it actively for transactions, increasing the adoption rate of RLUSD. RLUSD Poised to Compete With Major Stablecoins Industry experts believe RLUSD could reshape the crypto market, posing competition to major stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao remarked that while it may seem like a “stablecoin war,” it’s actually a healthy competition that’s just getting started. Stablecoin war, I mean healthy competition , just getting started. https://t.co/oTrgofXAMk — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) April 2, 2025 As RLUSD grows in popularity, XRPL-based DeFi apps are expected to benefit, increasing demand for XRP tokens. RLUSD is a stablecoin tied 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, available on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and cash equivalents. Users can create RLUSD by depositing dollars with trusted partners or get cash by burning their tokens. The price stays stable through market actions: if RLUSD drops below $1, traders buy it to redeem at $1, increasing demand; if it’s above $1, they mint more, boosting supply. It’s also secure for big investors. A new ‘clawback’ feature allows the issuer to recover tokens from wallets if there’s fraud, illegal activity, or accidental transfers. RLUSD Nears $250M In Market Cap Ripple noted that since its launch in December 2024, RLUSD has gained strong global traction, reaching nearly $250 million in market cap and $10 billion in trading volume. This shows growing demand for a USD-backed stablecoin designed with enterprise-grade security and compliance in mind. In addition to partners and exchanges LMAX Digital, Zero Hash, Bitstamp and Bullish, RLUSD was recently made available on Kraken, one of the world’s longest-standing crypto exchanges, further extending access and availability to retail users. XRP Dips after Tariff Announcement XRP dropped 5% on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all international trading partners. This fall wiped out recent gains that XRP had from Ripple’s announcement about adding the RLUSD stablecoin to its Ripple Payments system. The dip shows how global events like tariffs can negatively impact crypto markets.

The tariff announcement has affected the entire global market. In the daily chart, Europe is showing a bearish signal of -0.31%, China (-0.18%), Japan (-3.19%), India (-0.21%), South Africa (-0.94%) and Australia (-0.93%). However, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe predicts that demand for Bitcoin and altcoin may increase once market fears and uncertainty fade. Curious to know more! Read on! Trump’s Tariffs against Trade Partners US President Donald Trump, who had jolted the global economy with his decision to impose tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada in early February, once again sent shockwaves across the global trade landscape yesterday with his reciprocal tariff announcement against some of his trade partners, including China, the UK, South Korea and India. The US administration, led by Republican leader Trump, announced a 49% tariff on Cambodia, a 46% tariff on Vietnam, 34% tariff on China, a 26% tariff on India, a 25% tariff on South Korea and a 10% tariff on the UK. Interestingly, the US president dubbed the tariff announcement ‘ Liberation Day .’ White speaking at the tariff announcement event at the Rose Garden of the White House, Trump strongly defended his reciprocal tariff decision, saying “Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years. But it is not going to happen anymore.” US Tariff Concerns Easing: What It Means for the Market The tariff decision has created havoc in the global economy. Even the crypto market has been affected . In the last 24 hours, the crypto market has dropped by 2.8%. Bitcoin has slipped by 1.2%, Ethereum by 2%, XRP by 2.6%, Solana by 4.4%, and Dogecoin by 2.1%. However, Michael van de Poppe, a renowned crypto analyst, forecasts that demand for Bitcoin and altcoins may increase once market fear and uncertainty fade. The Tariffs won’t be as bad as the entire population expects them to be. Uncertainty fades away. Gold will drop. ‘Buy the rumor, sell the news’ #Altcoins & #Bitcoin goes up. ‘Sell the rumor, buy the news’ — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 2, 2025 Gold Expected to Drop: ‘Buy the Rumour, Sell the News’ in Action Since March 1, the gold market has experienced a surge of at least 8.7%. During the period, it has outperformed the Bitcoin market, which has witnessed a drop of 1.30%. Rumours related to Trump’s tariffs have created fear and uncertainty in the market. Experts believe that this market atmosphere encouraged investors to move from risky assets to safe options like gold. Today, at one point, the gold price touched as high as $3,167.382. Now, it remains at $3,129.210. Michael notes that investors brought gold as a hedge against uncertainty, but now that uncertainty is decreasing, gold prices may decline. Bitcoin & Altcoins Could Rise Machael points out that traders may have sold Bitcoin and altcoins earlier due to tariff fears. Now that the situation is clearer, they may start buying again, pushing prices up. Today, Bitcoin has climbed from $82,543.74 to $83.021.56. Currently, the market looks bullish.

Buying Bitcoin Here Could Be Profitable Bitcoin is currently trading approximately 10% higher than its recent local bottom of nearly $77,000, recorded on March 10. However, uncertainty in the market has increased due to US President Donald Trump’s looming trade tariffs, with some analysts predicting that the top cryptocurrency could experience further downside before a trend reversal occurs. Related Reading: Is a Bitcoin Rally Coming? Exchange Net Flow Data Suggests So Amid this backdrop, CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest noted that, based on market dynamics, BTC’s ARP is currently hovering around $71,000 – representing almost a 20% pullback from its current price in the mid-$80,000 range. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin’s ARP is a metric that calculates the average acquisition price of all actively traded BTC, filtering out dormant coins. It helps identify market sentiment by showing the cost basis of active investors, providing insights into potential support or resistance levels. Additionally, BorisVest pointed out that BTC’s TMMP currently has a key support level at $65,000. The analyst stated: If we define the area between the Active Realized Price and the True Market Mean Price as a zone, we can expect that in the near future, if the price declines, it should meet significant demand in this range. In essence, BTC’s current major demand zone lies between $71,000 and $65,000. Purchasing BTC within this range could provide investors with a favorable risk-reward ratio, potentially leading to substantial gains. Analyst Points Out Key Resistance Levels In contrast to BorisVest’s analysis, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified two key resistance levels for Bitcoin. Martinez stated: Bitcoin BTC faces the 200-day MA at $86,200 and the 50-day MA at $88,300 as key resistance ahead! A break above these levels could shift momentum back to the bulls. Moving-average (MA) based resistance levels often function as key psychological and technical price barriers. Market traders typically place their sell orders around these levels, leading to price reversal or consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Hit $112,000, But Only If It Holds Above This Key Level – Analyst Explains Martinez’s analysis aligns with that of fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital, who noted that despite BTC breaking its daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) downtrend, it may still face significant resistance ahead. That said, a bullish trend reversal may be on the horizon for BTC. Recent reports suggest that Trump may soften his stance on reciprocal tariffs, potentially enabling a relief rally for risk-on assets like BTC. At press time, BTC is trading at $84,820, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

The Minnesota Bitcoin Act, or HF 2946, was introduced to the state’s House by Republican Representative Bernie Perryman on April 1, following an identical bill introduced on March 17 by GOP state Senator Jeremy Miller. Meanwhile, on the same day in Alabama, Republican Senator Will Barfoot introduced Senate Bill 283 while a bi-partisan group of Representatives led by Republican Mike Shaw filed the identical House Bill 482, which allows for the state to invest in crypto, but essentially limits it to Bitcoin ( BTC ). Twin Alabama bills don’t explicitly name Bitcoin Minnesota’s Bitcoin Act would allow the state’s investment board to invest state assets in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and permit state employees to add crypto to retirement accounts. It would also exempt crypto gains from state income taxes and give residents the option to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin. Source: Bitcoin Laws The twin Alabama bills don’t explicitly name Bitcoin, but it would limit the state’s crypto investment into assets that have a minimum market value of $750 billion — a criterion that only Bitcoin currently meets. 26 Bitcoin reserve bills now introduced in the US Introducing identical bills is not uncommon in the US and is typically done to speed up the legislative process so laws can pass more quickly.

What Next for BTC?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/03/u-s-recession-odds-surge-in-prediction-markets-on-tariff-shock-what-next-for-btc,"U.S. recession fears are in the air following President Donald Trump's tariff plan, with prediction platforms Polymarket and Kalshi indicating heightened concerns the economy will take a hit. On Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, the chance of the country slipping into recession this year topped 50% for the first time since the betting contract "" US Recession in 2025 "" began trading early this year. The contract's Yes shares soared to over 50 cents from 39 cents in less than 24 hours. The contract will resolve to Yes if the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) confirms a recession at any point before Dec. 31. The other condition requires back-to-back quarterly contractions in gross domestic product. Kalshi , a U.S.-based regulated prediction market, also points to heightened economic concerns among traders, with the probability of a 2025 recession rising to 54% from 40% . Financial markets tend to be forward-looking and may react to rising U.S. recession odds by sending risk assets such as bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies lower. At publication time, the S&P 500 futures traded 3% lower, pointing to severe risk aversion on Wall Street and offering bearish cues to bitcoin, which changed hands at $83,100, 1.5% lower in 24 hours. The sweeping tariffs unveiled Wednesday set a base rate of 10% on all imports, plus higher taxes on 60 nations identified as worst offenders. China, the most heavily hit, warranted a 34% levy on top of the existing 20% charge, taking the total to 54%. The base tariffs go into effect on April 5 and the higher reciprocal rates on April 9. While the Trump administration expects tariffs to rectify the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficits, in the short run, they could add to domestic inflation and global instability. The latter could happen immediately if China, the European Union and others hit back with higher tariffs, starting a full-blown global trade war. Risk-off to be short-lived? Still, some observers say the tariff uncertainty might lead only to an economic slowdown rather than a full-blown recession. ""The threat of further tariff escalation remains a key concern, but our economic forecasts do not call for a recession in the US,"" UBS said in a blog post. ""In our base case, a wide range of selective tariffs and counteractions are likely to lead to slower economic growth compared to last year, but they should not prevent the US economy from expanding by around 2%—its historical trend rate—this year."" As for financial markets, some observers say the tariffs are dovish, meaning the initial risk-off reaction could be short-lived and quickly reversed by expectations of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. ""Remember - tariffs are dovish, and big tariffs are very dovish,"" Joseph Wang, operator of the research portal fedguy.com said on X, referring to his November post that detailed how big tariffs would lead to more rate cuts. Wang argued that while tariffs are inflationary, they can be mitigated through foreign-exchange rates and are ultimately transitory. Meanwhile, damage to the business sentiment can be long-lasting, leading to unemployment, which the Fed would want to avoid. Rates traders are already pricing a higher probability that the Fed will cut the benchmark borrowing cost in June, restarting the so-called easing cycle that began in September last year.",Markets|Top Stories|Polymarket|Trump|Markets|recession,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 08:05:10

On Thursday, April 3, the CEX revealed that it is hosting the TGE for STO, offering market support to the token. Mentioned below are some of the key details traders and investors should know as they look to capitalize on such emerging market opportunities. Binance Reveals StakeStone’s Exclusive Token Generation Event (TGE); Here’s Everything To Know In an official announcement, Binance Wallet announced that it is hosting the StakeStone TGE on BNB Chain with PancakeSwap. The STO TGE will be held on the BNB Chain and users are urged to keep sufficient BNB tokens in their wallets in order to participate. Here’s The Start & End Date For StakeStone TGE Start Date : April 3 at 08:00 AM UTC End Date : April 3 at 08:30 AM UTC The total number of STO tokens available in this event is 50,000,000, worth 5% of the total supply. Further, the total raise amount is $1,000,000 in BNB, per the announcement. No tokens other than those mentioned are to be accepted at this event. Other Subscription Details On Binance Wallet Additionally, the top crypto exchange set the price per token at $0.02 USD in BNB. The maximum amount of Binance Coins that each user can use to subscribe STO is 3 (Subscription Cap). Token allocations are to be conducted on a pro-rata basis, considering each user’s subscription amount against the total amount collected during TGE. DEX trading for StakeStone will kick off promptly after April 3 at 08:30 UTC. Users can partake in STO DEX trading via PancakeSwap, a hotspot on BSC for trading BEP-20 tokens, and also the platform’s Wallet DEX division. This announcement has altogether kept the crypto market abuzz as the omnichain liquidity protocol born in 2023 marks a landmark achievement with its TGE. Crypto Exchange BingX Joins The Fray Another renowned cryptocurrency exchange named BingX revealed plans to add STO to its Launchpool in the interim. The exchange is offering users a zero-fee staking experience from April 2-7. Top crypto exchanges like Binance and BingX bolster the new crypto project with enhanced offerings, and market sentiments about StakeStone now glimmer with optimism. Crypto market traders and investors are eagerly awaiting further details on the matter, whilst some speculate if other exchanges will also join the fray.

Arizona is making waves in the digital asset space. The Arizona House is seriously considering a future where Bitcoin isn’t just a buzzword, but a strategic asset for the state. Two groundbreaking bills, SB1025 and SB1373, just cleared a major hurdle, passing through the House Committee of the Whole. This could be a monumental leap for Bitcoin legislation and for Arizona’s financial future. Let’s dive into what these bills are all about and what they could mean for the crypto landscape. Arizona’s Bold Move into Bitcoin Reserves According to Bitcoin Laws on X, the Arizona House Committee of the Whole has given the green light to SB1025 and SB1373. These bills are not just minor tweaks; they represent a significant shift in how a state government views and potentially utilizes cryptocurrency , specifically Bitcoin. Imagine a state not just regulating digital assets, but actively incorporating them into its financial strategy. That’s precisely what Arizona is exploring. Let’s break down each bill to understand the specifics: SB1373: Creating a Strategic Digital Asset Reserve This bill is about building a war chest of digital assets , but with a unique source. SB1373 proposes establishing a “strategic digital asset reserve.” The key here is how this reserve would be filled: with digital assets seized through criminal proceedings. Think about it – instead of just liquidating seized crypto into fiat, Arizona could be holding onto it, strategically. SB1025: Bitcoin Investment for State Funds SB1025 takes an even bolder step. It proposes allowing Arizona’s Treasury and the state retirement system to invest a portion of their funds – up to 10% – in Bitcoin . This is a significant move towards mainstream adoption at the state level. Imagine the implications if other states follow suit! Understanding Arizona’s Digital Asset Reserve Legislation (SB1373) SB1373 is particularly fascinating because it pioneers a novel approach to managing seized digital assets . Instead of immediately converting seized cryptocurrencies into traditional currency, Arizona is considering holding them as part of a strategic reserve. This reserve would be managed by the state treasurer. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Innovative Asset Management: It’s a forward-thinking approach to dealing with seized digital assets, recognizing their potential value and strategic importance. Potential Revenue Generation: Depending on market fluctuations, this reserve could potentially grow in value, offering a new revenue stream for the state in the long run. Setting a Precedent: Arizona could become the first state to establish such a reserve, setting a precedent for others to follow in managing seized cryptocurrencies. However, there are also considerations. The volatility of the crypto market means this reserve’s value could fluctuate significantly. Effective management and security of these digital assets will be crucial. Exploring Bitcoin Investment for Arizona’s Treasury (SB1025) SB1025 is arguably the more impactful bill in terms of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Allowing state institutions to invest in Bitcoin is a major endorsement of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Let’s unpack the potential implications: Diversification of State Investments: Investing in Bitcoin could offer diversification benefits to the state’s investment portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk. Exposure to a Growing Asset Class: Bitcoin has shown significant growth potential over the years. Early adoption could position Arizona to benefit from future appreciation. Attracting Crypto Businesses and Talent: Such progressive legislation could make Arizona a more attractive destination for crypto businesses and talent, boosting the state’s economy. Of course, this also comes with challenges. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and investing public funds requires careful consideration and risk management. There will be debates around the prudence of investing taxpayer money in such a volatile asset. However, the proposed 10% limit suggests a measured and cautious approach. What’s Next for Arizona’s Bitcoin Legislation? The journey for SB1025 and SB1373 isn’t over yet. Having passed the Committee of the Whole, the bills now proceed to a third reading and a final vote in the House. If they clear this hurdle, they will be sent to the Governor for signing into law. The crypto world will be watching closely. If Arizona’s Governor signs these bills, it would send a powerful message about the state’s stance on Bitcoin and digital assets. Key Takeaways: Bill Description Potential Impact SB1373 Establishes a strategic digital asset reserve from seized assets, managed by the state treasurer. Innovative asset management, potential revenue, precedent-setting for other states. SB1025 Allows Arizona’s Treasury and state retirement system to invest up to 10% in Bitcoin. Mainstream adoption, investment diversification, attracting crypto businesses, potential for growth. Why Arizona Bitcoin Legislation Matters for the Crypto World Arizona’s move is significant for several reasons: Legitimization of Bitcoin: State-level consideration of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and investment asset further legitimizes Bitcoin in the eyes of traditional finance and government. Catalyst for Broader Adoption: Arizona’s actions could inspire other states and even countries to explore similar initiatives, accelerating the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency . Economic Opportunities: Embracing Bitcoin and digital assets can position Arizona as a hub for innovation and attract investment and talent in the burgeoning crypto industry. The outcome of these bills in Arizona could be a bellwether for how governments worldwide approach Bitcoin legislation and the integration of digital assets into public finance. It’s a story worth following closely. Conclusion: Arizona Potentially Forges a Crypto-Forward Path Arizona stands at the cusp of potentially becoming a leader in state-level digital assets adoption. By advancing these groundbreaking Bitcoin reserve bills, the state is signaling a willingness to embrace innovation and explore the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies. Whether these bills become law remains to be seen, but the message is clear: the conversation around Bitcoin and its role in government finance is evolving, and Arizona is right in the thick of it. This is a development that could reshape the landscape of state finance and cryptocurrency adoption for years to come. Keep watching this space!

Initially, traders responded with optimism, pushing Bitcoin (BTC) to a session high of $88,500. However, as the full scope of the policy became clear, the market turned red, with Bitcoin sliding 2.6% to $83,300 at the time of writing. Ethereum (ETH) faced an even harsher decline, falling over 6% from $1,934 to $1,797, while the total crypto market capitalization shrank by 5.3% to $2.7 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges investor sentiment, plunged to 25—signaling “extreme fear.” Traditional markets weren’t spared either. The S&P 500 wiped out over $2 trillion in market value in just minutes, reflecting the broader economic uncertainty triggered by the tariff escalation . Traders Brace for More Volatility Market analysts believe the initial crypto rally was driven by traders welcoming an end to uncertainty. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, described the reaction as “uncertainty relief,” quickly followed by sell-offs as investors grasped the broader economic implications. “On BTC Markets, trading volume surged 46% as local traders scrambled to reposition. Big players took profit on the spike, while smaller investors hesitated,” Lucas explained. She warned that any retaliatory tariffs from China or the European Union could trigger another round of panic selling. Despite the downturn, investors await signals from major economies on whether they will respond with countermeasures. Will Tariffs Bring Long-Term Crypto Market Stability? Some experts suggest that while the immediate reaction was negative, the clarity provided by Trump’s announcement could stabilize markets in the long run. David Hernandez, a crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, noted that institutions may take advantage of current price dips. “Although the tariff rates were slightly higher than expected, the announcement provided much-needed clarity on the scope and scale of the policy,” Hernandez said. “Markets thrive on certainty, and with speculation now largely removed, institutional investors may see an opportunity over the coming days to take advantage of compressed valuations.” As global markets digest the news , much will depend on how countries like China, Japan, and South Korea respond.

42843270,https://nulltx.com/?p=147690,1743671127,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Tracking Developer Activity: The Crypto Projects Leading Innovation,https://nulltx.com/tracking-developer-activity-the-crypto-projects-leading-innovation/,"In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a project’s development team holds the key to its success. Yes, we can talk about favorable market conditions, increasing rates of adoption, and strong user demand. These factors, in association with underlying project technology, seem to dictate the short- and long-term success of a cryptocurrency project. But when the dust settles, what really seems to count in the developer-centric cryptocurrency world is “developer activity.” Any blockchain project needs developers to survive and thrive. They are the ones who write the code that runs decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and the blockchain’s main infrastructure. Even though a strong, active developer community is a necessary component, it is not a sufficient condition for a project to succeed. From a business strategy perspective, a project has more chance of succeeding when there is an engaged community of developers. By measuring the kind of and amount of work that gets done by a project’s developers, it is possible to gauge its potential. Bearing this in mind, let us examine more closely the leading crypto undertakings that are exerting the most significant influence on GitHub, as measured by developer activity worth mentioning that has occurred over the last month. Top Crypto Projects by Developer Activity 1. Dfinity ($ICP) Leading the charge in development activity over the past month is Dfinity’s Internet Computer ($ICP). The project has soared to the top, showing a marked increase in development activity. Dfinity aims to revolutionize how the internet functions by creating a decentralized cloud platform. The active contributions from developers indicate a strong and innovative foundation, with ongoing work to improve the project’s capabilities. Dfinity’s ranking as the top project for development activity highlights its growing influence in the blockchain and decentralized internet space. 2. Chainlink ($LINK) Just behind Dfinity, Chainlink ($LINK) keeps a solid hold as a front-runner in the crypto development arena. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network is a vital piece of infrastructure for the larger blockchain ecosystem. Developers keep moving forward with upgrades that make their integration with smart contracts across many blockchains even better. This project has such importance in the DeFi ecosystem and is so central to the continued evolution of smart contracts that it’s hard to see how it wouldn’t keep placing highly in any such rankings. 3. StarkNet ($STRK) StarkNet, Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solution, has received a lot of attention in the past month and now sits in third place on our list. With Ethereum’s persistent scalability problems, StarkNet offers an excellent potential solution, enabling much greater throughput and significantly reduced transaction costs—without problematizing security. Its developers appear to be concentrating their energies on writing better zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) code, helping StarkNet itself to scale efficiently. From a developer’s activity standpoint, StarkNet looks like a very serious contender in the camp of Ethereum’s future scalability solutions. 4. Optimism (OP) Optimism (OP), another prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, saw a dip in development activity this month, moving down the ranks. Although its ranking has decreased slightly, the project still plays a significant role in improving Ethereum’s scalability through optimistic rollups. Optimism’s developers continue to enhance its platform, which reduces Ethereum’s transaction fees and boosts processing speeds. Despite its recent drop, Optimism remains a strong project with potential for future growth and innovation. 5. Cardano ($ADA) A front-runner once in blockchain development, Cardano ($ADA) has seen a decline in developer activity that has translated into a drop in the rankings this month. While the project’s academic, research-driven approach to blockchain technology wins it significant applause, the development pace has come in for some criticism. Slow and steady is the way some see its development progress, but it lags behind a few competitors that seem to be advancing to greater heights more quickly. Carrying on tonight, the project does pursue some praiseworthy goals. Future efficiency in dApp operation and some greater adoption of dApps in the ecosystem are two that’s wished for. To get there, an increased pace in the delivery of dApp developments and increased efficiency in those dApps might help. 6. iExec ($RLC) iExec ($RLC), a decentralized cloud computing network, has seen a surge in developer activity, moving up the rankings in the last 30 days. The project allows users to access computing power in a decentralized manner and provides a variety of services across enterprises, developers, and researchers. And as real-world blockchain applications continue to multiply, iExec’s decentralized cloud computing offers a more pertinent solution today than even just a few months ago. 7. Ethereum ($ETH) The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum ($ETH) maintains a high level of developer activity. As the primary smart contract platform, it remains a foundational pillar in the blockchain space. Recent work focuses on its transition to Ethereum 2.0, including the shift to proof-of-stake consensus and scalability improvements. Ongoing development is critical not only for the network but for the entire crypto ecosystem as it continues to evolve and accommodate more complex decentralized applications. 8. Avalanche ($AVAX) Avalanche ($AVAX) has experienced a significant upsurge in developer engagement and moved up in the rankings this month. The blockchain platform, which is meant to have high throughput and low latency, could be a good choice for developers who want to build decentralized applications or enterprise solutions. Avalanche’s ability to support customizable blockchains—”subnets,” in Avalanche lingo—means it can likely find a place in a number of interesting applications across different sectors. 9. Polkadot ($DOT) & Kusama ($KSM) Polkadot ($DOT) and Kusama ($KSM) are two closely related projects that focus on multi-chain interoperability. Both of these projects have dropped in the rankings because their developer activity has declined. Yet, the technology that underpins these networks allows for more types of data and assets to be moved across different kinds of chains than any other network. So if you’re worried about the downward slide of these two projects in the rankings, you shouldn’t be. Here are crypto's top overall coins by notable development activity the past 30 days. Directional indicators represent each project's ranking rise or fall since last month: 1) @dfinity $ICP 2) @chainlink $LINK 3) @starknet $STRK 4) @optimism $OP 5)… pic.twitter.com/wCk80VfRW8 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 1, 2025 Conclusion: Developer Activity Reflects Future Success Measuring developer activity is an extremely important and effective way to gauge the future potential of any crypto project. A developer community that is very active almost always leads to a project that is getting ongoing improvements and new innovations, which are key to the long-term success of any project. When I look at the projects Dfinity, Chainlink, and StarkNet, I see something in common: all three are getting ongoing, very active development, which is the first, key ingredient in creating the kinds of robust, scalable solutions that can really thrive in the fast-changing blockchain landscape. While blockchain technology is busy turning industries upside down, the projects that are most likely to gain and hold market share are the ones with vibrant development teams. In the cryptocurrency space, keeping a close watch on the development activity of various projects can help reveal which are ascendant and which have plateaued. Here, we’ve ranked—and color-coded—30 blockchain projects based on their development activity over the last month. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42843343,https://nulltx.com/?p=147691,1743671248,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bybit Recovers Strongly from February Hack as Capital Inflow Soars in March,https://nulltx.com/bybit-recovers-strongly-from-february-hack-as-capital-inflow-soars-in-march/,"Bybit has made a remarkable turnaround after suffering a high-profile hack in February. Its capital inflow in March was nothing short of impressive. Data from DeFiLlama shows that Bybit’s capital inflow in March reached an astonishing $3.61 billion, the highest among all centralized exchanges (CEXs) for the month. This, obviously, is a significant recovery for the platform and a testament to probably effective crisis management. 1. Retrieving lost capital after a hack is a difficult task for any exchange. 2. Most hacked exchanges tend to either collapse completely or exist in a zombie state. 3. Even the hacked CEX in question (in this case, Bybit) has managed to hang on to a fair amount of customer trust. 4. This article will explore the implications of Bybit’s recovery. After a tough few weeks following the hack, Bybit is coming back strong. The hack was bad, of course—the breach in security that led to the theft of user funds was never going to be an easy thing to deal with. But if a company can manage a life-threatening event and come out strong on the other side, there will surely be many Bybit loyalists living in a world where they can feel normal again. And with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surging, Bybit may very well be back in play. Bybit’s Recovery Plan: Transparency and Asset Reserves After the hack, Bybit took immediate and decisive action to manage the crisis. One of the key aspects of Bybit’s recovery strategy was its commitment to being transparent. The exchange quickly shared detailed updates with its users about the situation and the steps being taken to rectify the breach. In an effort to ensure that customer funds were fully protected, Bybit emphasized something very important—its asset-sharing—a concept that corresponds 1:1 with every user deposit. This was, for a good number of users, a very reassuring communication strategy. Bybit shared updates, gave some specialized interviews, and kept on communicating. This was almost a “overcommunication” strategy—lots of users who might have been teetering on the edge of returning to the site got this honesty as a confidence boost. Besides transparency, Bybit prioritized recovering the stolen funds. The security team at the company worked day and night tracing the pilfered assets and collaborating, where necessary, with authorities to identify the bad guys. This effort also helped with user reassurance. Moreover, Bybit took proactive measures to manage the fallout from the hack by supervising 350,000 withdrawal requests that had built up during the uncertain time. The handling of this situation allowed users who wanted to access their funds to do so quickly and without extra hassle. Going into damage control mode with this process helped Bybit fix its reputation enough to concentrate on the recovery from the breach. DeFiLama shows that after being hacked in February, Bybit's capital inflow in March reached $3.61 billion, ranking first among all CEXs, indicating that its customers are returning after the hack. Binance's inflow in March was $3.545 billion, ranking second. Currently, the total… pic.twitter.com/mstyw3SZ13 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 1, 2025 March Inflow: A Strong Showing from Bybit Bybit’s successful recovery was most clearly illustrated in March when the exchange saw a whopping influx of capital. With $3.61 billion in capital inflow, Bybit led all centralized exchanges, even ahead of Binance, which saw an inflow of $3.545 billion in the same time frame. The fact that Bybit managed to attract this enormous amount of new capital, in spite of the hack it experienced earlier in the year, is a pretty strong testament to the platform’s resilience and the way it has managed to reassure its users. Bybit has total capital inflows of $15.133 billion—indicative of both its recovery and continued growth. Those figures suggest that not only is the user base returning, but there’s renewed trust in operations and security. Given the volatile nature of the crypto space and the heightened risks associated with exchange hacks, Bybit’s performance (in capital inflows, at least) is all the more impressive. Binance’s Strong Position Amid Bybit’s Recovery Even though Bybit had impressive inflows in March, it wasn’t the only exchange experiencing that trend. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, also had a strong inflow of $3.545 billion in March, landing it in second place, just behind Bybit. This suggests that, despite the competition from exchanges like Bybit, users still trust Binance and are sending it a significant amount of capital. Trust in centralized exchanges appears to be growing, as evidenced by the large inflows seen by both Binance and Bybit in March. These inflows occurred just months after a significant security breach at Bybit, yet they indicate an intrinsic, upward trust trend for both platforms. This upward trust trend underscores the ability of both platforms to maintain user confidence, even when strong evidence points to possible, user-destroying security vulnerabilities in the places where users hold their crypto. The space between the two platforms is made clear by the finding that, in fact, there is no space—the ability of the two platforms to maintain confidence just might be a `crypto` manager’s textbook illustration of how to handle a breach, by being open and transparent. Looking Ahead: A Competitive Landscape The competitive structure of the centralized exchange market is changing while Bybit recovers from the hack. Binance and Bybit are both doing very well, yet Bybit’s sharp recovery is a clear sign that it is not only back but also looking to capture market share. If the platform can keep improving its fortifications and maintain a fundamentally sound, super transparent way of dealing with user troubles, that’s a good sign for it in terms of strength, stability, and position in the market. Additionally, the March data sheds light on the user trust in the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem. Exchanges that offer not just innovative products and services but also the security and transparency users demand will likely be the ones that thrive in the long run. Bybit’s recovery serves as a model for how exchanges can bounce back from such security incidents, with a laser focus on asset reserves, clear and concise communication with users, and a quick response to user needs. The market is changing. How other world exchanges will adapt to the increasing demand for safe, easy-to-use platforms remains to be seen. But today, Bybit’s impressive resurgence makes it about as close to a guaranteed thing as you can get in this market. It is a testament to the platform’s resilience and the regained trust of the platform’s user base. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42843407,https://nulltx.com/?p=147692,1743671367,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Movements in the Memecoin Market: April 1st, 2025",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-movements-in-the-memecoin-market-april-1st-2025/,"The memecoin market continues to draw in capital from both retail and institutional investors, and the latest on-chain metrics indicate it’s a market in which to pay attention. On April 1, 2025, Memecoin Central, aka the Chainlink, saw a trending increase of what seems to be memecoiners reinforcing their conviction to the hilarious, highly volatile, and oh-so-speculative nature of these tokens. According to on-chain analytical data, recorded for the sake of due diligence, the memecoin market, on the whole, was very much pumping on that day, with a net inbound volume of inflows outweighing the volume of outflows by the amount of $2.3 million. April 1st Inflow and Outflow Trends On April 1, the total trading volume in the memecoin space came to $5.1 million. With a net inflow of $2.3 million, this means there was significant movement within the memecoin market. Yet despite this action, the market sentiment appeared skewed towards accumulation and buying, not the profit-taking, sell-side activity that usually coincides with pronounced bullish trends. Intelligent capital—that is often used to mean institutional or, at the very least, well-informed investors—appeared to be making strategic moves, and it was concentrating its efforts (and its cash) on a few specific ones in particular. It was these specific memecoins that were attracting the attention of investors in this intelligent capital category. Key Memecoins Drawing Inflows On April 1st, several tokens attracted significant investments, signaling perhaps a trend of future price action. One of those investments was FARTCOIN, which saw $1.5 million flow into it. Given the nature of the token, one might interpret this seriously speculative bet as some sort of comment on large investors’ mental health. But there is no denying that FARTCOIN is a token that exists, and the investment world is one in which the speculative pricing of assets holds sway. GOAT, another memecoin, received an inflow of $267,000 that was more moderate but still significant. The inflow into this token, which is known for its strong community base, could indicate that smart money investors are positioning themselves in the expectation of price movements that often accompany tokens driven by their communities. GRASS also got a look, with $211,000 flowing into it. And here, too, the upward trend of inflow might suggest that investors are diversifying their portfolios in the memecoin space and trying to grab hold of multiple tokens— integral to this movement— with small but important communities. Even smaller-scale projects such as POPCAT ($136,000) and E/ACC ($65,000) attracted investment, indicating that capital is seeking the next breakout project, the next speculative event, in that way reminiscent of the memecoin market. This overall trend among these tokens seems to signal a mix of larger, well-established projects (like GOAT, a project we couldn’t quite figure out, and the comprehensively humorous FARTCOIN) and smaller, more niche projects (like POPCAT, a project whose very name elicits the kind of laughter economists like to pretend is only found in the playground) that are comfortable bets for future growth. Memecoins Experiencing Outflows Despite some tokens attracting substantial amounts of capital, there were also several that were experiencing outflows. Memecoins like CHEX (-$27,000), SOBA (-$16,000), and STINKDEX (-$30,000) all saw minor outflows. If nothing else, these seem to show that investor confidence in these tokens has waned somewhat, as otherwise there should be sufficient buy-side support to prevent even minor sell-offs. But what might be behind these small sell-offs? Possible answers include reduced market interest, lower engagement from the communities that support these projects, or simple profit-taking by early holders. The outflow from TITCOIN (-$34,000) and TRUMP (-$33,000) may suggest that certain investors are moving away from projects that are possibly losing their initial luster or are facing declining market sentiment. This may reflect the cyclical nature of the memecoin market, where interest can quickly fade, leading to sharp price declines and subsequent outflows. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 01/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $3.7M Outflow: $1.4M Volume: $5.1M Net Volume: $2.3M There was inflow into: $POPCAT ($136K) $GRASS ($211K) $GOAT ($267K) #FARTCOIN ($1.5M) #E /ACC… pic.twitter.com/EuTQwaqKQo — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 2, 2025 The Current Landscape of Memecoin Investing The memecoin market is acknowledged for its instability, where tokens may face wild price changes, usually driven by the project’s community or social media hype. On the 1st of April, the net inflow into FARTCOIN, GOAT, and other speculative assets was still very much in the positive, showing that people seem to still want to throw money at things they cannot comprehend. For investors—especially the savvy kind—the endgame is clear: secure a spot in projects poised for serious profits. And in the case of FARTCOIN, GOAT, and GRASS, these ones show some promise of being not just past but also future performers in the memecoin market. They could, in short, be described as potential Chads. And smart investors seem to have unfurled the red carpet for them and these other tokens, seeking them out in spaces populated by not just one but two active communities, and in the process flooding their prices with what in some quarters could be described as borderline illegal levels of hype. Conversely, the outflows from tokens such as TITCOIN and TRUMP reflect the rapid changes in investor sentiment that memecoins often experience. They show how fast capital can depart from these speculative assets, particularly when the market decides to shift its momentum or when other tokens start to command more attention. Looking Ahead: What Does the Data Tell Us? The data from April 1st gives a fascinating look at the memecoin market’s dynamics. This is because there was a very strong net inflow. So it suggests that, at least for the moment, there’s more optimism than pessimism in the market. But it’s also important to remember that this is a very speculative asset class. So any sudden shift in the market or doubts about future growth can quickly turn this optimism into a memecoin market that’s not so merry. For those who are keen on investing in this area, it would be prudent to watch the significant inflows and outflows, because they yield good insights into which tokens have momentum behind them and which ones are, for lack of a better term, going sideways. The memecoin market is very much in flux. Keeping a healthy skepticism about the on-chain data and where the smart money is flowing and just trying to make sense of it all is going to be an imperative for making good decisions in this space. To sum up, the money coming into certain memecoins indicates that some tokens are drawing in the kinds of institutional and speculative investors that, in recent years, have made traditional assets like art and sports collectibles more valuable. It’s a sign, to be sure, that what is in a token’s smart contract or underlying project matters less to many of its buyers than the sheer fun—and potential profits—of it all.

Among the performers in the recent Solana ecosystem is Titcoin ($TITCOIN), which in terms of both the holder count and whale accumulation is showing growth that is hard to believe given how short a time it has actually spent existing. Titcoin is in fact a coin that is coming up so fast, in the narrative of Solana tokens, that it has a good chance of becoming one of the go-to memecoins in that ecosystem. Titcoin’s Rapid Holder Growth As per the information from StalkChain, within a mere 17 hours, the number of people holding Titcoin swelled by an amazing 24.69%, going from 13,788 holders to 17,192. This added a substantial 3,404 new holders to Titcoin’s ranks in practically no time at all. At a conservative estimate, Titcoin was adding close to 200 new holders per hour during this stretch. What’s going on here? The rapid rise in the number of holders indicates a growing community that is actively participating in the Titcoin ecosystem. It seems like #Titcoin is one the fastest growing memecoin on sol in terms of holders count 17 hours ago, the holders count was 13,788 Atm, the holders count is 17,192 About 3,404 new holders have been added The holder count grew by 24.69% in the last 17 hours. That's pretty… pic.twitter.com/a5LjOwLYbJ — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 2, 2025 For many investors in the crypto space, the number of holders is an important metric, as it can be an early signal of a coin’s popularity and potential for further growth. The rising holder count suggests that Titcoin has expanded its reach and successfully captured the attention of a broader audience, with new investors in the crypto space optimistic about its prospects. Whale Accumulation: A Bullish Signal for Titcoin Titcoin is not just witnessing a rapid increase in holders; it is also seeing a serious uptick in whale accumulation. This is often interpreted as a very bullish sign in the crypto market. Large investors or “whales” can obviously move a market with their buying. Their accumulation of a particular token can be interpreted as a sign of confidence in its future potential. In the realm of Titcoin, various wallets have quickly amassed significant quantities of the cryptocurrency. For instance, Wallet Fb96 has secured nearly 75 grand of Titcoin. 9XUX is banking on it too, and has beefed up its holdings by around $12,000. E9n6 has gone the DCA route, and set up a strategy to pick up the crypto at various points on the price curve; hence, it already has a $9,000 grip on Titcoin. And Wallet DBV1 unexpectedly threw down around $29,730 worth of the largely unknown crypto. In total, these four wallets have supposedly hoovered up something like $124,730 worth of Titcoin in under two hours. These whales are buying up and holding onto Titcoin. Strong belief in the token’s future performance (a.k.a. its price) seems to be what Whale #1 is going on in all three Tits above. Insights of whale accumulation in $TITCOIN Wallet Fb96 accumulated $74k worth of tokens Wallet 9XUX accumulated $12k Wallet E9n6 opened a DCA and has already accumulated 9k worth of tokens wallet DBV1 accumulated $29.73k These whales have accumulated a total of $124,730 worth… pic.twitter.com/PfNXELBYfB — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 2, 2025 Whale could either expect the token to go up in price or might just be buying it up now because they believe in what seems like a very promising project. In any case, if the whales keep this sort of buying up and holding on of the token (aka ‘HODLing,’ in crypto lingo), then certainly increased price action (i.e., the token going up in price) will be in play. Caution: The Importance of Watching for Profit-Taking Even though whale accumulation is often taken as a sign that a token’s price is about to rise, we must also watch for profit-taking by those whales when they sell. Since whales can and do move a token’s price, if a big holder starts selling off a big chunk of their position, it can lead to a nice, sharp price drop. If the whales who have been accumulating Titcoin since its inception start to sell and take profits, then you could very well see an imminent price drop associated with the same kind of sell-off that would be triggered if the founders sold their shares, with the price supported only for as long as the next set of whales continue to buy. What’s Driving Titcoin’s Growth? Titcoin’s swift growth in the number of holders and in whale accumulation can be traced to some factors. As a memecoin, Titcoin gets some of the broader hype and speculative interest associated with the memecoin market. However, what appears to set Titcoin apart is its performance within Solana, the blockchain on which Titcoin runs, which is noted for its high speed and low transaction costs. The Solana network has emerged as an important player in the crypto space. Its scalability could be adding to the Titcoin’s attractiveness. Enthusiasm and loyalty characterize the memecoin community. If Titcoin has succeeded in building a community of such ardent supporters, that might account for the high rate at which new holders are coming aboard. Community projects of all kinds—meme, DEFI, or otherwise—often experience the kind of viral growth that seems to be the inalienable right of anything with the word token or coin appended to it. And such projects often hedge their bets by hitting up retail traders and investors seeking the next big thing. Future Outlook for Titcoin Suggesting the very rapid growth in holder count and the increasing accumulation of large investors (“whales”) that Titcoin, the current meme coin darling, is well-positioned to appreciate further in price, especially if the recent momentum continues. But, as with any similar cryptocurrency, the future of Titcoin will depend largely on market sentiment, the ongoing engagement of its community, and the actions of major investors. Investors’ main takeaway should be one of cautious optimism. The activity of whales might well indicate a solid and confident base for Titcoin that is genuinely invested in its development and potential. But these same whales could also serve as a dangerous fault line in Titcoin’s price if they ever decide to start taking profits. All in all, Titcoin’s future is, as of now, uncertain and highly dependent upon what type of community investment it can rally to maintain its meme momentum. To sum up, Titcoin has shown fast growth in both the number of its holders and the accumulation of whales, indicating that it is a memecoin with potential. It remains to be seen whether it can keep building on what appears to be some real momentum and sidestep the usual ups and downs of such coins. But for now, it’s certainly a Titcoin worth watching.

FDUSD has been a key source of liquidity for several of Binance’s trading pairs. FDUSD, a stablecoin specifically issued for trading pairs on Binance, is back above $0.99, almost regaining its $1 peg. The token, which has so far remained reliable, had a de-pegging event, sinking as low as $0.87. FDUSD regained its peg after causing market instability in its main pair with BTC. | Source: Coingecko The immediate reason for the de-peg is a statement by TRON’s founder, Justin Sun. He claimed the stablecoin issuer, First Digital Trust, was insolvent and incapable of honoring FDUSD redemptions. This led to market panic and the immediate chaotic dip of the stablecoin. First Digital Trust debunked those claims, but not before seeing FDUSD suffer the effect of the market panic. In a social media statement, First Digital Trust claimed all issued stablecoins are backed by traceable T-bills and other assets. The company also stated it would seek legal action against Sun for the smear campaign. The recent allegations by Justin Sun against First Digital Trust are completely false. This dispute is with TUSD and not with $FDUSD . First Digital is completely solvent. Every dollar backing $FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US backed T-Bills. The… — First Digital (@FirstDigitalHQ) April 2, 2025 The probable reason for Sun’s attack is that FDT was at one point responsible for the backing of TrueUSD (TUSD). The asset turned insolvent, requiring Sun to bail it out with $450M of his own funds. Sun’s involvement with TUSD was documented by a Hong Kong court, which is now investigating the stablecoin’s backing. FDT has been accused of not providing sufficient oversight of TUSD’s reserves. FDT was supposed to be in charge of the stablecoin’s treasury after Techteryx acquired the stablecoin project from its founder, TrueCoin. However, there is currently no direct evidence that FDUSD is facing a similar situation or that its reserves are limited. Binance itself carries FDUSD reserves in excess of user claims, with a 111.07% ratio. FDUSD is mostly tied to Binance’s demand Demand for FDUSD issuance mostly comes from Binance, which is often the sole recipient of new mints and redemptions. The supply of FDUSD peaked in April 2024, just before the spring and summer Bitcoin (BTC) rally. FDUSD was mostly deployed to a leading BTC pair, making up over 34% of the token’s volume. The other big market is the swapping pair FDUSD/USDT, which allows traders to move between stablecoins. FDUSD is mostly available to international clients, as it has been removed as an option for EU-based traders. FDUSD also offers additional perks and programs on Binance for its holders. FDUSD is also used as liquidity for multiple leading coins and tokens, including BNB, SOL, DOGE, and XRP. FDUSD is also one of the eligible assets for participation in launch pools and other limited token sale events. Recently, Binance started phasing out FDUSD from launch pools, offering alternative stablecoins for participation. While the token has received criticism for being too centralized, it has so far worked well for its role on Binance. In the past, BTC and other market rallies have been tied to increased issuance of FDUSD. The token has a circulating supply of just 2.5B, though its daily trading volume is over $7.78B. Despite its limited supply, FDUSD is extremely influential due to its representation on Binance and is a key source of liquidity during market rallies. Wintermute moves in to buy FDUSD The leading market maker, Wintermute, moved in with a new purchase as FDUSD de-pegged. The known Wintermute wallets hold over 38M FDUSD after the latest withdrawal of over 31M tokens from Binance. Based on the market maker’s purchase at around $0.90, Wintermute possibly made up to $3M in earnings after FDUSD recovered. Additionally, the traders on the BTC/FDUSD pair saw the price climb to $99,000 based on stablecoin valuations, opening a brief opportunity to lock in higher gains, but only if FDUSD moved closer to its $1 peg. This makes Wintermute one of the leading holders, with wallets almost competing with some of Binance’s vaults. FDUSD is mostly used on the centralized market but has spread to DeFi protocols. Some of the supply has flowed into Kamino Finance, and some of the stablecoins are flowing into Raydium. The stablecoin is also used on the PancakeSwap DEX, one of the main BSC markets. The stablecoin is held in a little over 39K wallets and has not caused mass panic with more long-lasting trading under $1.

As the price of Solana swung about, a portion of supply that had been just sitting there took a hike and freed up some not-so-profits; a nearby cohort, however, used the opportunity of the Solana swing to make some good ol’ purchases, dragging us back toward the levels of support we found in early 2023. Shifts in Supply Distribution: Profit-Taking and Support Strengthening Over the span of these two weeks, Solana’s price moved up and down. Significantly, the token’s price hit a peak of $147.49. But the how and why of the price movement provide some clues as to what we might expect in the near future—especially when considering the supply distribution patterns of the token. And for context, this behavior pattern hasn’t just been confined to Solana; several other large-cap altcoins have exhibited similar actions. Between Mar 19 and Mar 31, the share of $SOL supply last moved at: $123.89 rose from 3.69% to 3.73% $144.54 rose from 4.2% to 4.5% $147.49 fell from 2.08% to 1.98% This suggests some profit-taking or distribution near recent highs, with supply migrating into lower cost… https://t.co/WEknpNF77N pic.twitter.com/STW2nMfhHb — glassnode (@glassnode) April 1, 2025 At the upper end of the scale, the amount of Solana at the $123.89 price level increased from 3.69% to 3.73%. More of the tokens were situated there in this latest time frame than in the previous one. This obviously speaks to some kind of accumulation or holding pattern at that price level. And as a next step in the deductive reasoning here, it seems to speak to confidence in the price itself and in Solana’s performance around that price level. At the $144.54 level, the share of Solana’s supply moved up from 4.2% to 4.5%. This seems to reflect some level of price accumulation at this range, as investors capitalize on the recent bullish price action and establish themselves well ahead of what looks to be some key resistance levels. What this means structurally is that there is likely a wide net of Solana holders positioned just beneath recent highs, maintaining buy-side interest as prices rise. Not all price points appeared to be seeing accumulation. At $147.49, Solana’s supply dipped a bit from 2.08% to 1.98%. This indicated that a bit of profit taking was probably happening as Solana’s price was nearing its recent highs. Supply at this price point dropped, and it seemed that some investors who had been long Solana at much lower price points were cashing out as the price appreciated. This is also a critical indicator of sentiment and behavior within the Solana investor base. A supply drop at this level also potentially presages a distribution phase, where the base of investors holding Solana is decreasing. Key resistance levels ahead for #Solana $SOL : • $135.70 • $144.40 • $165.20 Watch these closely! Clearing each could signal a strong continuation of the uptrend. pic.twitter.com/JDjWtOjUep — Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2025 Solana’s Strengthening Support Levels Even with the profit-taking and distribution taking place at recent highs, Solana’s price has a solid support structure at the current range’s lower bounds. This is good for investors and traders, as it suggests that the price levels toward the lower bounds of the range are increasingly being viewed as attractive by buyers. Support at these lower levels is vital for the price of Solana maintaining any semblance of stability because it prevents the price from plummeting further during times of volatility. Solana can hold its value pretty well within this range, which gives off the impression that buyers are still quite interested at these levels. This kind of stability almost gives the sense that the token has found its footing. It almost makes one wonder if it’s now going to be just a case of whether buyers are going to keep showing up at these levels for Solana to structure favorably for continued upside. Price stays above key support levels? Then the bulls have a way more favorable setup! Key Resistance Levels: The Path Ahead for Solana In terms of near-term price movement, Solana has significant resistance ahead that it must overcome. The first resistance level is around $135.70. If Solana can push up through here and maintain upward price pressure, it would signify not just an uptrend resuming, but quite likely an ending to Solana’s recent consolidation period. The next main level of resistance is at $144.40, which is near where Solana has run into selling pressure lately. A sustained move above this level seems necessary to confirm Solana has the strength to keep pushing higher. If the price can break through this resistance, it might be signaling the potential for some further gains. The price level to watch is $165.20. This point represents a big obstacle for Solana, and getting beyond it would almost certainly mean the continuation of the uptrend, with Solana’s price potentially heading toward new all-time highs. The chart below shows Solana aiming to overcome not only $165.20 but also a series of resistance levels above that threshold. Charting Solana over the past several months reveals something of a macro get-above-and-stay-above pattern. Conclusion: Watch for Key Price Movements As Solana’s market keeps evolving, the balance between support and resistance will be a crucial factor in determining the digital asset’s next price moves. Recent changes in the distribution of supply suggest that investors are busy reconfiguring their positions at various price points—some heading for the exits, and some buying in. Recent price action suggests that Solana is holding strong support at lower price levels, which is encouraging, given that much of the token’s recent activity has seen it holding parallel trend lines. For traders and investors, the key levels to watch are the $135.70, $144.40, and $165.20 resistance zones. If these levels are surpassed, it could indicate that Solana is moving into a much more pronounced uptrend. On the other hand, if Solana were to reverse back down, the zones would be crucial in determining how long Solana’s price may confine itself before it either elects a new uptrend or downtrend.

Today’s market experienced what may well be one of the largest options block trades executed in some time—an enormous purchase of put options set to expire on April 25, 2025. These options, over 1,000 BTC worth, have yet again brought to the fore the looming question for any market concerned about such an event: Bitcoin’s future price direction. And not insubstantially, seeing as this transaction, valued at nearly $100 million, seems to speak with a pretty loud and bearish voice. A Deep Dive into the Largest Block Trade The day’s largest block deal concerned the purchase of put options at a $60,000 strike price. These options will not expire until almost two years from now, in April 2025. The deal amassed more than 1,000 BTC, with a notional value well in excess of $100 million. This huge buy could represent an extreme form of risk hedging (not likely) or highly leveraged speculation (more likely), with the buyer positioning for a big decline in Bitcoin’s price. To turn a profit on this trade, the price of Bitcoin would have to tumble by more than 30% from its current perch. Due to the volatility that’s part and parcel of the crypto market, such a move is far from impossible. Still, it would take a big shift in market sentiment to make it happen. Bitcoin is currently trading at well over $60,000, making this a deep out-of-the-money (OTM) option and paying approximately $100,000 for the privilege to hedge in this way seems, at first, to not be a very cost-effective approach. BTC Options Block Daily Report Today's Largest Block Today's largest options Block trade was the purchase of BTC puts expiring April 25, 2025, with a strike price of $60,000, accumulating more than 1,000 BTC, with a notional face value of nearly $100 million, and a deep… — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) April 2, 2025 Risk-Return Ratio: A Cautious Approach Even though the size and the scale of this trade have caught the eyes of market observers, it’s important to note the risk-return ratio for this particular block trade is quite low. It’s a big trade, and the trade is quite likely a hedge in part, quite possibly for a major Bitcoin bull who needs protection while he/she’s fully invested. More likely than not, this block purchase is part of a broader downside risk management strategy. For institutional investors, trades of this magnitude often function as protective positions within their portfolios. It is probable that they are using put options as an insurance policy against potential market declines, given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. This hedging strategy is ostensibly designed to offer some level of protection in the event of a sharp correction or a sustained bearish trend. The premium paid, while high, may be considered by some an acceptable cost for the risk management cover that such an unpredictable market demands. Bearish Sentiment Gains Ground Besides this large block trade, the overall Bitcoin options market indicates a shift toward bearish sentiment. In the previous month, our major institutional players have become net buyers of put options. This is a sign that these types of investors are positioning themselves for a downturn in Bitcoin’s price. In other words, they believe its current value is unsustainable and are profiting from fall. What is particularly notable is that these trades are occurring after the end of the quarterly delivery period. Are those market participants not adjusting their positions in the way they usually do when we move from one quarter to the next? If not, why not? The conclusion of the quarter is often a point at which market participants recalibrate their positions based on any new information that might be affecting the market. Protective Positions and Growing Hesitation While Bitcoin holds firm in the market, it looks as though caution is surfacing among investors. The protective positions now being taken speak volumes about the current sentiment, which is clearly shifting away from the previous ‘all systems go’ as we were rocketing into price discovery kind of vibe. One of the most obvious signs is the regular purchase of huge blocks of put options, which, when you look at the notional amounts involved, seem to indicate a lot of concern. This careful outlook has become much more distinct in recent days, when market participants have started to accept that Bitcoin’s price could, indeed, see significant challenges over the next few months. What has us so concerned, and in such a deep deflationary state of mind? Well, it’s a few different factors informing our judgment at the moment. First, we’re well aware that the use of put options among institutional investors has been on the rise. And this is significant, because it suggests the mindset of many institutional investors has shifted from buy-and-hold to being much more prepper-like. Conclusion: A Market on Edge The market for options on Bitcoin is giving off strong signals that investor sentiment is becoming more and more negative. Today’s big block trade, along with the upswing in the broader trend of activity in put options, underscores this bearishness. Even if these trades might just reflect some new risk management protocols being put in place by institutional investors—rather than a complete pivot to bearish speculation—the growing concern being expressed certainly seems noteworthy. For put option traders and investors, the way of using put options is on the rise. That’s a warning sign. It means a lot of folks expect Bitcoin’s price to have some significant challenges in the near term. And we’re not talking about the short, short term. These put traders are hanging on to their options for months, or buying them for months and gifting them to their friends. Put options allow you to hedge against a downturn, which is what many seem to be doing. And Bitcoin’s put-call ratio-often used as a barometer of market sentiment-has risen to its highest level in over a year. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a new blog post, Hayes says that Fed chair Jerome Powell’s recent comments on monetary policy indicate market liquidity will start to increase, which has ignited massive Bitcoin rallies in the past. According to Hayes, the Fed will start to transition from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE), beginning with its policy on US Treasury bonds. QE is a monetary policy used by central banks to prop up the economy by printing more money to accumulate financial assets. New money flows into the financial system, boosting spending and investments. “Powell proved last [month] that fiscal dominance is alive and well. Therefore, I am confident QT, at least regarding Treasuries, will stop in the short to medium term. Going further, Powell stated that while the Fed may maintain mortgage back security runoff, it will net buy Treasuries. Mathematically, that keeps the Fed balance sheet constant; however, that is Treasury QE. Bitcoin will scream higher once this is formally announced. Furthermore, because the banks and the Treasury demand it, the Fed will grant the SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio) exemption for the banks, which is another form of Treasury QE.” Hayes believes Bitcoin remains on track to hit $250,000 by the year’s end if the Fed shifts to QE. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from QT to QE for Treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end. Of course, this is not an exact science, but using the gold example, if I had to place a bet on whether I thought Bitcoin would hit $76,500 or $110,000 first, I would bet on the latter. Even if US stocks continue falling in reaction to tariffs, a collapse in earnings expectations, and or foreigner demand waning, I am confident that the odds favor Bitcoin continuing to climb higher.” Bitcoin is trading for $82,702 at time of writing, down 3.2% in the last 24 hours.

42843682,https://nulltx.com/?p=147696,1743671785,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum On-Chain Data Analysis: A Critical Fork for Holders,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-on-chain-data-analysis-a-critical-fork-for-holders/,"Starting April 1, 2025, Ethereum (ETH) is in a risky spot, with a big chunk of its holders apparently underwater. The latest on-chain data show that only 25% of Ethereum holders are currently in profit at current prices, with an incredible 74% sitting on unrealized losses. This paints a potentially dire situation, suggesting the market is at a tipping point where it could go either way, with holders either giving up or re-upping. Ethereum On-Chain Snapshot – April 1, 2025. Only 25% of ETH holders are in profit at current prices. 74% are holding at a loss, a potential setup for capitulation… or accumulation? Time Held: 23% > 1 year 74% held 1–12 months 3% Most holders… pic.twitter.com/rS1qhu2DpG — IT Tech (@IT_Tech_PL) April 1, 2025 A Struggling Majority: The Challenge of Holding Ethereum The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization—Ethereum—has faced a good deal of volatility over the past few months. As a result, a large number of its holders are currently under water. As of this writing, according to the latest on-chain data, only one-quarter of Ethereum holders are currently in profit. A staggering 74% of holders are experiencing losses. This stark contrast between profit and loss could set the stage for an important turning point in the market. When a large percentage of the holders are in the red, two possible scenarios could emerge: either we could witness a widespread capitulation, with holders selling off their positions and driving the price down even further, or we could see a significant accumulation phase, with the majority of investors choosing to hold through the downturn and waiting for a price recovery. For those experiencing a loss, the choice to maintain or divest is a momentous one. Many intermediate-term Ethereum holders are sitting on investments that have markedly devalued since their entry points. With the market still not reflecting a clear directional sentiment, there’s a palpable tension as holders contemplate the decision to either ride or die with the Ethereum price. Alas, for some, that ride could mean further stomach-churning losses before any potential comeback. Holder Behavior: Insights from Time-Held Data The information also illuminates the ordinary actions of Ethereum holders. Based on an on-chain snapshot, most Ethereum holders (74%) have been in possession of their assets for just 1 to 12 months. This group of holders forms the colossal market that is Ethereum, and any price movements that may occur in the future could very well be influenced by their actions. Most of these holders have been counting on Ethereum to come back to profitable conditions, and the current situation is a tough one for them. If the price of Ethereum keeps lurching along like it has been, there’s an increase in risk that some of those holders could throw in the towel and sell. Those would be tons of not-so-easy sells, since Ethereum doesn’t seem to have any buyers right now. And if all those holders who are already on the verge of capitulating actually do go ahead and capitulate, that would put even more downward pressure on Ether’s price. Nonetheless, there’s another scenario possible: Ethereum’s price might find resilient support in the holders who have bought in more recently (those holding from just before the current downturn started). These mid-term holders largely believe in Ethereum’s potential; they aren’t looking to make quick flips but are instead in it for what they see as an inevitable longer-term uptrend. And when Ethereum finally does decide to stage a comeback, it might find a very solid base of support built by these mid-term holders, with no immediate risk of being knocked back down. The data also portray that 23% of holders of Ethereum have held their assets for more than a year. These long-term holders have probably seen and withstood the previous fluctuations in Ethereum’s price and are perhaps in a better position than most to resist the siren song of selling. They have likely been around long enough to experience the up and down cycles of the market, which could give them more conviction to stay in the course of the next bull run. At the same time, just 3% of Ethereum holders have held their positions for not even one month. This group consists mainly of speculators (more likely than not) and, in any case, short-term traders. They should be seen as the very likely first line of defense—the very first possible obstacle—that price movements encounter on their way up and on their way down. Will Ethereum Holders Capitulate or Accumulate? The future of Ethereum’s price depends mainly on the actions of these holders of mid- and long-term. Will they capitulate when the price is under pressure and sell into what looks like a tumbling market, thereby triggering further price declines? Or will they decide to see the current market conditions as a grossly discounted opportunity to buy and hold Ethereum, making it more likely that the cryptocurrency will hold up during this current period of volatility? Right now, the market is at a crossroads, and the decision-making of Ethereum holders will weigh heavily on where it goes next. There’s certainly a risk of capitulation, but the very large number of long-term holders makes me think that Ethereum has a really strong foundation of supporters who could push-bounce Ethereum back to the upside if we were to find ourselves in a recovery scenario. Moreover, the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, together with macro repricing at the I- formed level for equities, could serve as tectonic plate catalysts for recovery. Conclusion: A Market in Flux On-chain data from Ethereum indicates a market at a critical juncture. Most holders are well in the red, and recent price action has given no reason to believe that recovery is right around the corner. All of this creates an environment where two paths lie ahead. In the weeks to come, the market will decide whether to: 1. Capitulatory sell-off? Trade volume has picked up in recent weeks, and along with it, the number of unique accounts that are either buying or selling has surged. A trend this pronounced can often precede a significant price movement. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42843753,https://nulltx.com/?p=147697,1743671889,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,PWEASE Memecoin Faces Sharp Decline as Market Sentiment Shifts,https://nulltx.com/pwease-memecoin-faces-sharp-decline-as-market-sentiment-shifts/,"The erstwhile-popular memecoin , $PWEASE, finds both its market cap and holder base sinking, with what appears to be a very rapid shift in sentiment across the community. For instance, over just the last 11 days, the holder base seems to have shrunk by more than 9 percent. Of course, not a lot seems to be going on with the $PWEASE cap itself: As the cap drops in what seems to be a pretty effortless slide, the trading and liquidity around it seem to drop pretty parallel, leaving us to wonder if $PWEASE is done or if it’s got some life left. A Sharp Drop in Holder Count and Market Cap A little more than a week ago, $PWEASE had a strong base of 25,374 holders. However, that count has since taken a nosedive to 23,082, with 2,292 holders deciding to leave the ship. This represents a remarkable 9.03% drop in the count of holders, which could indicate a turncoat signal for the memecoin—either a loss of confidence or a pivot toward more stable investments as the market becomes less favorable. Once the memecoin market turned into a talk show, $PWEASE reached a peak market capitalization of $54 million. But that peak has been short-lived, and the setup now shows a total of $6 million, which is a decline of 88.89% from the ATH. That setup alone raises some serious questions about the setup in terms of how long it can actually last. The decrease in market cap is a clear sign of the shift in market sentiment around $PWEASE. What was once a thriving and optimistic community is now contending with a much more pessimistic outlook. In the fast-moving world of memecoins, such rapid fluctuations are not unknown, but the extent of the drop is hard to overlook. Market Liquidity and Trading Volume Are Draining Adding to the complexity, the cash available for trades using $PWEASE is also very restricted. This rarity is represented by the current liquidity of $358,000, which amounts to only 5.97% of the coin’s market capitalization. By this measure, which makes the PWEASE seem a little underwhelming, its liquidity is barely touching the surface of 6% of the cash that could be available in the total market for PWEASE. 11 days ago, $PWEASE holders count was 25,374 ATM, holders count is 23,082 2,292 holders have exited the memecoin The holders count dropped by -9.03% PWEASE got to an ATH of $54m Mcap and is now at $6m mcap indicating a -88.89% drop in market cap. Market sentiment have… pic.twitter.com/uDbm61SSxP — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 2, 2025 For $PWEASE, or any token, liquidity is a basic requirement for making way for smooth market activity. Without adequate liquidity, traders will find it hard to buy or sell the token without significantly changing its price. This situation can lead to buying and selling at unfavorable prices. Most of us have been there before. You are trying to sell some of your assets, but the market is so thin that the price is going crazy, and you’re getting offered amounts that are below what the price should be in a semi-stable market. So you’re facing the decision to sell at a loss or not sell. Furthermore, insufficient liquidity frequently discourages additional investors from entering the market because they are concerned about the ease with which trades can be executed and the danger of slippage. Thus, the continuing insufficient liquidity exacerbates the already nasty problem that $PWEASE faces and makes it even more difficult for the coin to rehabilitate itself and regain the confidence of investors. The Shift in Sentiment: From Optimism to Pessimism $PWEASE was once seen as a potential memecoin with tremendous prospects. Its market sentiment, however, has taken a sharp turn. The price had been moving in a favorable direction, accomplishing a near 45 percent surge from around 272.5 units to 395.4. But since then, it’s taken a nosedive down almost to its original price again. This kind of behavior, especially in a price drop that looks so much like a “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario, ought to make even the most loyal traders take a good long look at their positions again. Although some may cling to the notion that $PWEASE can bounce back, the truth is that the market has left behind the once-optimistic highs that defined the coin. The falling number of holders, the dramatically reduced market cap, and the lack of liquidity all point to a situation where more and more investors are looking in the opposite direction. They’re not just unimpressed; they’re evidently worried and searching for better and safer opportunities in the volatile memecoin market. Can $PWEASE Recover? The future of $PWEASE is doubtful, and it may be easy to relegate it to the side, but what do we know about the memecoin market? In the best and the worst of market situations, it is known for being unpredictable. And that unpredictability signed the memecoin’s death warrant on several occasions, apparently, but only to see it rise from the ashes at others. The latest pricing moment may feel like a dose of the latter, but it still has too much unpredictability written all over it to condemn it; that is, if we are condemning anything, which so far, the authors of the White Paper from the memecoin have not done. Nevertheless, the limited liquidity and the current downward trend in holder count present a hard-to-hard-to-gleam future for $PWEASE. Unless a major sea change occurs to restore confidence in the memecoin, which trades for well under a penny, we see it as unlikely that its value will head up, which renders the prospect of profit for its holders bleak. Conclusion: A Rocky Road Ahead The significant drop in market capitalization and number of holders for $PWEASE, coupled with a complete lack of liquidity, makes the outlook for this memecoin rather bleak. A rebound, of course, is still within the realm of possibility. But the current market conditions suggest a recovery is far from certain. In fact, it’s likely many traders will be watching this coin closely for any sentiment or liquidity changes before even considering entering or exiting a position. As it stands, $PWEASE seems to be trudging down a bumpy road. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Could Remittix Be The Next Big Hit In Crypto?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-could-fall-below-1-by-june-claims-top-analyst-could-remittix-be-the-next-big-hit-in-crypto/,"Ripple updates show that it is at the turning point. Many now question whether Remittix or Ripple (XRP) would dominate in the coming months. The latest Ripple updates reveal that it is having its own issues and opportunities to overcome them. Experts refer to Remittix as one of the best cryptos to purchase. Remittix DeFi price is relatively cheap currently and this is why it is appealing to novices. In an era where banks are beyond the means of many individuals, an answer that bridges the gap between crypto and real-world money can be transformative. Ripple Updates : A Secure Digital Payment Option Ripple updates show that XRP has won the trust of banks as their payment method for cross-border payments. The current statistics indicate that XRP has picked up around 1.25% and is currently trading around $2.12. Ripple updates and technical analysis suggests XRP may rise 76.42% to hit $3.78 by April 28 as banks continue to accept it as a way to facilitate faster cross-border money transfer. Investors prefer XRP as it transfers money from one border to another instantly. Ripple updates show that it retains its position among the best due to its strong network amidst market volatility. Many use XRP to lower the expense of cross-border transfers. The stable growth of XRP usage in international finance adds resilience to its price. Investors are fond of XRP as they perceive it as a stable asset that offers sound means of payment. Remittix: The DeFi Revolution Changing Global Payments Ripple is the latest DeFi project providing solutions to day-to-day problems. It is unlike most tokens, as they seek to facilitate cheaper and faster cross-border payments. Remittix is an intermediary service between cryptocurrencies and standard banking. Remittix makes people able to keep things private and control their own money. There are plenty of people all over the world without bank accounts. Almost 1.4 billion people don’t even own a bank account. Such people are able to pay money using cryptocurrencies and then obtain cash for day-to-day use. Remittix eliminates extra steps and offers instant and affordable international remittances. Remittix had sold over 525 million tokens during its ICO. Remittix DeFi token price is currently about $0.0734 and it is among the best cryptos to put money on when you are searching for one that solves world problems. Experts estimate that Remittix may grow up to 10 times if market conditions remain favorable. The project bridges the gap between freedom of cryptography and the structure of modern finance. The project offers an alternative where people can keep their money with true anonymity and yet remain able to use the money in their day-to-day lives. They would place their money inside a wallet. They would transfer it to money transfer companies and get paid cash to them to purchase transport or food. Remittix gives them that exercise an extra push by cutting costs and speeding up transfers. This real-world use case is evidence that Remittix not only has the potential for expansion but addresses a single issue that plagues millions. The real-world use case has drawn investors who see a single token with solid tech and actual life use. To some, Remittix is the best cryptocurrency to purchase because it unites the actual potential of cryptography and contemporary money. Future Of Payments With Remitix Ripple updates show that XRP remains one of the best options for rapid, affordable global remittances. But Remittix is different because it offers a solution to real-life problems. Remittix offers the solution to the unbanked to send low-cost and secure money transfers. Remittix is most frequently referred to by experts as one of the cryptos to invest in because it offers an earthly approach and the potential to make us use the cryptos on a daily basis more frequently as part of our daily lives. For any investor who wants to construct a solid portfolio, the decision will soon be one of which project offers more than mere price appreciation. With its solid fundamentals and already clearly shown emphasis on international payments, Remittix is likely to become one of the leaders in reshaping global money flows over the coming years.

The decline of ACT and… pic.twitter.com/PfnH5sIoJx — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 2, 2025 The $ACT Crash: A Whale’s $2.17 Million Loss The crash of the ACT token has hit a major investor, a whale, especially hard. This whale had taken out a total of 4.58 million ACT tokens from Binance four months ago, worth around $2.49 million at the time. But the price of ACT has since crashed, and the same number of now-tokens only have a market value of $320,000. That’s a loss of $2.17 million in four months, and it underscores the current market’s extreme volatility. The $ACT crash has caused this whale to lose $2.17M! This whale withdrew 4.58M $ACT (then worth $2.49M) from #Binance 4 months ago; now, it's worth just $320K —a $2.17M hit. https://t.co/WuaWwSZNLy pic.twitter.com/Xi39cYxGf5 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 2, 2025 The $2.17 million loss is a stinging reminder of the dangers that come with trading in cryptocurrencies, and it is especially true for the second part of the trading equation: hold or invest in smaller-cap tokens that, over short intervals, can swing wildly and lose 20%, 30%, or even 50% of their value, as the two algo-autorized traders experienced, and a much larger whale lost. This also speaks to a trend that is affecting altcoin holders and traders, who over the last very short period of time, have experienced much more pronounced and sustained downturns. Short-Term Volatility: MASK, LEVER, and Other Tokens Suffer Heavy Losses The recent wave of sharp price drops is showing just how volatile the cryptocurrency market has become. Two tokens that had already been under pressure for the past few days—LEVER and MASK—were hit particularly hard today. In fact, LEVER/USDT fell by more than 28% in a very short time frame, while MASK/USDT dropped by 29%. For traders, the losses in these two tokens left many of them scrambling to react. For traders who had taken positions in these tokens, the sudden declines have led to significant losses in a matter of hours. These types of rapid and unpredictable drops are becoming increasingly common in the volatile world of crypto trading, where tokens can surge or plummet without warning. Such fluctuations often result in panic selling, further exacerbating the decline in prices, as traders look to mitigate their losses. The price decreases in MASK and LEVER are an expression of the market price sentiment, where many investors are moving toward a cautious stance under the specter of potential deep market declines. These tokens were at least partially lifted by the rising tide earlier this year, but they have rolled over and dropped noticeably in the past few weeks. Broader Market Impact: The Ripple Effect of ACT’s Fall The ACT token’s nosedive has sent ripples across the larger market, and especially among tokens that are in similar market categories. As ACT and DF have taken further tumbles, a number of traders have started to fret that the larger altcoin market could be in for a rough patch ahead. For now, many traders are taking a wait-and-see approach, with some even reducing their exposure to altcoins that they consider to be of the high-risk variety. Traders are seeking safe havens in more stable assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the smaller altcoins, in this volatile market, are facing increasing sell-offs. Many traders are now worried about both the altcoins ACT, LEVER, and MASK, which have been losing significant value lately, and the sustainability of a market that allows such volatile market conditions to persist. This situation has reignited worries over the trading of low-cap altcoins. And with good reason. When the crypto markets top off and then go bearish, the potential for losses amplifies—especially when something like 20 just got slashed down to 4.50 in a matter of hours. And in what we just witnessed, with the ACT debacle, it’s become painfully clear that anything you might trade in crypto can potentially wind up losing the vast majority of its value. And fast. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market Amid Heightened Risk The last 24 hours have been a sharp reminder of the extreme volatility that characterizes the cryptocurrency markets. Tokens like ACT, MASK, and LEVER have seen sharp declines, yet again reminding traders of the not-so-recent past—in an unpredictable environment, managing risk is the only way to stay afloat. The whale holding ACT tokens lost a lot of money yesterday. His loss should underscore how dangerous it is to trade in altcoins with small market caps, where price swings happen both fast and often. Over the next few weeks, it will be fascinating to watch the market react to these steep drops. Will altcoins like ACT, LEVER, and MASK bounce back, or are they in for a continued decline? These outcomes will ride mainly on the sentiment of the crypto market at large and whether or not investors can find their way back to a confident place in this space. Until then, traders need to stay alert and be prepared to move with the market’s shifting currents. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a post on X, Hayes stated, “Market no likey ‘Liberation Day.’ If $BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods. Don’t get chopped up!” Bitcoin’s Recovery Not Yet Confirmed His comments come as Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $82,000 while gold surged past $3,150, reacting to heightened global uncertainty following US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements. The Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on all countries starting April 5, with steeper rates for major economies such as China (34%), the European Union (20%), and Japan (24%). The move, announced during an April 2 speech in the Rose Garden, was accompanied by a national emergency declaration, which further rattled financial markets. The crypto market initially reacted positively to the announcement. However, as the broader implications became clear, prices reversed sharply across the board. Bitcoin rallied to a high of $88,500 before retreating to a low of around $82,200. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw a sharper decline, as it fell from $1,934 to $1,797. During this time, the total crypto market cap dropped by over 5% to $2.7 trillion. The price action, so far, aligns with Glassnode’s analysis which revealed that Bitcoin is starting to show signs of near-term seller exhaustion, but a renewal of sustained bullish momentum, is yet to transpire. The blockchain intelligence form explained that after reaching its $109K peak in January, BTC continues to “digest” the correction, with growing evidence of investor losses being realized. Despite price stabilization within the $76K-$80K demand zone, on-chain momentum indicators suggest that these recoveries could be short-lived and part of a larger downtrend rather than a true market reversal. Avoiding Extended Turbulence Hayes’ latest remarks suggest that Bitcoin’s ability to maintain key support levels until April 15, the US tax deadline, could determine whether the crypto market stabilizes or faces extended turbulence. Interestingly, Hayes recently predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $250,000 by year-end, while citing expanding fiat supply as the key driver. He also said that he anticipates a strong 2025 rally if the US Federal Reserve shifts to quantitative easing (QE), injecting liquidity into the economy.

So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $12 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Terra Classic (LUNC) Terra Classic (LUNC) has experienced notable price declines. In the past week, its price dropped by 11.93%. Over the last month, it fell by 19.22%, and in six months, the decrease reached 29.65%. This consistent downward trend suggests a bearish market sentiment. Currently, LUNC trades between $0.0000568 and $0.00006681, hovering near its nearest support level of $0.00005274. A rebound from this support could push the price towards the nearest resistance at $0.00007270, an increase of about 25%. Failing to hold the support may lead to a decline towards the second support at $0.00004276. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 35.29, approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator is low at 10.86, indicating potential overselling. The MACD level is negative, suggesting bearish momentum. The 10-day SMA is $0.00005890, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $0.00006002, hinting at possible short-term consolidation. Based on this data, LUNC might either bounce back if buyers step in or continue to fall if selling pressure remains. Stellar (XLM) Over the past six months, Stellar's XLM token soared by 193%, marking a remarkable uptrend. But recent movements have been less favorable. In the last month, XLM's price dropped by 24.44%, and the past week saw a further decline of 9.70%. Currently, it's trading between $0.25 and $0.29. Technical indicators suggest caution. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are both at $0.27, indicating a neutral trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 39.82, nearing oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator is low at 5.52, hinting that the asset is oversold. The MACD level is negative at -0.0010, pointing to bearish momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest support level is $0.24. If XLM falls below this, the next support is at $0.20. On the upside, resistance is at $0.32. A move above this could lead to testing the second resistance at $0.36, representing a potential gain of around 24%. Whether XLM can reverse its recent declines depends on market sentiment and buying interest. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has seen a significant drop in price over the past months. In six months, the token's value decreased by 67.37%. The last month alone accounted for a 40.24% decline, and just this past week, the price fell by 21.02%. Currently, FET is trading between $0.42 and $0.55, hovering near its nearest support level at $0.38. Technical indicators suggest continued bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 30.12, approaching oversold territory, while the Stochastic oscillator is very low at 2.63. The MACD level is negative at -0.006017, indicating potential for further downward movement. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $0.46 and $0.47 respectively, showing a lack of short-term trend direction. If the downward trend continues, FET may test the second support level at $0.26, which would be a substantial drop from current prices. However, if buying interest increases, the price could rebound toward the nearest resistance level at $0.63, marking a notable rise. Breaking past this resistance might lead to testing the second resistance level at $0.75. Traders are closely watching these levels to anticipate FET's next move. Sei (SEI) Sei (SEI) has seen significant declines recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 17.85%. The past month was even tougher, with a decrease of 36.27%. Looking back six months, the coin's value has fallen by 56.79%. Currently, SEI trades between $0.16 and $0.20. Technical indicators hint at possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index stands at 40.42, suggesting the coin is approaching oversold conditions. The Stochastic oscillator is at a low 9.05, which often indicates an oversold market that might be due for a rebound. The MACD level is negative at -0.000875, pointing to bearish momentum. Support and resistance levels are key to watch. The nearest support is at $0.15, and if the price holds above this, there might be a chance for a bounce. The nearest resistance is at $0.23. If SEI can break through this level, it could target the second resistance at $0.28. This would represent an increase of approximately 40% from the current price range. On the downside, if the price falls below the $0.15 support, the next support is at $0.10, which would be around a 30% decrease from current levels. Conclusion While LUNC, XLM, FET, and SEI show potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for massive growth and community-driven success.

From the White House Rose Garden, Trump introduced a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and additional targeted tariffs on 60 countries the US labels as the biggest trade offenders. These new tariffs, which could reach up to 50%, are set to take effect in early April. Key countries are hit with steep new tariffs : the EU faces a 20% levy, Japan 24%, and China is now subject to a 54% total tariff when combining the new and existing duties. Some Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam face tariffs nearing 50%. However, Mexico and Canada are spared from the most severe penalties, and UK goods are only hit with the base 10% tariff — a sign of possible warmer trade ties.

With specific anti-money laundering (AML) conditions, South Korea is opening its doors to foreign investors, allowing them to invest in the local crypto market. South Korean Crypto Market Attracts Foreign Investors According to a local report , the South Korean crypto market is attracting foreign investors, expanding opportunities for international participation. During a seminar on Wednesday at the National Assembly, the Financial Services Commission’s crypto head, King Sung-ji, acknowledged the need to promote foreign investors’ participation in the domestic crypto market. Reportedly, Kim asserted that the financial regulators may bring amendments to the AML rules in an effort to attract international crypto investors. He also noted that the current conditions may be revised if exchanges meet the required AML standards. South Korea Reconsiders Restrictions on Foreign Traders Currently, South Korea has imposed restrictions on foreign investors entering the local crypto market. The country’s crypto regulations mandate stringent know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for service providers, restricting international traders. Notably, the country imposes capital account restrictions, thereby maintaining strict control over portfolio investments. However, if South introduces new rules to attract international traders, these restrictions could be lifted. Presto Research team head Peter Chung stated, “Allowing foreigners to trade crypto on Korean exchanges would mute such restrictions.” Recently, South Korean regulators have taken the initiative to strengthen its AML rules . On March 5, 2025, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) convened a meeting in which they examined the AML regulations and shared inspection plans. South Korea’s Crypto Regulatory Moves Significantly, South Korea has been making efforts to tackle the increasing crypto threats and thefts. South Korea concentrates on bolstering the country’s crypto market growth and establishment, along with guaranteeing investor protection. As part of the country’s stringent regulations, South Korea urged Google to restrict access to 17 crypto exchanges that allegedly operate without proper registration. Subsequently, Google blocked these platforms which include KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, XT, CoinEx, BitMart, and Poloniex among many others.

But while the perennially worst-performing large cap cryptocurrency is down 22.7% year-to-date, milder than the 45% or 33% falls in ETH or SOL respectively, the technicals suggest something far more sinister. Bearish pennant formation led to a temporary drop under $0.630 during Asian trading hours throwing a possible 12% decline to $0.580. They say More downside is coming, calling Cardano a “zombie blockchain” with a market cap of $23.1 billion and a paltry $333 million in assets locked. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which completely turns this story on its head with $6,100,000 raised in presale funding from 7,800 investors in Phase 4 at $0.025. As Phase 4 is rises, we are loading readiness to pay 20% more and going to the $0.030 price in the next phase. Cardano Begins New Leg Down Against Bitcoin The hourly charts of Cardano are a dismal sight. A breakdown below $0.660 was the result of three successive lower highs since last Wednesday, although the price managed a partial recovery during U.S. hours. RSI, MACD point to increasing bearish momentum and Fibonacci retracement levels indicate the prospect of a retest at $0.630. A confirmed breach here may well invalidate the bullish pennant, sending ADA on to $0.580. There is growing skepticism as Cardano developers are bypassing her real-world applications in favor of rivals like Solana and trending DeFi innovations. Marketing and adoption-induced disconnection propels fears of more severe correction towards the $0.460 level. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge As Cardano wobbles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) proves its presale muscle. Phase 4 tokens are available for $0.025 each now, offering early investors a 140% gain when the token lists at $0.06. Tokenomics gives the project an even greater incentive for a fast uptake. Everyone who invests now, benefits with immediate in-the-money gains as the following rounds fill, leading to a self-incentivizing demand loop. Experts predict that post-launch price of $2.50—a 9,900% increase from the current price—off the back of Mutuum’s distinctive lending paradigm and buy-pressure mechanics. Mutuum Finance also employs mtTokens, which are interest-bearing assets that reflect the availability of deposited funds such as ETH or DAI. Over time these tokens create value generating passive income without losing liquidity. A peer-to-peer lending feature and overcollateralized loans provide even more utility, appealing to both risk-averse users and yield chasers. Platform feeds revenue goes to repurchase MUTM, putting it back into the pockets of the stakers and reducing disposals. The artificial scarcity, combined with a $100,000 giveaway to the first contributors, induces peak FOMO as Phase 4 inches towards a sold-out status. Security Pillars Reinforce Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance’s strategy is still around transparency. The team is completing a smart contract audit with CertiK, an important step that will be communicated through official channels when finalized. This proactive step serves to reassure investors navigating a sea of speculative projects. In stark contrast to Cardano’s esoteric rhetoric, Mutuum’s concrete ecosystem—is all about practical returns through lending, borrowing, and asset appreciation—makes a compelling case to pragmatists who want return on what they put in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents itself as a methodical antidote in the operational mayhem and existential criticisms beleaguering Cardano. The $0.025 entry point of phase 4 presents a limited-time opportunity before the price increases, enabling early adopters to position themselves for exponential returns. As CertiK audit results are still awaited and exchange listings beckon, time is running out for cynics to shift focus to a project that presents a unique combination of innovation with investor-first design.

Fidelity Investments has introduced nearly fee-free retirement accounts that allow Americans to invest directly in Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin. Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments has launched two outcome-oriented Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to generate income by leveraging Bitcoin’s price volatility. Fidelity Opens the Door for Crypto Retirement Accounts, Offering Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin Exposure In a move poised to reshape the American retirement landscape, Fidelity Investments, one of the largest financial services companies in the world with over $5.9 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a new suite of retirement accounts designed to allow US investors to gain direct exposure to cryptocurrencies — all with minimal fees. The new offering includes three distinct retirement vehicles: a tax-deferred traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as well as two types of Roth IRAs, including a rollover option. These accounts will give investors the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), three of the most prominent cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Fidelity’s crypto IRAs are being offered through its Fidelity Digital Assets subsidiary, which until now has primarily catered to institutional clients, such as hedge funds and family offices. The expansion into retail retirement accounts signals yet another step toward mainstream crypto adoption in the US, providing American savers and investors with a regulated, well-established channel to diversify their retirement portfolios with digital assets. Nearly Fee-Free Access to Crypto in Retirement Accounts Fidelity’s new crypto IRAs stand out for their low-cost structure. The company has announced zero account opening or maintenance fees for these retirement vehicles. Instead, Fidelity will generate revenue via a 1% spread fee on the execution price of buy and sell transactions — a model that is considerably more attractive than the fees charged by many crypto-focused IRA providers in the market today. This offering is designed to make cryptocurrency investing accessible to the average American worker, many of whom have been wary of complex and expensive platforms in the past. The move reflects growing demand for digital asset exposure among long-term investors, particularly those looking to hedge against inflation, diversify their retirement savings, or participate in the future of decentralized finance. Fidelity's decision to broaden access to crypto investments through IRAs is part of a wider trend in the United States, where regulatory clarity and institutional interest are rapidly transforming the crypto landscape. In recent months, several notable events have signaled that crypto adoption is no longer on the fringe: Multiple US companies, including stablecoin issuer Circle, have filed for initial public offerings (IPOs), aiming to bring their digital asset operations into public markets. A number of US corporations have adopted strategic Bitcoin reserves as part of their treasury strategies. Lawmakers have introduced new legislation to increase crypto accessibility within retirement accounts. Most notably, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville recently announced the reintroduction of a bill that would allow Americans to include cryptocurrency in their 401(k) plans. The legislation aims to scale back regulatory constraints imposed by the Department of Labor, further opening the door for Americans to integrate digital assets into their retirement strategies. Addressing Security Concerns with Cold Storage Security has long been a sticking point for crypto-curious investors, especially those considering long-term holdings in retirement accounts. To address this, Fidelity has emphasized that it will store the majority of the cryptocurrencies held in these IRAs in cold storage — meaning the digital assets will be stored offline in secure wallets, significantly reducing the risk of hacks and cyber attacks. This institutional-grade security approach is expected to boost confidence among investors who may have previously been concerned about the safety of crypto holdings in retirement portfolios. While Fidelity’s offering is a groundbreaking move by a traditional financial giant, it is not the first method available for US investors to gain crypto exposure within tax-advantaged accounts. Since early 2024, Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have allowed investors to gain exposure to these leading cryptocurrencies indirectly. These ETFs are typically accessible through existing retirement brokerage accounts, making them an easy option for many Americans. Additionally, self-directed Bitcoin IRAs and platforms like BitIRA have offered digital-asset-specific retirement accounts, enabling investors to purchase a broader range of cryptocurrencies — including altcoins like Litecoin — while benefiting from tax advantages. However, Fidelity’s entry into the space brings the weight and trust of a household-name institution, potentially making crypto retirement investing more palatable to the average investor. A Growing Demand for Crypto in Retirement Portfolios The growing interest in cryptocurrency inclusion within retirement accounts is driven by a generational shift in investment preferences. A recent Gallup poll revealed that 47% of millennials and Gen Z investors view cryptocurrency as a viable long-term investment, compared to just 16% of Baby Boomers. Fidelity’s move is likely to accelerate this trend, as more Americans recognize the potential of digital assets to diversify portfolios and generate long-term returns. Moreover, with US lawmakers actively discussing legislative measures to loosen restrictions around crypto in retirement plans, and the increased availability of crypto ETFs and self-directed IRA solutions, the momentum toward wider crypto retirement adoption is clear. Grayscale Launches Two Outcome-Oriented Bitcoin ETFs to Harness Crypto Volatility In related news, Grayscale Investments, the world's leading cryptocurrency asset manager, has expanded its suite of digital asset investment products with the launch of two new Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The new offerings, unveiled on April 2, are the Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) — both designed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s notorious volatility while offering investors alternative income streams. This bold step by Grayscale marks a significant evolution in how crypto investors can approach income-generating strategies within the digital asset space. Unlike traditional Bitcoin ETFs that simply mirror spot price movements, these ”outcome-oriented” ETFs employ sophisticated options-based strategies to provide both income generation and exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential. Complex Strategies to Tap Into Bitcoin’s Volatility The first of the two new products, the Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC), aims to maximize potential income through a systematic covered call strategy. The fund will routinely write call options near Bitcoin’s spot price, a method that allows it to collect option premiums while giving up some upside potential. This strategy is tailored to investors seeking to supplement their Bitcoin exposure with a structured income stream without the need to actively manage complex options themselves. The second product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI), takes a slightly different approach. It focuses on writing out-of-the-money call options on a variety of Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale’s flagship products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). This approach aims to balance income generation with the potential for price appreciation, offering investors the chance to participate in much of Bitcoin's upside while benefiting from periodic income distributions. The launch of these two ETFs comes at a time when investors are increasingly looking for diversified ways to earn yield on digital assets without relying solely on price appreciation. Bitcoin’s high volatility, often viewed as a risk factor, is being reimagined by Grayscale as an income-generating opportunity. By using sophisticated options strategies, these ETFs promise to deliver a systematic, rules-based approach to options management, with monthly income distributions — an attractive proposition for both institutional and retail investors who are looking to generate yield in a market known more for speculation than steady returns. Grayscale also noted that these outcome-oriented ETFs can serve as a complement to direct Bitcoin ownership or to other crypto-exposure products, allowing investors to create diversified strategies in their crypto portfolios. The unveiling of BTCC and BPI is the latest in a series of product launches and regulatory filings by Grayscale Investments as it aggressively expands its footprint in the crypto ETF space. Earlier this week, Grayscale filed for the creation of a broad-based cryptocurrency ETF that includes a basket of leading digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). This diversified ETF aims to offer investors exposure to multiple crypto assets within a single product, further cementing Grayscale’s position as a leading provider of digital asset investment vehicles. In addition, Grayscale has submitted a filing through Nasdaq to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Avalanche (AVAX) ETF, and is currently awaiting approval for several other high-profile products, including an XRP spot ETF, a Cardano spot ETF, and the conversion of its Litecoin Trust into an ETF. Some of the crypto products listing on Grayscale’s website (Source: Grayscale ) With these new filings and product launches, Grayscale’s total product lineup has grown to 28 crypto-focused investment vehicles, comprising 25 single-asset derivatives and three diversified ETFs. The Next Phase of Crypto Investment Products Grayscale’s aggressive ETF expansion strategy reflects the evolving nature of the crypto investment market. While early-stage Bitcoin ETFs focused primarily on price-tracking exposure, the market is now shifting toward structured, outcome-oriented strategies that mirror those found in traditional equities markets. By introducing income-focused derivatives tied to Bitcoin’s volatility, Grayscale is addressing the growing demand among investors for non-correlated income sources and diversified ways to profit from the cryptocurrency market’s unique characteristics. This trend also aligns with broader institutional interest in Bitcoin and crypto markets, driven by increased regulatory clarity and the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-03 09:30:00

Sui ( SUI ) is currently trading at $2.31, hovering above the key support zone between $2.10 – $2.20, despite the recent token unlock on April 1. The price has been holding this level since March 11, after it had reached its lowest low of around $2 this year, following the crash from its all-time high of $5.35 on Jan. 6. You might also like: $151M in SUI to be unlocked this week. Will SUI price falter? However, SUI price is still in a clear downtrend as it’s trading below both the 20-day Exponential Moving Average at $2.41 and 50-day Simple Moving Average at $2.67. The 20-day EMA is acting as immediate resistance, which SUI attempted to break it in late March and even briefly touched 50-day SMA, but faced rejection. RSI is at 45.09, meaning the momentum is weak but improving. RSI-based MA is at 46.35, showing that the strength of buyers is slowly increasing, but it’s still below the 50-neutral mark, so bulls aren’t in control yet. No major spike in volume is currently evident, meaning the market remains uncertain. Source: TradingView That being said, the chart is looking mildly bullish, especially considering that SUI has been holding above its key support zone between $2.10 – $2.20 for several weeks now. Plus, the price hasn’t made a new lower low since March 11 and has tested the 20-day EMA multiple times, meaning that buyers are challenging the short-term resistance. If the price continues to hold the current support and breaks out above the next resistance zone at $2.50 – $2.55, it could lead to a trend reversal, with the next major resistance at $2.67 (50-day SMA). Similarly, technical analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that SUI price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which may point to a short-term bullish reversal if it breaks past $2.52.

Dogecoin & XRP Have Seen A Notable Drop In Profitability During Last 30 Days In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Supply in Profit for the major assets in the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Approaches Neutral As BTC Recovers To $85,000 The “Supply in Profit” here is an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating supply of a given digital asset that’s being held at some net unrealized profit. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin on the network to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous transfer value of any token was less than the current spot price, then that particular coin is assumed to be sitting on a profit right now. The Supply in Profit adds up all coins of this type and determines what part of the supply that they make up for. An alternate indicator known as the Supply in Loss takes into account for the supply of the opposite type. The value of the Supply in Loss can also simply be calculated by subtracting the Supply in Profit from 100, as the total supply must add up to a 100%. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Supply in Profit for eight cryptocurrencies over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, Toncoin (TON) and BNB (BNB) have seen the Supply in Profit go through a significant increase recently. Over the last 30 days, TON has seen an additional 23.8% of the supply get into the green, taking the total to a whopping 94.1%. Similarly, BNB has seen a rise of 17.4%, putting the metric at 86.3%. On the other end of the spectrum are Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL), with each registering a notable decrease in the indicator. Below is a chart that filters out the other assets to focus on the curves for these coins. With the decrease, XRP has seen another 5.2% of its supply fall into a loss to take the total Supply in Profit to 81.5%. Dogecoin has seen an almost double digit decrease in the metric, but a majority of its coins are still above water as the indicator sits at 53.6%. Solana hasn’t been so lucky, however, as despite a decline of just 4.4%, only 35.2% of the the cryptocurrency’s supply is currently holding a gain. From one perspective, though, this development may not actually be so bad for SOL. Generally, profit-sellers are what impede bullish moves, but when there aren’t many investors left in gain anymore, the price tends to bottom out.

On the other hand, some countries rejected the idea of reserves, and Russia was among these countries. At this point, Russia is planning a legal path for the sale of Bitcoin seized from criminal cases. Russia's Federal Bailiff Service has taken action to increase government revenue. The agency is working to develop a legal framework for selling Bitcoins seized from criminal cases. Speaking at a meeting of the Russian Senate Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building, Head of the Federal Bailiff Service (FSSP) Dmitry Aristov called Bitcoin a “problem asset.” FSSP head Aristov said that they are working to sell the seized BTCs in response to a Senator’s question about “protocols for confiscating cryptocurrencies.” Aristov added that Russia should first of all determine the legal status of Bitcoin in Russia. The first target of this move is likely to be a bribery case involving 1,032.1 BTC, which was seized and transferred to the Treasury. *This is not investment advice.

This seed funding round comprises of €2.3 million in equity financing, with rest of €500,000 being funded by Italy’s Ministry of Economic Development through its “Smart&Start Italia” program – which supports innovative startups. ​ The investment was led by notable figures including LinkedIn Italy CEO Marcello Albergoni, Accenture Interactive Managing Director Alessandro Zanotti, and senior partners from McKinsey – Andrea Travasoni and Guido Frisiani. This significant investment will be used by Collecto to make exclusive luxury assets more accessible to a broader range of investors through fractional ownership. Collecto: A Growing Market for Fractional Ownership of Luxury Items Collecto operates at the intersection of blockchain and luxury investments, leveraging tokenization to offer fractional ownership of prestigious assets. The 2024-founded startup enables collectors and investors to purchase and trade digital shares of luxury items, making high-value markets more accessible to a broader audience. “This funding is a major milestone for Collecto and validates our vision of a more inclusive and transparent luxury asset market,” said Collecto’s CEO Giovanni Camisasca in a Linkedin post . “We believe blockchain technology can transform the way people invest in collectibles, and this investment will allow us to scale our platform and reach a wider community of collectors and investors.” The company’s model is part of a growing trend in the luxury sector, where traditional barriers to entry—such as high costs and limited liquidity—are being overcome through Web3 innovations. With Collecto App, investors can buy and sell fractional ownership stakes for luxury items such as watches, wines, and art with ease. Using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) , it allows investors to enjoy the benefits of asset appreciation without the burdens of physical custody. Investor Confidence in Web3 and Luxury Collectibles The €2.8 million round signals strong confidence from investors in both Web3 technology and the future of luxury asset tokenization. The luxury collectibles market is valued at billions of euros, but historically, it has been restricted to an elite few. But Collecto’s approach can democratize access while maintaining the exclusivity and security that high-net-worth individuals expect. As per the mechanism of Collecto, it uses an authoritative team of experts to verify each and every asset up for tokenized ownership on its platform. And once a user buys shares in a particular asset, the Custody of the assets is transferred to a specialized security vault for each vertical. With this latest funding, Collecto plans to invest in security infrastructure, product development, and marketing initiatives to attract more users and partners. The company is also exploring partnerships with luxury brands and auction houses to expand its catalog of tokenized assets. Expanding the Vision Beyond fine art and watches, Collecto is also eyeing expansion into other asset classes, including rare automobiles and high-end jewelry. The startup envisions a future where anyone, regardless of financial background, can hold a stake in the world’s most sought-after luxury items. Additionally, the platform will introduce enhanced features, including a secondary marketplace for trading shares of collectibles and an improved user experience through its mobile app. This aligns with the company’s goal of becoming a leading player in the luxury asset Web3 space. Thus, with the new funding in place, the startup is set to accelerate its growth and bring its vision of democratized luxury ownership to a global audience.

Although, at one point in January, the market touched a new all-time high of $109,586.27, the monthly returns of the month was just 9.54%. In February, the returns declined sharply to -17.5%, probably due to economic uncertainty created by Trump’s aggressive tariff plan . In March, the BTC market scenario slightly improved, as its monthly returns grew to -2.19. Since the beginning of this month, the market has surged by 1.30%. Interestingly, yesterday, the market made a strong attempt to break above two key technical levels, a downward sloping resistance and a 200-day Exponential Moving Average . Experts suggest that If Bitcoin closes above both these key levels, it could trigger a strong bullish rally, marking an end to the current bearish trend. Bitcoin Retests Critical Levels: What’s Happening? Yesterday, at one point, the Bitcoin market reached as high as $88,513.25. However, at the time of closing, the price plummeted to $82,530.38, creating a long bearish candlestick. The 200-day EMA indicator in the daily chart of Bitcoin sits at $85,417.58 – just 2.23% above the spot price. The downward sloping resistance has almost touched the 200-day EMA level in the BTC daily chart. This implies that if the market raises around 2.23%, it could break above these two crucial levels. Today, the market has so far grown by around 1.36%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today?

However, as it became clear that the tariffs were a lot more onerous than the market was expecting, the ensuing 7% dump caused a cascade of liquidations among traders as more than $6,000 was wiped off of the Bitcoin price in the space of around 4 hours. Market did not anticipate the full extent of tariffs The Wall Street Journal published a report before President Trump’s announcement on reciprocal tariffs that a 10% baseline tariff would be imposed upon all countries. It did mention that some countries would pay higher tariffs, but according to the Kobeissi Letter on X , it seems that the market was taking it that 10% would generally be levied across the board. Long and short traders liquidated According to Coinglass , both long and short traders were liquidated for a total of $487 million for the 24 hour period. In traditional markets, given the lateness of the announcement, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were able to close up on the day. However, the Nasdaq mini futures fell 6% from top to bottom, wiping off $1,200 before recovering slightly. S&P 500 bounce or further fall? Source: TradingView So where does this leave the market going forward? While U.S. stocks may well open significantly down, the weekly chart does suggest that a bounce is still due. If the market decides to vehemently follow a bearish course, there is the possibility of a fall in the S&P 500 down to the low $5,000 region. That said, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing a cross-up of the indicators, and this has heralded all the previous rallies. Trump walks a tightrope It could also be that the market may take a while to thoroughly absorb and price in all the tariffs. In fact, on the face of it, the tariffs are incredibly bearish and there is not much that can be said to detract from this. The U.S. economy is probably going to really struggle for a period, and it could be that President Trump, and his counterparts from other countries, will have to thrash out deals fairly quickly in order to limit the damage. President Trump is walking a tightrope. Key for his administration is to weaken the dollar, and get the 10-year bond yield further down so that refinancing the debt can be done at a much better rate of interest. Nevertheless, as this takes place, the economy could be in danger of going into freefall. $BTC fails to make a local higher high Source: TradingView The $BTC price is up around 1.3% on Thursday so far, although looking at the 4-hour chart it can be seen that a resistance level has been reached. Wednesday’s Trump tariffs announcement comes within the recent long red candle that stands out from any of those from the last few days. The bulls had their impetus to break through the horizontal resistance and the descending trendline, only for the price to plummet back down again as the full extent of the tariffs became known. What’s more, the upward spike stopped just short of making a local higher high, so it seems that the sideways and potentially downwards choppiness could be about to resume. Bulls are running out of time Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC could still be seen as bullish, given that a candle open above the descending trendline could be the beginning of a trend change. However, the bulls are beginning to run out of time. The descending trendline is running down to converge with the support at $80,000, and there can only be one more week before the price has to either break out or break down. If the Stochastic RSI indicator lines roll over, the breakdown, perhaps all the way down to $70,000 would be the favoured option. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Sun doubled down on claims that TrueUSD's reserves were ""misappropriated by a few bad actors,"" leading to him needing to quietly bail out the stablecoin. Sun pointed a finger the Hong Kong regulatory framework surrounding trusts , arguing at the press conference that loopholes and loose rules allowed the alleged misappropriation to occur. ""This situation highlights a serious challenge to the integrity of the financial system that must be addressed,"" he said. ""I found it hard to believe the scale of fraud orchestrated by a long list of licensed intermediaries."" Sun even said that for the time being, Hong Kong trust companies should be avoided entirely, and urged regulators to take decisive action to safeguard the city's global financial reputation. For that case, Sun might have an ally in the shape of Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng — called the city's Web3 politician. He released a statement saying that he's aware of multiple reports this year of alleged fraud exploiting trust companies, and acknowledged that local regulation needs to be improved. First Digital Trust denies all allegations After Sun's press conference, First Digital Trust held its own event on X, with CEO Vincent Chok saying Sun had yet to produce ""one solid piece of evidence"" to back up his claims. FDT followed its fiduciary duties, acted in clients' best interests, complied with instructions from Sun and his nominees, which were signed off by Techteryx directors, and noted that the company is subject to third-party audits, Chok said. Chok, however, acknowledged he was previously unaware of the familial connection between Aria CFF and Aria DMCC — the funds where TUSD's reserves are held up. In a complaint to the Department of Justice, Techteryx noted that Aria CFF, the fund it said is authorized to hold TrueUSD's reserves is managed by Matthew Brittain. Aria DMCC, which Techteryx said is unauthorized, is controlled by his spouse, Cecilia Brittain. Chok said FDT is working to recover funds, but know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) issues involving the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx are apparently holding things up. He also rejected Sun's claims in a post on X that First Digital Trust is unable to fulfill redemption obligations of its FDUSD stablecoin. The token is still very much solvent, Chok said. FDT said it plans to pursue legal action over Sun's claims.

Is Bitcoin Crashing to $71K?,https://coinpedia.org/news/trump-reciprocal-trade-tariffs-spark-fear-is-bitcoin-crashing-to-71k/,"The post Trump Reciprocal Trade Tariffs Spark Fear! Is Bitcoin Crashing to $71K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is once again facing a period of uncertainty as new U.S. trade tariffs add pressure to an already volatile market. According to Charles Edwards, this situation looks similar to the 2022 bear market bottom, raising concerns about what’s next for BTC. Meanwhile, analysts believe that bitcoin will hit $71,000 if economic pressure continues to grow. US Tariffs Put Pressure on Bitcoin Bitcoin took a hit after President Donald Trump announced global reciprocal trade tariffs on April 2. While US stocks managed to recover, BTC dropped as much as 8.5% in a single day. Edwards pointed out that US business expectations are now at levels seen in 2000, 2008, and 2022 years tied to major market downturns. Consider this as tariffs come in higher than expected. The Phily Fed Business Outlook survey is showing expectations today comparable to 2000, 2008 and 2022. How long until the Powell printer starts humming? Discussed in @capriole_fund 's update last week. pic.twitter.com/HNLJ8hgyWn — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) April 3, 2025 A chart from the Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Survey (BOS) showed business confidence falling below 15, a sign of economic strain. Edwards noted that while BOS data isn’t always accurate, it has historically indicated high-risk periods for financial markets. “If the tariff war escalates or corporate margins start to shrink, we could see further downside,” he warned. Key Price Levels to Watch For Bitcoin traders, the key level to watch in the short term is $91,000. If Bitcoin manages a daily close above the $84k level , it could be a strong bullish signal. However, if prices continue to drop, Bitcoin may test the $71,000 support zone, where a significant rebound could occur. Capriole Investments suggests that the U.S. macroeconomic environment will ultimately determine Bitcoin’s next major move. Can U.S. Liquidity Boost Bitcoin Up? Perhaps a shift in U.S. monetary policy might be a game-changer for Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve has already started easing its tight policies, raising speculation about a return to quantitative easing (QE).

In his latest analysis , Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, warned about the impact of “higher than expected” US trade tariffs. ”Higher than expected” US tariffs pressure Bitcoin Bitcoin reacted noticeably worse than US stocks after President Donald Trump announced worldwide reciprocal trade tariffs on April 2. BTC/USD fell up to 8.5% on the day, while the S&P 500 managed to end the Wall Street trading session 0.7% higher. Edwards said that US business expectations are reflecting the type of uncertainty seen only three times since the turn of the millennium. “Consider this as tariffs come in higher than expected. The Philly Fed Business Outlook survey is showing expectations today comparable to 2000, 2008 and 2022,” he told X followers. An accompanying chart showed the Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey (BOS) back under 15 for the first time since the start of 2024. Late 2022 was the pit of the most recent crypto bear market when BTC/USD reversed at $15,600 . Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Survey vs. S&P 500. Source: Charles Edwards/X In Capriole’s latest market update on March 31, Edwards acknowledged that BOS data can produce unreliable signals regarding market sentiment but argued that it should not be ignored. “While no guarantee of the future outlook (this metric does have false signals) this is a data reading we have had before at very high risk zones (year 2000, 2008 and 2022), telling us to keep a very open mind,” he wrote, adding: “Especially if the tariff war escalates significantly beyond current expectations or corporate margins start to fall.” For Bitcoin, a key level to watch in the tariff aftermath is $91,000, with Capriole suggesting that US macroeconomic moves would “decide the ultimate technical trend from here.” “All else equal, a daily close above $91K would be a strong bullish reclaim signal,” the update explained alongside the weekly BTC/USD chart. “Failing that, a dip into the $71K zone would likely see a sizable bounce.” BTC/USD 1-day chart (screenshot).

M2 money supply, meanwhile, is due for an “influx,” something which has historically spawned major BTC price upside. “The BIG takeaway (the most important observation) is that a big M2 influx is coming. The exact date is less important,” analyst Colin Talks Crypto predicted in an X thread this week. A comparative chart hinted at a potential BTC price rebound by the start of May.

On a 14-day moving average, the hashrate, representing the computational power required to mine a block on the proof-of-work Bitcoin blockchain, recently reached an all-time high of 838 exahashes per second (EH/s), and on a 24-hour time frame, it spiked to 974 EH/s, the second highest level ever, according to Glassnode data. Measuring over a 24-hour window can be misleading due to block time variability, so longer timeframes give more reliable insights. In two days, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment — which recalibrates every 2016 blocks to maintain a 10-minute block interval — is expected to increase by over 3%, reaching a new peak. This divergence between hash rate and price is notable. While bitcoin remains about 25% below its all-time high, mining costs continue to rise. For miners to stay profitable and cover operational expenses and capital expenditures, a strong bitcoin price, full blocks and high transaction fees are essential. Currently, miners earn revenue through two channels: block rewards (3.125 BTC per block in the current epoch) and transaction fees. However, transaction fees are extremely low — averaging around 4 BTC per day, or roughly $377,634. As bitcoin’s block subsidy continues to halve every four years, sustained or increasing transaction activity will be critical to maintaining mining incentives. Near empty blocks Developer Mononaut , from Mempool, recently noted that Foundry USA Pool mined the emptiest ""non-empty"" block in over two years, containing just seven transactions — a rarity only surpassed by a block with four transactions back in January 2023. In other words, while the rising hashrate paints a picture of a booming network, the near-empty blocks make it the case of a powerful train speeding down the tracks but without passengers. That's a cause for concern for Nicolas Gregory , creator of the Mercury Layer and a former Nasdaq Board Director. “Half-empty bitcoin blocks tell a tale — hawking the store-of-value line could scupper its future,"" Gregory said on X. ""I hope bitcoiners realize this space is more than just podcasts, spaces, and the ‘number go up’ digital gold narrative. If we don’t get people using bitcoin for real commerce, it’s game over,"" Gregory added.",Markets|Hashrate|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 10:11:11

42848731,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145878,1743680416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Spot-Quoted Crypto Futures: CME Group’s Bold Move for Bitcoin and Ethereum,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cme-group-spot-quoted-futures/,"Get ready for a seismic shift in the cryptocurrency derivatives landscape! The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, a titan in the global derivatives market, has just dropped a bombshell announcement. They’re planning to launch groundbreaking Spot-Quoted futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and major U.S. equity indices. This exciting development, slated for June 30th pending regulatory green light, promises to inject fresh dynamism and accessibility into how investors engage with both crypto and traditional markets. What are Spot-Quoted Futures and Why Should You Care About CME Group Futures? Let’s break down what Spot-Quoted futures actually mean and why this move by CME Group futures is a game-changer. Traditional futures contracts often rely on complex pricing mechanisms that can sometimes feel detached from the immediate, real-time value of an asset. Spot-Quoted futures , on the other hand, are designed to mirror the ‘spot price’ – that’s the current market price you see flashing on financial news outlets and investment platforms. This direct correlation offers a more transparent and intuitive trading experience. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and seasoned traders alike, the introduction of these CME Group futures represents a significant leap forward. Imagine trading futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ethereum where the pricing is directly linked to the spot market. This offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Transparency: No more deciphering complex pricing models. Spot-Quoted futures provide a clear and direct link to the real-time market value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Simplified Trading: The straightforward pricing mechanism makes these futures contracts easier to understand and trade, potentially attracting a broader range of investors, from institutional players to sophisticated retail traders. Efficient Risk Management: Hedging strategies become more precise and effective when futures prices closely track spot prices. This is crucial for managing risk in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: CME Group’s reputation and regulatory compliance provide a trusted platform for institutional investors to gain exposure to crypto assets through futures, potentially driving further adoption and liquidity. Bitcoin Futures and Ethereum Futures: A New Era of Crypto Derivatives Trading? The inclusion of Bitcoin futures and Ethereum futures in this launch is particularly noteworthy. These two cryptocurrencies dominate the market, and offering Spot-Quoted futures for them through a reputable exchange like CME Group could unlock substantial new trading volumes and opportunities. Why is this exciting for Bitcoin and Ethereum specifically? Increased Liquidity: The introduction of Spot-Quoted futures on a major exchange like CME Group can significantly boost liquidity for both Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. Broader Market Participation: By simplifying access and pricing, these futures could attract a wider range of participants to the Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives markets, including those previously hesitant due to complexity. Price Discovery Enhancement: Tighter alignment between futures and spot prices can contribute to more efficient price discovery in the underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. Sophisticated Trading Strategies: The availability of Spot-Quoted futures empowers traders to implement more sophisticated strategies, such as arbitrage between spot and futures markets, basis trading, and more refined hedging techniques. Beyond Crypto: Spot-Quoted Futures for Major U.S. Indices While the cryptocurrency aspect is undoubtedly grabbing headlines, it’s important to note that CME Group futures expansion isn’t limited to digital assets. The launch also encompasses Spot-Quoted futures for four key U.S. equity indices: the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, Russell 2000, and Dow Jones Industrial Average. This broadens the appeal and utility of these new futures contracts considerably. What does this mean for traditional market investors? Consistent Pricing: Just like with crypto, Spot-Quoted futures for indices offer a pricing mechanism directly linked to the real-time index values, simplifying trading and analysis. Diversification Opportunities: Investors can utilize these futures alongside crypto futures for diversified trading strategies within a single, regulated platform. Enhanced Market Access: CME Group’s established infrastructure and global reach provide investors with robust and reliable access to trading futures on major U.S. equity indices. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the outlook for Spot-Quoted futures is overwhelmingly positive, it’s also prudent to consider potential challenges and aspects to watch: Challenge Consideration Regulatory Approval The launch is pending regulatory approval, which is a crucial step. Delays or unforeseen regulatory hurdles could impact the planned June 30th launch date. Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While Spot-Quoted futures offer transparency, they also expose traders to the inherent price swings of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Adoption Rate While anticipated to be high, the actual adoption rate of these new futures contracts will determine their long-term success and impact on the market. Liquidity Fragmentation Introducing new futures contracts could potentially fragment liquidity across different types of futures products. However, CME Group’s strong market presence aims to mitigate this risk. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors So, how can you prepare for the launch of CME Group futures and potentially capitalize on these new trading instruments? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from CME Group and regulatory updates regarding the launch date and contract specifications. Educate Yourself: Familiarize yourself with the mechanics of Spot-Quoted futures and how they differ from traditional futures contracts. Understand the pricing and settlement processes. Risk Assessment: Carefully assess your risk tolerance and develop appropriate risk management strategies for trading cryptocurrency and index futures. Platform Readiness: Ensure your trading platform and brokerage account are equipped to handle futures trading on CME Group. Strategy Development: Start exploring potential trading strategies that leverage Spot-Quoted futures, such as arbitrage, hedging, and directional trading. Conclusion: A Powerful Step Forward for Crypto and Traditional Markets CME Group’s initiative to launch Spot-Quoted futures is undeniably a powerful move that could reshape the derivatives trading landscape for both cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. By offering a more transparent, accessible, and efficient way to trade futures linked to real-time spot prices, CME Group is paving the way for greater institutional participation, enhanced market liquidity, and more sophisticated trading opportunities. As we approach the anticipated June 30th launch date, the financial world is watching with bated breath to see the transformative impact of these revolutionary new futures contracts.

What Does This Mean? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-hash-rate-reaches-record-level-what-does-this-mean-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin’s hash rate has risen to a record high, pointing to a growing disconnect between network security and real-world usage. Bitcoin Hash Rate Hits Record, But Network Activity Remains Weak Despite miners dedicating more computing power than ever before, low transaction fees and nearly empty blocks are raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin’s network economics. Bitcoin’s 14-day moving average hash rate recently reached an all-time high of 838 exahashes per second (EH/s), while its 24-hour hash rate rose to the second-highest level ever recorded at 974 EH/s, according to Glassnode. The network difficulty adjustment, which ensures a consistent block time of around 10 minutes, is expected to increase by over 3% in the coming days, setting a new high. But this increase in mining power is not in line with Bitcoin’s broader market trends. Bitcoin’s price remains 25% below its all-time high, while transaction activity and fees remain alarmingly low. Bitcoin miners generate revenue through block rewards (currently 3,125 BTC per block) and transaction fees. However, transaction fees have dropped to just 4 BTC per day, meaning miners rely heavily on block rewards for profitability. With Bitcoin’s block subsidy halving every four years, low transaction activity could threaten mining incentives over time. Experts Warn of Future Risks Industry experts worry that Bitcoin’s “store of value” narrative could hinder its long-term adoption, which prioritizes holding BTC over spending. As Bitcoin’s security and mining costs continue to rise, the long-term health of the network may depend on increasing real-world adoption and transaction activity beyond speculation and digital gold rhetoric. *This is not investment advice.

Martinez tells his 134,700 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is forming a bearish pattern against Bitcoin on the monthly chart. According to Martinez, Ethereum could plummet by 91% from the current level. Based on an inverted chart of the ETH/BTC pair, the analyst appears to be suggesting that the pair is forming a double-top pattern or an M pattern on the monthly time frame. A double-top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern. “From this angle, the ETH/BTC trading pair could be heading to 0.0020 BTC!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Ethereum is trading at 0.02205 BTC ($1,866) at time of writing. Citing data from crypto analytics platform Santiment, Martinez says that Ethereum whales sold 760,000 ETH, worth approximately $1.42 billion at current prices, over the past two weeks. Source: Ali Martinez/X The crypto analyst and trader also says that during the last five weeks, whale activity on the Ethereum network has plummeted. “Since February 25th, the number of large Ethereum transactions has declined by 63.8%, signaling a drop in whale activity on the network.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Turning to Bitcoin, Martinez says that after the crypto king plunged below the 200-day and 50-day moving averages (MA) recently, the two moving averages are acting as resistance levels. Based on the analyst’s chart, it appears he’s suggesting that Bitcoin is on the cusp of forming a death cross, a bearish indicator that occurs when the 200-day and 500-day moving averages converge. “Bitcoin faces the 200-day MA at $86,200 and the 50-day MA at $88,300 as key resistance ahead!

Both senators were joined by three other Republicans, including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski, who voted to end the economic emergency that was imposed in February. The senators voted in disapproval of Trump’s tariffs on Canada just a few hours after he announced he would impose a 10% tariff on all imports. The President also revealed he would levy even higher rates on imports from the European Union, China, Vietnam, and Japan. He announced on Wednesday that he was imposing what he termed “reciprocal tariffs” on about 60 nations but exempted Canada and Mexico. Both countries are still facing tariffs under separate policies targeting aluminum and steel, which took effect in February. The resolution required the support of at least four Republicans for approval, with the chamber’s 47 Democrats and independents. The President pressured the GOP before the vote, arguing that “Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job and end the scourge.” U.S. Senate votes to end Trump’s tariffs on Canada Several Republican senators joined Democrats to vote against Trump’s tariffs on Canada, which marked a rare move against the President’s trade policy just hours after he announced plans for sweeping import taxes. The Senate voted to end Trump’s tariffs on Canada with a 51-48 vote led by four Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Kentucky senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul. Trump unveiled sweeping new tariffs in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Wednesday but did not include additional levies on Canada. The Senate vote against Trump’s tariffs on the nation amounted to a significant bipartisan condemnation of his escalating global trade war with allies and enemies alike. The President noted that “it would be devastating for the Republican Party and, far more importantly, for the United States.” The Senate’s vote has practically no chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and being signed by Trump, as he vowed that “I, as your President, will never sign it.” The vote also showed the limits of Republican support for Trump’s vision of remaking the U.S. economy since it was the first serious attempt by Congress at limiting the President’s ability to restrict free trade. The Senate’s resolution passing the House will also be a challenge due to changes that House Republicans pushed through last month. The new rules adopted last month will force the Senate-passed resolution to pass through the House’s committee process, which is a journey that is highly unlikely to be completed anytime soon. Senators unravel their take on Trump’s tariffs on Canada Senator Rand Paul stressed the economic damage tariffs will likely cause American families, businesses, and farmers. He noted that estimates showed that tariffs will increase the cost of homes, cars, and many consumer goods. “We’re not at war with Canada. They’re an ally that buys more of our stuff than almost any other country in the world.” -Rand Paul, U.S. Senator from Kentucky. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, the bill’s sponsor, argued that “tariffs will hurt our families” and that Canada was not their enemy. The politician added that the U.S. should not impose punishing costs on American families at a time when they can’t afford it. He also highlighted, “Let’s not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive.” Senator Collins defended her vote and argued that tariffs would hurt working families in her state of Maine, which shares a long border with Canada. She maintained that “the price hikes that will happen for Maine families … if these tariffs go into effect, will be so harmful.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune urged Republicans before the vote to oppose the resolution. Thune argued that the tariffs were needed to “ensure that President Trump has the tools to combat the flow of fentanyl from all directions.” Trump had blasted the Republican senators on Truth Social for championing the resolution aimed at undoing the tariffs against Canada. He also implored them to “get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats’ wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl.” Senator Collins also mentioned that fentanyl from Canada was not a major threat to the U.S., as Trump’s national emergency claimed. She acknowledged that “the fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned eight crypto addresses that data from blockchain forensic firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs had linked to the organizations. Two are deposit addresses at major crypto platforms, while the other six are privately controlled. Visualization of transaction flow related to OFAC sanctions. Source: Chainalysis The addresses in question reportedly moved nearly $1 billion worth of funds linked to sanctioned entities. Most of the transactions funded Houthi operations in Yemen and the Red Sea region. Slava Demchuk, a crypto-focused money laundering specialist and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime consultant told Cointelegraph that “the inclusion of Houthi-linked wallets reflects a broader recognition of crypto’s role in geopolitical conflicts and terrorism financing.” He added: “The implications are far-reaching — compliance frameworks must adapt swiftly, attribution efforts will intensify, and decentralized platforms may face increased scrutiny.“ Demchuk highlighted that the situation reshapes the regulatory landscape. According to him, crypto “is now firmly within the scope of international security. Who are the Houthis? The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, are a Yemeni political and armed movement that emerged from the Zaidi Shia community. Originating as a revivalist and reformist group, they later became a major force in Yemen’s ongoing conflict. Related: US DOJ says it seized Hamas crypto meant to finance terrorism In recent years, the Houthis have engaged in attacks against both military and civilian vessels in the Red Sea with missiles and drones. In January, US President Donald Trump designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization. The announcement noted that “the Houthis’ activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade.” The group was recently struck by a US bombing campaign.

At the time, Tether — the leading stablecoin operator and issuer of USDt — froze $27 million in USDt on the platform , forcing it to halt operations. The platform has reportedly shifted millions of dollars as it sought to reboot under its new brand, “Grinex. ” In mid-March, officials with India’s Central Bureau of Investigation announced the arrest of Lithuanian national Aleksej Bešciokov, who was alleged to have operated the cryptocurrency exchange Garantex. The arrest of the alleged Garantex founder was based on US charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

This outlook fits with the crypto market pessimism observed over the past few weeks. Let’s explore XRP price prediction for today and key levels to watch as Bitcoin holds $82K. XRP price today trades at $2.02 after dropping 5.35% on April 2. With a market cap of $117 billion as of April 3, will the token bounce from here or crash lower? XRP’s Head And Shoulders Setup Hints Double-Digit Correction On the daily chart, the XRP price shows the formation of a clear head-and-shoulders setup. This pattern hints at correction if the key neckline is breached. For Ripple (XRP), this level is $2. A breakdown of this level will complete the pattern and predict a 38% correction for XRP price to $1.23. XRP/USDT 1-day chart shows Bearish Head-and-Shoudlers Setup The XRP price prediction for today is slightly bearish, assuming the aforementioned level is breached. But will the token fall below this key level? The crypto market outlook also looks bleak with Bitcoin price holding above $82K . XRP Technical Analysis The four-hour chart shows the consolidation since December 2, 2024, has created a value area that extends from $2.11 to $2.60. The highest volume for this area was traded at $2.40, making it a key resistance level. If XRP price defends the selling climax at $1.95, it will be the first sign of a bullish outlook. The second bullish signal will come if Ripple’s value establishes a support above $2.11, which is the value area’s range low. This development could provide a decent long trade setup, where XRP price could rally 13% until it encounters the critcal resistance level at $2.40. If buyers stay strong, the token could extend up to $2.60, which is the value area’s range high. XRP/USDT 4-hour chart On the other hand, a breakdown of this level will confirm the bearish outlook emphasized by the head-and-shoulders pattern. Such a scenario will see XRP price revisit $1.23 support level.

Hopes for a recovery rest on potential exchange listings from Binance or Coinbase. From a Supporter to a Critic Pi Network’s native token witnessed another correction in the past 24 hours, with its price tanking by 7%. Currently, it trades at around $0.63 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a whopping 65% decline in the last month. Its massive retreat as of late seems to have changed the sentiment of even its hardcore fans. The X user MOON JEFF, who recently predicted that PI could skyrocket to an all-time high of $5, joined the critics’ corner. The analyst claimed that Pi Network is “now a slow rug,” criticizing the team behind the project: “The team is not delivering what they promised. They promised 100 Dapps on launch, but only less than 5 are working.” According to MOON JEFF, PI’s potential spike to $1 is “just a dream,” while breaking above that point is “just another dream.” Besides lambasting the project, the analyst noted that the coin’s daily unlocks “are back in millions.” “The daily unlocks will kill PI. The daily selling pressure is insane.” Earlier this week, Watch .Guru revealed that more than 121 million PI tokens will be unlocked in the next 30 days. The increased circulating supply could further negatively influence price performance (assuming demand doesn’t react accordingly). Currently, the amount of tokens in circulation stands just below 6.8 billion, meaning that over 90% of the total designated supply has yet to enter the market. The de facto circulating supply constitutes locked mining rewards and unlocked mining rewards. The latest data shows that almost 75% of the tokens remain locked, raising uncertainty about how the price will react once this amount frees up. What Can Stop the Freefall? One important factor that may prevent PI’s price from further collapsing and even put the asset on the green track again is support from leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Such a development will increase the token’s liquidity, boost its accessibility, and positively impact its reputation. Binance issued a vote in February to determine whether its users wish to see PI trading on the platform. More than 86% of the voters clicked the “yes” option, but the company remains silent on the matter . Coinbase was also rumored to embrace PI. Paul Grewal (the company’s chief legal officer) triggered enthusiasm across the Pi Network community in mid-March when saying: “We take PiDay at Coinbase very seriously.” Despite the interaction, there hasn’t been a follow-up, and the asset remains unavailable on the US-based cryptocurrency exchange.

This resilience stands out in a market rattled by economic uncertainty, hinting at underlying strengths tied to BNB’s role in the Binance ecosystem and recent developments that could shape its future. Impact of Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs Trump’s tariffs sent shockwaves through global markets, unsettling even cryptocurrencies, which are often seen as a buffer against traditional financial volatility. While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP have struggled to bounce back, BNB’s quick recovery points to strong community support and its utility as Binance’s native token. Traders use Binance Coin (BNB) for discounted fees and exclusive services on the world’s largest crypto exchange, giving it a practical edge that helps stabilize its value during turbulent times. VanEck filed for a BNB ETF in the US On March 31, 2025, VanEck, a prominent investment firm, filed to establish a trust entity for a proposed BNB exchange-traded fund in Delaware. VanEck BNB ETF entity registration filing with Delaware’s Department of State If approved, this would be the first US-based BNB ETF, and it would let investors tap into Binance Coin without owning it directly, potentially drawing in institutional money and boosting adoption. Notably, VanEck’s track record with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs adds weight to this move, marking it as a significant step for BNB’s mainstream appeal. Binance Coin price technical analysis Despite the upbeat BNB news, BNB’s price hasn’t soared as some might expect. Technical signals paint a cautious picture, with the Aroon indicator showing a bearish tilt with its Down line at 92.86% far outpacing the Up line at 35.71%. Other metrics, like a fading Awesome Oscillator and a slipping Money Flow Index, suggest weakening momentum and buying interest, hinting at possible dips toward $575.3 or even $532.6 if the downward pressure persists.

VanEck’s ETF filing offers a potential catalyst that could boost BNB’s status, but technical indicators suggest caution is warranted. Bearish indicators and sour sentiment suggest a slide to $575 or below might loom if market conditions worsen.

Investors watched anxiously as the value fluctuated, prompting immediate action from the project’s leadership. Suji Yan, the founder and CEO of Mask Network, stepped forward to address the situation directly, offering reassurance and a promise of swift resolution. Let’s delve into the details of this developing story and understand what it means for MASK holders and the broader crypto ecosystem. Why is Everyone Talking About the MASK Price Drop? The crypto market is known for its volatility, but the recent sharp decline in the MASK price has raised eyebrows and triggered widespread discussion. When a token associated with a project like Mask Network, which aims to bridge Web2 and Web3, sees such a pronounced downturn, it’s natural for investors to seek answers. The dip wasn’t just a minor fluctuation; it was a noticeable drop that caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. Here’s a quick snapshot of the situation: Sudden Downturn: MASK experienced a sharp price decrease, causing concern among holders. CEO’s Response: Suji Yan, Mask Network CEO, acknowledged the issue on X (formerly Twitter). Investigation Underway: The Mask Network team is actively investigating the reasons behind the crypto price drop . Promise of Solution: Yan stated a solution is expected within 1-2 days, aiming to reassure the community. Market Data: As of recent data, MASK is trading around $1.27, reflecting a decrease in the last 24 hours. Suji Yan Addresses the Crypto Community: What Did the Mask Network CEO Say? Transparency and communication are crucial in the crypto space, especially during times of uncertainty. Suji Yan , recognizing the community’s need for information, took to social media platform X to deliver a message directly to MASK holders and the wider crypto audience. His statement was concise but aimed to address the immediate concerns and outline the next steps. In his message, Suji Yan stated: “We are aware of the recent sharp drop in MASK’s price and are actively investigating the cause. Solution will come out in 1-2 days. Reaffirming the project’s long-term vision and commitment to sustainability.” This message, while brief, conveys several key points: Acknowledgement: Yan directly acknowledges the MASK price drop , showing awareness of the issue. Active Investigation: He highlights that the team is not passive but actively working to understand the root cause. Timely Solution: The promise of a solution within 1-2 days indicates a sense of urgency and commitment to resolving the problem quickly. Long-Term Vision: Reaffirming the project’s long-term vision aims to instill confidence and remind the community of the bigger picture beyond short-term price fluctuations. Commitment to Sustainability: This emphasizes the project’s dedication to long-term growth and stability, addressing concerns about the project’s future. The Shadow of the Crypto Hack: Is There a Connection to the MASK Price? Adding another layer of complexity to the situation is the recent revelation by Suji Yan about a personal security breach. Just days before the MASK price drop intensified, on February 27th, Yan disclosed that she had fallen victim to a crypto hack , resulting in a loss of approximately $4 million in assets, including ETH, MASK, and USDT. This unfortunate event naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the current price volatility. Could the crypto hack be related to the recent MASK price drop ? While it’s difficult to establish a direct causal link without further investigation, it’s important to consider the potential connections: Possible Connection Explanation Market Sentiment News of a CEO being hacked, especially with assets including MASK, could create negative sentiment around the token, leading to sell-offs and price decrease. Asset Liquidation While less likely to be a direct cause of a sharp drop across exchanges, large unexpected liquidations (if any were to occur due to the hack) can sometimes contribute to market instability. Wider Security Concerns The hack might raise broader concerns about security within the Mask Network ecosystem, even if the hack was personal, potentially affecting investor confidence. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and pinpointing a single cause for price fluctuations is often challenging. The Mask Network team’s investigation will be vital in determining the exact reasons behind the MASK price drop and whether the crypto hack played any role. Navigating Crypto Price Volatility: What Can Investors Learn? The recent events surrounding Mask Network and the MASK price serve as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. For investors, both seasoned and new, these situations offer valuable lessons and highlight the importance of informed decision-making and risk management. Here are some key takeaways for navigating crypto price drop scenarios and the volatile crypto landscape: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with project announcements, market news, and on-chain data to understand potential factors influencing price movements. Follow official channels like Mask Network’s X account and reputable crypto news sources. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto portfolio across different projects can help mitigate risk. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Consider using tools like stop-loss orders to manage potential downsides. Due Diligence: Before investing in any crypto project, conduct thorough research. Understand the project’s fundamentals, team, technology, and tokenomics. Community Engagement: Engage with the project’s community to gauge sentiment and stay informed about developments. However, always cross-verify information from community sources with official announcements. Security Awareness: The crypto hack incident involving Suji Yan underscores the importance of personal security. Practice robust security measures to protect your crypto assets. Patience and Perspective: Crypto markets can be cyclical. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price swings. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Mask Network and MASK? As the crypto community awaits the outcome of Mask Network’s investigation, all eyes are on the promised solution expected within the next two days. The way the team addresses this MASK price drop and communicates with its community will be crucial in shaping investor confidence and the future trajectory of the project. Suji Yan ‘s reaffirmation of the project’s long-term vision is a positive signal, but concrete actions and transparent communication will be essential to rebuild trust and navigate through this challenging period. The situation with Mask Network and the crypto price drop is a dynamic one. Keep an eye on official announcements from Mask Network and follow reputable crypto news outlets for the latest updates. The coming days will be critical in determining the next chapter for MASK and the project’s resilience in the face of market volatility and unforeseen challenges.

Recently, ETH has dropped below $1,900. The blockchain faces stiff competition from newer ones like Solana and Avalanche. While some analysts believe Ethereum’s fundamentals remain solid, others worry that ETH could remain trapped in a bearish cycle without a strong catalyst. Meanwhile, a viral ETH-based token, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is gaining massive traction and is predicted to grow explosively. The question now is: Can Ethereum match the momentum of this rising star? Ethereum (ETH): struggling to reclaim key levels amid bearish pressure Ethereum is under pressure as its price has fallen below $1,900. After losing the $2000 mark, Ethereum’s price dropped to $1,750. This represents its lowest point in months. At press time, it trades at $1898. ETH/USD 1D Price Chart| Source: TradingView Should bulls lose control, ETH might keep falling, making recovery even more challenging. Ethereum shows no indication of significant intense buying activity. According to on-chain statistics, the price action is dominated by more sell orders than buy orders. Thus, Ethereum remains in a negative cycle. Rising competitiveness in the crypto market is another factor influencing Ethereum’s bearish trend. Solana and Avalanche are two new layer-1 blockchains drawing more interest and liquidity than Ethereum, which is trying to keep leadership. Further changes at the Ethereum Foundation and uncertainty about forthcoming improvements have led to negative sentiment. These factors dampen ETH’s recovery potential. Some analysts feel Ethereum’s fundamentals are still robust, citing continuous institutional interest and network enhancements. Meanwhile, others fear that without a clear trigger, ETH can stay stuck in a bearish cycle. Ethereum has to recover the $2,000 mark and create firm support above it. The first indication of actual strength would be a breakout over $2,300. A target range of $2,700 to $3,000 will help to validate a complete rebound. If ETH keeps declining and dips below $1,800, the next stop may be $1,500, indicating even more losses. While ETH’s long-term potential still looks unshaken, a viral ETH-based coin has gained traction with claims of enormous returns. Many people have started to wonder if Ethereum can still yield comparable profits. ETH has historically emerged from significant declines. However, its capacity to match the momentum of this new and trending token is yet unlikely. Rexas Finance (RXS): the viral ETH-based token with 100x potential While Ethereum remains a dominant force in the crypto market, many investors are now looking at RXS as a token with the potential to outpace ETH in terms of growth. Rexas Finance has garnered investors’ attention as one of the most promising Ethereum-based projects to deliver massive gains in 2025. Built on Ethereum’s secure and scalable network, Rexas Finance is leading the charge in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Experts believe this industry will see explosive adoption in the coming years. Rexas Finance offers investors a unique opportunity to own fractional shares of real-world assets like real estate and artwork. These assets were previously challenging to own because of their high cost. However, tokenization breaks these assets into fractions represented digitally. Hence, people with low capital can now enter the market and benefit from these lucrative investment opportunities. Rexas Finance is more than just another token riding Ethereum’s success—it brings a suite of innovative tools that enhance its ecosystem. The Rexas Token Builder enables users to create and manage their own tokens without requiring extensive technical knowledge. The QuickMint Bot integrates with messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord for easy asset tokenization. Meanwhile, the Rexas Estate marketplace enables seamless fractional ownership of real estate. Hence, property investment is more accessible than ever. These features set Rexas Finance apart as a high-utility Ethereum-based token with long-term potential. With nearly 457 million tokens already sold and $47.3 million raised during its presale, demand for RXS has already surpassed expectations. The presale is in its final stage with RXS selling for $0.20. The token’s official launch is drawing near, creating more excitement. With the launch set for June 19, analysts predict a significant price surge once it lists on major exchanges. Some forecast gains that could outshine Ethereum’s performance as ETH’s momentum slows. Analysts believe it could see high demand, leading to a supply squeeze that will trigger a massive rally. Predictions suggest that RXS could hit $25 before the year ends, making it one of the most promising tokens for 2025. The increasing competition and unrelentless bearish pressure makes ETH’s recovery potential uncertain. Thus, Rexas Finance is standing out as a better alternative. As RXS gears up for its official launch with massive demand and bullish predictions, it may just be the Ethereum-based token to watch in 2025.

In a recent development, Brazil’s largest bank, Itaú Unibanco, is exploring the launch of a proprietary stablecoin, potentially extending its services to more than 55 million customers. Significantly, Brazil’s move aligns with the global trend of exploring the potential of stablecoins. Before finalizing the decision, the bank is watching other financial institutions that have already adopted these stable crypto assets. Largest Bank in Brazil Issues Stablecoin: What To Know? According to a local report , the largest Brazilian bank, Itaú Unibanco, has taken the initiative to launch an in-house stablecoin. This move comes amid the increasing global interest in stablecoins as an alternative to the highly volatile cryptocurrencies. Guto Antunes, Itaú Unibanco’s digital asset head, asserted that the bank is open to exploring the possibility of creating a stablecoin pegged to the Brazilian real (BRL). The bank is currently exploring the potential benefits and feasibility these digital assets for their clients. He cited, We are always open to understanding for our client whether it makes sense to have a stablecoin, even one in reals, within Itaú.” US Crypto Regulations Influence Brazil The US government has been undergoing a significant regulatory overhaul under President Trump. With the restructuring of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the regulatory landscape has seen a major shit, leading to the dismissal of multiple crypto lawsuits. In addition, the Trump government has given a specific focus on stablecoin regulation and growth. Recently, the US passed the STABLE Act , introducing exclusive guidelines for USD-pegged digital assets like USDT and USDC. Interestingly, the Brazilian bank’s proposal to issue a stablecoin is primarily driven by the US’ progressive stance on digital assets. Antunes commented that the bank has been influenced by America’s stablecoin developments. He noted, Of course, it is always on the agenda. The issue of stablecoins has always been on Itaú’s radar. We cannot ignore the power that blockchain has to settle transactions atomically. Brazil Prohibits Pension Funds from Investing in Crypto In a recent development, Brazil’s financial policy body, the National Monetary Council (CMN) issued a ban on pension funds’ crypto investments. The organization cited concerns about crypto assets’ inherent risks as the key reason for the decision. Meanwhile, the Brazilian bank’s plans to issue a stablecoin comes following the Cardano Foundation’s expansion into the country. Recently, Cardano joined hands with SERPRO , the Brazilian government’s information technology company.

Markets panicked after President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on global trading partners. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) plunged from an intraday high of $88,554 on Wednesday, dropping to a low of $82,321, a decline of over 3%. The flagship cryptocurrency is attempting a recovery during the current session but remains marginally down over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a substantial decline on Wednesday, falling to a low of $1,785 before rebounding to reclaim $1,800 and settle at $1,824. ETH is still struggling to build momentum and push towards $2,000. Ripple (XRP) almost fell below $2 as selling pressure intensified on Wednesday. However, it clung on to this level and registered a marginal increase to $2.06. Solana (SOL) registered a substantial decline as it fell below $120 and currently trades at $119. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 2%, while Cardano (ADA) is down over 2%. Toncoin (TON) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial declines. Crypto Market Meltdown The crypto market saw a substantial decline as major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and SOL, plunged into the red after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs. BTC fell to a low of $82,321 as sellers overwhelmed the support at $83,000. While the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered during the current session, trading volumes remain low. BTC had been trading above $88,000 in the leadup to Trump’s Liberation Day speech. Donald Trump formally announced reciprocal tariffs against several countries, including long-time allies and trading partners. While stocks and crypto had risen in the leadup to the speech, many were hit hard during after-hours trading. China faces a 34% rate and the European Union faces a 20% levy, while Japan will see a 24% rate. John Wu, President at Ava Labs, stated, “As a risk-on asset, cryptocurrencies have generally traded poorly during periods of uncertainty following announcements such as steady high rates or the introduction of trade tariffs.” The CEO of crypto research platform DYOR, Ben Kurland, believes markets will dip in the short term, stating, “Markets will likely dip in the short term, not because of the tariffs themselves, but because of what they represent: the return of policy-driven volatility. Traders hate unpredictability, and this signals more is coming.” Crypto Market Could Bottom Before June According to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, the crypto market could hit its lowest point in the next two months, with a 70% chance it will happen before June. The timing of the bottom depends on the outcome of ongoing global tariff negotiations, particularly the reciprocal import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump. The tariffs, intended to reduce the US trade deficit and boost manufacturing, have created uncertainty across financial markets. Trump unveiled the latest salvo of tariffs on April 2, intending to address a $1.2 trillion trade deficit. Markets have already shown volatility in response to previous announcements and have registered a substantial decline following the announcement of the latest tariffs. BTC and ETH are trading 15% and 22% below their all-time highs, as markets remain stagnant and overly cautious. BTC has been consolidating between $82,000 and $88,000 and has shown limited movement after a period of recalibration during the first quarter. A break above BTC’s consolidation range could signal positive momentum and push the flagship cryptocurrency past $90,000. Crypto Fear And Greed Index Drops To Extreme Fear The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 25, dropping 19 points from the previous day, pushing it into “Extreme Fear” territory. The drop comes after President Donald Trump announced aggressive reciprocal tariffs that are unsettling the traditional and crypto markets. Trump set a 10% baseline tariff on imports, with significantly higher rates for specific countries. China was subjected to a 54% tariff, combining a new 34% rate with an existing 20% duty. A 20% rate was also imposed on the European Union, while Vietnam (46%), Taiwan (32%), India (26%), and Japan (24%) were also impacted by the new tariffs. However, Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from the 10% baseline tariff and additional reciprocal levies. According to reports, the 10% tariff would only be imposed if Trump withdraws the 25% duties currently in place on the two countries. Trump has also imposed a 25% tariff on all cars made in other countries, which will come into effect at midnight on April 4. While investors are skeptical, Trump has promised the tariffs would protect American industries and lead to lower prices. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $85,000 in the runup to President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day speech as markets braced for the impact of Trump’s tariff announcements. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to an intraday high of $88,554 as momentum picked up. However, BTC registered a substantial decline following the address as the full extent of Trump’s tariffs was realized. Analysts had warned of a potential decline to $76,000 in the event of negative reactions to tariffs. “In crypto, sentiment remains broadly subdued. BTC continues to trade without conviction, while ETH holds the line at $1,800 in support. Across the board, crypto markets are showing signs of exhaustion, with numerous coins down 90% YTD, with some shedding over 30% in the past week. Without a material shift in macro or a compelling catalyst, we don't expect a meaningful reversal. While light positioning could support a grind higher, we're not chasing any upside moves until the broader macro picture improves.” BTC’s post-speech decline can be attributed to tariffs adversely impacting risk appetite, triggering a slump in risky assets. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged over 4%, dropping to a low of $82,321 before recovering during the ongoing session. BTC’s price action has largely revolved around Trump’s tariff announcement. The asset started the previous week on a positive note, rising almost 2% on Monday, racing to an intraday high of $88,839 before settling at $87,523. BTC encountered selling pressure and volatility on Tuesday and registered a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC registered another marginal drop to slip below $87,000 and settle at $86,942. The price recovered on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC plunged over 3%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $84,422. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish over the weekend as the price dropped over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,704. Sellers retained control on Sunday as BTC registered a marginal decline to end the weekend at $82,404. BRC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $82,511.

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to an intraday high of $88,554 in the leadup to Trump’s Liberation Day speech. However, markets turned bearish, and BTC dropped over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,535. The current session sees BTC up over 1% and trading at $83,680 as buyers look to build momentum and push back above $85,000. However, if sellers regain control, the flagship cryptocurrency could plunge to $80,000 or lower. The MACD suggests buyers have the upper hand, indicating BTC could see an uptrend. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) registered a substantial decline following Trump’s Liberation Day speech and the announcement of sweeping tariffs on allies and trading partners. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down almost 3% over the past 24 hours and 10% over the week as selling pressure intensifies thanks to a risk-averse market sentiment. However, it's not all doom and gloom for Ethereum as it reclaimed the top spot in decentralized exchange trading volume for the first time since September 2024. Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges handled $64 billion in spot trading volume compared to $52 billion by their Solana-based counterparts. Meanwhile, BSC-based decentralized exchanges handled $44 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama. However, Ethereum’s fee generation has registered a sharp decline. It earned $142 million in transaction fees in January, a figure that fell to $21 million in March. According to data from Ultrasound Money, just 53 ETH was burned per day last week. Additionally, ETH’s total supply has grown over 3% since EIP-1559, raising concerns about ETH’s long-term potential. ETH struggled during Q1, ending down 45%. The price registered a substantial increase last week, rising almost 4% on Monday to move past the 20-day SMA and $2,000 to settle at $2,082. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and registered a marginal decline on Tuesday, falling to $2,068. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as ETH dropped almost 3% and settled at $2,010. Sellers retained control on Thursday as ETH dipped to $2,003 after a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Friday as ETH plunged over 5%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,000 and settling at $1,897. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as ETH registered a drop of almost 4% on Saturday and 1.14% on Sunday to settle at $1,807. Despite the bearish weekend, ETH started the current week positively, rising nearly 1% on Monday. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH registered an increase of 4.57% and settled at $1,905. The price surged to an intraday high of $1,953 on Wednesday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped almost 6% to settle at $1,794. The current session sees ETH up over 1% and trading at $1,817 after reclaiming $1,800. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has been trading downwards since failing to move past $150 last week. The decline comes despite a strong start to the previous week, starting with an increase of over 6% on Monday, taking the price past $140 to $141. SOL continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising almost 2% and settling at $143 after reaching an intraday high of $147. SOL lost momentum on Wednesday, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, the price dropped over 4% to $137 before registering a marginal recovery on Thursday to settle at $138. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as SOL fell over 6%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $130 to settle at $129. Sellers retained control on Saturday, pushing SOL down by almost 4% to $124. Source: TradingView SOL registered a marginal increase on Sunday despite the overwhelming selling pressure to end the weekend on a positive note. However, SOL was back in the red on Monday, registering a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as the price registered an increase of almost 2% and settled at $126. SOL surged to an intraday high of $136 on Wednesday as markets rallied in the runup to Trump’s Liberation Day speech. However, sentiment changed following the speech. As a result, SOL plunged over 7%, slipping below $120 and a key support level to settle at $117. SOL has recovered during the ongoing session, with the price up over 1% and trading at $118. Buyers will look to retain control and push SOL back above $120. Failure to break above this level could allow sellers to drive the price to $100. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) has declined substantially since the weekend as it plunged below key moving averages and support levels. TIA started the previous week with an increase of almost 3%, moving to $3.64. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose over 1% to $3.69.

Backed by a troupe of heavyweight traditional finance (TradFi) companies including Standard Chartered, Zodia offers segregated custody and off-venue settlement. This means users can trade on Bybit while their assets remain in Zodia's custody, thus reducing exposure to on-exchange risks and preventing co-mingling of funds. The attack on Bybit in February saw nearly $1.5 billion worth of digital assets stolen and was the largest hack of a crypto exchange in dollar terms ever. Such instances give a bloody nose to the prospects of increasing institutional adoption of digital assets, hence the requirement for custody services akin to what institutions would expect in the TradFi world.

With the promise of new financial instruments such as the Solana ETF, many wonder if it’s time to join the party or if Solana’s moment in the sun has already arrived. Solana (SOL) price outlook: Is it time to buy? Despite the speculation about a Solana ETF, the price action has been anything but impressive. Recently, the price of SOL has fluctuated in a narrow band between $125 and $128, indicating that the market is still unsure about Solana’s genuine potential. A death cross formation caused a brief slump to $125, but the subsequent construction of a golden cross saw prices rebound to $132, only to face more resistance. Solana Price Chart (24-Hour), Mar. 23, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko While many hoped that the impending introduction of a Solana futures ETF would spark tremendous growth, this optimism has been chiefly factored in. The spot ETF, if approved, would generate significant buying pressure, but with regulatory worries looming, it is unclear when (or if) this will occur. Without that trigger, Solana may face a difficult road ahead. On the plus side, Solana has made steps toward enhancing its ecosystem. Solana declared intentions to carry out two significant protocol enhancements identified as Solana Improvement Documents (SIMDs). This upgrade seeks to improve network efficiency and support the long-term sustainability of the Solana ecosystem, enabling its competitiveness versus Ethereum and other Layer 2 initiatives. Should you buy Solana now? Analysts are still divided on SOL’s price movement. Some speculate a potential rally toward $250 from here. Others are on the lookout for a drop toward $80. So, investors should hold on for a break above $150 to confirm any notable upward movement. Amidst Solana uncertainties, savvy investors are moving to a trending alternative with better upside potential: Rexas Finance (RXS) . This cheaper token (selling for $0.20) disrupts the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization niche and is tipped as the next big breakout. Rexas Finance (RXS): The strong SOL alternative Rexas Finance offers a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity by seamlessly combining traditional real-world assets with blockchain technology. Rexas Finance uses tokenization to create access to illiquid assets such as real estate, fine art, and commodities, allowing partial ownership to anybody with an internet connection. For example, a $1 million property can be tokenized into 1 million RXS-backed tokens, allowing retail investors to hold a piece for as little as $0.20 per token. The project has received widespread support, and the figures are impressive: RXS active holders have now topped 50,000, indicating significant retail participation. Rexas Finance’s presale raised over $47.6 million, with 456 million tokens sold in the final stages. As the presale nears conclusion, the fear of missing out (FOMO) is evident. The token has appreciated by a whopping 566% from stage one price of $0.03 to $0.20, with 91% of the allocated tokens in the final stage already sold out. Those who secure their RXS tokens now stand to make significant profits when the project is listed on exchanges. Rexas Finance does not stop at tokenization. As a DeFi-driven ecosystem, RXS holders will get governance rights within the project’s treasury and other ecosystem operations. Rexas DeFi supports features like staking, liquidity pools, and yield farming, which provides added usefulness to holders. Furthermore, being an ERC-20 token, RXS may be seamlessly integrated across various decentralized networks. As an added incentive, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway , with the top 20 participants getting $50,000 in RXS. This giveaway is intended to raise awareness and give investors the opportunity to earn big returns prior to the official exchange listing. The official launch on June 19, 2025, is highly anticipated. With Rexas about to debut on three tier-1 exchanges, the listing price of $0.25 would appear tiny compared to the token’s 100,000% upside potential. As the market for real-world asset tokenization heats up, Rexas Finance is the next stop for early Solana-like gains in 2025. Time to act? Hold on for Solana while Rexas Finance is a buy now While Solana tries to break away from its trading range, Rexas Finance provides a new, unique alternative that blends cryptocurrency’s flexibility with the solidity of real-world assets. With the presale rapidly approaching, this could be your final chance to secure a position in RXS before it reaches the market. Don’t pass up this opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what might be the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Act immediately before the presale sells out.

Token listing procedures on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) drew significant controversy after Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder and former CEO of Binance, called the process flawed after disappointing performances of some token listings. Despite the criticism, crypto exchanges have outperformed traditional stock exchanges in terms of listings with positive returns on investment (ROI) and average ROI, according to an April 3 CoinMarketCap report shared exclusively with Cointelegraph. Over the past 180 days, crypto exchange listings had an average return of over 80%, outperforming the largest traditional stock indexes such as the Nasdaq and Dow Jones, as well as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ). CEX listings, top indexes, average ROI. Source: CoinMarketCap The 80% return refers to the average performance of all listed tokens by the seven major exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, Bitget, Gate and KuCoin. Moreover, 68% of crypto exchange listings boasted a positive ROI, outperforming the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) 54% and the Nasdaq’s 51%. Source: CoinMarketCap “This data suggests that crypto exchanges have made progress in refining their listing,” the report said. Related: 70% chance of crypto bottoming before June amid trade fears: Nansen Cryptocurrencies listed on CEXs generally see high demand from investors as the exchanges provide significant new liquidity that can boost the coins’ price performances after listing. Token-listing criteria on CEXs started garnering attention in November 2024, after Tron founder Justin Sun claimed that Coinbase allegedly asked for $330 million in total fees to list Tron ( TRX ), a surprising allegation since Coinbase claims to charge no fees for listing new cryptocurrencies. Related: Trump-linked crypto ventures may complicate US stablecoin policy Token listing performance still depends on broader market conditions: Binance Recent investor disappointment with some token listings may stem from historic profit expectations due to the significant upside of numerous CEX-listed tokens. Still, the returns of a cryptocurrency after listing depend on the wider market appetite, a Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding: “Outcomes can vary depending on broader market conditions. As the industry matures, we’re seeing reduced volatility compared to earlier cycles — a shift that reflects greater stability and long-term sustainability in the crypto market.” “Crypto investors’ expectations for new listings to perform well are understandable and often shaped by the historic success” of CEX listings, added the spokesperson. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, listed 77 cryptocurrencies throughout 2023 and 2024, with a 0% delisting rate. Binance announced a community voting mechanism for token listings on March 9, to make the listing process more decentralized.

42849415,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145978,1743681600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Kenyan Shilling: How Low Dollar Demand Fuels Currency Stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kenyan-shilling-dollar-demand-stable/,"In the dynamic world of forex and cryptocurrency, stability can feel like a rare gem. But for Kenya, there’s a story of resilience unfolding in its currency markets. The Kenyan shilling (KES) has demonstrated remarkable stability against the US dollar recently, a development that has significant implications for the Kenyan economy and forex traders alike. Let’s dive into the factors behind this steadiness and what it means for you. Why is the Kenyan Shilling Showing Such Currency Stability? The primary driver behind the shilling’s stability is a notable decrease in dollar demand . Several factors contribute to this reduced demand: Reduced Import Appetite: Kenya, like many economies, experiences fluctuations in import volumes. A temporary dip in demand for imports translates directly to less need for dollars to pay for these goods. Increased Local Currency Preference: There might be a growing preference for transacting in local currency within Kenya. This could be due to government policies, increased confidence in the shilling, or simply market dynamics. Foreign Exchange Reserves Management: The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) plays a crucial role in managing foreign exchange reserves. Prudent management and interventions can help maintain currency stability even during periods of volatility. External Factors: Global economic conditions and investor sentiment towards emerging markets can also influence dollar demand . Positive shifts in these areas can lessen the pressure on the shilling. It’s important to understand that currency stability is not a static state. It’s a dynamic equilibrium influenced by a multitude of economic forces. However, the current situation provides a breather and an opportunity for the Kenyan economy. The Impact of Low Dollar Demand on Kenya’s Forex Market Lower dollar demand has a ripple effect throughout Kenya’s forex market and the broader economy. Let’s break down some key impacts: Impact Area Description Benefit Inflation A stable or strengthening shilling can help curb imported inflation. Since many goods are priced in dollars, a stronger shilling makes imports cheaper in local currency terms. Potentially lower prices for consumers on imported goods, easing cost of living pressures. Investor Confidence Currency stability often boosts investor confidence. Both local and foreign investors are more likely to invest in an economy with a predictable currency environment. Increased investment inflows, potentially leading to economic growth and job creation. Debt Servicing For a country with dollar-denominated debt, a stable or stronger shilling reduces the cost of debt servicing in local currency terms. Frees up government resources that can be allocated to other development priorities. Business Planning Businesses, especially those involved in import and export, benefit from a stable exchange rate. It makes financial planning and pricing more predictable. Reduced exchange rate risk for businesses, fostering a more stable operating environment. Navigating the Forex Market: Actionable Insights for Traders For those involved in the forex market , whether you’re a seasoned trader or just starting, the Kenyan shilling’s current stability offers both opportunities and considerations: Monitor CBK Actions: Keep a close watch on the Central Bank of Kenya’s monetary policy announcements and interventions in the forex market . These actions can significantly influence the shilling’s trajectory. Analyze Import-Export Data: Track Kenya’s import and export figures. Changes in trade balances are leading indicators of future dollar demand and shilling movements. Consider Emerging Markets Sentiment: Global investor sentiment towards emerging markets plays a role. Positive global flows can support the shilling, while negative sentiment can create pressure. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the shilling is currently stable, the forex market is inherently volatile. Diversification across different currencies and asset classes remains a prudent strategy to manage risk. Stay Informed on Kenyan Economic News: Keep abreast of Kenyan economic news, including inflation reports, GDP growth figures, and political developments. These factors can all impact the shilling. Are There Challenges to Kenya’s Currency Stability? While the current stability is encouraging, it’s essential to acknowledge potential challenges that could impact the Kenyan Shilling in the future: Global Economic Shocks: Unexpected global economic downturns, commodity price fluctuations, or geopolitical events can trigger capital outflows and put pressure on the shilling. Increased Import Demand: As the Kenyan economy grows, import demand may rebound, potentially increasing the need for dollars and putting downward pressure on the shilling. External Debt Sustainability: Kenya’s external debt levels remain a point of concern. Servicing this debt requires foreign currency, and any strain on the balance of payments could affect the shilling. Political Uncertainty: Political transitions or instability can sometimes lead to capital flight and currency volatility. Addressing these challenges requires proactive economic management, including fiscal discipline, diversification of exports, and policies to attract stable foreign direct investment. The Resilient Shilling: A Beacon of Hope? The resilient Kenyan shilling , buoyed by low dollar demand , presents a positive narrative for Kenya’s economy. It offers a period of stability that can foster growth, reduce inflationary pressures, and enhance investor confidence. For forex traders, understanding the dynamics at play is crucial for navigating the market effectively. While challenges remain, the current stability provides a foundation upon which Kenya can build a stronger and more prosperous economic future.

Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to $83,450, while Ethereum (ETH) remained solidly below $2,000. The stock market crumbled, with the S&P 500 index nearing a death cross, while Polymarket recession odds soared to a record high. This crypto price prediction explains what to expect this year. S&P 500 Index Nears a Death Cross American stock market plummeted after Donald Trump unveiled his tariffs , leading to heightened recession risks. As shown below, the Polymaket odds of a recession rose to 50%, the highest level since the poll started. These odds stood at 19% in January this year. In a note, a TS Lombard analyst said : “These tariffs are not a mild stagflationary event, this is a recession-producing turn — if these tariffs stay in place.” The blue-chip S&P 500 index futures dropped by 200 points, entering a correction since it has now dropped by over 11% from its highest level this year. The Dow Jones futures dropped by 1,200 points, while the Nasdaq 100 fell by over 800 points. US recession odds There is a risk that the S&P 500 index will drop further now that a death cross is about to happen. This pattern happens when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other, leading to further downside. In this case, the spread between the two averages has narrowed and could flip each other soon. Indeed, a death cross has already happened when using the Weighted Moving Average. More technicals suggest that the index may also drop further since it has moved below the key support at $5,527, invalidating the double-bottom pattern that has been forming. If this happens, the index may slip to $5,120, the lowest swing on August 5, and down by 7.40% from the current level. S&P 500 index chart Crypto Price Prediction as S&P Sinks The S&P 500 index is a highly popular asset in the US. In most cases, its performance has an impact on crypto prices like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As such, there is a likelihood that its crash may trigger more bearish crypto price predictions. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis As the biggest coin in the industry, Bitcoin has a major impact on crypto prices. It is the engine that drives the crypto market. On the daily chart, the BTC price has remained below the crucial support at $89,145, its lowest swing on January 14, and the neckline of the double-top pattern. The coin has also formed and retested the rising wedge pattern. Worse, the 200 and 50-day weighted moving averages have formed a death cross pattern, meaning that the coin will have a bearish breakdown, potentially to $76,890, its lowest level this year. A move above the resistance at $89,145 will invalidate the bearish view. Bitcoin Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis Ethereum is another coin that impacts crypto price prediction. On the daily chart, the ETH coin has moved below the key point at $2,125, the neckline of the triple-top pattern at $4,000. It has also retested that resistance, creating a break and retest pattern that leads to more downside. Therefore, the most likely ETH price forecast is where it keeps falling and retests the support at $1,500. This view will be canceled if the coin rises above $2,126. Ethereum Price Chart Summary on the Cryptocurrency Price Prediction There are rising odds that the crypto market will keep falling in the coming days as investors panic and sell their coins. They will then bounce back as the Federal Reserve intervenes by cutting rates.

The sentiment is echoed by the early uptake for the privacy pools, which have processed 238 user deposit transactions, totaling 67.49 ETH in the first three days. The new tool has received a thumbs-up from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who was one of the first to deposit ETH . These privacy pools leverage zero-knowledge proofs and commitment schemes to facilitate ether deposits and subsequent withdrawals, in part or whole, while breaking the link between deposits and withdrawal addresses. Think of it like having a specialized bank account to send money while hiding your identity or how much money you have. The architecture comprises the contract layer for managing assets, the zero-knowledge layer to ensure privacy and the association set provider layer that ensures compliance by vetting funds. The three layers work together to preserve privacy while screening transactions for links to illicit actors such as hackers, phishers and scammers. The screening is dynamic, meaning a deposit is accepted but later found malicious, it can be removed. Privacy pools are non-custodial, ensuring users retain full control over their funds, allowing even rejected deposits to move back funds to their original addresses. As of now, the deposit limits are set between 0.1 ETH and 1 ETH, with the promise to increase the same after the initial battle testing period. ""This is only the beginning.

Its current valuation is $500 million, and it is projected to rise by 20x in 2025 alone. Leading the current DeFAI movement is NODO , an agentic AI-powered return-generating ecosystem selected for the Sui Hydropower Cohort . With a user base exceeding 400,000 and a reported trading volume of over $3.5 million , NODO is developing autonomous AI agents designed to execute market-making strategies on decentralized finance (DeFi) pools and perform portfolio rebalancing to support yield optimization. The project is supported by EMURGO Africa, Adaverse, and Sui Hydropower. Combining multiple strategies from market making, protocol farming, and futures trading with advanced risk assessment techniques, NODO’s multi-chain AI agent prediction keeper network brings institutional-grade automation to decentralized finance. Solving DeFi’s Biggest Challenges The DeFi sector continues to grapple with critical challenges in accessibility and usability. New market entrants often face high slippage and costs due to low and fragmented liquidity in new DEX pools. Up to 10% in losses can occur when entering or exiting positions. Compounding this issue, investors frequently face yield dilution of up to 50% during market volatility, making it hard to optimize earnings from a supposedly passive and stable financial tool. NODO confronts these systemic problems through market-making and yield optimizer AI agents, bringing robust liquidity management, real-time risk assessment, and autonomous yield optimization to digital asset investors. By replacing manual processes with intelligent automation, the platform equips investors to adapt instantly to market dynamics while adhering to their unique risk tolerance and financial goals. Powering Up Development with Sui Hydropower Mentorship In a significant development, NODO has been accepted into season two of the Sui Hydropower Cohort , reserved for the next wave of pioneering builders on the Sui Network. Cohort members are entitled to receive official technical, advisory, and marketing support from the Sui Foundation team to accelerate product development and project growth. NODO will be closely mentored by seasoned ecosystem founders on Sui during the development of their agentic AI infrastructure and have the opportunity to present and obtain vital feedback from leading VCs in the space via the end-of-season Demo Day. The cohort members will also receive networking and partnership growth support from the foundation, which NODO aims to leverage as part of its plan to integrate with leading DeFi and AI projects building on Sui. In particular, the agentic AI infrastructure is looking to integrate with the leading Sui AMM Cetus, as well as other Sui-based DeFi protocols and DEXes, to enhance the capabilities of its AI agents. Sowmya Raghavan, NODO’s Co-Founder, shared about the project’s expansion to Sui: “The Sui Hydropower program is about more than support – it unlocks real-world AI execution for DeFi. With Sui’s cutting-edge object model and unparalleled transaction processing capabilities, we’re automating portfolio management at speeds that rival top-tier financial services. With the mentorship and support of the Sui Foundation, which believes in our vision for an autonomous and decentralized economy, we are well positioned to redefine efficiency in DeFi.” How NODO is Evolving DeFAI NODO’s competitive edge stems from its advanced AI agentic capabilities, which redefine efficiency in decentralized finance. The platform excels in multi-protocol APY tracking , offering real-time monitoring across diverse DeFi ecosystems to ensure that investors capture optimal yields. Leveraging a multi-layer AI coordination architecture, NODO’s AI infrastructure turns abstract on-chain data into actionable insights and then autonomously executes them in real-time on behalf of investors. A dedicated Intelligence layer aggregates, analyzes, and devises the optimal strategy based on key market data in real-time, such as price movements, market conditions, trading activities, and risk factors. This information is then fed to autonomous agents in the Execution layer, which specialize in specific trading pairs, to implement the tailored strategy in split seconds, minimizing slippage and dilution risks. Market Momentum & Strategic Backing AI has become one of the most important technologies in modern history. Today, 75% of businesses aim to integrate AI into their operations by 2026, while 63% of users are open to letting autonomous agents manage their funds. The market numbers further back this up. DeFi and AI, two of the most popular sectors amongst VCs, are currently valued at $101.6 billion and $7.2 billion , respectively. Sui Network, in particular, is a rising star with over $1.22 billion in DeFi valuation alone and is quickly expanding toward AI with the Sui Hydropower Cohort accelerator program. NODO’s strategic roadmap aligns seamlessly with this trajectory, emphasizing multi-chain AI interoperability to unify fragmented ecosystems, institutional-grade risk management tools to safeguard assets, and democratized DeFi automation to empower users of all experience levels. Backed by top VCs and bolstered by partnerships with industry giants, including Tether and OKX Wallet , NODO is well-positioned to realize its mission to redefine decentralized finance through intelligent automation. About NODO NODO is an agentic AI-powered ecosystem that maximizes return generation through a multi-layer infrastructure automating real-time analytics, adaptive risk management, and cross-chain execution. Supported by Sui Hydropower and industry leaders, including EMURGO Africa and Adaverse, NODO empowers investors to navigate volatile markets with confidence.

Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL), which dropped dramatically from $593.49 million to $308.09 million in early 2025, has lately shown a fall as well. This fall suggests that investors might be leaving the network, which would raise price volatility and raise questions on its short-term performance. Although Cardano is still a major participant in the cryptocurrency market, other coins valued less than $0.40—such as Rexas Finance (RXS) , Dogecoin (DOGE), Stellar (XLM), and TRON (TRX)—show great promise for increases in the following months. Thanks to their unusual use cases, increasing acceptance, and positive technical indicators, these currencies might surpass Cardano in terms of development. Rexas Finance (RXS): Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization One of the most interesting recent initiatives in the crypto market, Rexas Finance (RXS), is fast acquiring popularity. Rexas Finance seeks to provide liquidity to otherwise illiquid markets by concentrating on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, commodities, and private equity. Investors have found great resonance in this fresh approach; the RXS presale shows a fantastic rise. From $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12, a 567% rise in price has gone on for RXS. The Rexas Finance ecosystem consists of the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas Launchpad, allowing anyone to engage in the blockchain economy. These features and the emphasis on fractionalized ownership of valuable assets in the project have attracted much interest from institutional and retail investors. Rexas Finance is preparing for a robust market launch in June 2025 with over 91.46% of the presale tokens already sold and over $47.4 million raised. One of the most exciting altcoins for 2025, analysts forecast RXS might experience a significant 10000% price spike upon launch. Dogecoin (DOGE): A Rebound on the Horizon On March 16, 2025, Dogecoin (DOGE) is being sold for $0.16, experiencing a slight 1.60% fall within the last 24 hours. Technical study, however, points to DOGE perhaps about to have a significant upward movement. At the 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), DOGE is nearing a significant resistance level that, should it be broken above, might indicate the start of a fresh bullish trend. Should DOGE keep support at $0.16, analysts estimate the price might climb to values between $0.50 and $1.00 by the end of 2025, ranking well among those surpassing Cardano’s gains in 2025. Stellar (XLM): Poised for a Breakout Stellar (XLM) is another cryptocurrency under $0.40 that has the potential to outperform Cardano in 2025. XLM, trading at about $0.2664, has seen a slight drop but stays inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, a chart creation usually indicating a breakout. The meeting of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages points even more to an approaching notable price shift. XLM might rapidly climb to the $0.72 level if it can break over the $0.30 resistance. On the other hand, XLM retesting support at $0.075 would be seen in a breakdown below $0.085. Stellar is positioned for steady increases in 2025 with its strong foundations and approaching potential breakthrough. TRON (TRX): Ready For a Momentum Shift TRON (TRX), priced at $0.2138, trades within a consolidation range. From its previous close, TRX dropped by 0.03762%; nonetheless, its support is around $0.20, and resistance is at the $0.25 point, so it’s getting ready for an increase. The 50-day moving average flattening suggests a possible momentum change. Analysts think TRX may target the next major obstacle at $0.30 if it can break above the $0.25 barrier. However, a decline below $0.20 might find TRX testing support at $0.18. With its present technological configuration, TRON could see a notable increase in the following months, therefore setting itself to surpass Cardano. Conclusion: The Race for Growth Although Cardano is still a well-known blockchain platform, its latest performance—which shows TVL and investor outflows— bears concerns about its near-term future. At prices less than $0.40, cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin, Stellar, TRON, and Rexas Finance present interesting development prospects. Thanks to their creative application, robust technical indicators, and rising acceptance, these coins are positioned to outperform Cardano in 2025. With unique value propositions that might drive their expansion in 2025, Dogecoin, Stellar, TRON, and Rexas Finance are underdog coins with great promise as the market develops.

The decision could hinge on how American institutions fare with their stablecoin rollouts, said Guto Antunes, head of digital assets at Itaú. At an industry event in São Paulo, Antunes cited the growing momentum behind blockchain-based settlement systems. “Itaú has always had stablecoins on its radar. We cannot ignore the strength that blockchain has to settle transactions atomically,” local media quoted him saying. Stablecoins, for now, remain a “topic on the agenda.” The renewed interest in stablecoins comes on the heels of a political shift in the U.S., where lawmakers rejected a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in favor of encouraging private stablecoin alternatives to preserve the dollar’s dominance. In Brazil, regulators are conducting a public consultation—Consulta Pública No. 111—focused on how stablecoins might fit into the existing financial system. Antunes said the bank is waiting to see what rules the central bank sets before advancing any internal project. Antunes also raised concerns about a proposed ban on self-custody in Brazil’s draft stablecoin rules.

42849837,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145976,1743682258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Fearless Forecast: Dollar Retreats as Tariffs Lift Recession Fears, Euro Surges",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-retreat-euro-gains-tariffs/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can swing wildly on market sentiments and blockchain innovations, understanding traditional financial markets remains crucial. Today, we’re diving into a significant shift in the forex arena: the dollar’s retreat and the euro’s ascent. What’s driving this dramatic change, and how could it impact your crypto investments? Let’s explore the ripple effects of easing trade tensions and shifting global economic winds. Why is the Dollar Retreating? Unpacking the Dynamics The mighty US dollar, often seen as a safe-haven asset in times of global uncertainty, is currently experiencing a dollar retreat . This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a notable pullback fueled by a confluence of factors. The most prominent catalyst is the easing of trade tensions, particularly the lifting of some tariffs. For years, trade disputes and the looming threat of escalating tariffs cast a shadow over the global economy, pushing investors towards the perceived safety of the dollar. Now, as these fears subside, the rationale for holding onto the dollar as a defensive play diminishes. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements contributing to the dollar’s recent weakness: Reduced Safe-Haven Demand: With tariffs being lifted and global trade showing signs of potential recovery, the urgency for investors to park their funds in safe-haven assets like the dollar is waning. Improved Global Growth Outlook: Easing trade tensions suggest a more optimistic outlook for global economic growth. This reduces the appeal of the dollar, which tends to perform well during periods of economic anxiety. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Market sentiment is a powerful force. As recession fears recede, investors are becoming more willing to take on riskier assets and move away from the dollar. Currency Diversification: Large institutional investors and central banks are constantly rebalancing their portfolios. A perceived decrease in global risk can lead to diversification away from the dollar into other currencies. Consider this scenario: Imagine a large investment fund that previously allocated a significant portion of its portfolio to dollar-denominated assets due to recession worries. As tariffs are lifted and economic indicators improve, this fund might reallocate some of those dollar holdings to other currencies or asset classes, contributing to the dollar retreat . Euro Gains Momentum: Riding the Wave of Optimism While the dollar is experiencing a pullback, the euro is seizing the opportunity to strengthen. The euro gains are not happening in isolation; they are directly linked to the same factors weakening the dollar – the easing of trade tensions and the subsequent reduction in recession fears . As investors become more optimistic about the global economy, the euro, representing a major economic bloc, becomes more attractive. What’s fueling the euro’s upward trajectory? Positive Economic Data from Eurozone: Recent economic data from the Eurozone has shown signs of resilience and potential recovery. This positive momentum strengthens the euro’s appeal. Reduced Geopolitical Risks in Europe: Easing of certain geopolitical tensions within Europe and globally can boost investor confidence in the euro. Attractive Investment Destination: As global risk appetite increases, the Eurozone, with its diverse economies and established markets, becomes an attractive investment destination, leading to increased demand for the euro. Dollar Weakness as a Catalyst: The dollar retreat itself acts as a catalyst for euro gains . As investors sell dollars, they often look for alternative currencies to invest in, and the euro is a natural choice. Let’s think about a practical example. A multinational corporation planning to expand its operations might have been hesitant due to recession fears and trade uncertainties. With tariffs being lifted and a more positive economic outlook, this corporation might decide to proceed with its expansion plans in the Eurozone. This would require converting other currencies into euros, driving up demand and contributing to euro gains . Tariffs Lifted: The Domino Effect on Currency Markets The decision to have tariffs lifted is the linchpin in this currency market shift. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, have been a major source of economic friction in recent years. They disrupt global trade flows, increase costs for businesses and consumers, and fuel uncertainty about economic growth. When tariffs are lifted , even partially, it sends a powerful signal to the market: Impact of Tariffs Lifted Explanation Reduced Trade Uncertainty Businesses can plan for the future with more confidence, knowing that trade barriers are easing. Lower Inflationary Pressures Tariffs contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods. Lifting them can help to ease inflationary pressures. Boost to Global Trade Lower tariffs can stimulate international trade, benefiting economies worldwide. Improved Investor Confidence Easing trade tensions boosts investor confidence and encourages investment in global markets. The impact of tariffs lifted extends beyond just trade. It has a cascading effect on investor sentiment, economic forecasts, and ultimately, the currency market . The perception that tariffs are lifted signals a move towards a more stable and predictable global economic environment, which is inherently positive for risk assets and less supportive of safe-haven currencies like the dollar. Recession Fears Fade: A Shift in Economic Sentiment The specter of recession has been looming over the global economy for some time. Recession fears , fueled by trade disputes, geopolitical uncertainties, and concerns about slowing growth, have been a major driver of market volatility. However, the recent easing of trade tensions and some positive economic data points are leading to a notable shift in sentiment – recession fears are beginning to fade. Why is this shift in sentiment so important? Increased Risk Appetite: When recession fears subside, investors become more willing to take on risk. This often translates to increased investment in stocks, emerging markets, and other higher-yielding assets, while reducing demand for safe-haven assets like the dollar. Improved Business Investment: Businesses are more likely to invest and expand when they are less concerned about an imminent recession. This investment can drive economic growth and further reduce recession fears . Consumer Spending Confidence: Consumer confidence tends to improve when recession fears decrease. This increased spending is a crucial engine for economic growth. Central Bank Policy Shifts: Reduced recession fears can influence central bank policies. Central banks might become less inclined to maintain ultra-loose monetary policies if the risk of recession diminishes. The fading of recession fears is not just about economic data; it’s about psychology. Market sentiment can be self-fulfilling. As investors and businesses become more optimistic, their actions can contribute to a more positive economic outcome, further validating the shift in sentiment. This is a powerful dynamic playing out in the currency market right now. Navigating the Currency Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does all of this mean for cryptocurrency investors? While the crypto market operates somewhat independently, it’s still influenced by broader macroeconomic trends and currency market dynamics. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Dollar Weakness and Crypto: Historically, a weaker dollar can be beneficial for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As the dollar loses value, alternative assets, including crypto, can become more attractive as stores of value or hedges against inflation (though this relationship is not always consistent and is debated). Euro Strength and Crypto Adoption: A stronger euro could indicate increased economic activity and potentially greater adoption of cryptocurrencies within the Eurozone. Keep an eye on crypto regulations and adoption trends in Europe. Diversification Beyond Dollar: The dollar retreat highlights the importance of diversification. Crypto investors should consider diversifying their holdings across different currencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Monitor Global Economic Sentiment: Stay informed about global economic trends, trade developments, and shifts in recession fears . These factors can indirectly impact the crypto market. Currency Pair Trading Opportunities: For crypto traders, fluctuations in the currency market can present opportunities for trading crypto pairs against fiat currencies like the dollar and euro. In essence, understanding the interplay between traditional forex markets and the cryptocurrency space can provide valuable insights and strategic advantages for crypto investors. The current currency market scenario, with the dollar retreat and euro gains driven by easing trade tensions and reduced recession fears , is a prime example of how global economic shifts can create ripples across all asset classes, including crypto. Conclusion: Riding the Forex Tide The dollar retreat and the concurrent euro gains are more than just numbers on a currency chart. They represent a shift in global economic sentiment, a move away from recession fears , and a potential recalibration of risk appetite in the currency market . As tariffs are lifted and trade tensions ease, the global economic outlook brightens, impacting everything from traditional forex to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For crypto investors, understanding these forex trends is not just academic – it’s a crucial element in navigating the complex and interconnected global financial landscape. Stay informed, adapt your strategies, and be ready to ride the forex tide as it shapes the future of finance.

Santiment Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/are-trumps-tariffs-impacting-cryptocurrencies-as-expected-santiment-weighs-in/,"Since United States President Donald Trump took over the White House, the crypto market has mostly underperformed, with bitcoin (BTC) reacting negatively to most policy changes. The latest policy change—the confirmation of reciprocal tariffs on global trades—has triggered a market-wide reaction, with participants wondering if this is a desired effect. The on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the market is not reacting as crypto bulls expected. Since Trump confirmed the tariffs, BTC has lost at least $5,000, and most altcoins are in the red. Potential Effects of the Tariffs Trump’s tariffs are meant to encourage American citizens to buy domestic goods instead of international products. Some advantages include bolstering production and purchasing within the U.S. and raising additional income that could fund domestic projects and reduce budget deficits. However, like any other government policy change, tariffs have some cons. Consumers will witness an increase in prices since imported goods will become more expensive, an economic slowdown due to decreased global trade, and a potential trade war as foreign countries retaliate with their own tariffs. As tariffs trigger uncertainty at the global economic level, traditional financial markets are affected, too. Global stocks are plunging, and U.S. futures indexes are declining. Although the tariff announcement was timed shortly after stock markets closed on April 2 to avoid a massive negative reaction, Santiment believes that Wall Street will still experience a huge sell-off when the regular trading session starts. Are Traditional Investors Turning to Crypto? Many crypto analysts argued that the uncertainty in traditional financial markets could lead investors to move their money from stocks and bonds to cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset. However, investors’ main reaction so far has been capital inflows into more traditional safe havens like gold and silver, which are not affected by economic conditions. While BTC struggled in the first quarter due to macroeconomic conditions, gold kept hitting new all-time highs (ATHs). After a three-month 20% surge , the precious metal is currently trading at approximately $3,190. Within the same timeframe, BTC has mostly correlated with the S&P 500, recording a few temporary cases of decorrelation. Altcoins, on the other hand, have performed even worse. While the crypto market continues to react negatively, some analysts believe the tariffs will eventually trigger bullish momentum in the coming months as countries cave in and lower their tariffs against the U.S. As they insist that this is a “short-term pain, long-term gain” scenario, others believe the crypto and stock markets are in for a lengthy, rough ride.

While the XRP price remains in a range due to lack of catalysts and uncertainty, Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee has revealed his big price prediction for XRP. Lee said that if Ripple can capitalize on key opportunities like regulatory clarity and the possibility of an IPO, XRP could rise to $10 by 2030. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that an IPO is possible for Ripple, while Lee said, “If Ripple goes public, it could increase its exposure to institutional investors, thereby creating additional demand for XRP.” Referring to the fact that although the SEC and Ripple have withdrawn their appeals in the case, there has not yet been an official settlement announcement, Lee stated that a clear and definitive legal solution will support the XRP price. Noting that XRP is largely trading between $2.35 and $2.55 in the short term, Lee said that a breakout from this range could lead to significant price movements in either direction. Accordingly, Lee listed his short-term targets as $2-$2.17 on the downside and $2.65-$3.00 on the upside. In contrast, Lee was more optimistic in his long-term XRP forecast. Lee predicted that by 2030, XRP could reach somewhere between $4.20 and $10. XRP, which has fallen 4.3% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $2.02 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What to Expect from XRP Price Next?

Think of it as your all-in-one toolkit for navigating the decentralized web, directly from your mobile device. NEXUS, based in South Korea, aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly, and CROSSx is a significant step in that direction. The choice to launch on the Google Play Store indicates a clear intention to reach a broad audience, making decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto management more mainstream. Your Secure Gateway: Exploring the Crypto Wallet Features At the heart of CROSSx lies a sophisticated crypto wallet . But this isn’t just any wallet; it’s your secure vault in the decentralized world. What makes a crypto wallet within a dApp like CROSSx so essential? Secure Asset Management: A crypto wallet allows you to securely store, manage, and control your digital assets. With CROSSx, you can keep your cryptocurrencies and tokens safe, away from centralized exchanges and potential vulnerabilities. Seamless Transactions: Sending and receiving cryptocurrencies becomes incredibly easy. Whether you’re paying for goods and services, sending crypto to friends, or interacting with other dApps, your CROSSx wallet streamlines the process. Token Compatibility: CROSSx supports a variety of tokens, allowing you to manage a diverse portfolio within a single application. The specific tokens supported will be crucial for users, and NEXUS is expected to expand compatibility over time. User-Friendly Interface: Navigating crypto wallets can sometimes be daunting, but CROSSx aims to simplify this. A user-friendly interface is paramount for both crypto veterans and newcomers, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience. Imagine the convenience of managing your digital assets on the go, with the peace of mind that your funds are secured by blockchain technology. This is the promise of the crypto wallet in CROSSx. Trade Freely: Delving into the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Beyond just a wallet, CROSSx integrates a powerful decentralized exchange (DEX). What’s the buzz around DEXs, and how does CROSSx leverage this technology? What is a DEX? A decentralized exchange operates without intermediaries, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other. This peer-to-peer trading model offers several advantages: Enhanced Security: DEXs minimize the risk of hacks and centralized failures, as users retain control of their funds until the moment of the trade. Greater Privacy: Often, DEXs require less personal information compared to centralized exchanges, offering a more private trading experience. Wider Access to Tokens: DEXs can sometimes list a broader range of tokens, including newer and more niche cryptocurrencies, compared to larger centralized platforms. Transparency: Transactions on a DEX are typically recorded on the blockchain, providing a high level of transparency and auditability. In CROSSx, the decentralized exchange functionality goes a step further by enabling users to not only trade cryptocurrencies but also in-game tokens and items. This is a particularly exciting feature, tapping into the growing intersection of blockchain and gaming. For gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, this opens up new avenues for trading and interacting with digital assets within gaming ecosystems. The ability to transfer tokens and trade in-game items directly within the app adds a layer of utility and engagement that goes beyond typical crypto wallets and DEXs. Why Google Play Store Matters: Accessibility and User Adoption The strategic decision to launch CROSSx on the Google Play Store is a game-changer. Why is this so significant? Massive User Base: The Google Play Store is the primary app marketplace for Android devices, boasting billions of users worldwide. Listing CROSSx here instantly exposes the dApp to a vast potential audience. Ease of Access: Downloading and installing apps from the Google Play Store is incredibly straightforward for most smartphone users. This ease of access is crucial for driving user adoption, especially among those who are new to crypto. Credibility and Trust: Being listed on a reputable platform like the Google Play Store can enhance the credibility and trustworthiness of a dApp in the eyes of users. It signals a level of legitimacy and security that is vital in the often-unregulated crypto space. Mobile-First Approach: In today’s mobile-centric world, having a dApp readily available on mobile devices is essential. The Google Play Store launch emphasizes a mobile-first approach, catering to the preferences and habits of modern users. By choosing the Google Play Store , NEXUS is making a bold move to bring blockchain technology and decentralized finance closer to the mainstream, directly into the hands of everyday users. South Korea Crypto Landscape: A Hub of Innovation CROSSx emerges from South Korea crypto scene, a region known for its vibrant and innovative approach to digital currencies and blockchain technology. South Korea has consistently been at the forefront of crypto adoption and development. What makes the South Korea crypto market so unique? High Crypto Adoption Rates: South Korea has one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates globally. A significant portion of the population is familiar with and actively involved in crypto trading and investment. Tech-Savvy Population: South Koreans are generally early adopters of new technologies, and this extends to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The tech-savvy nature of the population creates a fertile ground for dApp adoption. Supportive Regulatory Environment (Evolving): While regulations are constantly evolving, South Korea has shown a willingness to engage with and regulate the crypto industry, rather than outright banning it. This creates a more conducive environment for blockchain innovation. Strong Tech Infrastructure: South Korea boasts a robust technological infrastructure, including high-speed internet and widespread smartphone penetration, which are essential for the growth of blockchain-based applications. Launching CROSSx from within the South Korea crypto ecosystem positions NEXUS to tap into a highly engaged and technologically advanced market, setting the stage for potentially rapid growth and adoption of the dApp. Actionable Insights and the Future of CROSSx The launch of CROSSx on the Google Play Store is more than just an app release; it’s a signal of the growing maturity and accessibility of blockchain technology.

Test out the features and see how it can streamline your crypto activities. For Gamers: Keep an eye on the in-game token and item trading features within CROSSx. This could represent a significant step towards true ownership and tradability of digital gaming assets. For Developers: The success of CROSSx highlights the potential of launching blockchain-based applications on mainstream platforms like the Google Play Store. It sets a precedent for future dApp development and distribution. For the Crypto Industry: This launch underscores the importance of user-friendliness and accessibility in driving mainstream crypto adoption. Simplifying the user experience is crucial for attracting a wider audience. The future of CROSSx looks promising. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and gain wider acceptance, dApps like CROSSx are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the decentralized future. The combination of a user-friendly interface, robust functionalities, and strategic platform launch positions CROSSx for significant impact in the crypto and gaming spaces. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Decentralization NEXUS’s launch of CROSSx on the Google Play Store is a revolutionary move that brings the power of blockchain and decentralized finance to the fingertips of millions.

Though Sun claimed he was just an advisor and not directly involved with TrueUSD, he provided crucial financial support during the crisis. A heated clash unfolded between Tron founder Justin Sun and First Digital Trust (FDT) over accusations that funds from Techteryx’s TrueUSD reserves were misused. Sun claimed bad actors misused the money, forcing him to step in quietly to save the stablecoin. Notably, Justin Sun live streamed the event, where he claimed to expose a major international financial fraud involving traditional financial institutions and Web3 platforms in Hong Kong. Sun criticized Hong Kong’s trust regulations, claiming that loopholes allowed the alleged fraud to happen. “This situation highlights a serious challenge to the integrity of the financial system that must be addressed,” he noted. “I found it hard to believe the scale of fraud orchestrated by a long list of licensed intermediaries.” A Serious Threat To Financial Integrity He called the situation a serious threat to financial integrity and suggested avoiding Hong Kong trust companies for now. Sun urged regulators to act decisively to protect the city’s global financial standing. Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng, known as the city’s Web3 advocate, also supported Sun’s concerns, noting reports of similar fraud cases and the need for stronger regulations. In a recent X post, Justin Sun emphasized the importance of Hong Kong’s financial reputation and user asset security, and expressed his confidence in local authorities to resolve the case and prevent future fraud. 非常感谢吴议员的支持，事关香港金融中心的声誉与用户资产安全，这是全行业的大事，也是香港的大事，我们对于香港的监管机构与执法机关充满信心，也相信该案件会得到圆满结果，香港未来绝不应也不会再出现类似的欺诈案件。 https://t.co/yXfbrISiQZ — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) April 3, 2025 FDT Strikes Back However, after Justin Sun’s press conference, First Digital Trust (FDT) held its own event to respond to the allegations. CEO Vincent Chok firmly denied any wrongdoing, saying Sun had not provided any solid evidence to support his claims. Chok explained that FDT had followed all its fiduciary duties, acted in the best interests of its clients, and complied with instructions from Sun and his team, which were approved by Techteryx directors. He also mentioned that FDT is regularly audited by third-party firms. However, he admitted that he wasn’t aware of the family connection between Aria CFF and Aria DMCC, the companies holding TrueUSD’s reserves. Chok noted that they’re trying to recover the funds, but delays are due to KYC and AML issues tied to Techteryx’s ultimate owner. He rejected Sun’s claim that FDT can’t process FDUSD redemptions, confirming that the token is still solvent. FDT also plans to sue Sun and shared onchain data showing that redemptions are still processing.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|FDUSD|TUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-03 12:20:40

Its current valuation is $500 million, and it is projected to rise by 20x in 2025 alone. Leading the current DeFAI movement is NODO , an agentic AI-powered return-generating ecosystem selected for the Sui Hydropower Cohort . With a user base exceeding 400,000 and a reported trading volume of over $3.5 million , NODO is developing autonomous AI agents designed to execute market-making strategies on decentralized finance (DeFi) pools and perform portfolio rebalancing to support yield optimization. The project is supported by EMURGO Africa, Adaverse, and Sui Hydropower. Combining multiple strategies from market making, protocol farming, and futures trading with advanced risk assessment techniques, NODO’s multi-chain AI agent prediction keeper network brings institutional-grade automation to decentralized finance. Solving DeFi’s Biggest Challenges The DeFi sector continues to grapple with critical challenges in accessibility and usability. New market entrants often face high slippage and costs due to low and fragmented liquidity in new DEX pools. Up to 10% in losses can occur when entering or exiting positions. Compounding this issue, investors frequently face yield dilution of up to 50% during market volatility, making it hard to optimize earnings from a supposedly passive and stable financial tool. NODO confronts these systemic problems through market-making and yield optimizer AI agents, bringing robust liquidity management, real-time risk assessment, and autonomous yield optimization to digital asset investors. By replacing manual processes with intelligent automation, the platform equips investors to adapt instantly to market dynamics while adhering to their unique risk tolerance and financial goals. Powering Up Development with Sui Hydropower Mentorship In a significant development, NODO has been accepted into season two of the Sui Hydropower Cohort , reserved for the next wave of pioneering builders on the Sui Network. Cohort members are entitled to receive official technical, advisory, and marketing support from the Sui Foundation team to accelerate product development and project growth. NODO will be closely mentored by seasoned ecosystem founders on Sui during the development of their agentic AI infrastructure and have the opportunity to present and obtain vital feedback from leading VCs in the space via the end-of-season Demo Day. The cohort members will also receive networking and partnership growth support from the foundation, which NODO aims to leverage as part of its plan to integrate with leading DeFi and AI projects building on Sui. In particular, the agentic AI infrastructure is looking to integrate with the leading Sui AMM Cetus, as well as other Sui-based DeFi protocols and DEXes, to enhance the capabilities of its AI agents. Sowmya Raghavan, NODO’s Co-Founder, shared about the project’s expansion to Sui: “The Sui Hydropower program is about more than support – it unlocks real-world AI execution for DeFi. With Sui’s cutting-edge object model and unparalleled transaction processing capabilities, we’re automating portfolio management at speeds that rival top-tier financial services. With the mentorship and support of the Sui Foundation, which believes in our vision for an autonomous and decentralized economy, we are well positioned to redefine efficiency in DeFi.” How NODO is Evolving DeFAI NODO’s competitive edge stems from its advanced AI agentic capabilities, which redefine efficiency in decentralized finance. The platform excels in multi-protocol APY tracking , offering real-time monitoring across diverse DeFi ecosystems to ensure that investors capture optimal yields. Leveraging a multi-layer AI coordination architecture, NODO’s AI infrastructure turns abstract on-chain data into actionable insights and then autonomously executes them in real-time on behalf of investors. A dedicated Intelligence layer aggregates, analyzes, and devises the optimal strategy based on key market data in real-time, such as price movements, market conditions, trading activities, and risk factors. This information is then fed to autonomous agents in the Execution layer, which specialize in specific trading pairs, to implement the tailored strategy in split seconds, minimizing slippage and dilution risks. Market Momentum & Strategic Backing AI has become one of the most important technologies in modern history. Today, 75% of businesses aim to integrate AI into their operations by 2026, while 63% of users are open to letting autonomous agents manage their funds. The market numbers further back this up. DeFi and AI, two of the most popular sectors amongst VCs, are currently valued at $101.6 billion and $7.2 billion , respectively. Sui Network, in particular, is a rising star with over $1.22 billion in DeFi valuation alone and is quickly expanding toward AI with the Sui Hydropower Cohort accelerator program. NODO’s strategic roadmap aligns seamlessly with this trajectory, emphasizing multi-chain AI interoperability to unify fragmented ecosystems, institutional-grade risk management tools to safeguard assets, and democratized DeFi automation to empower users of all experience levels. Backed by top VCs and bolstered by partnerships with industry giants, including Tether and OKX Wallet , NODO is well-positioned to realize its mission to redefine decentralized finance through intelligent automation. About NODO NODO is an agentic AI-powered ecosystem that maximizes return generation through a multi-layer infrastructure automating real-time analytics, adaptive risk management, and cross-chain execution.

This time, they’ve reportedly turned a significant profit by strategically trading Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Let’s dive into the details of this audacious move and explore what it means for the ever-vigilant crypto community. Lazarus Group’s Astute WBTC Trade: A Masterclass in Crypto Profit? According to on-chain analytics firm Spot On Chain, a wallet linked to Lazarus Group executed a highly profitable trade involving WBTC. The group allegedly sold 40.78 WBTC for a staggering $3.51 million. What makes this transaction particularly noteworthy is the substantial profit margin. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Asset Sold: 40.78 WBTC Sale Value: $3.51 million Original Purchase Cost: $999,900 USDT Profit Generated: $2.51 million This translates to a remarkable $2.51 million profit from a single trade! The data indicates that Lazarus Group initially acquired the WBTC in February 2023 for $999,900 USDT, at an average price of $24,521 per WBTC. This strategic purchase and subsequent sale demonstrate a keen understanding of market timing and asset valuation, traits not typically associated with illicit cyber activities. It begs the question: are these hackers not just skilled at infiltration, but also surprisingly adept at crypto trading? From WBTC to ETH: Tracing the Funds and the Crypto Hacks Connection The story doesn’t end with the WBTC sale. The funds, now in USDT, were swiftly moved and converted into another popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH). Approximately 1,857 ETH were acquired in exchange for the USDT proceeds roughly 12 hours before the report surfaced. What happened next is a common tactic used to obfuscate the origin and destination of illicit funds. The newly acquired ETH was then distributed across three separate wallets. This dispersal strategy makes it more challenging for authorities to track the funds and potentially recover them. This entire operation underscores a recurring pattern associated with Lazarus Group and other state-sponsored hacking entities: leveraging cryptocurrency to launder and move illegally obtained funds. Their activities often involve: Exploiting vulnerabilities in crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms. Stealing vast sums of cryptocurrency assets. Utilizing mixers and decentralized exchanges to obscure transaction trails. Converting stolen assets into different cryptocurrencies like ETH or stablecoins. Cashing out through various means, often involving over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Why WBTC? Understanding Wrapped Bitcoin and its Role in Crypto Profit Strategies Why did Lazarus Group choose WBTC for this particular maneuver? WBTC , or Wrapped Bitcoin, is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum network. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in the vast ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on Ethereum. Here are a few reasons why WBTC might have been an attractive asset for Lazarus Group: Benefit of WBTC Explanation DeFi Access WBTC unlocks opportunities to engage in DeFi protocols on Ethereum, potentially for yield farming, lending, or borrowing. Liquidity WBTC markets are relatively liquid, allowing for easier buying and selling compared to less common tokens. Bitcoin Exposure on Ethereum WBTC offers exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements within the Ethereum ecosystem, diversifying asset holdings. Cross-Chain Functionality WBTC bridges the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum, enabling cross-chain asset transfers and operations. By utilizing WBTC , Lazarus Group could have seamlessly moved their Bitcoin holdings into the Ethereum network, potentially leveraging DeFi platforms to further obscure the funds or generate additional yield before ultimately cashing out. The Lazarus Group and the Relentless Pursuit of Crypto Profit: What’s the Impact on Bitcoin and Beyond? The fact that Lazarus Group managed to secure a $2.51 million cryptocurrency profit from this WBTC trade highlights several critical concerns within the digital asset space. Firstly, it underscores the ongoing threat posed by sophisticated cybercriminal organizations, particularly those with state backing. Secondly, it raises questions about the security measures in place within the DeFi ecosystem and the broader Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. While blockchain technology is inherently transparent, the methods employed by groups like Lazarus to obfuscate transactions and launder funds demonstrate the need for continuous vigilance and enhanced security protocols. Here are some key takeaways from this incident: Enhanced Security is Crucial: Crypto exchanges, DeFi platforms, and individual users must prioritize robust security measures to prevent illicit access and asset theft. Improved On-Chain Analytics: Companies like Spot On Chain play a vital role in tracking and analyzing suspicious transactions, helping to expose and mitigate illicit activities. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments and regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on the crypto space to combat money laundering and illicit financing. Incidents like this will likely intensify regulatory pressure. User Awareness: Crypto users need to be educated about the risks and vulnerabilities within the ecosystem and take proactive steps to protect their assets. Navigating the Future of Crypto Security in the Face of Evolving Threats The Lazarus Group’s WBTC profit is a stark reminder that the world of cryptocurrency is not immune to sophisticated criminal activity. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, so too will the tactics of malicious actors. Staying ahead of these threats requires a multi-faceted approach involving technological innovation, regulatory collaboration, and heightened user awareness. The incident also serves as a powerful example of how even seemingly transparent blockchain transactions can be manipulated and obscured by determined and resourceful actors. The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and cybercriminals in the crypto realm is likely to intensify. For investors and participants in the crypto market, this news should serve as a call to action: prioritize security, stay informed about potential threats, and support initiatives aimed at enhancing the overall safety and integrity of the digital asset ecosystem. The pursuit of crypto profit should always be balanced with a strong commitment to security and responsible participation.

This follows an order by the US Bankruptcy Court allowing the exchange to publish the denied claims and expunge them from its list of liabilities. Although the exchange did not state the cost of the claims it denied, one X (formerly Twitter) user, Mr Purple, estimated that claims were worth around $300 million. He said: “There’s probably about 400k claims on here! However, if you look at the estimated allowed claims Interestingly, the exchange could still deny more claims. FTX Creditor champion Sunil Kavuri noted that FTX plans to expunge claims that fail to complete the KYC process by June 1, 2025, the deadline. A note in the court order reads: “Claims listed on Schedule 1 to the Order but not included on Exhibit A attached hereto may still be subject to disallowance if the holder of any such claim does not submit all KYC information requested by the FTX Recovery Trust or its KYC vendors on or prior to June 1, 2025 at 4:00 p.m. (ET) (the ‘KYC Submission Deadline’).” If all these claims are denied, Kavuri estimates it would save about $2.5 billion in liabilities, with $655 million for creditors below $50,000 and $1.9 billion for creditors above $50,000. Meanwhile, the report of FTX expunging claims has attracted complaints and criticisms from creditors, who noted that they could not complete the KYC despite submitting all the documents. Some users have also complained that the exchange did not give them any feedback on why their claims are disputed. Interestingly, the FTX administrator did not disclose how to spend the savings from the denied claims. However, the exchange plans to start the next phase of its repayment by May 30. The exchange’s European creditors are also likely to get their repayments soon after the company that acquired FTX Europe, Backpack , launched its claims page on April 1. FTX creditors in restricted countries are still waiting for updates While FTX creditors in the US and Europe are finally getting some clarity on their repayments, a group of FTX creditors remain uncertain about their prospects. These creditors in over 160 countries were excluded from the first phase of its recovery claims. Kavuri disclosed in February that the exchange had excluded several countries, including Nigeria, Egypt, Colombia, Russia, China, Ukraine, and Saudi Arabia, from the first phase of recovery and is working on a recovery solution for them. At the time, his post provided some clarity for the FTX creditors in these countries who have been waiting for the opportunity to get their refunds. Residents of almost 170 countries cannot make claim for FTX repayments (Source: Sunil Kavuri on X) However, users in these countries are still waiting for repayment or any information on their status, with one creditor asking Kavuri for an update on when they will be paid. Since Kraken and BitGo, the two distribution options FTX has provided for its claims, are unavailable in most countries on the excluded list, it looks unlikely that they will be paid in May.

Despite a broader downturn in crypto and tech venture capital markets during 2023 and 2024, Bitcoin-specific startup formation and funding showed resilience, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage. According to the 2024 edition of TVP’s Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief , Bitcoin Pre-Seed startup transaction volume rose 767% compared to 2021, signalling a maturing and sustained venture category. In 2024 alone, Pre-Seed transaction counts increased 50% year-over-year, while the overall deal count for Bitcoin-native startups grew by 31.8%. The emerging Bitcoin-native venture capital landscape Download “One or two years’ data might represent an anomaly, but with four consecutive years of year-over-year growth at the earliest stage of Bitcoin startup formation, the data now confirm a sustained, long-term venture category trend,” said Christopher Calicott , Managing Director at TVP . TVP defines a Bitcoin-native company as one whose product success is inherently aligned with Bitcoin’s success and which leverages the Bitcoin protocol stack in its core operations. While overall venture capital dollars in the crypto sector declined, TVP’s findings show that Bitcoin-specific investments bucked the trend. In 2024, Bitcoin-native deals made up a growing share of venture activity, with notable participation from institutional VC firms such as Draper Associates, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, and Ribbit Capital. TVP’s report excluded mining operations and late-stage outlier deals to focus on early-stage software and infrastructure startups. The data set includes activity from 2021 through 2024 and aims to offer clarity to allocators seeking long-term exposure to Bitcoin’s startup ecosystem.

It’s part of a functional DeFi ecosystem that’s being built with long-term sustainability in mind. Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial platform where users can lend or borrow digital assets through smart contracts. What sets it apart is how the system is designed: lenders earn passive income while borrowers unlock liquidity by using their existing holdings as overcollateralized security. This model gives users flexibility without requiring them to exit positions—ideal for anyone who wants to stay exposed to market gains while still using capital efficiently. More importantly, it’s a working system in progress, not just a concept on paper. The token is currently priced at $0.025 during its ongoing presale. So far, it has already attracted over 7,700 holders and raised $6 million in a short timeframe. Previous phases sold out quickly, and interest continues to grow as the project gets closer to launch. Given the utilities behind MUTM and the fact that the price remains accessible, this stage may be one of the final chances to buy before larger movements begin. With major updates on the horizon—including a beta version of the platform launching alongside the token—buyers aren’t just speculating on a future use case. They’re preparing for a live product rollout that’s expected to bring immediate user activity, demand, and price momentum. Why analysts see more upside in MUTM than XRP right now While XRP has potential, especially if further institutional traction occurs, its current trajectory is weighed down by broader market pressures and technical patterns hinting at more downside. In contrast, Mutuum Finance is in the early stages of growth, where high ROI is more achievable from a low-cost entry point. The fact that many experienced traders are rotating into MUTM—even some who’ve previously backed major assets like ADA, XRP, and ETH—speaks volumes. For these investors, it’s about identifying undervalued projects with utility, adoption potential, and token mechanics that support sustainable growth. An integral part of the Mutuum ecosystem is its mtToken model. When users deposit assets like ETH or USDT, they receive a corresponding mtToken, such as mtETH or mtUSDT. These are ERC-20 tokens that reflect the deposit and accumulate interest automatically. Users can redeem them later for their original asset plus the yield earned. This setup empowers passive earners and makes capital work harder, all while remaining liquid. Another key mechanism gaining attention is how the protocol uses part of its revenue to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These are then distributed to holders of mtTokens, rewarding them for staying active in the ecosystem. It’s a way to tie real platform usage to token demand and offer ongoing incentives without inflating supply unnecessarily. As XRP holders wait for a potential reversal, others are already making moves. MUTM offers what many are seeking: clear use cases, strong community traction, and a token price that still leaves plenty of room for growth. With a beta launch and major updates approaching, this might be the best time to pay attention. In a market constantly chasing the next big thing, Mutuum Finance may already be it—quietly positioning itself as one of the smartest DeFi plays for 2025.

Beyond the hype, how does Bitcoin remain true to its core values? That’s the central theme of the latest episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast , where hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson are joined by Charlie Spears, co-founder of Blockspace Media, to unpack Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. Bitcoin’s evolution From the outset, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional money. But as adoption has surged, so too has the debate over its scalability and usability. Jenkinson began the conversation by explaining the origins of the original cryptocurrency and how that has shifted over time: “It started out as digital gold and electronic money, and it was supposed to be that. And this is why there is that shift towards scaling and different transactional capabilities that people are looking to bring onto the network.” The discussion underscores the growing importance of layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which aim to make Bitcoin practical for everyday transactions by enabling users to transact in satoshis — the smallest unit of Bitcoin — rather than traditional currencies. Related: 4 key Bitcoin metrics suggest $80K BTC price is a discount Bitcoin’s core principles Debates over Bitcoin’s direction often center on its philosophical roots. Some purists argue that any modification risks altering the essence of what makes Bitcoin unique. Others see thoughtful updates as a way to reinforce its role as a global financial system. Spears compares this to interpreting historical texts: “Reading what Satoshi wrote years ago is like analyzing the words of the Founding Fathers. The world changes, and we have to decide what that means for Bitcoin today.” The discussion highlights how some proposed upgrades aren’t new but were initially removed as a precaution. Now, with Bitcoin’s maturity, developers are considering reinstating them to improve functionality. “Bitcoin is in the hands of its users,” Spears emphasizes. “We get to decide what it should be, just as much as those who were there 15 years ago.” As Bitcoin continues to evolve, The Clear Crypto Podcast cuts through the noise to deliver insightful conversations about where it’s headed next.

42852753,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145995,1743687028,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Move: Brazil’s Itaú Unibanco Considers Revolutionary Stablecoin Launch,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brazil-bank-itau-stablecoin-launch/,"In an exciting development for the crypto world, Brazil’s largest financial institution, Itaú Unibanco, is seriously exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin. This news, reported by Bitcoin.com News, signals a significant shift in the traditional banking sector’s approach to digital assets and could have far-reaching implications for crypto adoption in Latin America and beyond. Are we on the cusp of seeing mainstream banks fully embrace the power of stablecoins? Let’s dive into the details. Why is Itaú Unibanco Mulling a Stablecoin? Guto Antunes, the head of digital assets at Itaú Unibanco, revealed the bank’s interest in stablecoins, highlighting a surge in enthusiasm within the banking industry. This increased interest is largely attributed to a change in the U.S. government’s stance on crypto, with stablecoins now being viewed not just as speculative instruments but also as strategic tools. Antunes pointed out the potential of stablecoins to even “protect the sovereignty of the dollar.” This perspective opens up a fascinating new dimension to the stablecoin narrative, moving beyond simple transactional use cases. For Itaú Unibanco, the question isn’t just about jumping on the crypto bandwagon. It’s about strategically positioning themselves to meet evolving client needs and explore innovative financial solutions. As Antunes stated, “We are always open to understanding for our client whether it makes sense to have a stablecoin, even one in reals, within Itaú.” This client-centric approach suggests a pragmatic and thoughtful exploration of stablecoin technology. The Rising Tide of Crypto Adoption in Traditional Finance Itaú Unibanco’s consideration of a stablecoin is not an isolated event. It reflects a broader trend of crypto adoption within traditional financial institutions. Several factors are driving this trend: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: As governments worldwide begin to provide clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, banks feel more comfortable exploring and integrating digital assets. Client Demand: Customers are increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies and digital assets . Banks are responding to this demand by exploring ways to offer crypto-related services. Technological Advancements: Blockchain technology and stablecoins have matured significantly, offering secure, efficient, and transparent solutions for financial transactions. Competitive Pressure: With fintech companies and crypto-native firms offering innovative financial products, traditional banks need to adapt to stay competitive and relevant. This confluence of factors is creating a perfect storm for crypto adoption in the mainstream financial world, and Itaú Unibanco’s move is a clear indication of this transformative shift. Stablecoin in Reais: A Game Changer for Brazil? The prospect of Itaú Unibanco issuing a stablecoin pegged to the Brazilian Real (BRL) is particularly intriguing. Here’s why this could be a game-changer for Brazil bank ing and the broader Brazilian economy: Enhanced Efficiency and Lower Costs: Stablecoins can streamline transactions, reduce processing times, and lower fees compared to traditional banking systems. Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations in Brazil, fostering greater financial inclusion. Cross-Border Transactions: A BRL-pegged stablecoin could simplify and expedite international transactions for Brazilian businesses and individuals. Innovation and Competition: Itaú Unibanco’s foray into stablecoins could spur innovation and competition within the Brazilian financial sector, benefiting consumers and businesses alike. However, the issuance of a stablecoin by a major Brazil bank also presents certain challenges. Regulatory compliance, security considerations, and ensuring price stability are crucial aspects that Itaú Unibanco would need to carefully address. Itaú Unibanco and the Future of Digital Assets Itaú Unibanco’s exploration of stablecoins underscores the growing significance of digital assets in the global financial landscape. As one of the largest banks in Latin America, Itaú’s actions carry considerable weight and can influence the direction of the financial industry in the region. Their cautious yet open approach to stablecoins reflects a strategic move to embrace innovation while mitigating potential risks. Key Takeaways: Itaú Unibanco, Brazil’s largest bank, is considering issuing a stablecoin. This move reflects increasing interest in stablecoins within the banking sector, driven by evolving regulations and client demand. A BRL-pegged stablecoin could offer significant benefits for the Brazilian economy, including enhanced efficiency and financial inclusion. Challenges related to regulation, security, and price stability need to be carefully addressed. Itaú Unibanco’s exploration of stablecoins highlights the growing importance of digital assets in traditional finance. What’s Next for Itaú’s Stablecoin Ambitions? While still in the exploratory phase, Itaú Unibanco’s interest in stablecoins is a compelling development to watch. The next steps likely involve in-depth feasibility studies, regulatory discussions, and technological assessments. If Itaú decides to move forward, it could set a precedent for other major banks in Brazil and Latin America to explore their own stablecoin initiatives. The journey of traditional finance into the world of digital assets is just beginning, and Itaú Unibanco’s potential stablecoin launch is a powerful signal of the exciting transformations ahead.

According to crypto trader EgyHash from CryptoQuant , network activity has been slowing down, putting Ethereum in a difficult position. Compared to Bitcoin, its performance has fallen to levels last seen in 2020, raising concerns about a possible 91% price crash. Why is Ethereum Struggling? EgyHash points to declining network activity as the main cause of Ethereum’s troubles. Since the beginning of the year, the number of active addresses has been dropping steadily. This slowdown has led to lower transaction fees, which affects Ethereum’s overall value. Blockchain data confirms this trend. The average transaction fee and block fee have hit record lows , making Ethereum less profitable for validators. This, in turn, has weakened its ecosystem. Whales Are Selling Off Billions Investor confidence in Ethereum is also slipping. Data from Santiment reveals that large investors, known as whales, have sold 760,000 ETH—worth about $1.42 billion—in just two weeks. Whales sold 760,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/lpb6ZfIV1C — Ali (@ali_charts) April 2, 2025 Whale activity has dropped by 63.8% in the last five weeks, which is a worrying sign. If big investors continue to sell, Ethereum could face more downward pressure and a major sell-off. Inflation Worries Are Growing Ethereum’s deflationary mechanism, which burns transaction fees to reduce supply, has weakened due to lower network activity. Since the Dencun upgrade, the burn rate has dropped to its lowest level since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake. This has increased supply and added inflationary pressure, which could hurt the price even further. EgyHash warns that unless network activity and transaction fees pick up, Ethereum will struggle to maintain its value. If inflation keeps rising faster than demand, the price could stay under pressure for a long time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Are Down Today? Top Reasons Behind the Crypto Dip , A 91% Crash? Analyst Issues a Warning Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has raised alarms about a potential Ethereum collapse against Bitcoin. Based on the ETH/BTC chart, he predicts that Ethereum could drop by 91% if a bearish pattern plays out. From this angle, the $ETH / $BTC trading pair could be heading to 0.0020! pic.twitter.com/6kbCwP5krT — Ali (@ali_charts) April 2, 2025 Martinez explains that when flipped upside down, the chart reveals a double-top pattern, which often signals a major decline. If this pattern holds, ETH/BTC could fall to 0.0020 BTC. Right now, Ethereum is trading at 0.02153 BTC ($1,766). A drop to 0.0020 BTC would be devastating for holders. Despite the concerns, there is still a chance for a rebound. If Ethereum holds above the $1,800 support level and starts recovering like Bitcoin, it could push past the $1,900 and $1,950 resistance levels. Ethereum is at a critical point. Its future will depend on whether network activity improves and investor confidence returns. Until then, the risk of further losses remains high. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This marks the company’s third-highest monthly block count, according to a company note . The increase comes as global mining difficulty continues to climb, underscoring MARA’s ability to maintain competitive efficiency. The company averaged 26.8 Bitcoin ( BTC ) per day in March, up from 25.2 BTC in February, and its share of available miner rewards grew to 5.8%. MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings reached 47,531 BTC by the end of the month, including loaned and collateralized assets. In March, MARA Holdings Inc. announced plans to sell $2 billion in stock to fund Bitcoin purchases. The company disclosed it would offer shares periodically through an at-the-market offering.

Since its launch, MARAPool has exceeded the network’s average luck factor by over 10%, resulting in more blocks mined and higher rewards. “Operating our own mining pool gives us better control over our efficiency and earnings. We remain committed to strengthening our position as a leader in Bitcoin mining and energy generation,” said Fred Thiel, MARA’s chairman and CEO. The company also reported a 1% month-over-month increase in energized hashrate , reaching 54.3 EH/s.

It is down by almost 60% from its November high, and its weak fundamental metrics like falling active addresses, ETF outflows, and fee plunge points to a potential crash to $1,000. Active Addresses, Fees Plunge, and ETF Outflows Hint at Ethereum Price Plunge Ethereum price could crash to $1,000 in the near term. On-chain data shows that the number of active addresses has continued to plunge, a sign that some holders are abandoning ship. ETH had over 575k active addresses in January, a figure that has dropped to 333k today. Ethereum active addresses More data reveals that the ETH burn rate continues to drop as the fees generated by the network falls. According to TokenTerminal , Ethereum network has made only $222 million, a figure that is much lower than Uniswap, Solana, Jito, Circle, Tron, and Tether. Ethereum used to dominate in fees in 2024. Ethereum Burn Rate Additional data reveals that Ethereum ETF outflows soared to $403 million in March, bringing the cumulative figure to $2.36 billion. In contrast, Bitcoin has had over $36 billion in inflows since January last year. Analysts have turned bearish on Ethereum price. Just last month, Standard Chartered lowered its ETH price forecast by 60% to $4,000. On top of all this, ETH price is battling a period of extreme fear in the market after Trump launched his reciprocal tariffs that have pushed recession odds higher. Technical Analysis Shows ETH Price May Plummet to $1k A closer inspection of Ethereum’s weekly chart shows an increasing risk that the coin will continue falling soon. That’s because it formed a triple-top pattern between March 11 and December 16 last year. This pattern is made up of three peaks and a neckline. In this case, the peaks were at $4,045, while the neckline was at $2,130. It has now plunged below the neckline, validating the bearish thesis. At the same time, the Average Directional Index (ADX), a popular indicator that measures the strength of a trend, has soared to 30, a sign that the trend is strengthening. Therefore, measuring the distance between the top and the neckline shows that it is about 50%. A similar measurement from the neckline shows that it may crash to $1,000, which is about 42% below the current level. Ethereum price chart On the flip side, a move above the crucial resistance level at $2,130, the triple-top’s neckline, will invalidate the bearish ETH price forecast . It will raise the odds of the coin rising to $2,500.

MARA wrote a prospectus that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create a stock offering on the market. A group of investment banks, such as Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, and Cantor Fitzgerald, created an at-the-market (ATM) program to make proceeds from selling shares and then use the money to buy Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings, previously known as Marathon Digital Holdings, operates one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations worldwide. The sales of the stock offering will first go to the investment banks, taking a 3% commision, and then will be used to buy more Bitcoin. The shares will be listed on exchanges such as Nasdaq. The prospectus stipulates that the stock offering will occur with multiple sales agents, providing a way to get $2 billion in revenue. The venture is a good example of a Bitcoin company using market forces to combine traditional finance with new forms of blockchain innovation. MARA has been buying more of its mining facilities, with the aim of having direct control over its equipment and improving the efficiency and profitability of its mining operations. MARA currently owns 70% of its facilities and is already using this increased autonomy to invest in renewable energy projects. Michael Saylor created the strategy to offer convertible bonds on the market, raising a large amount of equity and creating a Bitcoin treasury. MARA has a treasury of 46,376 BTC, and Strategy has a treasury of 506,137 BTC. MARA has the second-biggest treasury among publicly listed companies and could aim to grow that amount. MARA Holdings is a leader in crypto mining with operations on four continents, a particular focus on Bitcoin, and an interest in creating sustainable mining methods without negatively affecting the environment. MARA aims to have low-cost operations, such as owning their property and equipment outright, diversifying into other blockchain and artificial intelligence industries, and maintaining strict environmental policies during the whole process. The Bitcoin Halving, an inflation-busting algorithm created by Satoshi Nakamoto, caused problems for the mining industry because the miners get less revenue with every halving event. The miners were already getting profitable returns, using their operations to drive growth, but now needed other methods to maintain a reasonable amount of profit post halving. Therefore, creating an open market to build a Bitcoin treasury became a much more profitable option for the mining companies. The halving event happened last year, explaining the sudden urgency for MARA to build their treasury suddenly. Fred Thiel, MARA CEO, said that the company was going ‘full HODL’ with future operations, holding mined Bitcoin instead of selling the newly minted crypto and further buying more Bitcoin from other sources, such as with a public share offering.",Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-03 13:39:25

Bitcoin Mining Industry Braces for Impact as Trump's Tariffs Hit Supply Chains Additionally, Thailand and Malaysia, major players in the Bitcoin mining hardware supply chain, will face higher customs duties of 36% and 24% respectively, starting April 9. Many major Bitcoin mining companies operate in the United States, but their supply chains are concentrated in Asia. Bitmain, a Beijing-based Bitcoin mining hardware giant, has production lines in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Lin, hardware manager at US-based Luxor Technology, a Bitcoin mining software and services firm, revealed that he had to rush 5,600 Bitcoin miners from Thailand to the US within 48 hours to avoid the upcoming tariffs. The sudden policy change has forced mining companies to reevaluate their strategies. Higher import costs for mining equipment could increase operational expenses, affecting Bitcoin’s network hash rate and overall mining profitability in the US.

42853211,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145980,1743687631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Update: US House Approves Landmark Anti-CBDC Bill to Safeguard Financial Freedom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anti-cbdc-bill-house-approval/,"In a landmark move that’s sending ripples through the crypto world, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has given the green light to the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. If you’re invested in cryptocurrencies or simply concerned about the future of digital finance and your privacy, this news is HUGE and demands your attention. Let’s dive into what this bill is all about and why it could be a game-changer. What’s the Buzz About the Anti-CBDC Bill? The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act (H.R. 1919), championed by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, just cleared a significant hurdle. With a 27-22 vote in the House Financial Services Committee, it’s now one step closer to becoming law. But what exactly does this bill aim to do? In simple terms, this legislation is designed to slam the brakes on the Federal Reserve’s potential foray into creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that could be directly issued to individuals. The core concern? Privacy and the specter of government overreach. Key Highlights of the Anti-CBDC Bill: Blocks Direct CBDC Issuance: The bill explicitly prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC directly to individuals. This is a crucial point as direct issuance could give the Fed unprecedented control over personal finances. Focus on Privacy: A central theme is the protection of financial privacy. Proponents argue that a CBDC, in its current conceptualization, could become a powerful tool for government surveillance, tracking every transaction. Limits Fed’s Power: The bill aims to restrict the Federal Reserve’s authority in the realm of digital currencies, ensuring that any digital dollar initiative aligns with American values of financial freedom and privacy. Bipartisan Concerns (Though Vote Was Partisan): While the committee vote was largely along party lines, concerns about CBDCs and privacy are not strictly partisan. Many across the political spectrum have voiced worries about government control over digital money. Why is This Considered a Win for Crypto and Financial Freedom ? For the crypto community and advocates of financial freedom , the passage of this bill in committee is being hailed as a significant victory. Here’s why: Preserves Decentralization: Many in the crypto space believe in the principles of decentralization and permissionless finance. A centrally controlled CBDC, issued by the Federal Reserve , is seen as antithetical to these principles. This bill helps maintain a space for decentralized cryptocurrencies to thrive. Protects Against Surveillance: The fear of a “surveillance state” is a major driving force behind the opposition to CBDCs. This bill directly addresses these concerns by limiting the Fed’s ability to create a tool that could potentially be used for mass financial surveillance. Supports Innovation: By restricting the Fed’s role in directly issuing digital currencies, the bill may inadvertently foster innovation in the private sector. It could encourage the development of more privacy-focused and decentralized digital payment solutions. Empowers Individuals: Ultimately, the argument is about individual liberty and control over one’s own finances. Restricting a potentially intrusive CBDC is seen as empowering individuals and limiting government overreach. Crypto Regulation and the CBDC Debate: A Complex Landscape The debate around CBDCs and crypto regulation is far from simple. Proponents of CBDCs, often including central bankers, argue that they could offer several benefits: Potential Benefits of CBDCs (Arguments from Proponents) Challenges and Concerns (Arguments from Critics) Improved Payment Systems: CBDCs could lead to faster, cheaper, and more efficient payment systems, potentially modernizing financial infrastructure. Privacy Risks: As highlighted by the Anti-CBDC bill, the potential for government surveillance and erosion of financial privacy is a major concern. Financial Inclusion: CBDCs could potentially bring more people into the formal financial system, especially those who are unbanked or underbanked. Centralization of Power: CBDCs concentrate power in the hands of central banks, raising concerns about control and potential for misuse. Monetary Policy Implementation: CBDCs could give central banks new tools for implementing monetary policy and responding to economic crises. Disruption to Commercial Banks: Direct CBDC issuance could disintermediate commercial banks and disrupt the existing financial system. Combating Illicit Activities: Some argue that CBDCs could be designed to better track and combat illicit financial activities, although this is debated. Security Risks: Centralized digital currencies could be attractive targets for cyberattacks and pose significant security risks. It’s clear that there are valid arguments on both sides. However, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, at least for now, is leaning towards prioritizing privacy and limiting the Federal Reserve’s direct involvement in the digital currency space. What Happens Next? The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act is not law yet. Here’s the roadmap ahead: House Vote: The bill needs to be voted on by the full House of Representatives. Given the committee approval, it has a good chance of passing, but floor votes can be unpredictable. Senate Consideration: If it passes the House, the bill will then move to the Senate. It will need to navigate the Senate legislative process, which can be even more challenging. Presidential Signature: Finally, if it passes both chambers of Congress, it would need to be signed into law by the President. The President’s stance on CBDCs and crypto regulation will be a key factor. The journey to becoming law is still long, but the momentum is building. This is a crucial moment for the future of digital currency in the United States and globally. Digital Currency and Your Future: Stay Informed Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor, a tech enthusiast, or simply someone interested in the future of money, staying informed about these developments is crucial. The decisions being made in Washington D.C. right now will shape the landscape of digital finance for years to come. The approval of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act by the House committee is a significant step. It reflects a growing concern about government control over digital money and a desire to protect financial privacy. As this bill progresses through Congress, it’s vital to keep a close watch and understand the potential implications for the future of digital currency and your financial life.

While Bitcoin’s swings hold to maintain traders on aspect, a few rising crypto initiatives are showing consistent and steady increase, positioning themselves as high-upside investments for the next bull run. One such project is Ozak AI, an AI-powered cryptocurrency that has remained heading in the right direction for its ambitious $1 target despite broader market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s Unpredictable Swings Keep Investors Guessing Bitcoin’s price movement has been somewhat stable in recent weeks. After surpassing $85,000, it faced resistance, leading to minor corrections and fluctuations that left buyers speculating approximately its next flow. Many analysts point to macroeconomic elements, institutional activity, and regulatory developments as key drivers behind Bitcoin’s current volatility. While long-term buyers remain bullish, short-term investors are navigating unpredictable price swings, making it harder to determine Bitcoin’s instant trajectory. Despite its role as the market leader, Bitcoin’s moves are regularly dictated by external factors, making it tough for investors searching for constant growth. While BTC remains a strong store of value, many are turning to alternative projects that offer better upside potential in the coming months. Ozak AI’s Steady Climb Toward $1 Unlike Bitcoin’s rollercoaster price movement, Ozak AI has been on a regular upward trajectory, fueled by growing interest in AI-powered blockchain solutions. With artificial intelligence becoming a transformative force throughout industries, Ozak AI is rising as one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. Its capability to combine AI-pushed automation with decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart agreement optimization offers it a completely unique edge over traditional cryptocurrencies. Ozak AI’s early-stage OZ presale price of $0.003 has placed it as a high-growth asset, with analysts predicting a sturdy rally towards $1 within the near future. Unlike speculative meme coins or volatile large-cap cryptos, Ozak AI’s steady adoption and real-world use instances make it an attractive choice for traders seeking out long-term profits. Why Ozak AI’s Growth is More Predictable than Bitcoin’s Swings Bitcoin’s price fluctuations are often encouraged through market sentiment, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic trends, making it a tough asset for short-term traders. On the other hand, Ozak AI benefits from a clear technological roadmap, growing demand for AI-primarily based blockchain solutions, and established tokenomics that promote long-term boom. Additionally, as AI adoption continues to enlarge, Ozak AI is about to capitalize on the intersection of AI and blockchain, giving it a strong foundation for sustainable price appreciation. This positions it as a greater stable and profitable investment in comparison to the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin’s price moves. While Bitcoin stays the dominant force in the crypto market, its price swings continue to create uncertainty for investors. Ozak AI, alternatively, is demonstrating consistent and sustainable increase, subsidized by way of AI-pushed innovations and increasing adoption. With its $1 target firmly in sight, Ozak AI gives a compelling opportunity for those trying to invest in the future of AI-powered blockchain technology.

The firm has also transferred the funds to addresses labeled Ripple (12) and Ripple (13). The release also followed two transfers made from escrow by an anonymous wallet, including 200 million XRP and 300 million XRP transactions. On-chain data showed that those XRP transactions were worth around $407,926,449 and $612,401,797, respectively, at the time of execution. Ripple unlocks 500M XRP worth around $1B 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 🔓 500,000,000 #XRP (1,020,192,378 USD) unlocked from escrow at #Ripple https://t.co/6CmkMweioW — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 3, 2025 Ripple has unlocked 500 million XRP worth roughly $1.02 billion from its escrow account named “Ripple (27). On-chain data also showed that Ripple (27) still holds 500 million XRP at the time of publication. The firm also transferred the funds to Ripple (12) and Ripple (13) addresses. The crypto company revealed that it is not flooding the market with all the tokens simultaneously. Instead, it plans to set aside only 20-25% of the unlocked XRP for market sales and strategic partnerships. The firm also sets aside roughly a quarter of the unlocked XRP for transactions with institutional purchasers and re-locks the remainder in escrow for future use. The crypto firm acknowledged that its escrow system aims to assist it in navigating market volatility while allowing tokens to be gradually released into circulation in a controlled manner. The company argued that it gets better control over how much XRP is available and also prevents any sudden surge of tokens that may flood the market. The XRP issuer revealed that 55 billion XRP is currently locked into escrow, with 1 billion XRP scheduled to be released every month. The crypto firm has had an XRP supply control mechanism in place dating back to 2017. Ripple releases approximately $1 billion XRP each month on the first day of the month. The blockchain company changed its release schedule by releasing XRP on April 3 instead of April 1. The XRP issuer revealed that it locked 700 million coins on April 2 before the traditional release. The firm also unlocked one billion XRP on March 3, and they locked 700 million coins in escrow two days before, suggesting that the company has made changes to its own monthly XRP release strategy. On February 1, 2025, the firm unlocked another 1 billion XRP from the Ripple (26) and Ripple (27) wallets. 400 million XRP and 100 million XRP were released from Ripple (26), while 500 million XRP came from Ripple (27), all valued at approximately $3.10 billion. The remaining half of XRP from April’s 1 billion unlock is expected to be released in the coming days or weeks, following Ripple’s phased approach. The release of such a significant amount of crypto could cause volatility in the market, as Ripple periodically unlocks XRP to manage its supply and support its operations. XRP was exchanging hands at $2.04 at the time of publication, a 3.71% drop in the last 24 hours.

42853504,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145997,1743688225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Deutsche Bank Predicts US Dollar Confidence Crisis – Crypto Impact?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-confidence-crisis-deutsche-bank-2/,"Is your crypto portfolio safe from a potential US Dollar meltdown? Deutsche Bank, a global financial heavyweight, is raising red flags, warning of a possible US Dollar Confidence Crisis . For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this isn’t just Wall Street chatter; it’s a potentially seismic event that could reshape the financial landscape. Let’s dive into what this warning means, why it matters, and how you can navigate these turbulent waters. What is the US Dollar Confidence Crisis Deutsche Bank is Warning About? Deutsche Bank’s economists are sounding the alarm bells, suggesting that the seemingly invincible reign of the US Dollar as the world’s reserve currency might be facing an unprecedented challenge. But what exactly does a ‘confidence crisis’ mean in this context? It’s not about the dollar suddenly disappearing; it’s about a gradual erosion of trust in the dollar’s stability and long-term value. This erosion of trust can stem from various factors, and Deutsche Bank highlights several key concerns: Unsustainable US Debt Levels: The United States’ national debt is ballooning, and concerns are mounting about its sustainability. Investors may start questioning the government’s ability to manage this debt, potentially leading to a loss of faith in the dollar. Persistent Inflation: While inflation has shown signs of cooling, it remains elevated compared to recent history. If inflation proves to be stickier than anticipated, it could erode the purchasing power of the dollar and further dent confidence. Geopolitical Instability: The global landscape is fraught with geopolitical risks, from ongoing conflicts to escalating tensions. These uncertainties can drive investors to seek safe havens away from the dollar, diversifying into other currencies or assets. Rise of Alternative Currencies: While not an immediate threat, the increasing interest in and development of alternative financial systems, including digital currencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), could gradually chip away at the dollar’s dominance over time. It’s crucial to understand that this isn’t necessarily a prediction of imminent collapse, but rather a warning of a growing risk. Deutsche Bank is urging investors and policymakers to pay close attention to these factors and consider the potential consequences of a USD Crisis . Why is a USD Crisis a Concern for Crypto Investors? Now, you might be thinking, “Why should I, as a crypto enthusiast, care about a Dollar Devaluation or a US Dollar Confidence Crisis ?” The answer is multifaceted and deeply intertwined with the very nature of cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this warning from Deutsche Bank should be on your crypto radar: Concern Impact on Crypto Inflation Hedge Narrative Strengthens If the dollar weakens due to inflation or a confidence crisis, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, could be seen as a more attractive alternative store of value. This could drive increased demand and potentially higher prices for cryptos. Safe Haven Asset Diversification In times of economic uncertainty and Global Currency Risk , investors often seek safe haven assets. While gold has traditionally played this role, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being considered as a modern, digital alternative. A weakening dollar could accelerate this trend. Dollar-Denominated Crypto Market Impact The majority of cryptocurrency trading pairs are denominated against the US Dollar (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD). A significant USD Crisis could introduce volatility and uncertainty into these markets, at least in the short term. However, in the long run, it could push for diversification into other currency pairs or decentralized exchanges. Broader Economic Instability and Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment A major dollar crisis could trigger broader economic instability, leading to risk-off sentiment in global markets. While crypto is often touted as uncorrelated, it can still be affected by overall market sentiment. However, in the longer term, it might emerge stronger as a truly decentralized and alternative asset class. In essence, while a US Dollar Confidence Crisis might present short-term volatility and challenges, it could also act as a catalyst for the broader adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as alternative assets. It underscores the fundamental value proposition of crypto: decentralization and independence from traditional financial systems. How Can Crypto Investors Prepare for Dollar Devaluation? So, what actionable steps can crypto investors take in light of Deutsche Bank’s warning and the potential for Dollar Devaluation ? It’s not about panic selling or making drastic changes, but rather about prudent portfolio management and strategic positioning. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even within crypto. Diversify across different cryptocurrencies, sectors (DeFi, NFTs, etc.), and even consider diversifying into other asset classes outside of crypto, such as precious metals or real estate. Hedge with Stablecoins (Strategically): While seemingly counterintuitive in a dollar crisis, certain stablecoins pegged to other currencies (like EUR or CHF) or even algorithmic stablecoins (with caution) could offer a hedge against dollar devaluation. However, always research stablecoins thoroughly and understand their risks. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: In times of uncertainty, quality shines through. Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, solid technology, active development communities, and real-world use cases. These are more likely to weather economic storms. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The financial landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about macroeconomic trends, monitor indicators of dollar strength or weakness, and be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as needed. News and analysis from institutions like Deutsche Bank are valuable inputs to this process. Consider Decentralized Finance (DeFi): DeFi platforms offer alternatives to traditional financial systems. Exploring DeFi lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities could provide ways to generate returns and potentially hedge against traditional financial risks, but remember DeFi also comes with its own set of risks. What are the Broader Global Currency Risk Implications? The potential US Dollar Confidence Crisis isn’t just a US-centric issue; it has profound implications for the global financial system. The dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency means that its stability is intertwined with the stability of the entire global economy. Here are some broader implications of Global Currency Risk related to a potential dollar crisis: Emerging Markets Vulnerability: Many emerging market economies hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A stronger dollar (initially, but a confidence crisis could lead to volatility in either direction) or a dollar crisis could make it more expensive for these countries to service their debts, potentially leading to economic distress and contagion. Trade and Commodity Price Volatility: The dollar is the primary currency for international trade and commodity pricing. A dollar crisis could inject significant volatility into these markets, impacting global trade flows and commodity prices. Shift in Global Reserve Currency Landscape: While dethroning the dollar as the reserve currency is a long and complex process, a confidence crisis could accelerate the trend towards diversification of reserve currencies. Other currencies, like the Euro, Yuan, or even a basket of currencies or digital assets, could gain prominence over time. Increased Volatility in Forex Markets: Expect heightened volatility in foreign exchange markets if a US Dollar Confidence Crisis unfolds. Currency fluctuations can have significant impacts on international businesses and investments. Deutsche Bank’s warning serves as a crucial reminder of the interconnectedness of the global financial system and the potential ripple effects of a crisis in a major currency like the US Dollar. It highlights the importance of monitoring these risks and considering diversification at a global level. Deutsche Bank Warning: A Call to Action for Diversification? Ultimately, Deutsche Bank’s warning about a potential US Dollar Confidence Crisis is not a doomsday prediction, but a call to vigilance and proactive planning. For crypto investors, it reinforces the importance of the core principles of diversification, risk management, and staying informed. It’s a reminder that even in the seemingly unstoppable world of traditional finance, vulnerabilities exist, and alternative systems like cryptocurrencies may offer valuable diversification and resilience. While the future is uncertain, and predicting currency crises is notoriously difficult, being aware of these potential risks and taking steps to prepare your crypto portfolio is a prudent approach. The Deutsche Bank Warning serves as a valuable signal to pay attention to the macroeconomic landscape and consider the potential implications for your crypto investments. By understanding the nuances of a potential USD Crisis and the broader Global Currency Risk environment, you can navigate the crypto markets with greater confidence and resilience.

Top Traders Data Indicates The Markets Favor Coldware,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-doge-touch-1-in-2025-top-traders-data-indicates-the-markets-favor-coldware,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are eager to know where Dogecoin (DOGE) will stand by the end of 2025. The popular meme coin has experienced its share of highs and lows, but its future remains uncertain as new contenders like Coldware (COLD) enter the scene with promising returns and utility. As DOGE struggles to surpass its all-time high of $0.74, many top traders are turning their attention to Coldware (COLD) , which offers a real utility proposition that DOGE cannot match. Coldware (COLD): The Rising Star in Crypto As DOGE struggles to find new catalysts for growth, Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a strong competitor, offering investors a more practical investment with real-world utility. Unlike DOGE, Coldware (COLD ) is backed by a robust technological framework and a focus on scalability, making it an attractive option for those seeking long-term growth. The presale for Coldware (COLD) has already raised over $2.2 million , and it is gaining momentum as more investors see the potential for massive returns. Coldware (COLD) offers a unique combination of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and real-world asset (RWA) integration, setting it apart from meme coins like DOGE. The Struggles of Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, once seen as the leader of the meme coin market, has faced significant challenges in recent months. Despite strong community support and occasional price surges, DOGE has struggled to break past key resistance levels. Currently trading at around $0.1756, DOGE is showing signs of resistance around $0.20 and $0.25. Analysts predict that without significant developments or utility improvements, DOGE may continue to face a stagnating price trajectory. In recent weeks, DOGE has failed to break through its previous all-time high of $0.74, and while there is optimism within the community, its lack of real-world utility and reliance on speculative trading may limit its growth potential. Despite efforts to promote DOGE as a store of value, the coin has faced significant hurdles in terms of scalability and adoption. Will DOGE Reach $1 by 2025? While DOGE has a loyal following and continues to receive support from figures like Elon Musk, its price trajectory may struggle to reach the $1 mark in 2025. The lack of real-world use cases and utility-driven adoption could continue to hinder DOGE’s growth. However, if DOGE were to break through key resistance levels and gain broader institutional support, it could potentially touch $1 by the end of 2025. Coldware (COLD): The 50x Opportunity As DOGE faces uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a more stable and practical investment option. With a strong presale performance and growing investor confidence, Coldware (COLD) has the potential to offer 50x returns, making it one of the most promising tokens in the market today. Unlike DOGE, which remains speculative, Coldware (COLD) offers real-world utility, which could lead to sustainable growth and long-term value. Conclusion: A Changing Crypto Landscape While Dogecoin (DOGE) may still have a place in the meme coin world, its future growth prospects appear limited without substantial utility improvements. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) offers a more promising path forward with its innovative approach and growing market interest.

The numbers are a major milestone not only for WhiteBIT but the broader crypto industry , as they highlight the increasing adoption of digital assets as an everyday spending alternative to fiat. The growing adoption of crypto payment solutions By some estimates , nearly one in five crypto holders is expected to use digital assets for everyday purchases by 2026. The projections are expected given that over 560 million people now own crypto, meaning there is a vast potential user base for emerging crypto cards which incentivize adoption with enhanced privacy, simplified borderless transactions, the ability to convert digital assets into fiat, and various rewards. Another statistic worth noting is that the crypto credit card market, valued at $1.3 billion in 2024, is predicted to reach no less than $220.46 billion by 2033 — an annual growth rate of 8.6%. The most commonly spent digital currencies right now include USD Coin ( USDC ), Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ), and they are used for a wide range of transactions, for example, on platforms like Spotify, YouTube , and PlayStation . Luxury retailers are also seeing significant engagement, although everyday grocery shopping, dining, and online subscriptions remain the most popular spending categories. Crypto card incentives Rewards like cashbacks remain the top incentive for crypto card adoption. For instance, grocery purchases account for the largest share of cashback (22.8%), followed by food and café spending (20.4%) at number two and subscription services (14.1%) at number three. This, among other reasons, is why 88.52% of WhiteBIT Nova users opt for the digital version of the card. The trend also aligns with the growing digital wallet adoption, which has been projected to grow by 53% from 2022 to 2026, reaching 5.2 billion users.

With expectations the Fed will cut in June , there’s no better time to go hunting for the best altcoins that could mint a tidy fortune as the market rises once again. In this list, we’re breaking down five of the best altcoins to invest in for the Fed cutting cycle, each deserving a place in any portfolio. The best altcoins to buy before June: Bitcoin Pepe: Driving Bitcoin’s meme moment PepeX: The fair, AI-powered meme coin launchpad CartelFi: Where memes earn cartel-grade yield Act I: The AI Prophecy: The AI agent pioneer Myro: Solana’s true community token Bitcoin Pepe: Driving Bitcoin’s meme moment Bitcoin Pepe joins a long line of Pepe-themed projects, but it’s unlike anything ever seen before. For years, Solana has ruled the meme scene with its low fees and blazing speeds, making it a go-to for new meme coins. Bitcoin Pepe offers all that and more but on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Pepe is a layer-2 built to bring meme coins home to Bitcoin. It uses the PEP-20 token standard to allow meme coins, NFTs, and even DeFi projects to flourish directly on the world’s largest and most secure network. Think of Bitcoin Pepe as Solana’s pump.fun moment for Bitcoin. Importantly, it could be the catalyst for unlocking trillions of dormant BTC liquidity waiting on the sidelines and sending that capital flowing directly into memes. Early adopters of the BPEP presale stand to benefit tremendously. Across 30 stages, BPEP will rise more than 300% before it hits exchanges in Q2, with each stage rising 5% in price. Along with the prospect of Bitcoin Pepe driving the next meme coin supercycle, these initial returns—plus staking rewards with quadruple figure options—have driven more than $5.8m to the presale, now in its 8th stage with 193% left to climb. Bitcoin Pepe is preparing to mark the next milestone in Bitcoin’s history, turning it into an ecosystem that may be the death knell for Solana. Rate cuts have propelled meme coins in the past, and they’re likely to do so again come June, meaning BPEP might time its launch perfectly. That makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in as the rate-cutting cycle resumes. PepeX: The fair, AI-powered meme coin launchpad PepeX is a new AI-powered meme token launchpad giving Pump.fun a serious run for its money. Millions of tokens were created on Pump.fun in 2024, yet just 0.4% of traders made more than $10,000. At the mercy of insiders and snipers, traders want a fairer alternative. With the upcoming launch of PepeX, the wait is over. Built with fairness at its centre, PepeX offers real protection for retail buyers. Founders only get 5% of their coin’s supply after putting up a $500 fee. If their project flops, their locked liquidity is redistributed to the community. That means accountability is baked in. It’s positioned as the smart alternative, with anti-sniping protections, transparent bubble maps, and an AI-powered marketing bot that does the shilling for every new project. Launching a token here is so easy with the AI Moonshot Engine, it’s scary—just type in a ticker, drop a few prompts, and let the AI build everything: branding, LPs, social accounts, even agents to manage communities. The demand for PepeX is clear: just 1 week after the PEPX token presale went live, it’s raised more than $1.1m. Investors have rushed in to get ahead of 5% price rises every three days across the 30-stage ICO, with 272% currently on offer in the 3rd stage ahead of a listing towards the end of June. PepeX is setting up the next meme coin supercycle with an efficient, ruthless, and fair platform. With pump.fun-killer potential, PEPX is one of the top altcoins to watch right now. CartelFi: Where memes earn cartel-grade yield CartelFi is DeFi with attitude. It’s the first-ever yield cartel for meme coins, offering a way out for traders stuck between chasing pumps and earning steady returns. While most DeFi platforms cater to stablecoins or blue-chip assets, CartelFi leans into volatility. It lets traders deposit meme coins into purpose-built liquidity pools and earn up to 300% APY or 10% on stables. That means no more selling low just to squeeze a few percent yield; instead, gain exposure to all of the upside and accumulate tokens. The real power move is its ultra-deflationary mechanism. 99% of all protocol fees go toward buying back the CARTFI token, with 50% of that being permanently burned. Constant buy pressure and a shrinking supply is a recipe for long-term price appreciation—a massive bonus for early backers. The presale kicks off 8th April, starting at just $0.0251, increasing 5% every three days over a 90-day run. 25% of CARTFI is set aside for ICO buyers, while 10% goes towards huge presale staking rewards—set to be unveiled soon—and 25% for liquidity and farming incentives. The rest fuels the growth of the meme-farming empire. It’s a solution meme traders have been calling out for, ranking CartelFi among the best altcoins to buy before the Fed cuts rates. Act I: The AI Prophecy: The AI agent pioneer Act I: The AI Prophecy isn’t the typical AI project. Act I is pioneering in the field of AI agents, offering a decentralized space where multiple AI models collaborate directly with human users and entirely new kinds of digital interactions. Instead of confining AI to rigid guidelines, Act I has built an environment where AI can learn, evolve, and innovate alongside users. It’s such a compelling idea that it’s one of the few AI tokens that Marc Andreessen of a16z has invested in. Now, the upcoming launch of the ACT DAO and a new ACT Framework is drawing attention. The DAO will offer users direct influence over project direction, governance, and investments, while the ACT Framework provides developer-friendly tools to build creative AI projects easily. The project secured a Binance listing back in November, a move that sent the ACT token skyrocketing. From $0.02 on the 11th of November, it smashed past $0.75 by the 15th, topping a $722 million market cap. While it’s settled back to $0.19 as of mid-March, a resurgence in AI meme coins could rank ACT among the best altcoins this year. With Fed rate cuts coming down the line that could push AI projects higher, this is one of the altcoins to watch. Myro: Solana’s true community token While Bonk might be known as the face of Solana meme coins, it’s Myro working tirelessly behind the scenes to drive Solana adoption forward. Named after Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s dog, Myro went live in November 2023 to mix meme culture with genuine utility. Myro now represents a limited but well-thought-out ecosystem. The Myro Buy Bot offers free exposure to up-and-coming Solana projects in return for a small fee. At the same time, its Social-Fi mobile app allows users to monetize their own content by minting collectible NFTs directly from their posts. Fans can even earn rewards by liking popular posts. The token is completely fee-free, and all 1 billion MYRO tokens are in circulation. Plus, developers have burned their liquidity tokens and renounced contract ownership—making MYRO one of the safer and more transparent meme coins. Myro made headlines back in March 2024 for ripping to over $0.40 from $0.002 at launch. The hype has died down since, but Myro’s energetic community of over 100,000 members across Twitter and Telegram could easily propel it much higher from $0.016 today . Among the best altcoins to buy before June, it doesn’t get much better than Myro. These are the top altcoins to buy before June With rate cuts on the horizon, crypto is primed to surge. The right altcoins have the potential to deliver incredible gains when timed correctly, and with a recent market dip, these tokens are available at a significant discount. For those looking to turn a modest investment into something far greater, these are the five altcoins to watch as June approaches.

The crypto market has resumed its bearish momentum, with Dogecoin being one of the assets affected. Between January and April 2024, the price of Dogecoin saw a significant drop from over $0.40 to around $0.16.Key Support and Resistance Levels for DogecoinRecently, the price has decreased by 3.6% over the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term fall, analyst Ali Martinez's recent chart proves that Dogecoin's overall price movement from 2018 to 2025 has generally followed an upward trajectory.According to Martinez, at present, Dogecoin is at a make-or-break level, a critical level that must hold for any potential uptrend to continue. If the price stays above this point, Martinez suggests Dogecoin could rally towards the resistance at $0.57, representing a 256.25% increase. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1907631139168079972However, if the support at $0.16 fails to hold, a significant drop to $0.06 is possible, signaling a 62.5% decrease in value. Martinez is however not the only analyst watching Dogecoin price future moves.Bullish Divergence and Market SentimentNotably, another analyst, deeppatidar14, is observing a bullish divergence on Dogecoin's 3-month chart. This pattern indicates that while the price has been making higher lows, the RSI (Relative Strength Index), a momentum indicator, has been seeing lower lows.This discrepancy often signals a potential reversal or rally. The analyst advises traders to focus on the numbers and avoid being swayed by the news.Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern IdentifiedMeanwhile, a separate analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has pointed out a short-term bullish pattern forming on Dogecoin's chart. Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, typically indicative of a trend reversal. This pattern formed on the 4-hour chart, with the left shoulder forming when Dogecoin dropped to $0.1658 on March 29, followed by a dip to $0.1601 on March 31. The right shoulder then developed after a recent decline to $0.1677. The neckline of this pattern is positioned at $0.1760, and a breakout above this level could confirm a potential reversal to the upside.In addition to the technical analysis, significant growth in address activity has been noted. Over the past seven days, new addresses have increased by 102.40%, while active addresses have risen by 111.32%.",Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-03 13:55:41

Will It Take Over Dogecoin’s Legacy?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/yeti-ouro-raises-over-3-18-million-in-viral-crypto-presale-will-it-take-over-dogecoins-legacy/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has led projects that have been driven by the community in the crypto market for years, but the meme coin sector is now changing. There has been a rise in investors who prefer to put their funds in utility meme coins like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) rather than coins like DOGEC, which has survived the market using hype culture. Yeti Ouro’s presale has seen massive attention, raising over $3,18 million. The project is currently in Stage 3 of its presale and its tokens are priced at $0.024. emphasizing security and gaming utility, YETIO has positioned itself as more than an asset that relies on speculation. Dogecoin Price Action And Market Speculation Dogecoin supporters have remained hopeful about a price rise as the wider market continues to face scrutiny. Ever since the controversy surrounding Argentina President Javier Milei and his endorsement of the Libra token–an incident that nearly resulted in his impeachment–there have been increased concerns about meme coins moving away from the core principle of decentralization that the crypto sector was built on. Dogecoin’s Cup and Handle Pattern: A Classic Setup or a Misleading Signal? On the other hand, the recent price performance of Dogecoin has caused discussions about a possible cup and handle formation. The pattern started after the price of the asset dropped from its all-time high of $0.71 in May 2021 before it stabilized around the $0.05 to $0.06 price mark. The price of the asset later saw a rise to $0.48 in December 2024, showing a renewed bullish sentiment. However, a rejection and a pullback later, the asset moved to the $0.14 to $0.17 range, leading to the creation of what analysts call the handle. Despite the setup, analysts are still not convinced. A classic cup and handle formation appears close to the previous resistance level. However, the asset’s drop from $0.74 to $0.05 over the last few years has seen it too long for it to qualify. Additionally, the handle’s drop of about 65% from the rim of the cup is against the traditional charting principles. via TradingView Some experts argue that DOGE is instead undergoing a long-term accumulation phase rather than preparing for a breakout. Dogecoin Founder’s Portfolio Raises Questions Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin and widely recognized in the crypto industry as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, recently caused debates with a cryptic post on X. He shared a chart showing a small price drop, which many saw as a satirical critique of media outlets that exaggerate small crypto price movements. However, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham has revealed a new fact, noting that Markus’ wallet currently holds zero Dogecoin. Instead, it contains various small-cap tokens, including 100,000 Shiba Inu (SHIB), a token that was seen as the Doge Killer. Yeti Ouro: The Rising Star of Crypto Gaming While many meme coins in the market rely on speculation, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is making it big in the Web3 gaming sector. Its presale registered big success, raising over $3.18 million. The current Stage 3 price per token is $0.024, with the price showing early investors from Stage 1 a 100% ROI. YETIO has also audited its security from SOLIDProof, following a structured roadmap, top exchange listings following its launch and multi-platform P2E (Play-to-Earn) game launches. The platform’s main project, YetiGO, is a racing game built with Unreal Engine 5. It allows players to earn while competing, providing several features for them to excel in the game. The project has also entered into a partnership with a top gaming platform in the gaming industry responsible for games like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, bringing quality to every detail. The audio experience of the project is also shaped by award-winning sound engineers who have worked alongside Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Kabaka Pyramid, and Vybz Kartel. Below is the official reveal of the central character of the game and a first look at the captivating world. Tokenomics: A Deflationary Model with Real Utility The tokenomics structure of YETIO was designed for sustainability. Unlike some tokens that increase in supply through mining or staking rewards, Yeti Ouro has a cap of one billion tokens with a mechanism that reduces the circulating supply over time. This is how YETIO’s supply is distributed: 50% for presale 15% for play-to-earn rewards 15% for community rewards Remaining for team, marketing, liquidity, and a burning mechanism With the project’s reliance on gaming, security credentials, and a structured roadmap, YETIO is a better option to popular hype tokens like DOGE, with some analysts predicting that it may overtake DOGE’s growth in 2025. It is presently offering a 20% bonus on all purchases with an additional 5% on purchases over $500. To invest in YETIO is easy. Investors need a good DeFi wallet on any network of their choice, including Meta mask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc. Place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website for the preferred amount of YETIO tokens and complete it with a one-click transaction.

The airdrop will occur on April 22, and users can check their eligibility to receive $HYPER tokens via a portal provided by the Hyperlane Foundation by April 13, the team shared in a press release with CoinDesk. The token distribution will mostly go to the community, with 57% of the supply going to users, while the remaining circulating tokens will be distributed to the core team (25%), investors (10.9%), and the foundation’s treasury (7.1%). The team also shared that the airdrop will be fully unlocked for community recipients, while the core team and investors' tokens will be locked for the first 12 months. In addition to the token distribution to early users, Hyperlane is coming out with their “expansion rewards” program, which is based on developer and cross-chain end-user activity, and will be distributed to users each quarter proportional to their activity on the network. “The retroactive token allocation at TGE is just the first of many over the coming several years, as protocol ownership begins moving into the hands of the developers and end-users who rely on Hyperlane to send assets and other critical messages across chains,” said Nam Chu Hoai, a co-founder of Hyperlane.

He revealed the level the flagship crypto needs to hold to avoid these “heavy declines.” Bitcoin Price Could Witness Further Crash If It Falls Below This Level In a TradingView post, Pejman stated that the Bitcoin price could record heavy declines if it falls below $83,500. This warning came following a bullish analysis in which he remarked that BTC seems to be completing the bullish flag pattern. The analyst added that he expects the flagship crypto to rally to the upside as it looks to fill the CME gap at the $86,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles: Crypto Analyst Bucks Back Against Bearish Sentiment, Top Is Not In This eventually happened as the Bitcoin price rallied to as high as $88,000 amid the massive volatility that occurred following Trump’s reciprocal tariffs announcement. However, Pejman suggested that the rally to $88,000 is likely the local top for BTC, stating that there is a possibility that Bitcoin will fall again following this price surge. Moreover, the Bitcoin price has since corrected following the rally to $88,000. This price crash occurred as Trump unveiled the customized tariff rates for countries such as China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan. This move from the US president is expected to trigger a trade war, with these countries retaliating with counter-tariffs, which is bearish for BTC and the broader crypto market. BTC Could Still Drop To As Low As $78,000 Based on crypto analyst Kevin Capital’s analysis, the Bitcoin price could soon drop to as low as $78,000. The analyst noted that there is a little bit of long liquidity at the $78,000 to $80,000 level, but there is also a lot of liquidity in the $87,000 to $90,000 range. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Makes Case For Bitcoin Price At $260,000, But This Invalidation Level Threatens The Rally He further remarked that market makers could look to transact in that $87,000 to $90,000 range just before Trump’s tariff announcement, which happened as predicted. With the Bitcoin price sucking up the liquidty at the $87,000 to $90,000 range, it looks likely to drop to the $78,000 to $80,000 range to also suck up the liquidity at that range. Despite the Bitcoin price’s downtrend over the past two months, crypto analyst Rekt Capital is still bullish on the flagship crypto’s trajectory. He noted that BTC experienced a 32% downtrend from mid-March 2024 to early September 2024, a pullback that lasted almost six months before its price broke to new all-time highs (ATHs). As such, the analyst suggested this downtrend is nothing to worry about as BTC could still rally to new highs in a flash. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $83,000, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42853836,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145962,1743688834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Rupee: Why India’s Currency Defies US Tariff Market Dip,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/rupee-defies-us-tariff-dip/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and digital assets, where volatility is often the name of the game, the stability of traditional currencies can seem like a distant concept. Yet, understanding the dynamics of fiat currencies, especially in the face of global economic shifts, offers crucial insights into broader market trends that can indirectly impact the crypto sphere. Today, we’re diving into a fascinating case study: the Indian Rupee holding its ground amidst a significant market dip triggered by renewed US tariffs . Is this just a fleeting moment of calm, or does it signal deeper economic resilience? Let’s explore the factors at play and what this means for the global financial landscape. Why is Currency Stability Important in Today’s Volatile Market? In an era defined by rapid technological advancements and interconnected global economies, currency stability acts as a bedrock of financial confidence. For traders, investors, and even everyday citizens, a stable currency offers predictability and reduces the anxieties associated with fluctuating values. But why is this so critical, especially now? Predictability for Businesses: Imagine a business importing goods. If their home currency is highly volatile, budgeting and pricing become nightmares. Stable currencies allow businesses to plan effectively, manage costs, and ensure consistent profitability. Investor Confidence: Investors, both domestic and international, are drawn to economies with stable currencies. It signals sound economic management and reduces the risk of currency devaluation eroding investment returns. This is particularly relevant in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which is vital for economic growth. Reduced Inflationary Pressures: A depreciating currency makes imports more expensive, potentially leading to imported inflation. Currency stability helps to keep inflation in check, preserving the purchasing power of consumers and maintaining economic equilibrium. Debt Management: For countries with significant foreign currency debt, a stable domestic currency is crucial. A sharp depreciation can make debt servicing much more expensive, potentially leading to financial distress. In the cryptocurrency world, while volatility is often seen as an opportunity, the underlying stability of fiat currencies and the global financial system still plays a significant role. Major economic events impacting fiat currencies can create ripple effects across all markets, including crypto. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed decision-making in the digital asset space. The US Tariff Trigger: What Caused the Market Dip? The global economy is a complex web of interconnected factors, and trade policies enacted by major economies like the United States can send ripples across the world. Recently, the re-imposition of US tariffs on certain goods has become a significant catalyst for market dip . But how exactly do these tariffs lead to market instability? When the U.S. imposes tariffs on imports, it essentially increases the cost of these goods for American consumers and businesses. This can lead to several consequences: Trade Tensions Escalate: Tariffs are often seen as protectionist measures and can provoke retaliatory tariffs from other countries. This tit-for-tat can escalate into trade wars, creating uncertainty and dampening global economic sentiment. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses with global supply chains may face increased costs and disruptions as they adjust to the new tariff regime. This can impact production, profitability, and overall market confidence. Market Uncertainty: The imposition of tariffs introduces uncertainty into the market. Investors become wary of potential economic slowdowns, reduced corporate earnings, and broader economic instability. This uncertainty often leads to sell-offs in equity markets, contributing to a market dip . Currency Fluctuations: Trade tensions and economic uncertainty can also lead to fluctuations in currency values. Investors may seek safe-haven assets, impacting the demand and supply dynamics of various currencies. In the context of the recent market dip, concerns over renewed US tariffs have played a significant role in unsettling investor sentiment. This global economic uncertainty provides the backdrop against which the Indian Rupee’s performance becomes particularly noteworthy. Indian Rupee’s Resilience: Holding Steady Amidst the Storm While global markets grappled with the fallout from renewed US tariffs , the Indian Rupee has demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding relatively steady against major currencies. This stability is not just a matter of luck; it’s a result of a combination of factors reflecting India’s economic fundamentals and strategic policy decisions. What are these factors contributing to the Indian Rupee’s surprising strength? Robust Economic Growth: India remains one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. This strong economic growth provides a solid foundation for the Indian Rupee , attracting foreign investment and bolstering confidence in the currency. Healthy Foreign Exchange Reserves: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has built up substantial foreign exchange reserves. These reserves act as a buffer, allowing the RBI to intervene in the forex market to manage volatility and support the Indian Rupee when needed. Prudent Monetary Policy: The RBI has maintained a relatively prudent monetary policy, focused on controlling inflation and maintaining macroeconomic stability. This approach has instilled confidence in investors and contributed to currency stability . Strong Domestic Demand: India’s large and growing domestic market provides a degree of insulation from external shocks. Strong domestic demand supports economic activity and reduces reliance on exports, making the economy and the Indian Rupee less vulnerable to global trade tensions. Capital Inflows: Despite global uncertainties, India continues to attract capital inflows, both in terms of foreign direct investment and portfolio investments. These inflows support the demand for the Indian Rupee and contribute to its stability. This confluence of factors has allowed the Indian Rupee to weather the storm of global market volatility triggered by US tariffs , standing out as a beacon of stability in a turbulent financial landscape. Benefits of a Stable Rupee: Impact on the Indian Economy and Beyond The Indian Rupee’s currency stability in the face of global economic headwinds offers a range of benefits, not just for the Indian economy but also for international trade and investment. Let’s explore some key advantages: Reduced Import Costs: A stable or appreciating Rupee makes imports cheaper in local currency terms. This is particularly beneficial for India, which is a major importer of commodities like crude oil. Lower import costs can help to keep inflation under control and reduce the burden on consumers and businesses. Lower External Debt Burden: For Indian companies and the government with foreign currency debt, a stable Rupee means a reduced debt burden in local currency terms. This can free up resources for productive investments and reduce financial risks. Enhanced Investor Confidence: Currency stability enhances investor confidence in the Indian economy. It signals macroeconomic stability and sound economic management, attracting further foreign investment and boosting economic growth. Improved Creditworthiness: A stable currency can improve India’s creditworthiness in international markets. This can lead to lower borrowing costs for the government and Indian companies when they access international capital markets. Support for Forex Market Confidence: The resilience of the Indian Rupee can contribute to overall confidence in the forex market , particularly in emerging market currencies. It demonstrates that sound economic fundamentals and prudent policies can provide a buffer against global economic shocks. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the stability of a major emerging market currency like the Indian Rupee highlights the importance of macroeconomic factors in the broader financial ecosystem. While crypto markets operate with their own dynamics, they are not entirely immune to global economic trends and currency movements. Challenges and Considerations: Can the Rupee Maintain its Course? While the Indian Rupee has shown impressive resilience, it’s crucial to acknowledge that challenges and potential risks remain. The global economic landscape is constantly evolving, and several factors could test the Rupee’s currency stability in the future. What are some of these potential headwinds? Global Economic Slowdown: A significant global economic slowdown could impact India’s exports and capital inflows, potentially putting downward pressure on the Indian Rupee . Geopolitical Risks: Escalating geopolitical tensions, such as trade wars or regional conflicts, could increase risk aversion and lead to capital outflows from emerging markets like India, impacting the Rupee. Domestic Economic Challenges: While India’s economic growth is robust, domestic challenges such as inflation, fiscal deficits, and structural issues could pose risks to currency stability if not effectively managed. Changes in US Monetary Policy: Aggressive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve could strengthen the US dollar and potentially lead to capital outflows from emerging markets, putting pressure on currencies like the Indian Rupee . Commodity Price Volatility: As a major oil importer, India is vulnerable to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. A sharp spike in oil prices could widen India’s trade deficit and put downward pressure on the Indian Rupee . Maintaining currency stability is an ongoing effort. The RBI and the Indian government need to remain vigilant and proactive in managing these potential risks through sound economic policies and strategic interventions. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from the Rupee’s Performance? The Indian Rupee’s performance amidst the US tariff -induced market dip offers valuable lessons for investors, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding global financial dynamics. What are the key takeaways? Economic Fundamentals Matter: Strong economic fundamentals, such as robust growth, healthy reserves, and prudent policies, are crucial for currency stability , especially in times of global uncertainty. Diversification is Key: For investors, the Rupee’s resilience highlights the importance of diversification. Relying solely on one asset class or market can be risky. A diversified portfolio that includes exposure to different currencies and economies can help to mitigate risk. Monitor Global Economic Trends: Understanding global economic trends, including trade policies, geopolitical events, and monetary policy shifts, is essential for making informed financial decisions. These factors can have a significant impact on currency values and market movements. Emerging Markets Can Offer Stability: While often perceived as riskier, some emerging markets, like India, can offer surprising resilience and stability. Careful analysis of economic fundamentals and policy frameworks can uncover valuable investment opportunities. Currency Stability is a Sign of Economic Health: For policymakers, the Rupee’s performance underscores the importance of prioritizing macroeconomic stability. Currency stability is not just a goal in itself; it’s a reflection of broader economic health and a foundation for sustainable growth. For those in the cryptocurrency space, observing the resilience of the Indian Rupee can provide a valuable perspective. While the crypto market is driven by different forces, the underlying principles of economic stability, investor confidence, and global interconnectedness are relevant across all financial markets. Conclusion: A Beacon of Resilience in a Turbulent World In a world increasingly characterized by volatility and uncertainty, the Indian Rupee’s steadfast performance amidst a market dip triggered by US tariffs is a compelling story of economic resilience. It underscores the importance of sound economic fundamentals, prudent policy-making, and the inherent strength of a large and growing economy. While challenges remain, the Rupee’s ability to hold its ground offers a powerful message of stability and confidence in the face of global economic headwinds. This resilience not only benefits the Indian economy but also contributes to a more stable and predictable global forex market , offering valuable lessons for all participants in the interconnected world of finance.

These Tokens Head South The global trade war escalated earlier this week after the US President Donald Trump announced a new series of tariffs on the European Union, China, Japan, and many other countries. The cryptocurrency market reacted negatively to the news, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping to $82,000. The meme coin sector also took a blow , with some Trump-themed tokens dumping to multi-month lows. Official Trump (TRUMP) – the biggest of that type with a market cap of almost $1.8 billion – tanked by 14% on a daily scale and currently trades at just south of $9 (per CoinGecko’s data). TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko This is the lowest level observed since mid-January, when the asset saw the light of day. It was launched by President Trump’s team and quickly became one of the sensations in the crypto world. On January 19, the token’s valuation exploded above $70, while its market capitalization skyrocketed to roughly $14.5 billion. Thus, TRUMP flipped Shiba Inu (SHIB) and briefly became the second-biggest meme coin, trailing only behind Dogecoin (DOGE). However, the peak was short-lived, and the coin has been on a massive downtrend ever since the billionaire officially stepped into the White House as America’s 47th president. Other Trump-themed meme coins which have recorded painful losses in the past 24 hours include MAGA (-6%), PTRUMP (-8%), STRUMP (-9%), SUITRUMP (-11%), and more. Traders should keep in mind that the aforementioned tokens are highly speculative and tend to spike or crash based on Trump-related news. The American president will likely remain in the spotlight due to his trade tariffs and other policies, meaning these meme coins could experience additional volatility in the short term. TRUMP’s Next Potential Move Several hours ago, the largest Trump-themed meme coin was trading slightly above $10. At that point, the renowned analyst Ali Martinez claimed losing that support level might lead to a quick drop to $8. On the other hand, the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals an incoming resurgence. The technical indicator varies from 0 to 100, as readings below 30 hint that TRUMP has entered oversold territory and might be poised for a rally. Conversely, anything above 70 is interpreted as a bearish sign. The RSI recently entered the bullish zone and is currently set at around 25.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has been surfing the tides of the market. Amidst the turn of events, marketers are hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE in order to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently holding onto its support at $0.159, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.18. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

That’s not all, Dogecoin has witnessed an impressive 400% spike in its active addresses, hinting at growing network activity. If the FOMO around Dogecoin continues to grow and if influencers promote the coin, then its price could reach $1.07 . However, if Dogecoin cannot maintain its current growth rate, its price will likely average out at $0.84 in a highly competitive market. On the other hand, if Dogecoin fails to stay relevant in 2025, the price of DOGE can plunge to a low of $0.62 .

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) crashed by 3.5% in the last 24 hours as it approached the crucial support at $80,000. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) price dropped to $1,765, while Ripple ( XRP ) fell below the key support at $2. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies declined by 4% to $2.6 trillion, meaning investors have lost over $1 trillion in recent months.

He imposed a minimum tariff of 10%, with China and the European Union’s tariffs being 34% and 24%. Trump has also imposed a 25% tariff on steel, aluminium, and parts. Therefore, there is a risk that these tariffs will trigger a recession in the US and other countries. Polymarket odds of a US recession in 2025 rose to a record high, while a TS Lombard analyst said : “The imposition of tariffs is not a mild stagflationary event, this is a recession-producing turn — if these tariffs stay in place.” BTC, ETH, and XRP prices to depend on Federal Reserve Historically, risky assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks plunge immediately following black swan events. Stocks dropped sharply at the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Similarly, both stocks and crypto fell in March 2020 when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. In both cases, the market began to recover only after the Federal Reserve intervened. The stock market experienced a decade-long rally after the 2008 crisis, while both stocks and crypto rebounded strongly after the Fed slashed interest rates in March 2020. Now is the time to remember that more wealth is created during recessions than any other time. Few understand this, and even fewer act on it. — Kelly (@SelfMadeMastery) April 2, 2025 In this case, however, the Fed may decide to accelerate its interest rate cuts if it sees the US veering into a recession. Also, Donald Trump may decide to offer bailouts to key sectors like agriculture, leading to more money supply and higher asset prices. Therefore, while BTC, ETH, XRP, and other altcoins may continue to fall in the short term, a rebound cannot be ruled out if the Federal Reserve steps in.

Starting as a joke, DOGE has shown over and again that it can yield significant profits faster than most well-known cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL). Many are looking at Dogecoin as one of the fastest-growing digital assets in the industry as the crypto market heats up for yet another optimistic run. Though another cryptocurrency is ready to go even faster, Dogecoin is projected to turn $400 into $4,000 at a quick speed. Rexas Finance (RXS) is already preparing for an even more significant jump, maybe surpassing both Dogecoin and Solana in terms of increase before DOGE starts its next rally. Dogecoin’s History of Explosive Growth The history of Dogecoin is dotted with large breakouts that surprised the market. DOGE surged from fractions of a cent to over $0.70, creating several millionaires overnight. Dogecoin has remained a highly volatile asset, with notable price swings even in the most recent market cycles. A strong community and support from influential people like Elon Musk help explain Dogecoin's success. With regular social media boosts and rising real-world payment acceptance, DOGE keeps a strong place in crypto. Many experts think Dogecoin can turn $400 into $4,000 in the following months, providing a 10x return in a short period of time since it moves fast once momentum gathers. Though DOGE is predicted to move quickly, it might not be the fastest crypto in the competition. Why Dogecoin Could Outpace Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has experienced a significant price correction over the last month. On Jan. 19, the asset hit an all-time high of $293.31. Since then, SOL’s price has dipped by 134% to $134.4 as of this writing. SOL is in a strong downtrend, so its path to 10x is bumpy. Solana's market capitalization is also much higher; hence, SOL would need a massive capital influx 10x. For long-term investors, Solana has been a consistent investment; but, it lacks the viral drive that lets meme coins like DOGE soar in a few weeks. Here, Dogecoin has the benefit. DOGE can yield significant profits faster than Solana since retail traders continuously increase demand and the market mood is changing fast. Though DOGE accelerates price faster than SOL, one cryptocurrency is poised to surpass both. The Crypto Set to Move Even Faster: Rexas Finance (RXS Although Dogecoin is a well-known fast performer, Rexas Finance (RXS) is the next big thing in the crypto scene. Unlike meme coins dependent only on community excitement, RXS is supported by actual usefulness, robust tokenomics, and a fast growing ecosystem. Currently in its last presale stage at $0.20 per token, RXS has already jumped from its starting price of $0.03 to provide early investors almost a 6x return before even touching exchanges. The presale of Rexas Finance already defines the direction of its bright future. Selling over 457.3 million tokens at a nominal price of $0.20, the project has generated an incredible $47.4 million. Early investor confidence indicates strong market support for the project's long-term plan. Whales are accumulating RXS ahead of launch and an official listing price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025, suggest that RXS may be preparing for a spectacular surge. Rexas Finance's emphasis on real-world asset tokenizing, DeFi solutions, and creative launchpad for fresh crypto businesses adds even more appeal. This implies that it has a far more substantial basis than only speculative assets, which enables it to continue long-term expansion even when it causes significant short-term price swings. With analysts projecting a possible 20x or even 50x increase following debut, RXS can transform $400 into $8,000 or more—well above what DOGE is predicted to reach in the same period. Final Thoughts: RXS Before DOGE Before SOL The sequence of possible returns seems obvious for those wishing to profit from fast crypto gains: Rexas Finance (RXS) is ready to explode first, then Dogecoin (DOGE), while Solana (SOL) stays a strong long-term hold. Although Dogecoin is still among the fastest-moving assets available on the crypto market, RXS is already gathering momentum that can see it outperforming DOGE and SOL regarding short-term returns. Keeping an eye on Rexas Finance (RXS) before it formally starts could help investors looking for the next great 10x or even 50x chance to maximize gains in the forthcoming bull cycle.

Recent AI models predict Dogecoin (DOGE) will experience a powerful price increase which has sparked ongoing interest in this cryptocurrency. The cross-border payment token Remittix (RTX) gathers strength according to analysts who predict its value could reach 100x in favorable situations. The strategic possibilities emerge when evaluating the assets based on their real-world functionality after the evaluation of speculative momentum concludes. Dogecoin’s Sentiment-Driven Trajectory The world recognizes Dogecoin as a highly visible cryptocurrency because its popularity stems from its social cultural appeal and community support rather than technological development. The coin initiated as an amusing project has surpassed technical projections through the power of retail influencer activity combined with celebrity market involvement. The deployment of AI-driven price prediction models has excited Dogecoin backers because they forecast the token will reach $0.57 during late April which represents a 229% rise from its current value. Dogecoin reached a trading point of $0.1714 on April 2, 2025. The currency experienced nominal price growth during the last day since the market continues to experience low movement. The market experts predict that Dogecoin will show limited development during the next month yet they maintain diverse opinions about its price movement. Even as market conditions rise based on investor sentiment the possibility of such a sentiment-fueled rally always looms in the future. The price of Dogecoin relies primarily on sudden spikes of public interest instead of traditional technical criteria presenting both investment threats and prospects. The price increase of DOGE does not change the technical constraints of its operation. The practical use of Dogecoin extends primarily to tipping along with occasional casual transactions while its programming frameworks remain behind contemporary platforms. Dogecoin faces doubts about its permanence in an emerging market environment which prioritizes practicality instead of meme-like popularity. Remittix Enters With Purpose and Precision RTX (Remittix) operates as a purposeful solution for global financial needs whereas Dogecoin functions through the power of hype. As an alternative to other new altcoins which try to duplicate previous cycles, Remittix solves existing problems with international money transfer methods. The older banking infrastructure delivers funds between international territories while requiring complex procedures and high costs and requiring time. Through Remittix’s system users can transmit cryptocurrency which instantly gets transformed into fiat currency for automatic bank deposits into recipients’ accounts. The blockchain system creates new opportunities beyond SWIFT and Western Union alternatives by changing the practical applications of blockchain technology for common consumers. Remittix gives three essential benefits to senders overseas who wish to transfer money back home as well as to NGOs active in restricted banking areas and freelancers conducting business in global platforms: it provides fast processing and enhanced operational efficiency and affordable costs. The market entry of Remittix tokens has been as interesting as their performance on exchange. At present RTX has finished its presale phase where investors purchased 525 million tokens worth $14.3 million at the price of $0.0734 each. The investor composition stands out because Remittix draws financial support from both early-stage institutions and long-term holders and fintech market influencers. According to analysts, RTX could generate 100x returns by capturing a small portion of the Dogecoin investor base because cross-border crypto payment demand keeps increasing. Final Thoughts: The Shift from Hype to Utility A gradual revision occurs within the cryptocurrency market at this time. The era when meme-based easy price increases disappeared from the market. Purpose-built financial networks became possible due to projects such as Ripple which secured institutional support. The market shows increasing attention to Remittix as it extends the mission from financial institutions into retail businesses and small enterprises. RTX along with similar tokens will lead future markets because they address global problems instead of providing only short-term fun from Dogecoin. An upward movement by Dogecoin towards its predicted targets might become the catalyst that drives Remittix prices to 100 times their current value making it the most unsung prediction in the crypto market at this moment.

But Web3? Not so much, says ad-tech exec Asaf Nadler. His company Addressable, is out with a new service that Nadler, the chief operating officer, claims will improve the efficacy of Web3 marketing — from the perspective of salespeople, of course. It's all about ""retargeting"" the most valuable potential customers: people who very nearly pressed buy, trade, sell, swap, join, but didn't. Finding those folks in Web2 is straightforward given the troves of personal data scattered online. Crypto's trickier because wallets are pseudonymous. The company's database ""bridges the gap,"" he said, and lets companies target their most likely customers. Such precision could be especially important if crypto's bear market deepens into a blowout that pushes new users away. Economic malaise increases what traditional marketers call the ""cost per acquisition"" and what Addressable terms the ""cost per wallet."" ""Especially in a bear market people aren't as hyped about user acquisition,"" said Nadler, ""But what founders care about is letting the community know they still care and reactivate them."" Addressable isn't building a doxxing service, says Nadler. While it might know on the backend that John Doe owns wallet abc123, it's not passing that information to the client, say, CoinDEX. Instead its product lets CoinDEX target John Doe with ads so that wallet abc123 becomes a paying customer. Building the inference is Addressable's specialty, he said. The company trawls social media posts for intel that it can cross-check with wallets. Perhaps wallet abc123 interacted with protocols that John Doe follows on X. Or it's made trades that John Doe discussed on Reddit. All these clues can be enough to reverse-engineer a targetable identity. The resulting ad-tech playbook is less an only-in-crypto innovation than a recreation of online marketer's existing capabilities with special twists for the on-chain economy. Companies' Web3 funnels are already incredibly narrow, Nadler said, because potential customers are uniquely difficult to target. ""Rather than pay KOLs , or do very broad activities, what we allow is companies to target only the users that have engaged with you,"" he said. KOLs are key opinion leaders, social media influencers who promote projects to their followers. While Addressable has been around for three years, the retargeting service is new, Nadler said. He said he believes it will be a difference-maker for protocols seeking stickier customers. ""The most horrible thing that can happen to DeFi projects at the moment is if users stop believing in them,"" he said, pointing to targeted advertising as the solution.",Tech|Advertising|Marketing,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 15:40:10
42857614,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145931,1743694852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Binance Adds 10 Tokens to Monitoring List – Is Your Portfolio Affected?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-monitoring-tag-token-updates/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, exchanges are constantly evaluating and adjusting their token listings to ensure a secure and dynamic trading environment. Binance, a leading global crypto exchange, has recently announced updates to its token monitoring system, a move that’s generating significant buzz among crypto enthusiasts. On April 3rd, Binance updated its Monitoring Tag list, adding ten new tokens, while also refining its Seed Tag list. Let’s dive into what these changes mean for you and your crypto investments. Decoding Binance’s Monitoring Tag and Seed Tag: What’s the Deal? Before we delve into the specifics of the recent updates, it’s crucial to understand what Binance’s Monitoring Tag and Seed Tag actually signify. Think of these tags as warning labels, designed to inform users about the risk levels associated with certain cryptocurrencies. Binance implements these tags as part of its ongoing effort to protect users and maintain a healthy trading ecosystem. But what exactly distinguishes these tags? Monitoring Tag: This tag is applied to tokens that exhibit higher volatility and risk compared to others listed on the platform. Tokens under the Monitoring Tag are assessed regularly, and if they no longer meet Binance’s listing criteria, they could face potential delisting. Trading of these tokens often comes with additional risk disclosures and may have limited trading features. Seed Tag: The Seed Tag is reserved for newer projects with potentially higher volatility and risks, but also with significant growth potential. These projects are in their early stages, and while they offer exciting opportunities, they also come with increased uncertainty. Tokens with Seed Tags typically have lower trading limits and require users to pass quizzes to ensure they understand the associated risks before trading. Essentially, both tags are risk warnings, but the Seed Tag is generally associated with projects in their infancy, while the Monitoring Tag is for tokens that, while more established, might be showing signs of increased risk or volatility. Understanding these distinctions is key to navigating the crypto market responsibly. Which Tokens Are Now Under Binance’s Monitoring Tag? The latest update saw Binance add ten tokens to its Monitoring Tag list. These tokens are: Ardor (ARDR) Biswap (BSW) Flamingo (FLM) LTO Network (LTO) NKN (NKN) PlayDapp (PDA) Perpetual Protocol (PERP) Viberate (VIB) Voxies (VOXEL) Wing Finance (WING) For holders of these tokens, this update is a significant signal. Being placed under the Monitoring Tag doesn’t necessarily mean delisting is imminent, but it does indicate that Binance has identified increased risk factors associated with these projects. These factors could range from decreased trading volume and liquidity to project-specific developments or broader market conditions. What Does It Mean to Have a Token Under Monitoring? When a token is placed under the Monitoring Tag , several implications arise for traders and investors. It’s not just a label; it’s an alert to exercise caution. Here’s a breakdown of what it practically means: Increased Risk Awareness: The primary purpose of the Monitoring Tag is to make users acutely aware of the elevated risks associated with trading these tokens. Binance emphasizes that these tokens are more volatile and susceptible to price swings. Potential Trading Restrictions: While not always the case, tokens under monitoring might face certain trading restrictions in the future. This could include adjustments to leverage limits, reduced order sizes, or even temporary trading suspensions if the risk level escalates significantly. Regular Review and Potential Delisting: Tokens on the Monitoring Tag list are under constant scrutiny. Binance conducts regular reviews to assess if these tokens still meet their listing standards. Failure to meet these criteria can lead to delisting from the exchange. Impact on Market Sentiment: The announcement of a token being placed under monitoring can negatively impact market sentiment. Traders might become more cautious, leading to decreased trading volume and potential price drops as investors reassess their positions. For token holders, it’s a call to conduct thorough due diligence. Understand why your tokens might be flagged and evaluate your risk tolerance. It might be prudent to review your investment strategy and consider diversification. Jupiter (JUP), Starknet (STRK), and Toncoin (TON) Exit the Seed Tag: A Positive Sign? In a contrasting move, Binance also announced the removal of Jupiter (JUP), Starknet (STRK), and Toncoin (TON) from its Seed Tag list. This is generally perceived as a positive development. Removal from the Seed Tag indicates that Binance believes these projects have matured and now present a lower level of risk compared to when they were initially listed. Let’s explore why this is good news: Project Maturation: Exiting the Seed Tag suggests that these projects have likely demonstrated progress in development, adoption, and community growth. They’ve moved beyond the very early, highly speculative phase. Reduced Risk Perception: Binance’s decision implies a reduced risk profile for JUP, STRK, and TON. This could boost investor confidence and attract more participants to these ecosystems. Potential for Increased Liquidity and Trading Activity: As the perceived risk decreases, these tokens might experience increased trading volume and liquidity. Removal of Seed Tag restrictions could also facilitate easier trading for users. Positive Market Signal: The market often interprets the removal of a Seed Tag as a sign of validation. It can enhance the reputation and credibility of these projects within the broader crypto space. For holders of JUP, STRK, and TON, this update is a welcome signal of progress and reduced risk. It reinforces the potential of these projects and may contribute to a more stable and positive market outlook for them. Navigating Token Listings and Delistings: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Binance’s token listing updates , particularly the Monitoring Tag additions and Seed Tag removals, highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the importance of staying informed. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors to navigate these changes effectively: Stay Informed: Regularly monitor announcements from exchanges like Binance regarding token listings, delistings, and tag updates. Use official channels and reputable crypto news sources. Understand Tag Classifications: Familiarize yourself with the meaning of different tags like Monitoring and Seed Tags. Understand the risk levels they represent and the potential implications for your investments. Conduct Due Diligence: When you see a token under a Monitoring or Seed Tag, or any token you’re considering investing in, perform thorough research. Understand the project’s fundamentals, team, technology, and market position. Manage Risk: Adjust your portfolio risk based on token tags and your risk tolerance. Consider diversifying your holdings and not over-allocating to tokens with higher risk tags. Review and Rebalance: Periodically review your portfolio in light of token updates and market conditions. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy. By staying proactive and informed, you can better navigate the complexities of crypto token listings and delistings, making more informed decisions and managing risks effectively. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Game Binance’s recent update to its Monitoring Tag and Seed Tag lists serves as a crucial reminder of the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency. The addition of ten tokens to the Monitoring Tag and the removal of three from the Seed Tag are not just administrative changes; they are vital signals for investors. These updates emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, due diligence, and risk management in the crypto space. For investors, understanding these tags and responding proactively is key to navigating the market successfully and protecting their investments. By staying informed and adaptable, you can turn these market dynamics into opportunities rather than just risks.

Bitcoin Hayes, who stated that BTC does not like “US Liberation Day” after US President Donald Trump announced the mutual tariffs yesterday, said that the most important day for BTC is April 15. According to Hayes, if Bitcoin manages to stay above $76,500 by the US tax day on April 15, BTC and the market could survive the current uncertainty and volatility. https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1907547718681244009 The most important aspect of the deadline for US tax filing and payments, which is April 15, regarding cryptocurrencies is its possible impact on prices. Many analysts, like Hayes, also say that BTC and cryptocurrency prices could be suppressed ahead of tax season. This means that cryptocurrency investors will pay taxes on their gains from the previous year, and that they will be able to meet the cash they will need to pay taxes by selling. Therefore, analysts warn that there may be short-term selling pressure on cryptocurrency prices as the April 15 tax date approaches. Arthur Hayes also thinks that the FED will start printing money and with the contribution of increasing fiat liquidity, Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Several top altcoins posted single-digit gains, while meme coins like Pepecoin barely saw upward movements. Pepecoin latest news reveals the token will see more sell-offs regardless of what happens on Wednesday. Any positive development wouldn't be enough to flip Pepecoin bullish due to the recent dump by whales. Meanwhile, there is Remittix (RTX), a new payment network putting on a show in the market trenches. The new PayFi protocol has attracted huge interest from market participants across the market. Businesses and freelancers are lined up to exploit its unique DeFi capabilities once it launches officially. With the rate at which the project’s market presence is growing, experts forecast that the project could enjoy market pumps of up to 100x before the year's final quarter. We will cover Pepecoin latest news and examine why Pepe holders have joined crypto degens and investors to back Remittix . Pepecoin Latest News: Huge Duge by Whale Could Trigger Increased Selling Volumes While metrics indicate that the total number of Pepe holders increased last month, Pepecoin'spoor run has triggered investors to begin dumping their holdings. The froggy token, which is exchanging at $0.000007388 , has suffered a colossal 61.81% dump from year to date. Pepecoin's market capitalization stands at $3.1 billion, which is way short of the $11 billion it boasted sometime in December 2024. Pepecoin latest news confirms the sales of 150 billion tokens, a few days ago, by an early Pepe investor which is about $1.14 million. Well, it does appear that whales are feeling less confident in Pepecoin and switching to other projects with huge upside potential like Remittix. Given Pepe's poor performance and the lack of momentum in the crypto market, their decision looks reasonable. Experts believe this sudden withdrawal will cause the token to print consecutive red candles this week with increasing selling pressure. Pepecoin is expected to reap the ripple effect of this whale activity—more sell-offs, and thus, any developments from the Liberation Day wouldn't turn Pepecoin price prediction bullish. Moreover, the RSI, which stands below 50, confirms that bears have started making moves. Once the sell-offs begin, Pepecoin could see huge losses and plunge its value to levels last seen in November. Remittix: Numbers Don't Lie! Remittix has been one the best-performing projects in the market by a mile. RTX has enjoyed increased market interest since its investors caught wind of the project’s potential. Achieving a whopping 14.3 million of investor capital in one of the most challenging periods is no easy feat. Pepe holders have joined institutional investors in this period, racking up 525 million tokens. At this rate, experts are confident that RTX will be an instant hit once it enters the market. Market participants are particularly drawn to its compelling utility that enables instant and direct crypto-to-fiat payments; a solution like this is unlike anything the market has ever seen. On this innovative platform, users can withdraw their crypto assets in any way they prefer; they can convert directly to fiat or any cryptocurrency pair of choice. Interestingly, Remittix expands its reach to underbanked regions and developing countries where users cannot access modern financial tools. This innovation will foster improved B2C relationships and broaden its demand, making the forecasted multi-trillion-dollar market size more realistic. Moreover, Remittix’s flat fee strategy will cancel out financial intermediaries and allow every cross-border payment made on the platform at zero cost. Entrepreneurs and businesses can evade FX costs and hidden charges by adopting this payment solution. The numbers don't lie; Remittix is moon-bound in 2025.

These options offer exciting opportunities like higher potential returns and liquid markets. Blockchain and crypto could be smart choices for SSAS members looking to grow their investments. Why Invest SSAS Pensions in Alternative Markets Since 1973, the Small Self-Administered Schemes (SSAS) pensions have helped millions of retirees plan a life after work and live a healthy life. Today, the focus is shifting from commercial property, shares, and business loans to new alternatives such as crypto and blockchain. Investing your SSAS Pensions to grow your retirement fund offers these key benefits: ● Unlock new markets: Compared to traditional markets like real estate, modern markets like the crypto market, for example, have a faster growth rate. The blockchain/crypto industry is now worth trillions in under two decades. SSAS members can explore the opportunities in these new markets, such as getting profitable positions before they launch new products and services. ● Increased flexibility: Diversifying from traditional investments allows SSAS members to control their finances more freely. This can help you find more investments and organise your portfolio to explore them. ● Potential for Higher Returns: Exploring new markets can unlock higher profits in the long run. For example, Bitcoin hit an all-time high price of $108,786, marking a 128,341.20% profit from launch. This is more than many traditional investments offer within the same period. ● Leverage New Technologies With Immense Potential: Analysts project tech-driven markets to dominate the global investment markets soon. These will allow users to find and leverage incredibly efficient tools at scale. Investing your SSAS in these markets can help you find and deploy technologies that enhance other areas of your life. Let’s now get more specific: what are the opportunities to explore in the blockchain and crypto space? Opportunities in Blockchain Startups and Crypto Projects With more institutional investors stepping into the blockchain and crypto world, the future of adoption looks promising. The extensive application of blockchain across industries means builders and early adopters can make the best returns as adoption increases. These are some of the fast-growing opportunities for investment in blockchain and crypto. Infrastructure Development Building the infrastructure that allows blockchains to run is another excellent opportunity for investing in blockchain. Startups focus on physical infrastructure, building the components and systems that support advanced software. These include data centres, mining hardware, cloud services, software, etc. Others focus on regulatory and legal compliance, allowing crypto projects to run smoothly. Supply Chain Management Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains, making management more effortless. With blockchain, companies can reduce fraud, improve efficiency, and rapidly scale their services. Blockchain startups focused on supply chain management include Origin Trail and VeChain. These companies use decentralised data to build knowledge, maintain inventories, monitor changes, and ensure fast and secure transitions. Healthcare Adopting blockchain technology in healthcare will enhance healthcare delivery and access to high-quality service. Although it is still growing, many startups are focused on building private blockchains for healthcare facilities to share and securely store data. This also covers the use of blockchain in medical sciences, where researchers use it to improve the integrity and transparency of research. Financial Services and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) As expected, blockchain and crypto significantly impact the financial sector, influencing new products and services. In DeFi, opportunities abound for you to earn profits from staking, yield farming, and other methods. DeFi also allows greater control over your assets so you can make decisions without third-party interference. Investment opportunities in these areas include building the tools and apps that power the ecosystem and exploring opportunities to earn tokens. Crypto Trading You can explore crypto trading through spot, futures, and derivatives to grow your portfolio . The crypto market has a huge daily volume, with traders from every corner of the world. It offers a secure and convenient way to invest in SSAS pensions to buy and hold tokens. Trading cryptocurrencies requires knowledge of technical and fundamental analyses, a trading plan, and good financial management. How to Invest SSAS Pensions Although investing is straightforward, you should consider a few things before going all in. ● Regulatory Compliance: The platform you invest/trade with should comply with regulations. Knowing you are doing business with a legitimate and secure platform will help you feel confident. ● Expertise and Professional Guidance: Seek professional advice where necessary, especially when moving your SSAS pension and onboarding on your investment platform. Understand the processes involved and gain clarity with each step before moving on. Ensure all related documents are updated and available for use. ● Do your due diligence: Confirm the capability of your investment platform, including its track record, terms and conditions. Research each investment before opening a position; for example, keep track of Bitcoin news to know why the price changes and how you can invest. ● Plan Your Investment: Successful investors work with a plan and adjust it where necessary. You should create a plan detailing how to invest your SSAS pension. Your plan should include proper risk management strategies, clear and defined rules, and exit points. Remember that your portfolio should include a mix of assets that spread risk and maximise profits. Keep a Close Watch Investing your pension funds can increase the quality of your retirement years through careful planning and execution. Investing in the blockchain and crypto market is a modern option if you prefer non-traditional markets with high performance and returns. The ease of investing from your smartphone or laptop is only surpassed by the convenience of receiving potential profits from anywhere globally. Yet, in making this decision, ensure you keep a close watch and do your due diligence when investing in emerging technologies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42857846,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146143,1743695281,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,From Caution to Confidence: How South Africa Became a Crypto Hotspot,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/from-caution-to-confidence-how-south-africa-became-a-crypto-hotspot/,"Over a decade ago, in 2014, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), along with other financial institutions such as the Financial Services Board (now the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, FSCA) and the South African Revenue Service (SARS), issued its first official statement regarding cryptocurrencies. The main takeaway for the public was to remain cautious – highlighting that cryptocurrencies were neither regulated nor supervised by any of these authorities. A rise in popularity In the following years, exploration of blockchain technology’s potential began, and in 2016, the Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG) was formed to analyse possible risks and opportunities. The crypto market grew rapidly, especially during the 2017 boom, which triggered a rise in interest among investors and regulators. With the increased popularity, fraud and illegal activities escalated, creating a strong need for regulation. This led the IFWG to publish a position paper on crypto assets, proposing that crypto service providers should be registered and subject to special regulatory rules. And in 2022, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority declared crypto a classified financial product. As a result, more South Africans are entering the crypto market with crypto brokers in South Africa becoming increasingly popular. A Growing Crypto Use Today, the cryptocurrency market continues to grow steadily, not only through private trading but also with the help of professional and institutional investments and improved technological payment solutions. One of the biggest drivers of adoption was the high transaction costs for payments in the traditional banking system. Many South Africans now use crypto to send and receive money internationally, especially since remittances from abroad are essential to the country’s economy. The historic volatility of the South African rand has also led many to view digital assets as an alternative for preserving value. “ We are seeing growing interest from institutional clients, particularly around custody solutions for digital assets, which will play a crucial role in supporting the crypto ecosystem here ,” said Rob Downes of Absa Group, one of South Africa’s largest banks. Implementation of Directive 9 However, as interest from institutions increases, so does regulatory pressure, and starting April 30th, stricter rules for crypto transactions will be implemented in South Africa. This will happen through a directive called “Directive 9.” A key part of this is the so-called “travel rule,” which requires proper customer information for domestic and cross-border crypto transactions. This information includes the sender’s full name, identity or passport number, date and place of birth, residential address, and wallet address for all transactions exceeding R5,000. This is a significant change in South Africa’s regulatory framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs), who need to take immediate action to comply with these obligations. While these implementations aim to improve transparency and security, they also raise privacy concerns. The “travel rule” may require personal information to be transferred to countries with weaker data protection laws, potentially conflicting with South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (Popia). Onshore or Offshore asset? Another issue in South Africa is that digital assets are not classified as either onshore or offshore. This makes crypto a legal gray area, unlike traditional assets, which are clearly categorised as onshore or offshore. This classification matters because offshore investments are capped for retail investors, while onshore assets have no such restrictions. Marius Reitz, Africa’s general manager at Luno exchange, a global cryptocurrency company, believes that this regulatory uncertainty is possibly slowing the sector’s growth. If regulators started classifying digital assets as onshore assets, this would probably further boost large-scale market growth. Future outlook: The Role of Crypto in South Africa’s Financial Future Throughout the 2020s, South Africa has become one of the global leaders in the DeFi sector and one of the top 20 crypto markets in the world, according to the Tech Trends in South Africa 2025 report. Numbers from Chainanalysis also show that the South African crypto market was valued at an astonishing $26 billion in 2023. Another survey – the Web3 and Crypto Perception Survey, conducted by leading blockchain and software company Consensys, also revealed that 42% of South Africans currently own or have previously bought cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the most popular. Additionally, 47% of respondents see crypto as “the future of money.” With the convergence of regulatory evolution, technological breakthroughs, and expanding institutional support, South Africa is well-positioned to redefine its entire financial ecosystem. The coming years could witness a transformation in which digital assets become not just an alternative investment but a cornerstone of everyday economic life.",Forex News|Crypto|Financial Future|South Africa,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-03 15:48:01

On Thursday, the banking giant announced a new product that allows fund managers to post real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) directly onto a blockchain, negating the need for third-party accounting firms. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, will reportedly become the first to use the tool for its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL . BNY Mellon is among several Wall Street banks that are purportedly warming up to crypto, supported by US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration, which has already cut back on restrictions imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the Biden era. BNY Mellon’s push into tokenization Tokenized funds are investment vehicles that resemble traditional mutual funds but operate on a blockchain ledger. By reducing reliance on intermediaries, these funds offer what blockchain technology represents: transparency, efficiency, and cost savings. Speaking in a press briefing earlier today, Caroline Butler, BNY Mellon’s head of digital assets, discussed the bank’s position in offering blockchain-native financial services. “ Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this ,” she explained. Butler believes real-time NAV reporting on a blockchain will improve transparency and credit ratings for tokenized funds. According to Butler, BNY Mellon’s previous ventures into digital assets mainly focused on crypto custody, but this NAV tool will extend the institution’s services beyond safekeeping to integrate blockchain into mainstream finance. Regulatory tailwinds shifted into BNY’s crypto ambitions In 2022, BNY Mellon launched a digital asset custody platform that allowed clients to store Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, in March of that year, during the Biden administration, the SEC introduced a regulatory balance sheet of requirements, forcing financial institutions holding crypto to account for it as a liability. The guidance, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, stifled banks’ ability to engage with digital assets. BNY Mellon secured an exemption from the financial regulator in September last year to provide custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum for exchange-traded products (ETPs) without regulatory roadblocks. After Donald Trump re-entered the Oval Office on January 20, the SEC, now under a new chair, quickly rescinded SAB 121, opening the door for banks like BNY Mellon to expand their crypto services without punitive accounting treatment. BNY Mellon set to announce Q1 2025 earnings BNY Mellon is set to release its Q1 2025 earnings before the market opens on April 11. Analysts project adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50, a 16.3% increase from the previous year. The bank has consistently outperformed Wall Street expectations in recent quarters, driven by a $2 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and strong fee revenue. The company’s stock has surged 38.85% over the past year, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 4% gain and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLF) 14.69% return. In Q4 2024, the bank’s earnings beat estimates, with adjusted EPS rising 33.3% year-over-year to $1.72. Total revenue increased 11.2% to $4.8 billion, fueled by a 9% jump in fee revenue and an 8.1% rise in net interest income. Cost-cutting measures also added to the profits, with non-interest expenses dropping by 16%. Towards the end of February, according to a Wall Street Journal report , BNY Mellon announced a strategic multiyear partnership with artificial intelligence (AI) leader OpenAI. The collaboration will provide BNY Mellon with access to OpenAI’s AI tools, including its Deep Research platform and advanced reasoning models, improving the capabilities of the bank’s internal AI platform, Eliza. “ We feel AI has transformational power and will be part of every product and service ,” Sarthak Pattanaik, head of BNY Mellon’s AI hub, reckoned.

Just when many were anticipating a potential easing of monetary policy, the investment banking giant has announced a starkly different prediction: no Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are expected in 2025. This is a major turnaround from their previous forecast, which anticipated a 25 basis point rate cut as early as June 2025. For cryptocurrency investors and market watchers, this news carries substantial weight and warrants careful consideration. Let’s dive into what this revised market forecast means and how it could potentially reshape the financial landscape. Understanding Morgan Stanley’s Revised Market Forecast Morgan Stanley’s updated projection, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X (formerly Twitter), signals a recalibration of expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Previously, the market consensus, and indeed Morgan Stanley’s own view, leaned towards the likelihood of rate cuts in 2025. This expectation was often fueled by hopes of moderating inflation and supporting economic growth. However, the new forecast suggests a more persistent inflationary environment or a more hawkish stance from the Fed, or perhaps a combination of both. Let’s break down the key elements: Shift in Timeline: The most striking change is the complete removal of anticipated rate cuts in 2025. This contrasts sharply with the earlier projection of a 25 basis point cut in June. Implications for Borrowing Costs: No rate cuts mean borrowing costs are likely to remain elevated for longer than previously anticipated. This affects everything from mortgages and car loans to corporate borrowing and investment decisions. Economic Outlook Revision: This forecast revision likely reflects a reassessment of economic data and inflation trends. It suggests Morgan Stanley believes the Fed will need to maintain a tighter monetary policy to combat inflation, even if it means potentially slower economic growth. Market Sentiment Impact: Such a significant revision from a major financial institution like Morgan Stanley can significantly influence market sentiment. Investors may need to adjust their strategies to account for a potentially prolonged period of higher interest rates. Why No Fed Rate Cut in 2025? Exploring the Potential Reasons Several factors could be contributing to Morgan Stanley’s revised stance on Fed rate cut prospects in 2025. Understanding these potential drivers is crucial for grasping the broader economic context. While the specific reasons behind Morgan Stanley’s internal analysis are not fully detailed in the initial report, we can infer some plausible explanations: Persistent Inflation: Inflation may be proving more stubborn than initially anticipated. Despite efforts to curb price increases, underlying inflationary pressures might be lingering, requiring the Fed to maintain higher interest rates . Stronger-than-Expected Economic Data: The U.S. economy may be showing more resilience than expected. Robust employment figures or continued consumer spending could reduce the urgency for the Fed to cut rates and stimulate growth. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events and geopolitical tensions can impact economic forecasts. Unforeseen events could influence inflation, supply chains, and overall economic stability, leading to a more cautious approach from the Federal Reserve. Fed’s Communication and Stance: The Federal Reserve’s own communications and policy statements might be signaling a more hawkish approach. If the Fed is consistently emphasizing its commitment to fighting inflation, even at the cost of slower growth, institutions like Morgan Stanley are likely to adjust their forecasts accordingly. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market: Navigating the New Landscape The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, is likely to react to this revised market forecast . Higher interest rates generally make riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies, less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing investments. Here’s how this development could potentially affect the crypto space: Reduced Liquidity: Higher interest rates can tighten financial conditions, potentially reducing liquidity in the market. This could lead to decreased investment flows into cryptocurrencies. Increased Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding interest rates and economic growth can fuel market volatility. The crypto market, already prone to price swings, might experience heightened fluctuations. Shift in Investor Sentiment: A prolonged period of higher rates could dampen investor enthusiasm for high-growth, high-risk assets. Investors might become more risk-averse, favoring traditional assets over cryptocurrencies in the near term. Opportunities for Innovation: Despite potential headwinds, challenging market conditions can also spur innovation within the crypto space. Projects with strong fundamentals and real-world utility might become more appealing in an environment where speculative fervor wanes. Strategies for Crypto Investors in a No Rate Cut Scenario Given Morgan Stanley’s updated outlook and the potential implications for the crypto market, what actionable steps can investors take? Adapting to this evolving environment is key to navigating the challenges and identifying potential opportunities: Focus on Fundamental Analysis: In a more cautious market, strong fundamentals become paramount. Prioritize cryptocurrencies with solid use cases, strong development teams, and clear pathways to adoption. Manage Risk Prudently: Implement robust risk management strategies. Diversify your portfolio, set stop-loss orders, and avoid excessive leverage. Stay Informed and Adaptable: Continuously monitor economic data, Fed announcements, and market developments. Be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as the landscape evolves. Seek Long-Term Value: Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Periods of market uncertainty can present opportunities to accumulate assets at more attractive valuations for long-term growth. Looking Ahead: What Does 2025 Hold for Interest Rates and the Market? The revision by Morgan Stanley serves as a stark reminder that economic forecasts are not set in stone and can change rapidly based on new data and evolving conditions. While their current prediction points to no interest rates cuts in 2025 , the economic landscape remains dynamic. Several factors will influence the actual path of interest rates, including: Inflation Trajectory: The future direction of inflation will be a primary determinant of the Fed’s policy decisions. If inflation continues to remain elevated, the pressure to maintain higher rates will persist. Economic Growth Momentum: The strength of the U.S. economy will also play a crucial role. If growth slows significantly, the Fed might reconsider its stance, although the current forecast suggests a focus on inflation control. Global Economic Conditions: International economic developments and geopolitical events will continue to exert influence on the U.S. economic outlook and the Fed’s policy choices. Federal Reserve Communication: Pay close attention to the Federal Reserve’s statements and policy signals. These communications will provide valuable insights into their thinking and potential future actions. In conclusion, Morgan Stanley’s revised forecast of no Fed rate cuts in 2025 is a critical development for all market participants, especially those in the cryptocurrency space. It underscores the need for vigilance, adaptability, and a focus on sound investment principles. The economic narrative is constantly unfolding, and staying informed and prepared is the best strategy to navigate the evolving financial landscape.

The spike above $0.000015 in late March was short-lived due to heightened volatility, which caused the meme coin to drop to $0.000012 at the time of writing. The fresh decline came after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on imports from 50 countries, including the BRICS and the European Union. Despite this, the conviction of long-term investors remains strong. According to recent data from IntoTheBlock, long-term Shiba Inu holders – those retaining their tokens for over a year – now collectively own more than 80% of the total SHIB supply. This significant concentration among this cohort of investors suggests a strong belief in the meme coin’s future potential, even amidst the volatility of the market.

This indicates that even amid challenges in the memecoin market, many $SHIB holders remain optimistic. pic.twitter.com/JTnHS2TIjq — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 2, 2025 Such a high percentage of long-term holders can contribute to price stability as these investors are less likely to engage in rapid selling during market fluctuations. Additionally, this trend indicates a maturing investor base that views SHIB not merely as a speculative asset but as a long-term component of their cryptocurrency portfolios. In a milestone for the SHIB ecosystem, its Layer 2 scaling solution, Shibarium, recently surpassed one billion total transactions. Prominent Shiba Inu team members, including marketing strategist LUCIE, praised the community’s role in this success. The main objective behind Shibarium is to improve transaction efficiency, expand utility, and introduce a token-burning mechanism.

Amid this, Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, sank over 6%, turned bearish, and is now poised for a significant price decline. Why is Bitcoin Price Crashing? The potential reason for the market sell-off is the tariff announcement, under which major countries will now face a 10% tariff, while China, the EU, and Japan will face tariffs of 34%, 20%, and 24%, respectively. Following this development, BTC has lost its recent support, which it formed during the market uncertainty. Bitcoin Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, BTC has recently lost the $82,500 support level and has fallen below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that the asset is entering a strong bearish trend. Based on recent price action, if BTC closes its daily candle below the $81,500 level, there is a strong possibility it could fall significantly and hit the $77,700 level or even lower in the coming days. Source: Trading View Besides BTC, other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP were hit harder, witnessing price declines of over 7%, 12%, and 7.5%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, BTC is currently trading near the $81,750 level, and due to the loss of support, it has gained massive attention from traders and investors, leading to an 85% surge in trading volume. 18,930 BTC Sell-Off by Short-Term Holders Following this massive price decline and the bearish shift in market sentiment, short-term holders have been shaken. Recently, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that short-term holders sold 18,930 BTC last night, immediately after the tariff announcement. 18,930 #Bitcoin $BTC were sold by short-term holders last night, immediately after @realDonaldTrump announced new tariffs! pic.twitter.com/pONWoxV5a9 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 3, 2025 This massive sell-off by short-term holders indicates that BTC may experience a price crash in the near term.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-03 15:51:49

This pattern occurs when the 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day moving average, often seen as a bearish sign. However, history shows that not every Death Cross leads to a major price drop. History of Death and Golden Crosses Tony “The Bull” highlighted that Bitcoin has experienced multiple Death Crosses and Golden Crosses over the years. A Golden Cross happens when the 50-day moving average moves above the 200-day moving average, signaling an uptrend. Bitcoin is about to form a Death Cross of the 50-day and 200-day Moving Average A thread on what this means historically pic.twitter.com/xgX72RuCiT — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@tonythebullBTC) April 3, 2025 Since the 2022 bear market bottom, Bitcoin has seen three Golden Crosses and two Death Crosses. Meanwhile, the first Golden Cross after the FTX collapse appeared when Bitcoin was around $21,000, leading to a strong uptrend. The trend remained bullish until a Death Cross in September 2023 at $25,000, but this turned out to be a false signal. Shortly after, Bitcoin formed another Golden Cross at $35,000, triggering a new rally. By August 2024, another Death Cross appeared when Bitcoin was at $61,000. Despite concerns, Bitcoin continued to rise, proving that Death Crosses are not always reliable bearish indicators. Will This Death Cross Change Bitcoin’s Trend? Tony “The Bull” pointed out that while Golden Crosses have historically signaled strong uptrends, Death Crosses have been less reliable. In some cases, such as during the 2022 bear market, a Death Cross lasted an entire year and led to a 60% price drop. However, in other instances, they resulted in only short-term corrections before Bitcoin resumed its uptrend. Now, the big question is whether this upcoming Death Cross will confirm a lasting downtrend or be another false signal. Since Bitcoin has already seen two false Death Crosses recently, traders are divided. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $81,897 , reflecting a drop of 6% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $1.7 trillion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-03 15:52:01

Designed to ride the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, Bitwise’s ETFs will target the performance of MSTR, COIN, and MARA. Bitwise Trio Of ETFs Designed To Ride Crypto Volatility According to an announcement on X , crypto investment firm Bitwise says it is rolling out three active option income strategy ETFs. Per the announcement, Bitwise has its sights on supporting investors to capitalize on market volatility with the trio of ETFs. Active option income ETFs are funds that generate additional income from selling covered calls and distributing the premium on sold options. The Bitwise ETFs with the tickers $IMST, $ICOI, and $IMRA, will operate as active option income strategy funds, providing monthly returns to investors. The fund will allow investors to have exposure to Strategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), and MARA, firms with significant Bitcoin holdings. Early in the week, MicroStrategy acquired 22,048 BTC , with the trio holding over 500,000 BTC. “IMST, ICOI, and IMRA aim to distribute monthly income to investors while thoughtfully participating in the performance of MSTR, COIN, and MARA,” read the statement. Bitwise has tapped its Head of Alpha Strategies, Jeff Park, and three top members of its portfolio team to write the options. The lean team will still maintain a long position on MSTR, COIN, and MARA while considering key fundamentals and option pricing. A Streak Of Crypto-related ETFs For Consumers Bitwise has a red-hot streak of ETF activity in the cryptoverse in recent weeks. The crypto investment firm launched the OWNB ETF to track corporate Bitcoin holders, including Strategy and MARA holdings. Fold and Bitdeer also recently joined the OWNB index. Riding on the wave of ETFs, Bitwise submitted an S-1 filing for an Aptos ETF, building on its impressive streak. Before Aptos, Bitwise filed a Dogecoin ETF, following up with a proposal for its Ethereum ETF staking . Bitwise has donated $150,000 to the Bitcoin community, proceeds from its Bitcoin ETF for open-source development. Furthermore, the firm has dabbled into decentralized finance (DeFi) striking a partnership with Maple for on-chain credit.

A new payment system named Remittix introduced itself through the market as ""XRP 2.0"" specifically designed for efficient and affordable transactions. The presale of Remittix exceeded $14.3 million during which 525 million+ tokens were sold at $0.0734 per token becoming a highly disruptive competitor. Whales Disrupt the XRP Market Source: Ali Martinez on X. Image depicting large whale sell-offs in the XRP ecosystem. According to analyst Ali Martinez , a substantial 1.12 billion XRP worth $2.25 billion was quickly removed from Ripple's ecosystem by its massive holders across a 48-hour period. Expert analysts attribute these strategic moves to the XRP community dynamics where such actions lead to new market fluctuations. The XRP price might fall to $1.65 based on a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern if traders are unable to restore momentum past $3. People opt for positive expectations that breaking the $2.25 resistance threshold could lead to increased market attention. This price instability has forced numerous investors to reconsider their investments. The cryptic sell-offs by whale investors have sparked a split opinion among XRP price spectators because some see this behavior as initial warning indicators but others interpret it as bullish signs for a massive market rally. The XRP price falling below $1.70 would validate the most bearish market predictions. The market has the potential to stabilize quickly whenever a sufficient number of buyers join the support areas. Source: tradingview . XRP currently trades near $2.11 XRP Price in Flux as Remittix Gains Momentum The XRP price volatility does not deter remittix from becoming a focal point in the market through its focus on practical real-world implementations. Remittix emerges as a new generation of international money transfer service that provides fast effective cross-border transactions at reduced costs. Traders find practicality encouraging when they are tired of hype-based tokens which lack substantial value. Remittix achieved $14.3 million through its presale stage because its clear objectives combined with open project documentation attracted investors despite the present cryptocurrency market saturation. The main reason for Remittix's success stems from its solution of banking problems through faster and more affordable processes. Remittix aims to smooth transaction processes in order to minimize problems experienced by both businesses and individuals. XRP whales currently rearrange their funds while supposedly examining Remittix as their new potential investment. The new platform addresses longstanding complaints from XRP holders by providing solutions that make it a potential replacement for ""XRP 2.0"". Remittix’s Future vs. XRP Uncertainties XRP price movements do not affect Remittix's reputation for providing reliable services. The whale market movements do not distract Remittix who remains committed to completing its technological development. The development team behind this blockchain project provides clear disclosure about software updates to show how blockchain technology can address frequent transaction challenges. The project takes a different stance from whale-driven assets which can create vague market conditions through unexpected price drops that alarm smaller traders. No venture exists without any level of associated risk. The company needs to fulfill its promise of effortless payments to continue succeeding in the early stages of development. Some analysts anticipate that Remittix might draw away additional investors from using XRP. Remittix attracts whale investor attention since its ability to transform international financial operations proves its authentic enduring potential. The shift of market interest has begun even though XRP is not expected to suffer major consequences from Remittix's rise. Conclusion The XRP price fluctuations have resulted in significant whale selling activity that creates intense speculation about Ripple's upcoming trajectory. Remittix currently stands as a promising new start-up that presents many investors with a practical alternative solution. The platform stands as a major competitor because it raised more than $14.3 million through token sales of 525 million+ tokens. The steady growth of Remittix combined with recent XRP whale movements draws crypto world attention as it suggests investors are now seeking platforms that provide practical solutions to escape volatile price fluctuations associated with whale trading activities.

The industry is gearing up for a number of tech launches that could change the balance of power: Ethereum will introduce the Pectra upgrade to improve scalability, MEXC will launch a hybrid exchange for simplified crypto asset trading, and Hemi Network will launch a mainnet to merge Bitcoin and Ethereum. It remains to be seen whether these developments will lead to another market surge, but they certainly lay the groundwork for future growth. Innovations in DeFi, AI integration, and infrastructure expansion highlight the industry’s desire to adapt and evolve, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty. MEXC Launches Hybrid Exchange — DeFi and CEX Under One Roof While most exchanges choose between a centralized or decentralized side, MEXC is taking the path of fusion. In March 2025, the platform launched a next-generation hybrid exchange that combines the liquidity of centralized markets with access to decentralized protocols, all in one interface. The DEX+ Wallet offers access to on-chain assets across various blockchains and seamless multi-chain trading, backed by institution-grade security. It combines the diverse asset options of decentralized platforms with the robust security and user-friendly experience of centralized exchanges, providing users with a streamlined and highly secure trading experience. With UX becoming a key battleground, MEXC's bet on a unified hybrid platform looks like a timely (and potentially game-changing) move. Ethereum Pectra’s upgrade Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade , slated for mid-March 2025, is a major step toward improving the network’s scalability, efficiency, and usability. By merging the previously separate Prague and Electra upgrades, Pectra introduces critical enhancements such as flexible gas payments, optimized staking options, and technical advancements like Verkle Trees and PeerDAS. A key highlight is account abstraction, which allows users to pay transaction fees with ERC-20 tokens like USDC instead of being limited to ETH. This shift simplifies transactions and enhances user accessibility. Additionally, Verkle Trees and PeerDAS improve data management and reduce storage demands, ensuring a more efficient Ethereum ecosystem. The upgrade will roll out in two phases, with the initial implementation in March 2025 focusing on increasing layer-2 storage capacity, lowering fees, and expanding validator staking limits. The second phase, expected in late 2025 or early 2026, will integrate advanced optimizations to further enhance network performance. Pectra builds upon the foundation laid by the Dencun upgrade in 2024, which introduced proto-dank sharding to reduce layer-2 transaction costs. By addressing key bottlenecks, Pectra positions Ethereum for broader adoption and long-term sustainability, reinforcing its role as the leading smart contract platform. TRON Removes Fees — Completely Many blockchains are reducing fees. TRON has decided to go further and completely eliminate gas for transactions in its ecosystem. The new feature, introduced in early March, allows users to send transactions without any fees — by redistributing revenue within the network. For users, this is a breath of fresh air, especially in DeFi and NFT applications, where micropayments were unprofitable due to fiat. For developers, it is an incentive to rethink the UX in favor of the mass user. The network is already recording an increase in activity, especially in the markets of Southeast Asia, where the cost of transactions is a critical factor. Tether launches an AI platform When one of the largest stablecoin issuers suddenly goes beyond the financial infrastructure, it is already an event. In March 2025, Tether introduced its own AI platform focused on blockchain applications with artificial intelligence. Unlike typical hype-driven AI efforts, Tether is focusing on infrastructure: the launch includes a framework for developing AI models in a Web3 environment and a computing architecture powered by self-governing nodes. This could change the approach to decentralized storage, data analysis, and predictive model building on the blockchain. If the platform is adopted by developers, Tether will be able to occupy a unique niche between AI and Web3 — and strengthen its influence beyond USDT. Hemi Network Brings Bridge Between Ethereum and Bitcoin What if you combined the resilience and security of Bitcoin with the flexibility of Ethereum? This question is now answered by Hemi Network , a new mainnet aimed at uniting two of the largest ecosystems in a single decentralized structure. The network uses a hybrid architecture and an original smart contract interoperability model, which allows it to run EVM applications with Bitcoin security at the base level. This is not just a ""bridge"" — it is an attempt to reboot the very concept of interoperability in crypto. While analysts argue about the feasibility of ambitions, the market votes with interest: validator activity and TVL are growing rapidly.

With rising investor sentiment, the spotlight is back on the blockchain heavyweight. But there's a twist: a lesser-known token, Remittix (RTX) , is rapidly gaining traction. This sudden shift in focus has left many asking—what do RTX holders know that the rest of the market doesn’t? ADA Price Surges on Renewed Momentum Over erratic market cycles, the ADA price has proven resiliency again. Cardano is a long-term competitor since its ecosystem is still among the most actively evolved ones in the blockchain environment. With a current market cap of $23.92 billion and currently priced at $0.6789. Cardano sits comfortably among top-tier cryptocurrencies. Analysts believe that if it breaks key resistance, a sharp upward movement could follow. Interestingly, retail and institutional traders alike are stacking ADA now more than ever. Whales are also re-entering the scene, signaling confidence in an imminent breakout. Cardano Fundamentals Remain Strong Despite the attention around RTX, Cardano hasn’t lost its shine. In fact, the fundamentals remain solid. Cardano’s Hydra upgrade has improved scalability, and its smart contract functionality has broadened the scope for decentralized apps. This technological advancement is contributing to renewed optimism around ADA price growth. Moreover, Cardano’s academic and peer-reviewed approach appeals to developers looking for security and stability. With hundreds of projects building on its chain, the network's utility is expanding rapidly. All these factors contribute to a potentially explosive trajectory for ADA price, especially if bullish momentum persists. Why Are Investors Flocking to Remittix (RTX)? While the ADA price captures headlines, a new player—Remittix (RTX)—is quietly attracting serious capital. Priced at just $0.0734, RTX has already raised over $14.3 million in funding and sold more than 525 million tokens. But why the sudden rush? Remittix is carving a niche in the blockchain-based remittance sector, combining financial inclusion with real-world utility. The token offers ultra-low fees, fast cross-border transactions, and an integrated smart contract system for compliance—attracting users in regions traditionally underserved by banks. Consider migrant workers in South Asia who rely on Western Union to send money home, often losing 6–10% of their earnings in transfer fees. Remittix slashes that down to almost nothing while providing near-instant settlement. Another use case? Freelancers and remote workers who face delays and fees when paid internationally. Remittix enables them to receive funds securely in minutes. The project’s growing popularity has even caught the attention of crypto influencers and early-stage VCs. Its potential for mass adoption is becoming hard to ignore. What Do They Know That We Don’t? The crypto community is buzzing with one question: Why are investors—especially early backers—doubling down on Remittix (RTX)? Some believe RTX insiders have insight into upcoming exchange listings or large-scale partnerships. The project’s documentation hints at integration with global payment networks, though no official statement has been made. Still, the numbers are telling. Over 525 million tokens sold before a major exchange listing is rare. And crossing $14.3 million+ in presale capital? That’s not retail FOMO—that’s calculated conviction. This is not to say RTX is competing head-to-head with Cardano. But it’s clear that savvy investors see Remittix as complementary—not a competitor. It’s about diversifying into high-potential microcaps while still holding blue-chip assets like Cardano. Conclusion The ADA price may be poised for a breakout, supported by strong fundamentals and ecosystem upgrades. But keep an eye on what savvy investors are doing behind the scenes. Their growing interest in Remittix (RTX)—a lesser-known yet rapidly scaling remittance token—could reveal an upcoming narrative shift in the crypto space. The numbers speak for themselves: $0.0734 per token, $14.3M+ raised, and 525 million tokens sold. As crypto moves toward real-world use cases, both Cardano and Remittix are worth watching—one for its stability, the other for its breakout potential.

Over $2 trillion has been wiped out of the markets as the Dow lost over 1500 points on the day. Besides, the Nasdaq 100’s decline officially exceeds over 1000 points on the day and is now just 2% away from entering a bear market. Meanwhile, the mega-caps like NKE, AMZN, AAPL, META, etc., and a few more are bleeding, pushing the market participants into full panic. A significant impact on the crypto markets has also been seen with the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP taking a major hit. The current market dynamics appear to be a reaction to the tariffs announced yesterday, suggesting that the US growth in 2025 is likely to be slower than the 1.7% that had been projected in March. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price is still sustaining over the crucial support at $81,000, and only a drop below the levels could be dangerous for the upcoming price action of the entire crypto markets. Does this point towards the beginning of a major pullback? A popular analyst anonymously known as Gordon finds it a good opportunity. The analyst believes the people are currently fearful, which flashes a huge buying opportunity, and the S&P 500 has taken the worst hit after Trump’s inauguration compared to the previous presidents including Biden and Obama. Besides, Trump has been a huge crypto proponent and aims to put more governance and policies in place. However, his memecoin drained the liquidity and added uncertainty to the market. Therefore, the analyst suggests his 736.5K followers trust Trump’s process as greener days seem to be on the horizon. The BTC price has slumped below $82,000, while the volume continues to rise, largely dominated by the bears. This hints towards a potential pullback that may drag the levels below $80,000 if the support at $81,017 is not defended. If, in case, the star crypto loses crucial support, the entire market is expected to plunge further. Meanwhile, the fearful market sentiments have not yet dropped ahead, which hints towards a potential rebound.

Large PEPE investors made a strategic move by entering the MUTM market at its current price level of $0.000020. The presale event for MUTM has received widespread interest from investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the fourth phase of its funding process with a price of $0.025 and has attracted more than $6.1 million from investors as it shows swift expansion. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has received entry from more than 7800 holders during phase 4 before the system boosts its price from $0.025 to $0.03. The current phase of investment enables investors who join now to earn 140% profits when MUTM launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance could hit $3 A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 7800 investors have partaken in support of the project by investing $6.1 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to DeFi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance plans to construct a completely collateralized stablecoin backed by USD fixed within the Ethereum blockchain to support its entire ecosystem. This cryptocurrency exceeds algorithmic stablecoins’ requirements by using extra collateral thus reducing both the risks and maintaining stability over time. Such an approach provides complete investor confidence because it combines open financial architecture with audited smart contracts while avoiding the failures that devastated other DeFi projects. The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presale lead Mutuum Finance to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. The decentralized finance market receives transformation through Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which implements a two-faced lending process and robust token distribution system while expanding its ecosystem. The MUTM presale has penetrated into 7,800 investor portfolios while amassing more than $6.1 million in investment funds thus sustaining its rapid market expansion. Influxes from price increases that begin at $0.025 and surge to $3 during the June timeframe will yield substantial benefits for initial MUTM investors. The existing opportunity demands that individuals enter the future of DeFi at this moment. Participate in the Mutuum Finance presale now to benefit from the extensive market expansion ahead.

42858290,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146096,1743696019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Forecast: US Interest Rate Cuts to Ignite Crypto Market, Tariffs Unlikely to Deter",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/interest-rates-crypto-market-tariff/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! The latest buzz from the U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggests a significant shift in the economic landscape that could send ripples through the digital asset realm. Lutnick’s bold pronouncements about impending interest rate cuts and the ineffectiveness of tariff retaliation are not just Wall Street whispers; they’re potential catalysts for the next crypto market surge. Let’s dive into what this means for your crypto portfolio and the broader economic picture. Why Interest Rate Cuts Could Supercharge the Crypto Market When the U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick states that interest rates are poised to fall “significantly,” it’s more than just economic commentary; it’s a potential green light for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Lower interest rates essentially make borrowing cheaper and reduce the returns on traditionally safer investments like bonds. This scenario often leads investors to seek higher-yield opportunities, and where better to look than the dynamic and potentially lucrative crypto market? Here’s how interest rate cuts can act as rocket fuel for crypto: Increased Liquidity: Lower borrowing costs mean more money circulating in the economy. A portion of this increased liquidity often finds its way into investment avenues, including the high-growth potential of cryptocurrencies. Reduced Opportunity Cost: When traditional savings accounts and bonds offer meager returns due to low interest rates, the allure of higher-yielding assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins becomes significantly stronger. Investors are incentivized to move funds into crypto to seek better returns. Weakened Dollar (Potentially): Interest rate cuts can sometimes weaken the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. While complex, a weaker dollar can, in some cases, make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors as they become relatively cheaper. Risk-On Sentiment: Lower rates generally foster a “risk-on” environment. Investors become more comfortable taking on riskier investments in pursuit of higher returns. Cryptocurrencies, known for their volatility and high potential rewards, often thrive in such environments. Tariff Retaliation: An Ineffective Tool in the Current Economic Climate? Secretary Lutnick’s assertion that tariff retaliation against U.S. tariff policies would be “ineffective” is another crucial piece of the puzzle. While tariffs themselves can create economic uncertainty, his statement suggests a potential resilience in the face of trade tensions. Let’s unpack why this matters in the context of the global economy and, indirectly, the crypto market. Here’s a breakdown of why tariff retaliation might be losing its sting: Globalized Supply Chains: Modern economies are interconnected. Tariffs aimed at one country often impact multiple nations due to complex global supply chains. Retaliation can become a tangled web, hurting everyone involved, including the retaliating country itself. Limited Impact on US Economy (Potentially): The U.S. economy, while not immune, might be less vulnerable to targeted retaliation than some anticipate, especially if domestic demand remains strong. This perceived resilience could embolden the U.S. in its tariff policies. Focus on Domestic Growth: If the U.S. administration believes tariff retaliation is ineffective, it might signal a stronger focus on domestic economic policies, including, potentially, the aforementioned interest rate cuts, to stimulate growth from within. Shifting Trade Dynamics: The global trade landscape is constantly evolving. Countries are seeking new trade partners and diversifying their supply chains. Traditional retaliatory tariff measures might be less impactful in this fluid environment. Economic Impact: Navigating the Uncertainties and Opportunities The interplay of falling interest rates and potentially ineffective tariff retaliation creates a complex economic landscape. For the crypto market, this could translate into both opportunities and challenges. Potential Benefits for Crypto: Increased Investment Flows: As discussed, lower interest rates can drive more investment into crypto assets. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: In times of economic uncertainty, including trade tensions and fluctuating interest rates, some investors view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Innovation and Adoption: A favorable economic environment, fueled by lower rates, can spur innovation and further adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Potential Challenges to Consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased crypto market activity might attract greater regulatory attention, potentially leading to stricter rules and compliance requirements. Volatility Remains: While lower rates can be a tailwind, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. External economic shocks, unexpected policy changes, or market sentiment shifts can still trigger significant price swings. Inflationary Pressures: While not immediately indicated, aggressive interest rate cuts could, in the long run, contribute to inflationary pressures. How cryptocurrencies perform in a high-inflation environment is still a subject of ongoing debate and observation. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Do Now? So, what are the actionable takeaways for crypto investors in light of these developments? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic indicators, especially interest rate announcements and trade policy updates. News from the U.S. Federal Reserve and statements from officials like the Commerce Secretary are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto holdings across different types of cryptocurrencies and consider a balanced portfolio that includes both established coins and promising altcoins. Risk Management is Key: Understand your risk tolerance. The crypto market is volatile. Implement sound risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments. Focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of the projects you invest in. Seek Expert Advice: If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who understands the crypto market. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and investment goals. Conclusion: Navigating the Promising Yet Complex Crypto Landscape Secretary Lutnick’s pronouncements paint a potentially bullish picture for the crypto market, fueled by anticipated interest rate cuts and a perceived resilience to tariff retaliation. However, the crypto landscape is never without its complexities and uncertainties. By staying informed, managing risk wisely, and maintaining a long-term perspective, crypto investors can navigate these dynamic times and potentially capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. The confluence of economic factors suggests a fascinating period for digital assets, demanding both vigilance and strategic action.

Amid all this, AI-based predictions have started pointing traders toward high-returning long-term projects and away from poorly performing tokens. Based on the latest models, Remittix (RTX) is poised to take the position of leader with an 12,500% expected return. While Chainlink (LINK) can be expected to appreciate by around 232% and Toncoin (TON) could see gains. Based on Shiba Inu news forecast, Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be reaching near-term highs. Let us observe why AI predictors are telling investors to dump TON and SHIB, and join Remittix. Chainlink (LINK) Could See Gains—But Remittix Is the Clear Winner Chainlink began showing signs of life in early March after weeks of sideways trading. LINK created higher lows and seemed ready for a breakout. But instead of pushing higher, LINK broke down from its support trend line , invalidating its bullish pattern. As of now, Chainlink is trading in the lower portion of a descending wedge. The RSI recently broke its bullish divergence, and the MACD remains underwhelming. Analysts suggest LINK could fall to $9.60 before attempting any recovery. While a 232% AI-predicted return is impressive, Remittix’s use-case-driven momentum offers more. Remittix has climbed steadily thanks to its real-world payment utility, addressing urgent demand for seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion. LINK may bounce back, but Remittix is already proving itself in live markets. Source: Tradingview Toncoin (TON) Rally Weakens, AI Suggests Caution—RemittixStill Rises Toncoin gained traction after a March 11 bounce from its multi-month low of $2.35. Since then, TON surged by over 65%, but this relief rally may be nearing its end. The price now sits at $4.09, having confirmed the $2.70 level as support. Yet short-term patterns signal trouble. The six-hour chart shows TON forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The MACD and RSI reveal divergence, further supporting the likelihood of a breakdown toward the $3.01 Fibonacci level. While investors hoped TON would reclaim higher territory, AI projections are less optimistic. As attention shifts toward practical, payments-based tokens, Remittix continues its climb—free from the volatility plaguing TON. Its PayFi model is already showing value in real-world scenarios. Source: Tradingview SHIB Faces Headwinds Despite Token Burns—Remittix Gains Investor Confidence According to Shiba Inu news, (SHIB) has rebounded nearly 8% over the past 24 hours, rising from $0.000012 to $0.00001293. The price surge has sparked optimism, with analysts predicting a move to $0.00002045 by April 5. But SHIB remains speculative, relying on token burns and layer-2 developments to stay relevant. Shiba Inu news forecast a 63% gain for SHIB early in April, AI suggests any upward movement may be short-lived. The meme coin still lacks strong utility and continues to face resistance around every price jump. Source: Tradingview Why AI Predicts Remittix Will Lead the Next Wave With over 524 million tokens sold and more than $14.3 million raised in presale, Remittix continues to outpace speculative projects. Its current price of $0.0734 reflects steady interest, but AI tools now predict a staggering 12,500% upside—positioning it as one of the most promising tokens of the year. Remittix thrives because it addresses a specific, global need: fast and affordable crypto-to-fiat transfers. Small business owners, remote workers, and even nonprofits have real incentives to adopt Remittix over speculative tokens like TON and SHIB. For instance, a nonprofit in Europe funding disaster relief in multiple countries can use Remittixto accept crypto donations, convert them instantly into local currency, and distribute funds where needed—without the high costs or delays of traditional banks. This utility is why AI sees Remittix reaching new heights while other tokens hit ceilings. It’s not just a speculative asset—it’s a usable, scalable tool with real-world benefits. Rotate Into Remittix Before April Surge Based on Shiba Inu news, the coin might still deliver short-term gains. Also, Toncoin and Chaiinlink could surprise, but AI predictions are clear— Remittix is where the smart money is heading. Its foundation in real-world finance makes it more than just another altcoin; it's a payments revolution in motion. With proven growth, strong community backing, and increasing adoption, Remittix offers the clearest path to long-term success. As AI forecasts explosive gains, the time to act is now—before the rest of the market catches up. Don’t miss the future of crypto payments—join the Remittix presale today at Remittix.io.

As of April 02, 2025, XRP’s rise after the SEC settlement has fueled optimism, yet MAGACOIN FINANCE’s drastic rise is catching investors’ attention. While XRP promises investors stability and a chance to return to its 2018 peak, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rapid rise that they cannot ignore. Why are XRP investors moving away from the token, and which coin will dominate by December 31, 2025? Let’s break it down. XRP’s Resurgence: Aiming for Historic Peaks? Ripple (XRP) has been using the momentum to its advantage after it settled with the SEC on March 25, 2025, reducing its $125 million fine to $50 million, finalizing a legal tussle that started in 2020. Now, the asset is trading at $2.11 from $1.88 that it traded two weeks ago, putting it within a touching distance of its $3.84 high in 2018. Analysts have predicted $15 by late 2025 if it overcomes the $2.50 resistance, a level the asset has tested three times in the past six months. Whale activity has also increased, with about eight million tokens moved in the last 24 hours. In addition, ETF rumors could also trigger a 600% gain. Yet, its 100 billion supply and one billion monthly escrow releases might cap the climb. Can XRP hit new heights? MAGACOIN FINANCE Ignites Presale Fever: 9,500% Looms As XRP continues to see attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the Altcoin playbook. Its presale has seen over $5 million, with Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 per token as of April 02, 2025. The confirmed listing price of $0.007 means that a 2,500% ROI is guaranteed, but a projection of $0.025 – $0.03 by 2025 means that 9,500% is possible. The project has also ensured that its 50,000 supporter base earns its trust by carrying out its audit with Hashdex Blockchain. In addition, the supporter base has been increasing by 10,000 every week across 30+ different countries. With the presale stages finishing in days, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting XRP investors hungry for bigger, faster profits–could it outpace XRP’s rally? Experts Weigh In: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 50x Speed Beats XRP Analysts have noted that with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential, it can witness a 50x ROI, moving from $0.000266 to $0.0133, before XRP hits $15. XRP’s predicted 600% jump relies on its $120 billion market cap and ability to recover after its regulatory issues. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s lean supply and presale attention could also push the token by Q3 2025, leaving XRP’s slow climb in the dust. XRP is a steady veteran in the market, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s speed and scale make it the perfect token to choose for quick gains, experts say. The Great Debate: XRP’s Peak or MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Leap? LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH CODE MAGA50X XRP is targeting $15, which means a 600% gain, with a 240% rise in 2024 and eight million tokens in play showing strength. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $0.000266 to $0.03 path, which means a 9,500% rise, could turn $100 into $9,500, backed by $5 million raised. XRP is the safe pick with ETF potential, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the better pick. Stage 6 is gone, join MAGACOIN FINANCE before it experiences another rise.

Here's How Traders Playing the Dip",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/03/what-next-for-btc-eth-sol-ada-xrp-after-trump-tariffs-traders-react,"The kickstart of heavy tariffs under the Trump administration has ushered in a new chapter of uncertainty and opportunity for the crypto market, one that tends to ebb and flow with changes in the global economy. Tariffs, by design, increase the cost of imported goods, often leading to higher inflation, shifts in supply chains, and fluctuations in currency valuations. A stronger U.S. dollar, driven by tariff-induced trade imbalances, might initially pressure crypto prices downward as investors flock to traditional safe havens. However, prolonged economic uncertainty could fuel bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value, especially if central banks respond with loose monetary policies. Here’s how crypto traders and market watchers are approaching the coming months — largely expecting muted price action in the near term but bullish in the medium to long term. Rick Maeda, Research Analyst at Presto Research Trump’s tariffs, jumping to 34% on China and 25% on cars from the 10% baseline levy, unnerved global markets and crypto was no exception. Bitcoin sold-off into the $82k level while Ethereum got hit harder, dipping below 1,800. Options flow-wise, there was put buying across tenors as traders hedged against further downside, but implied volatility term structures held relatively steady. Crypto continues to be haunted by Trump’s trade policies as it faced a similar shock earlier this year when tariffs on Mexico and Canada - 25% each - were floated. Lacking a strong intrinsic narrative, the asset class remains firmly tethered to macro forces, with its macro beta keeping it closely bound to trade war developments. Structurally, a prolonged trade war could continue to batter crypto as it continues to identify as a risk asset rather than the digital gold it once was. Enmanuel Cardozo, Market Analyst at Brickken ""Trump’s tariffs that rolled out yesterday on April 2, 2025, for a long list of countries, are stirring up the crypto industry in a big way. We saw how bitcoin was at $88,500 flirting with the $90K level but in a span of 4hrs dropped down to around $82,000. In the short term, these tariffs are fueling a lot of volatility in what seems to me a sideways consolidation zone—, as economic uncertainty drives retail investors toward safer bets like gold or traditional investment vehicles while institutional investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Add to that the broader risk-off sentiment—JPMorgan’s survey shows 51% of institutional traders see inflation and tariffs as the top market shapers this year. But looking past the immediate turbulence, there’s a potential upside for crypto in the long run. These tariffs could weaken the dollar’s dominance by making imports pricier, which might position bitcoin as a go-to hedge against inflation. As global trade gets more murky, crypto’s utility for cross-border transactions could potentially gain more appeal, especially with stablecoins stepping up as a workaround for tariff barriers as we’re already seeing hints of this with government-backed stablecoin adoption. Trump’s tactic—where tariffs might act by weakening the dollar—adds another layer. If the easing effect wins, bitcoin could benefit long-term. Either way, I’ll be watching how these tariffs interact with Fed policy and market sentiment to see how crypto adapts to this scenario."" Alvin Kan, COO at Bitget Wallet ""Trump’s proposed tariffs risk triggering stagflation—rising prices without growth—which could undermine confidence in fiat, especially the U.S. dollar. As capital seeks protection from inflation and trade war uncertainty, bitcoin stands out as a neutral, decentralized hedge. If dollar dominance erodes and volatility spikes, BTC demand could rise fast. In a fragmented, protectionist world, bitcoin becomes less about speculation and more about preservation, and smart traders are already positioning accordingly."" Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SignalPlus ""Trade partners promised retaliation, while cross assets saw a massive risk-off move, leading to a similar drop in BTC to recent lows. Compared to the move in US equities, which breached recent lows, crypto prices outperformed relatively, with BTC holding above the $80k level as the weaker dollar and stronger gold move is providing markets with a convenient excuse to give bitcoin a little bit of a flight to quality bid. A bold statement from Secretary Bessent blaming the sell-off as a ""Mag-7 problem"" compounded the negative sentiment. Risk off will likely be the consensus move here, as it's hard to imagine Trump pulling a quick 180-degree move after such an aggressive show of force, with US assets likely underperforming with economic growth to show tangible weakness in the near future. We like buying BTC on aggressive dips towards the 76-77k area."" Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research ""Trump’s unexpectedly harsh tariffs, including 10-49% tariffs on imports, may have sparked a panic-driven sell-off in the wider market, with ETH and SOL dropping ~6%, and the market shifting to stablecoins as fear spiked. Beyond the initial shock, these tariffs threaten the U.S. economy, which could ripple into crypto markets. Higher import costs—particularly from key partners like China —could accelerate inflation, with some models projecting a 2-3% CPI uptick by Q2 2025 if trade wars escalate. Concurrently, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate of a 2.8% GDP decline for Q1 2025 may worsen as consumer spending and business investment falter under tariff pressures. A weakening dollar from economic strain and potential Fed easing could boost BTC as a hedge, with data showing early accumulation trends. However, altcoins may need stronger fundamentals to benefit in the long term.""Read more: Why Trump's Tariffs Could Actually be Good for Bitcoin",Markets|market analysis|Markets|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 16:06:36

In a recent update shared by Eleanor Terrett, host of ‘Crypto in America’ on X, Atkins has successfully navigated the Senate Banking Committee hurdle and is now poised for a full U.S. Senate vote. This development could signal a pivotal shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto in America. Who is Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair Nominee? For those unfamiliar, Paul Atkins is not a newcomer to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008. His background gives him a deep understanding of the intricacies of financial regulation and the workings of the SEC itself. Understanding his perspective is crucial as he stands on the cusp of potentially leading the agency. Here’s a quick rundown of his relevant experience: Former SEC Commissioner (2002-2008): This experience provides him with firsthand knowledge of the SEC’s operations and regulatory challenges. CEO of Patomak Global Partners: A regulatory consulting firm, indicating continued engagement with financial market regulations. Deep understanding of financial markets: His career reflects a long-standing involvement in financial regulatory matters. Given his background, Atkins’ nomination is being viewed with considerable interest, especially by the cryptocurrency community, which is keenly observing how regulatory frameworks will evolve under potential new leadership at the SEC. Senate Banking Committee Greenlights Atkins: What’s Next for the Senate Vote? The Senate Banking Committee’s approval is a critical milestone in the nomination process. It signifies that Atkins has garnered sufficient support within the committee to move forward. However, it’s important to understand that this is just one step. The next, and arguably more significant, stage is the full U.S. Senate vote. Here’s a breakdown of what this entails: Full Senate Vote: Atkins’ nomination will now be put to a vote before the entire U.S. Senate. Majority Required: He will need a simple majority vote in the Senate to be confirmed as the SEC Chair. Political Dynamics: The Senate’s current political composition will play a crucial role in determining the outcome. Bipartisan support or opposition will be key factors to watch. Timeline Uncertainty: The timing of the full Senate vote is not yet fixed and can be influenced by the Senate’s legislative schedule and political priorities. The crypto industry and financial markets alike are now waiting with bated breath for the scheduling of the Senate vote, as it will determine whether Atkins will indeed take the helm at the SEC. Cryptocurrency Regulation: How Could Atkins’ SEC Chairmanship Shape the Future? The burning question for the crypto community is: how will Paul Atkins, as SEC Chair, approach cryptocurrency regulation ? While we await more definitive statements from Atkins himself regarding his specific plans for digital assets, we can infer potential approaches based on his past statements and general regulatory philosophy. Here are some key considerations: Emphasis on Investor Protection: SEC Chairs typically prioritize investor protection. Atkins is likely to continue this trend, potentially scrutinizing crypto offerings and platforms to ensure investor safety. Clarity on Regulatory Frameworks: The crypto industry has long called for clearer regulatory guidelines. Atkins might focus on providing more definitive frameworks to help crypto businesses operate within legal boundaries. Balance Between Innovation and Regulation: A key challenge for any SEC Chair in the crypto era is striking the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. Atkins’ approach to this balance will be closely watched. Enforcement Actions: The SEC under Atkins could continue, or even intensify, enforcement actions against crypto firms deemed to be in violation of securities laws. It’s important to note that these are speculative points. The actual direction of SEC crypto policy under Atkins will depend on various factors, including evolving market dynamics and broader policy considerations. The Significance of the Senate Vote for SEC Crypto Policy The upcoming Senate vote is not just about confirming an individual; it’s about setting the direction for SEC crypto policy for the foreseeable future. The SEC Chair wields significant influence over the agency’s agenda, priorities, and enforcement strategies. Here’s why this vote is particularly significant for the crypto space: Policy Direction: The confirmed chair will influence the SEC’s stance on key crypto issues, including token classifications, exchange regulations, and DeFi oversight. Market Impact: SEC decisions have a direct impact on crypto markets. Clarity or ambiguity from the SEC can significantly affect market sentiment and investment flows. Industry Growth: The regulatory environment shaped by the SEC Chair can either foster or hinder the growth and development of the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S. Global Implications: The U.S. SEC’s approach to crypto regulation is often observed and sometimes emulated by other countries, giving it global significance. Therefore, the outcome of the Senate vote will be a crucial determinant of the regulatory climate that the cryptocurrency industry will navigate in the years to come. Anticipating the Future: What to Expect After the Senate Vote? Once the Senate vote concludes, regardless of the outcome, the crypto industry will need to adapt and respond. Here’s a look at potential scenarios and what to expect: Scenario Potential Impact on Crypto Atkins Confirmed Likely increased regulatory scrutiny, potential for clearer guidelines, emphasis on investor protection, possible enforcement actions. Atkins Not Confirmed The nomination process would likely restart, potentially leading to another nominee with possibly different views on crypto regulation. Uncertainty would persist until a chair is confirmed. In either scenario, proactive engagement from the crypto industry will be essential. This includes ongoing dialogue with regulators, adherence to evolving compliance standards, and continued efforts to educate policymakers about the nuances of cryptocurrency technology and markets. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto and SEC Leadership Paul Atkins’ advancement to a full Senate vote marks a critical juncture for both the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry. The decision that the Senate will make holds the potential to significantly shape the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States and beyond. As the industry awaits the Senate’s verdict, stakeholders should remain informed, adaptable, and prepared to engage with whatever regulatory environment emerges. The coming weeks will be decisive in determining the direction of Cryptocurrency Regulation and the SEC’s role in it. Stay tuned for further updates as this crucial story develops.

With crucial levels expected to play a pivotal role in their future, the market is buzzing with anticipation. This article delves into the critical points to watch in Q2, unveiling which coins are poised for remarkable growth. XRP Price Dynamics: 1-Month Dip and 6-Month Rally XRP dropped around 14% in the past month, signaling short-term weakness amid volatile price swings. Over the last six months, the coin surged by over 280%, demonstrating strong long-term recovery and renewed investor interest. Price fluctuations have been significant, reflecting both rapid downward movements and robust upward momentum. Current prices settle between $1.66 and $2.77, with key levels at $1.23 for support and $3.45 for resistance. Bears dominate, as evidenced by a 13% weekly decline and negative momentum indicators. No clear trend is present, prompting traders to monitor potential rebounds at support or further declines if the $1.23 level is breached. A move above current levels could test the $3.45 resistance. Cardano: Shifting Momentum within Key Price Bounds Trading over the past month indicates a significant decline of nearly one-quarter, whereas the performance over the last six months shows an impressive gain of over 84%. Price action remains choppy, characterized by a clear downturn recently, contrasting with a strong longer-term surge. This volatility highlights the usual market fluctuations, where recent short-term losses follow a period of extended growth that has positively influenced investor sentiment. Cardano is currently trading within a range of approximately $0.47 to $1.02, with support identified at around $0.27 and resistance at $1.37. Bears seem to be dominant in the short term, as momentum indicators alongside an RSI near 40 indicate weakness. Trading strategies could focus on a possible break above resistance for bulls to regain control, while keeping a close watch on the support level is crucial. Conclusion XRP and ADA are showing strong potential for major movements. Key levels for XRP suggest preparation for a significant breakout. ADA's anticipated levels also indicate a possible surge. Monitoring these coins closely in Q2 is crucial. Both currencies have shown strength, making them worth attention. Future price actions could lead to notable shifts.

Key Improvements In The Ethereum Pectra Upgrade The Pectra update has a bundle of 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) intended to enhance the usability and effectiveness of the network. All the changes will be made at the same time to tackle a number of elements within the Ethereum environment. One of the standout additions is adding “smart contract” functionality to wallets. This will make wallets simpler to use and recover. This will alleviate a widespread issue for Ethereum users who have previously had issues with wallet recovery and management options. For validators in Ethereum, EIP-7251 introduces a dramatic shift in the staking process. In this proposal, the upper limit of ETH that can be staked will be raised from the current threshold of 32 ETH to a much higher value of 2,048 ETH. This adjustment is tailor-made to enhance staking efficiency for those running several validators. It will enable them to organize their activities in a single node instead of operating separate nodes per validator. Pectra’s Testing Journey And Implementation Timeline The road to Pectra’s mainnet launch has been met with several challenges. The upgrade went through three separate testnet implementations before developers felt confident enough to set a mainnet launch date. Even though the final test on the Hoodi testnet proceeded without any issues, the two earlier test runs encountered bugs that forced developers to delay the upgrade. These technical challenges brought forth more testing and tweaks prior to proceeding with the mainnet deployment plan. In the call among the core developers, the group approved the May 7 target date following an assessment of the successful Hoodi testnet. Now that the May 7 date has been finalized, users, developers, and validators all have a set schedule by which to ready themselves for the changes. Node operators and staking services in particular will need to update their software to remain compatible with the network once Pectra goes live. Ethereum Struggles At $1,700 Ethereum’s price has been underperforming on all time frames leading up to the Pectra upgrade announcement. The data indicates ETH has dropped 6.2% over the last 24 hours, with deeper declines of 12.6% in the last seven days and 14.7% in the last 30 days. Ethereum price has also dropped 47.1% in the last 12 months. Currently trading in the $1,700 range, ETH has not seen a positive market reaction to the upgrade news. Analysts have mixed views on Ethereum’s price outlook. Ito Shimotsuma pointed to potential bullish signals, noting on X: “ETH is forming a bullish divergence on the 12H timeframe. RSI is slowly reaching neutral territory while price is going down. On top of that, a lot of shorts are building up, which is always a good signal if you hold an Altcoin.” $ETH is forming a bullish divergence on the 12H timeframe.

All we need to see is a little bit of strength… pic.twitter.com/qr8avm0p0a — Ito Shimotsuma (@ItoShimotsuma) April 3, 2025 Taking a much more optimistic long-term view, analyst CryptoElites stated : “Ethereum to $10K by 2025—minimum! The path is clear, just stay focused and trust the process!” The announcement is coming just after Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs , and the upgrade could provide a bullish outlook for ETH. Inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have surged once again as investors chose to look past the Trump reciprocal tariffs. As per the data, net inflows across all US ETFs for Bitcoin stood at $220 million yesterday.

Pi Network ( PI ) was one of the worst performers as it dropped to a record low of $0.56, down by over 80% from its highest level in February. Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-biggest meme coin, dropped by 17%, while Ethena ( ENA ) fell by 18%. The other top laggards were altcoins like Hyperliquid, Berachain, Bonk, Jito, and Official Trum, which also fell by over 15%. The sharp decline came as U.S. recession odds surged. According to Polymarket, the probability of a U.S. recession rose to over 70%. MetLife, a leading financial services firm, increased its recession odds to 40%, while Goldman Sachs and PIMCO raised their forecasts to 35%. You might also like: ‘Classic business technique’: Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs stir crypto chaos These odds jumped after Donald Trump announced tariffs on all countries that export their goods to the US. Analysts caution that these tariffs pose a black swan event that could reshape the global economy. Several countries have already pledged to retaliate. Canada imposed a 25% tariff on U.S.-made vehicles — a move that could trigger further escalation. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that tariffs on retaliating countries could rise even further. The crash in top altcoins like Pepe, Pi Network, and Ethena mirrored declines in U.S. equities. The Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 fell by 1,200, 200, and 815 points, respectively. They also dropped as a sense of fear spread in the financial market. The fear and greed index moved to the extreme fear zone of 11, while the crypto fear index plunged to 24. On the positive side, bull market cycles often begin when fear is at its peak. For example, the last time the CNN Fear and Greed Index hit this level was in March 2020 which coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stocks and crypto began a historic rally after the Federal Reserve intervened with rate cuts and liquidity support. Therefore, there is a possibility that Bitcoin and altcoins like Pi Network, Pepe, and Ethena will bounce back once the current wave of panic selling ends.

Brazil's Largest Bank Itaú Unibanco Designs Its Own Stablecoin The bank's decision will depend on regulatory developments in Brazil and the success of stablecoin offerings by U.S. financial institutions. Guto Antunes, Itaú’s head of digital assets, said the decision could depend on how American institutions proceed with their stablecoin offerings. Speaking at an industry event in São Paulo, Antunes cited the growing momentum behind blockchain-based payment systems. “Stablecoins have always been on Itaú’s radar. We can’t ignore the power of the blockchain to process transactions atomically,” he said. For now, stablecoins remain a hot topic. The surge in interest in stablecoins comes on the heels of a political shift in the United States, where lawmakers rejected a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in favor of promoting private stablecoin alternatives to preserve the dollar’s dominance. In Brazil, regulators are conducting a public consultation (Consulta Pública No. 111) focusing on how stablecoins can fit into the current financial system. Antunes said the bank is waiting to see what rules the central bank will set before moving forward with any internal projects. Antunes also expressed concerns about the proposed self-custody ban in Brazil’s draft stablecoin rules. It’s worth noting that Brazil prohibits large pension funds from investing in cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

The latest exciting development is the full integration of Sui Network by Utila, a leading digital asset management platform. This powerful alliance is set to significantly enhance institutional crypto support and reshape how institutions interact with blockchain technology. Are you ready to explore how this integration is a game-changer for the crypto landscape? Deep Dive into Sui Network Integration by Utila The announcement, made via a post on X (formerly Twitter) by Sui Network, highlights a comprehensive suite of features now available through Utila. This isn’t just a surface-level connection; it’s a deep, robust Sui Network integration designed to meet the rigorous demands of institutional investors. Let’s break down what this integration brings to the table: MPC-Secured Transactions: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ensures that transactions are secured through a distributed cryptographic protocol, eliminating single points of failure and significantly boosting security. This is crucial for institutions managing large sums of digital assets. Native Staking: Utila users can now directly participate in Sui Network’s native staking mechanisms. This allows institutions to earn rewards on their Sui holdings, contributing to network security and earning passive income simultaneously. DeFi Access: The integration unlocks seamless access to the burgeoning Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Sui Network. Institutions can now explore DeFi protocols, yield farming opportunities, and other innovative financial instruments directly through Utila’s platform. Object-Level Policy Controls: This feature provides granular control over digital assets at an object level. Institutions can define and enforce specific policies for different assets, enhancing compliance and risk management. Centralized Exchange (CEX) Connectivity: Utila’s integration extends to centralized exchanges, facilitating smooth and efficient trading and liquidity management across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Why is Institutional Crypto Support Crucial? The entry of institutional players into the cryptocurrency market is widely regarded as a pivotal moment for the industry’s maturation and long-term sustainability. Institutional crypto support brings in substantial capital, credibility, and stability. Here’s why it matters: Increased Market Liquidity: Institutional investment injects significant liquidity into the market, reducing volatility and making it more efficient. Enhanced Market Stability: Institutions often have longer investment horizons compared to retail investors, which can contribute to greater market stability and reduce speculative bubbles. Regulatory Compliance and Trust: Institutional platforms like Utila are built with regulatory compliance in mind, providing a safer and more trustworthy environment for digital asset management. Innovation and Growth: Institutional involvement fuels innovation by supporting the development of more sophisticated financial products and services within the crypto space. The Power of Digital Asset Management with Utila Utila stands out as a premier digital asset management platform, specifically designed to cater to the complex needs of institutions. By offering a secure, compliant, and feature-rich environment, Utila empowers institutions to confidently navigate the crypto landscape. What makes Utila a preferred choice for institutional investors? Feature Benefit for Institutions MPC-Secured Wallets Unparalleled security for digital assets, mitigating risks associated with private key management. Compliance Framework Adherence to regulatory standards, ensuring operational legitimacy and investor protection. Customizable Policy Controls Granular control over asset access and usage, aligning with internal governance and risk management frameworks. Comprehensive Reporting Detailed transaction history and portfolio analytics, facilitating auditing and performance tracking. Dedicated Support Expert assistance and tailored solutions to meet the specific needs of institutional clients. Unlocking Blockchain DeFi Access for Institutions Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents a wealth of opportunities for yield generation and innovative financial products. However, navigating the DeFi space can be complex and risky, especially for institutions accustomed to traditional finance structures. Utila’s Blockchain DeFi Access simplifies this journey, providing a secure and compliant gateway to DeFi on Sui Network. How does Utila bridge the gap to DeFi? Curated DeFi Protocols: Utila likely vets and integrates with reputable and secure DeFi protocols on Sui Network, reducing the risk of exposure to unaudited or vulnerable platforms. Simplified DeFi Interaction: The platform likely abstracts away some of the technical complexities of DeFi, offering a user-friendly interface for institutions to engage with protocols. Risk Management Tools: Utila may provide tools and analytics to help institutions assess and manage the risks associated with DeFi investments. Yield Optimization Strategies: The platform could offer strategies and automated tools to optimize yield farming and staking returns within the DeFi ecosystem. The Security Edge: MPC Secured Transactions Security is paramount in the cryptocurrency world, especially when dealing with institutional capital. MPC Secured Transactions are a cornerstone of Utila’s offering, providing an advanced layer of protection against cyber threats and internal risks. What makes MPC security so effective? Distributed Key Management: Instead of a single private key, MPC distributes key shares among multiple parties. No single party holds the entire key, making it virtually impossible for hackers to compromise the entire key. Threshold Signatures: Transactions require signatures from a threshold number of parties to be valid. This prevents unauthorized transactions even if some key shares are compromised. Enhanced Privacy: MPC can enable secure computations without revealing the underlying data. This can be beneficial for privacy-sensitive institutional transactions. Reduced Single Point of Failure: By eliminating single points of failure associated with traditional private key management, MPC significantly enhances the overall security posture. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Crypto and Utila-Sui Network The integration of Sui Network by Utila marks a significant step forward for institutional crypto support . As institutions increasingly allocate capital to digital assets, platforms like Utila, which prioritize security, compliance, and seamless access to innovative blockchain ecosystems, will become indispensable. This partnership is not just about technology; it’s about building trust and fostering wider adoption of cryptocurrencies within the institutional world. The future looks bright for both Utila and Sui Network as they continue to empower institutions to confidently embrace the transformative potential of digital assets.

If you’re ready to move on from PEPE’s frog-fueled past, INPEPE is the future of meme coins, and here’s why it’s time to make the switch. PEPE’s Party Is Over PEPE was a masterclass in viral hype—a frog meme that caught lightning in a bottle. But beyond the laughs, it’s got little to offer.

The first to negotiate will win—the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life,” Eric said . This came just hours after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tariff plan at the White House that has already caused a pile of angry reactions across the globe. According to Reuters, Trump’s new plan will apply a 10% base tariff on imports from all countries, then add higher rates depending on how much the White House believes each country has been taxing U.S. goods. The administration posted a chart of these new “reciprocal tariffs” on Truth Social showing a full breakdown of countries and their rates. The new rates include a 34% tariff on China, 20% on the European Union, 46% on Vietnam, and 32% on Taiwan. President Trump introduces his reciprocal tariffs on ‘Liberation Day.’ Source: Al-Jazeera Global leaders react, demand answers as Trump ignores backlash India reacted quickly. On Thursday, India’s Department of Commerce said it is still “carefully examining the implications” of the announcement. The U.S. tariffs on India now sit at 27%, while Trump’s Truth Social post said 26%. That discrepancy wasn’t explained by either side. Thailand’s Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told reporters that his country could lose one percentage point from its economic growth forecast because of Trump’s tariffs. The International Monetary Fund had predicted Thailand’s economy would grow by 2.9% this year. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also gave a number. He said these tariffs could knock 0.4% off Poland’s GDP, which equals around 10 billion zlotys, or $2.64 billion. “A severe and unpleasant blow because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it,” Tusk wrote on X. “Our friendship must also survive this test.” German officials are already talking strategy. Acting Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Thursday that Trump “will buckle under pressure” if Europe unites. “That is what I see, that Donald Trump will buckle under pressure, that he corrects his announcements under pressure,” he said during a press conference. Greece’s Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis issued a warning of his own. He said the U.S. tariffs are a big change in direction and go against how the European Union believes economic policy should be handled. “As a country, we are in favour of free trade,” Pierrakakis said in a written statement. “We hope that this chapter will last as little as possible.” The South African presidency said on Thursday that the 30% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have created an “urgency” to renegotiate terms. “The tariffs affirm the urgency to negotiate a new bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the U.S.,” their statement said. The presidency also said the country is “concerned” by the new duties. In London, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed a group of business leaders inside 10 Downing Street. He said that Trump had a “mandate” to do what he believed was right for the U.S., but warned that the United Kingdom would make decisions based on its “own national interest.” He added, “Decisions we take in the coming days and weeks will be guided only by our national interest. In the interest of our economy. In the interests of the businesses around this table.” Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the 20% tariff slapped on the European Union. “The tariffs are wrong and not in the interest of either party,” she said, as reported by Dow Jones. She also warned that a trade war would “inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players.” Meloni said she would push to reach a deal with the U.S. and avoid escalation. Spain’s Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said on Thursday that Madrid is willing to negotiate but won’t accept what he called “unfair and unjustified” tariffs. Spain is part of the EU, which was hit with a flat 20% rate across the board under Trump’s new rules. Cuerpo said the government will take “action” to protect local companies and consumers from the financial hit. The strongest comments came from France. French government spokesperson Sophie Primas said Trump’s new tariffs reflect an “imperialist posture” and accused him of acting like the “master of the world.” Speaking on RTL Radio, she said the European Union will not let this slide. Primas confirmed the EU is preparing to introduce countermeasures starting in mid-April, with more coming later in April if the situation doesn’t change.

So, which one stands out the most, and how do they compare? Let’s dive into each of these projects individually to explore why they’re some of the best cryptos to join for long term and how each offers something unique for future adoption. Qubetics: Leading the Way in Cross-Border Transactions When searching for the best cryptos to join for long term investment, Qubetics is definitely a name to watch. While scalability issues or limited real-world applications still bog down many cryptocurrencies, Qubetics is taking a different approach by focusing on cross-border transactions .

This partnership expands Qubetics’ ability to provide smoother, more secure cross-chain interactions, positioning it to lead the way in global payment solutions. With businesses in mind, Qubetics is making international payments quicker and more reliable than ever before. SUI’s Devnet Gains Traction with Key Developer Support SUI recently launched its Devnet , a crucial step in its development that’s received support from both developers and early adopters. This move not only enhances the platform’s usability but also boosts SUI’s reputation as one of the best cryptos to join for long term . The Devnet’s success means that SUI’s ecosystem is on track for expansion, with more decentralized applications ready to be built on the network. This makes SUI an exciting project for anyone looking for a robust platform to scale blockchain applications without sacrificing performance. This scalability focus is exactly why SUI has been gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to join for long term growth. The platform’s ability to scale easily is a significant advantage, especially as more dApps (decentralized applications) and users join the ecosystem. Additionally, SUI’s architecture allows for high throughput and low latency , making it ideal for real-time applications like gaming, financial services, and supply chain tracking. Algorand Partners with Major Financial Institutions In recent months, Algorand has been gaining further recognition by partnering with major financial institutions to enhance its DeFi offerings. This includes collaborations with global payment processors and traditional financial entities, which solidifies Algorand’s position as one of the best cryptos to join for long term growth in the financial sector. These partnerships are setting the stage for mass adoption, making Algorand an appealing choice for those looking for a stable and reliable blockchain solution for the future. What sets Algorand apart from other platforms is its focus on real-world applications. It’s already being used for a variety of financial services, from payments to decentralized finance (DeFi) . Algorand’s ability to execute cross-border transactions instantly and at a low cost has led to adoption by banks and financial institutions looking to integrate blockchain into their infrastructure. Cross-Border Transactions: The Future of Blockchain Payments Regarding best cryptos to join for long term , cross-border transactions are a key feature to look for. Traditional financial systems often face high fees, slow processing times, and lack of transparency. However, blockchain technology can change all of that, and projects like Qubetics are leading the way. Key Benefits of Cross-Border Blockchain Transactions: Lower Fees : Blockchain significantly lowers transaction fees than traditional financial systems.

42861013,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146104,1743700831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Bitcoin Payments: Block Unveils Bold Integration for Bitkey and Square,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/block-bitcoin-payments-bitkey-square/,"Get ready for a seismic shift in how you interact with Bitcoin! Jack Dorsey’s Block, formerly Square, is doubling down on its commitment to cryptocurrency, confirming plans to weave Bitcoin payments directly into its Bitkey self-custody wallet and the ubiquitous Square payment platform. This exciting development, initially hinted at by Crypto Briefing on X, promises to streamline Bitcoin transactions for millions. But what exactly does this mean for users, and what’s driving Block’s intensified focus on Bitcoin? Why Bitcoin Payments are a Game Changer for Block’s Ecosystem? Integrating Bitcoin payments into Bitkey and Square isn’t just a minor upgrade; it’s a strategic move that could redefine Block’s position in the fintech landscape. Here’s why this integration is a significant step: Enhanced User Experience: Imagine seamlessly using Bitcoin for everyday transactions within the Square ecosystem, or managing your Bitcoin holdings directly through Bitkey for payments. This integration aims to make Bitcoin more accessible and user-friendly. Broader Bitcoin Adoption: By embedding Bitcoin payments into widely used platforms like Square, Block is paving the way for wider cryptocurrency adoption. This could encourage more businesses and individuals to embrace Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method. Synergy within Block’s Products: Connecting Bitkey and Square through Bitcoin payments creates a powerful synergy. Users can manage their Bitcoin securely in Bitkey and then utilize it for transactions via Square, all within the Block ecosystem. Competitive Edge: In a rapidly evolving fintech market, offering integrated Bitcoin payment solutions gives Block a distinct advantage. It caters to the growing demand for crypto-friendly financial services. Bitkey: Your Self-Custody Gateway to Bitcoin Payments Launched in late 2023, Bitkey is Block’s foray into the world of self-custody Bitcoin wallets . Unlike custodial wallets where a third party holds your private keys, Bitkey puts you in complete control of your Bitcoin. Integrating Bitcoin payments into Bitkey means: Full Control Over Your Funds: You maintain complete ownership and control over your Bitcoin, aligning with the core ethos of cryptocurrency. Direct Payments from Your Wallet: Send and receive Bitcoin payments directly from your Bitkey wallet, enhancing its utility beyond just storage. Security and Privacy: Self-custody wallets like Bitkey are designed to offer enhanced security and privacy compared to custodial solutions. Seamless Integration with Block’s Ecosystem: Bitkey is poised to become a central component in Block’s Bitcoin-centric strategy, with payments being a key feature. Square and Bitcoin: Expanding Payment Horizons Square, known for its point-of-sale systems and payment processing services, is already somewhat familiar with crypto, having allowed Bitcoin trading on its Cash App. However, direct Bitcoin payments through Square’s core platform would be a significant leap. This could mean: Bitcoin Payments for Businesses: Businesses using Square could potentially accept Bitcoin as payment, opening up new customer segments and payment options. Consumer Bitcoin Payments: Consumers could use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services at Square-enabled businesses, directly from their wallets (potentially including Bitkey). Reduced Transaction Fees: Bitcoin transactions can sometimes offer lower fees compared to traditional payment methods, especially for international transactions. Innovation in Retail Payments: Integrating Bitcoin payments into Square could spur innovation in retail payment solutions and customer experiences. Beyond Payments: Block’s Broader Bitcoin Strategy The move towards Bitcoin payments is just one facet of Block’s broader strategy. Jack Dorsey’s company is evidently deepening its commitment to Bitcoin, as evidenced by: Bitcoin Mining Chip Development: Block is developing a 3nm Bitcoin mining chip, signaling a serious foray into Bitcoin mining infrastructure. This indicates a long-term vision for Bitcoin’s role in the future. Scaling Back Other Ventures: While increasing its Bitcoin focus, Block is reportedly scaling back efforts in other areas like Tidal (music streaming) and TBD (decentralized web platform). This reallocation of resources underscores the priority Bitcoin holds for the company. Long-Term Bitcoin Vision: These actions collectively suggest that Block views Bitcoin not just as a trend, but as a fundamental technology with enduring value and potential. What are the Potential Challenges? While the integration of Bitcoin payments into Bitkey and Square is exciting, challenges remain: Regulatory Hurdles: Cryptocurrency regulations are still evolving globally. Block will need to navigate complex and potentially differing regulatory landscapes to implement Bitcoin payments seamlessly. Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can be a concern for both businesses and consumers. Mechanisms to mitigate this volatility might be necessary for widespread adoption in payments. Scalability of Bitcoin Network: While Bitcoin’s Lightning Network offers solutions for faster and cheaper transactions, broader scalability remains a topic of ongoing development. User Education: Educating users about Bitcoin, self-custody, and secure payment practices will be crucial for the success of these integrations. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Payments with Block Jack Dorsey’s Block is making a bold statement by prioritizing Bitcoin payments and infrastructure. While no launch date has been specified, the confirmation of these plans is a significant signal to the market. As Block pushes forward with its Bitcoin-centric vision, it could catalyze a new wave of cryptocurrency adoption and reshape the future of digital payments.

This comes amid Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs, which could trigger this price crash. Bitcoin Price Could Drop Below $60,000 If It Fails To Hold This Level In an X post , Titan of Crypto warned that the Bitcoin price could drop below $60,000 if it fails to hold above $81,872. He remarked that BTC must hold within this range, stay above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and keep the weekly RSI above key support. He warned that the flagship crypto could witness a deeper correction if it fails to hold above those levels. His accompanying chart showed that a drop below $60,000 could occur as part of this correction, with Bitcoin touching $58,500. This bearish outlook for Bitcoin follows US President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on all countries. This move could spark this downtrend for BTC, especially as a global trade war heats up. The flagship crypto has already dropped from as high as $88,000 following this announcement and could soon lose the $80,000 range. In the long term, Titan of Crypto believes the Bitcoin price could still rebound. He highlighted a Falling Wedge pattern, which was forming for the flagship crypto. The analyst remarked that over the next couple of months, the CPI and Core PCE will likely improve as Trueflation data shows inflation cooling off significantly. He then raised the possibility of this setting the stage for a “strong” BTC bounce by May. Macro fundamentals continue to heavily impact Bitcoin’s price and the broader crypto market. A CoinGape market analysis highlighted the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech as two key macroeconomic events to watch this week. Bullish Scenario For BTC Amid this persistent downtrend for the Bitcoin price, analysts are still providing bullish predictions for BTC. Crypto analyst Crypto Caesar stated that his bullish scenario for the BTC price is a rally to $120,000, which will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. He suggested that this price level would mark the top for BTC in this cycle. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader Tradigrade asserted that the Bitcoin price is poised for the final surge. He remarked that a surge begins whenever BTC’s RSI breaks the ascending triangle. Interestingly, his accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could reach as high as $650,000 on this final surge, although this looks likely to happen next year.

Currently in Phase 4 of an 11-phase presale, the project is having tokens sold at $0.025 a piece, with this phase filling up quickly as investors speculating a 20% price bump to $0.03 in the following phase. Investors anticipate a 140% return when it hits exchanges for $0.06; and after it launches it’s expected to climb as high as $3.50 by 2025, making MUTM one to watch in the decentralized finance space. Investor Gains During Phase 4 Momentum Demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unprecedented, with Phase 4 tokens selling out faster than in prior phases. While investors buying at the $0.025 price now could make an immediate 20% profit the moment Phase 5 starts, once the token is officially listed at $0.06 the average purchase price at this stage would guarantee investors a return of 140%. This structured appreciation is hardwired into the token’s design, encouraging early participation ahead of each incremental price increase. The presale’s swift advance — it’s already 20% sold out — demonstrates growing confidence in Mutuum’s lending protocols and revenue share systems, which reward long-term holders with buy pressure mechanics. Market Potential and Post-Launch Trajectory In addition to its presale achievements, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making headlines also for its anticipated performance after listing. According to conservative estimates, the token is worth $0.06 on the day of exchange debut, while bullish analysts are calling $3.50 a plausible target in 2025. This forecast is based on Mutuum’s special mtTokens, which accumulate interest over time, and its overcollateralized lending system that works to mitigate default risks. Defying speculative counterparts, implementing real-world utility, enabling decentralized borrowing, liquidity provisioning, and mtToken transfer across platforms which should underpin prolonged demand in line with broader adoption. The Final Push on Presale with Strong Security Assurance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its presale phases while its team completes the smart contract audit through Certik as a security measure for investors. Official published materials will present the project results once they are ready to reveal them under the framework of Mutuum Finance’s transparency policy. Phase 4 will reach its capacity which signals the end of affordable $0.03 token acquisition opportunities. The upcoming price increases during the phases will provide better value for initial investors. MUTM presented by Mutuum Finance delivers DeFi innovation and astute growth approaches creating a product that benefits investors in short-run returns and long-run asset value. The wide shifting trend toward utility-focused tokens in unpredictable crypto space becomes clear through MUTM’s rising popular demand in presale while showing market estimates of reaching $3.50. Real-world project investors looking for logical rewards should consider the present MUTM phase because it rises to a new price. Phase 4 Pricing Is Your Ticket to Secure MUTM Before the Next Bull Rally As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) accelerates in Phase 4, time is of the essence. Closely followed by Certik audit updates and exchange listings, the token’s course is sharply headbound. And as investors flock to profit from its 140% initial return — and potential 13,900% growth rate of 2025 — they have to act while Phase 4 is still open.

Stepping into this critical space, the Cardano Foundation has just announced a game-changing innovation: Veridian . This open-source digital identity platform, built on the robust foundation of blockchain technology, promises to redefine how individuals and organizations manage their online identities. Let’s dive deep into what Veridian offers and why it’s creating waves in the crypto and tech world. Introducing Veridian: A New Era for Digital Identity on the Blockchain Announced recently by The Block, Veridian is not just another digital tool; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem designed to empower users with control over their digital identity . Imagine a world where you can securely verify your credentials online without constantly surrendering personal information to centralized authorities. This is the vision behind Veridian. Developed by the Cardano Foundation, Veridian leverages the power of blockchain to offer a decentralized and secure platform. It’s built on the principles of: Decentralization: Shifting away from centralized identity providers, giving users more autonomy.

The release of the Veridian Wallet alongside the platform underscores the Cardano Foundation’s commitment to providing a complete and user-friendly experience. It bridges the gap between complex blockchain technology and everyday usability, making decentralized identity accessible to a wider audience. Cardano and Veridian: Strengthening Trust in the Digital Age Veridian’s role as an optional trust layer for the Cardano blockchain is significant. It signifies a strategic move to enhance the Cardano ecosystem by addressing a crucial aspect of digital interaction: trust. In the digital age, establishing trust online is often challenging. Veridian aims to simplify and secure this process. By serving as a trust layer, Veridian helps to: Enhance Security within the Cardano Ecosystem: Providing a secure and reliable way to verify identities within applications built on Cardano. Expand Use Cases for Cardano: Opening up new possibilities for Cardano in areas requiring robust identity verification, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Promote User Confidence: Giving users greater confidence in the security and privacy of their interactions within the Cardano network. The integration of Veridian with Cardano highlights the blockchain’s versatility and its potential to move beyond just cryptocurrency transactions. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can be applied to solve real-world problems, starting with the critical need for secure and decentralized identity solutions. Benefits of Veridian: Why This Blockchain Digital ID Matters The introduction of Veridian brings a host of benefits, making it a noteworthy development in the realm of blockchain and digital identity . For both individuals and organizations, Veridian offers compelling advantages: For Individuals: Increased Privacy: Greater control over personal data and reduced reliance on centralized identity providers. Enhanced Security: Protection against identity theft and fraud through advanced cryptography and decentralized architecture. Convenience: Streamlined online verification processes and easy management of digital credentials via the Veridian Wallet. Self-Sovereignty: True ownership and control over their digital identity.

Innovation: Opportunity to build innovative applications and services leveraging decentralized identity. Veridian is not just about technological advancement; it’s about empowering users and organizations with a more secure, private, and efficient way to manage digital identity in an increasingly interconnected world. Challenges and the Future of Blockchain-Based Digital Identity While Veridian represents a significant leap forward, the journey of blockchain -based digital identity is not without its challenges. Adoption, regulatory clarity, and user education are key hurdles that need to be addressed. Some of the challenges include: Adoption Barriers: Overcoming inertia and encouraging widespread adoption by both individuals and organizations. Regulatory Landscape: Navigating the evolving regulatory frameworks surrounding digital identity and blockchain technology. User Education: Educating users about the benefits and usage of decentralized identity solutions like Veridian.

Ethereum developers will most probably plan the upgrade for May 7. The Ethereum network may introduce the long-awaited Pectra upgrade on May 7. Until recently, the upgrade was expected around April 30. Pectra will be the biggest upgrade for Ethereum since the Dencun fork, which dramatically decreased fees for L2 projects. Ethereum developers pointed to May 7 as the confirmed date, though the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin are yet to speak on the Pectra upgrade. Pectra mainnet date confirmed May 7 Let's gooooo — nixo.eth 🦇🔊🥐 (@nixorokish) April 3, 2025 The decision for the set date arrived after a developer call on April 3. The readiness to launch Pectra on the mainnet follows the final test of the fork on the Hoodi testnet last week. The Pectra upgrade has a minor prediction pair, which has not been resolved yet. The prediction pair seeks to determine whether Pectra will launch by April 30. Despite the May 7 date, the prediction pair is only up to 84% probability for a ‘No’ answer. Pectra to affect all ecosystem participants The Pectra upgrade is a collection of several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), which will target multiple types of users. The upgrades will affect potential validators, L2 operators, and end users with Ethereum wallets. The potential validators will receive the chance to stake up to 2,048 ETH at a time for more efficient establishment of nodes. The larger stakes will help institutional players deal with a single validator instead of thousands of nodes with 32 ETH each. Staking activation will also be speeded up through EIP -6110. Two more proposals will ensure faster withdrawals for validators, as well as simplified exits with a smaller risk of loss. The second set of proposals affects L2 protocols and the way they use the L1 chain. Blob capacity per block will be doubled from 3 to 6 blobs. Pectra will also increase calldata costs, encouraging L2 to use more blobs. The blob schedule and flexibility will also offer more predictable fees. Currently, protocols pay close to zero rent to the L1, with days of sudden spikes in block fees and unexpected expenses. Ethereum’s EIP-2537 will also make L2 potentially cheaper and encourage cross-chain apps. The Pectra upgrade is yet to show if it will solve the problem of low earnings from L2, which pays minimal fees to Ethereum. EIP-7702 will be important for end users and general Ethereum adoption. The proposal will turn wallets into smart contracts, allowing for gas sponsorship, easier wallet-based tasks, and batch transactions. EIP-7702 will introduce smart wallet functionality, which may allow apps to onboard Ethereum users while sponsoring fees. Ethereum will also introduce a fourth transaction type, offering composable complex transactions for faster, more user-friendly swaps. Currently, Ethereum has three main types of transactions beyond legacy transfers, with dynamic transactions having the biggest share. The fourth type of transaction will allow every end user wallet to swap and approve in a single transaction, meaning each user wallet will behave like a smart contract. Pectra news fails to revive Ethereum sentiment Pectra has been one of the expectations for re-sparking interest in Ethereum. Despite the successful testnet upgrades, the price of ETH did not react to the news of the imminent fork coming in weeks. After the news, ETH felt more selling pressure, sinking to $1,774.56. The bearish mood also comes from slowing on-chain activity, as Ethereum is mostly used for simple ETH transactions and USDT transfers. Ethereum still had the biggest share of DEX activity and is the go-to chain for larger USDT transfers and perpetual futures trading. The Pectra upgrade is seen as one potential turning point for scaling ETH and inviting more app users. Ethereum has been losing revenues after years of peak fee production. For the past month, Ethereum only brought $20M in total fees, with a trend of diminishing returns for validators. More on-chain apps sponsoring gas for end users may revive the usage of Ethereum.

Talent Acquisition: To achieve its ambitious goals, Ultra needs a strong team.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction on March 13, preventing Genius Group from accessing its $150 million at-the-market funding and continuing its Bitcoin-first strategy .

In October 2024, Genius Group initiated arbitration to exit the agreement. By December, both companies had agreed to a preliminary injunction related to the APA. Fatbrain AI shareholders later filed lawsuits against the company and its executives, Michael Moe and Peter Ritz, alleging fraud in connection with the APA. The SEC also brought shareholder fraud allegations against Fatbrain AI, according to Genius Group. In response, Moe and Ritz sought a Temporary Restraining Order and a preliminary injunction against Genius Group, which the court granted on February 14.

The company also submitted a transcript of a meeting with Ritz, alleging he detailed a strategy to use the court order to extract money from Genius Group. Fatbrain AI shareholders have also filed this transcript in their lawsuit against Moe and Ritz in Florida, according to the note. Genius Group CEO Roger James Hamilton said the company did not anticipate that a U.S. court could restrict its financial decisions. “We never dreamed that it was possible that a U.S. court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds or buy Bitcoin – all actions that would normally be decided by a public company’s shareholders or Board rather than a court,” Hamilton said. The court order has forced Genius Group to restructure its operations, including downsizing, closing divisions, and halting sponsorships, marketing, and investments. The company has also been unable to issue share-based compensation to employees, which it says puts it in violation of Singaporean labor laws. “We will not bend to fraudsters and market manipulators that are themselves the subject of multiple lawsuits for fraud and misconduct,” Hamilton said. Since the restraining order, Genius Group’s share price has dropped 53%, and its market capitalization is now at 40% of its Bitcoin Treasury value. The company has filed an emergency motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn the injunction. Genius Group adopted a Bitcoin-first strategy in November 2024, aiming to hold Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset.

The… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 3, 2025 He believes the US will be forced to make significant investments in its own production capabilities, a process he warns will require painful short-term sacrifices. Post-Liberation Day market chaos Schiff’s forecast came against the backdrop of a global market bloodbath triggered by President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs on nearly all imports into the United States. Trump seems to have shaken up markets around the world, causing sharp drops in a number of measures. The S&P 500 fell 3.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,204 points, or 2.9%, in the early hours of Thursday. The Nasdaq fell 5.6%, which would be the worst day for it since March 2020. Europe’s STOXX 600 index tumbled 2.67%, and Germany’s DAX fell 3.08%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 sank 2.77%, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index down by 1.52%. Global investors fear that the tariffs could lead to retaliation from international trading partners, exacerbating an already fragile economic environment. In an X post today, British broadcaster Piers Morgan told followers that Trump’s tariff war could either be a “spectacular success” or a “total disaster,” adding that he had no clue which direction it would go. PREDICTION: President Trump’s global tariff war is either going to be a spectacular success or a total disaster. I have no clue which. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) April 2, 2025 Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square also commented on the market situation, saying: “ Sometimes the best strategy in a negotiation is convincing the other side that you are crazy. ” Morgan quoted Ackman’s post, replying with the word “true.” Late Wednesday, Schiff called out Republican Senators for not supporting Senator Rand Paul’s stance against Trump’s tariff strategy. He reckoned that the tariffs, while perhaps well-intentioned, would ultimately harm the very people they were meant to protect. “ Are there no other Republicans willing to help Trump understand that while well-intentioned, his tariffs are wrong? ” the 62-year-old gold asset manager asked . In his earlier posts, Schiff asserted that the world doesn’t need Americans to buy products; rather, it is Americans who need the world to make products. “There are consumers all over the world eager to buy what Americans can no longer afford. As the US dollar falls and their own currencies rise, that is precisely what will happen,” he concluded. Oil prices, dollar index nosedive, Gold climbs US oil futures dropped 7.59%, settling at $66.27 a barrel, marking their worst day since July 2022. Similarly, Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 6.95%. Analysts believe the fears surrounding President Trump’s trade war, compounded by concerns that the global economy would slow, could have reduced the demand for oil. US-based companies that depend on international supply chains also felt the effects of the tariffs. Apple’s stock dropped by 8%, Nike’s plunged by 10.72%, and both Best Buy and Ralph Lauren shed off over 14%. According to TradingEconomics data , the US dollar index plummeted nearly 2% to 101.8, its steepest single-day decline in over two years and reaching its lowest point in six months.

But is this narrative starting to crumble? Recent analysis from JPMorgan suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment, with traditional gold regaining its shine as the preferred safe haven. Are investors losing faith in Bitcoin’s ability to weather economic storms? Let’s dive into why Bitcoin might be losing its luster compared to the timeless appeal of gold. Bitcoin vs Gold: The Safe Haven Showdown The core of the argument lies in the contrasting performances of Bitcoin and gold in the current market. JPMorgan analysts point to Bitcoin’s increasing volatility and its strong correlation with tech stocks as key reasons for its weakening status as ‘digital gold’. This means when tech stocks wobble, Bitcoin often follows suit, diminishing its appeal as a diversifier and safe haven asset . On the other hand, physical gold is experiencing a resurgence, drawing investors seeking stability amidst market turbulence, according to a report by The Block. Here’s a quick comparison: Asset Perceived Role Current Trend JPMorgan’s View Bitcoin ‘Digital Gold’, Inflation Hedge ETF Outflows, Price Volatility Weakening ‘digital gold’ status due to tech stock correlation and volatility. Gold Traditional Safe Haven, Inflation Hedge ETF Inflows, Price Stability Gaining favor as a safer hedge. Why Are Investors Shifting to Traditional Safe Haven Assets? The shift towards gold reflects a broader investor concern: risk. In times of economic uncertainty, investors typically flock to assets perceived as less risky and more stable. Gold has a long history as a store of value, acting as a buffer against inflation and currency debasement. While Bitcoin aimed to modernize this concept, its inherent volatility and relatively short history are now being scrutinized. The recent outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs and inflows into gold ETFs are tangible evidence of this investor rotation towards established safe haven assets . Economic Uncertainty: Global economic headwinds and inflation concerns are pushing investors towards safer bets. Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin’s price swings are significantly higher than gold, making it less appealing for risk-averse investors in turbulent times. Tech Stock Correlation: Bitcoin’s price movements are increasingly linked to tech stocks, diluting its diversification benefits. Traditional Appeal of Gold: Gold’s long-standing reputation as a store of value and safe haven provides psychological comfort and historical precedent. Is Bitcoin Still a Viable Investment Hedge? Despite the current headwinds, Bitcoin’s role as an investment hedge isn’t entirely negated. It’s crucial to understand the nuances. While Bitcoin might not be behaving exactly like ‘digital gold’ in the short term, its long-term potential as a diversifier and a hedge against specific types of risks (like monetary policy mismanagement in the long run) remains relevant. However, for investors seeking immediate, reliable protection against broader market downturns, gold appears to be the current preference. The key takeaway is that the effectiveness of any investment hedge depends on the specific economic environment and investor risk tolerance. Decoding JPMorgan Bitcoin Analysis: What Does it Mean for Investors? JPMorgan’s JPMorgan Bitcoin analysis offers valuable insights into Bitcoin’s current valuation. They estimate Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted value to be around $71,000. This suggests that while Bitcoin may have long-term potential, its inherent risk profile needs to be considered. Furthermore, JPMorgan identifies $62,000 as a historical price floor for Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin won’t go below this level, but it indicates a price point where Bitcoin has historically found strong support. Investors should interpret JPMorgan Bitcoin analysis not as definitive price predictions, but as informed perspectives on Bitcoin’s valuation and risk factors, guiding their investment decisions with a more nuanced understanding. Key points from JPMorgan’s analysis: Risk-Adjusted Value: Around $71,000, highlighting the need to account for Bitcoin’s volatility. Historical Price Floor: $62,000, indicating a potential support level. Weakening ‘Digital Gold’ Status: Emphasizing the shift towards gold due to Bitcoin’s tech stock correlation. Focus on Volatility: Highlighting volatility as a major factor impacting Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal. The Persistent Challenge of Bitcoin Volatility Ultimately, Bitcoin volatility remains a significant hurdle in its quest to become a universally accepted ‘digital gold’ and a true safe haven. While volatility can offer opportunities for high returns, it also deters investors seeking stability and security, particularly in uncertain economic climates. Until Bitcoin’s price swings become less dramatic, it will likely continue to be viewed by many as a risk-on asset rather than a reliable safe haven like gold. Addressing Bitcoin volatility is crucial for its long-term adoption as a mainstream investment and a credible alternative to traditional safe haven assets. Factors contributing to Bitcoin’s volatility: Market Maturity: Bitcoin is still a relatively young asset class compared to gold. Speculative Trading: A significant portion of Bitcoin trading is driven by speculation, leading to amplified price movements. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations across different jurisdictions can impact market sentiment and price. Market Sentiment: News and social media trends can have a disproportionate impact on Bitcoin’s price due to its retail-driven market. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Bitcoin and Gold The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is currently facing a strong challenge as investors seemingly prefer the traditional allure of gold amidst market uncertainties. JPMorgan’s analysis underscores this shift, highlighting Bitcoin’s volatility and tech stock correlation as factors diminishing its safe-haven appeal. While Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains, for now, gold is reclaiming its throne as the king of safe-haven assets. This doesn’t necessarily signal the end of Bitcoin’s journey, but rather a recalibration of its role in the investment landscape. The competition between Bitcoin and gold as stores of value and hedges is likely to continue, and the ultimate winner may depend on how Bitcoin addresses its volatility challenges and matures as an asset class.

In an April 2 committee session, lawmakers voted 27-22 in favor of passing the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. The bill was one of five the committee considered in a markup hearing discussing possible amendments. Lawmakers also approved a bill regulating payment stablecoins, setting up the legislation for a full House vote. “Last Congress, this bill passed out of the House of Representatives by a 216-192 vote,” said Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer, the anti-CBDC bill’s sponsor. “So far this Congress, this bill has 114 cosponsors and support from groups ranging from the Independent Community Bankers Association and the American Bankers Association to Club for Growth, Heritage Action, and the Blockchain Association.” Many Republican lawmakers have targeted institutions like the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department from exploring CBDC development, often citing financial privacy concerns. After reintroducing the bill in March, Rep. Emmer suggested it was an attempt to codify an executive order from US President Donald Trump into law. That order, signed on Jan. 23 , prohibited “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a CBDC in the United States.

His routine consisted of long boring days of sitting in a chair engaging in monotonous maintenance work, reconfiguring systems, and resetting passwords for users who’d forgotten them. It was the kind of job where a problem occurring that actually requires you to engage your attention in a meaningful way is so rare an occurrence that you wind up sitting around hoping for something like that to happen most of the time. Stu spent most days just browsing through Reddit threads during his copious amounts of downtime. But this turned out to not be such a bad scenario in the end, as this was how Stu found himself pulled into the Bitcoin space around 2017. Like many Bitcoiners, or rather soon-to-be Bitcoiners, back in that period, Stu got sucked into the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and altcoin frenzy of the time. Also, like many Bitcoiners around that time, he wound up getting burned financially by some bad investments in random unknown projects in which he probably shouldn’t have invested in the first place. Inevitably the gravity of Bitcoin pulled him down the proverbial rabbit hole. After a few years of learning more deeply about Bitcoin, Stu hit a period of frenzy and quit his job at the peak of the 2021 bull market to look for opportunities to work in the Bitcoin space. By that time the programming language Rust had become widely used in different Bitcoin projects and libraries, so Stu began learning it so that he could contribute to Bitcoin. Towards the end of 2022, his search for a job in the space ended when he was hired by Michael Tildwell to work at ZBD , a company that integrates bitcoin payments into videogames using the Lightning Network. Working At ZBD Stu worked DevOps at ZBD, but in his free time he kept working at prototype Rust projects. “Most of my side projects are related to what I was interested in at the time, as I was working at ZBD I started making games that could use bitcoin,” Stu told Bitcoin Magazine. To start, he built a multiplayer web game, rain.run , based around players collecting lightning bolts for rewards in satoshis, to get more familiar with building applications that have to talk to each other over a network. Afterwards he built a simple connect4 game played over the Nostr protocol. “[This] was a great way to learn how Nostr worked,” said Stu. “I attended btc++ in Austin in 2024, which was the Script edition.” The four day conference was the most dense forum for discussion around Bitcoin script improvements and covenants in the last year or so. “There seemed to be, at the time, some kind of consensus developing for covenants on Bitcoin,” recalled Stu. “This got me really interested in how Bitcoin script worked and [led] me to experimenting with Taproot and Bitcoin scripts…” he added. “I didn’t really end up with much but it was a great way to learn how scripts worked.” TABConf, Payment Pools, and CTV In 2024, Stu attended TABConf, another developer-focused conference, which is held yearly in Atlanta, Georgia. The conversations in Atlanta also revolved heavily around covenants. Like all developer-focused conferences, TABConf put on a hackathon. Stu chose to build a project using Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which enabled users to bet on the outcome of chess matches. It became very obvious to Stu that building software around pre-signing large numbers of transactions introduced a lot of complexity for developers. Discussing this issue, he said: “The answer to this problem seemed to be CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) . As I wanted to learn more about covenants, CTV seemed like a good place to start, so I started integrating CTV into my DLC chess project. I couldn’t believe how simple it made everything…” Stu went on to build a proof-of-concept prototype of a Payment Pool using CTV. Payment pools are a very basic layer 2 system where groups of larger than two share control over a single unspent bitcoin output. “One way we can scale bitcoin to be used by everyone, without using centralized third parties, is for users to share UTXO’s,” he said when asked why he chose to work on a proof-of-concept for a payment pool. “Payment pools are a great way to do this, especially alongside other layer 2 solutions such as Lightning or Ark.” Covenants Covenants have become a contentious issue in the discussion about where to take Bitcoin going forward. Every developer has their personal opinion on them, and Stu is no exception. “I think using covenants to replace pre-signed transactions alone is an amazing improvement for developers to build faster and safer,” he said. “It removes a lot of interactivity and friction for users, so there is less need for them to be online or coordinate with other parties, which can improve the user experience by a great deal.” I asked him if this is what drew him to building proof-of-concepts and prototypes using CTV as opposed to other covenant proposals. “I was drawn to CTV because it was so simple to implement in the applications I wanted to build. Once I built the payment pool with CTV, I was planning on doing the same for all covenant proposals. I figured out how to get the exact same functionality with CAT, but it just took a very long time to get working, and added way more code. The Bitcoin script was like 50 lines of code, compared to CTV with like 3 lines.” “I’m pretty sure there is consensus between protocol developers that there is no risk to Bitcoin if we enabled CTV…” he said. “…so the argument now seems to be that the users don’t want it. But the users are already using applications and protocols such as Lightning and multisig vaults that would be improved by CTV. So…I think it should be the priority for the next soft fork…” When asked about the current contentious nature of the discussion around covenants and the next soft fork, and how the atmosphere could be improved, he had this to say: “Someone needs to get Saylor to tweet a sandwich emoji and everything will be good.” “But seriously, I don’t really know. Maybe more in person events where people can discuss face to face would help. It doesn’t seem like much of a technical reason that we aren’t making progress, more of a political one,” he went on to say in a more serious tone. “I think some of the hesitance is more around making any change at all to Bitcoin. The reason it is so hard to change is an amazing property of Bitcoin, but it doesn’t have to extend to soft forks quite so much. It causes a lot of stress for certain Bitcoin developers, especially Bitcoin Core maintainers. Everyone is waiting on their opinion on the next fork, which seems to make them hesitant on joining in the conversation at all, which makes it hard to get consensus on any new change,” he said. The Future Stu recently participated in the Bitcoin Open Source Software (BOSS) program by Chaincode Labs, a program designed as a way for developers new to the Bitcoin ecosystem to cut their teeth and quickly develop a deeper understanding of and experience with building on Bitcoin. Going forward Stu is going to contribute to the Char Network, a somewhat off the radar effort to build a new bitcoin staking platform led by Jeremy Rubin, the developer who designed and proposed CTV. He plans to continue working on his personal side projects and contributing to open source projects as well, with the eventual goal of starting to contribute to Bitcoin Core itself. Stu had this to say about Bitcoiners’ priorities going into the future: “Our number one focus should be on making self custody better. It really sucks right now, and I think more Bitcoiners in general need to admit that. Backing up 12 words does sound simple, but it really isn’t that easy, and no one is doing it.” This post Covenants, CTV, And Making Things Easier For Developers first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Shinobi .",BUILDERS|FEATURED|CAT|Char Network|Covenants|CTV|Payment Pools,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TOKEN SALE|FORKS,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-04-03 17:59:05

42862370,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146020,1743703255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Deutsche Bank Signals Imminent US Dollar Confidence Crisis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-confidence-crisis-deutsche-bank/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! A major tremor is potentially heading our way from the traditional financial world. Deutsche Bank, a financial titan, has just sounded the alarm bells, warning of a possible confidence crisis in the mighty US dollar. For those of us navigating the volatile yet exciting crypto landscape, understanding these traditional market shifts is crucial. Could this dollar wobble be the next big catalyst for digital assets? Let’s dive deep into what Deutsche Bank is saying and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Dollar Confidence Crisis What exactly is a dollar confidence crisis ? In simple terms, it’s when global investors and institutions start losing faith in the US dollar as a stable store of value and a reliable reserve currency. This isn’t just about exchange rates fluctuating; it’s a fundamental shift in perception that can have far-reaching consequences across the entire global economy . Think of it like this: if the foundation of a building (the dollar) starts to crack, everything built upon it feels the strain. A confidence crisis isn’t a sudden event but rather a gradual erosion of trust. It manifests in several ways: Decreased demand for US dollar-denominated assets: Foreign investors might start selling off US Treasury bonds and other dollar assets, seeking safer or more lucrative alternatives. Weakening dollar exchange rate: As demand falls, the dollar’s value against other currencies could decline significantly. Increased volatility in financial markets: Uncertainty about the dollar’s future can trigger turbulence in stock markets, bond markets, and commodity markets. Shift towards alternative currencies: Nations and businesses might explore using other currencies for trade and reserves, potentially including digital currencies. This isn’t just theoretical doomsday talk. History is filled with examples of currency crises that have reshaped economies and geopolitical landscapes. Remember the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s or the more recent currency turmoil in various emerging markets? While the US dollar’s position is unique, no currency is immune to losing confidence if underlying economic fundamentals and policy decisions falter. Why is Deutsche Bank Ringing the Alarm on Dollar Confidence? So, why is Deutsche Bank , a major player in global finance, specifically highlighting this risk now? Their analysis likely stems from a confluence of factors that are currently putting pressure on the US dollar. These factors aren’t isolated incidents; they’re interconnected threads weaving a complex narrative of potential economic vulnerability. Mounting US Debt: The US national debt is at historically high levels, and persistent budget deficits raise concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability. Investors worry about the government’s ability to manage this debt, especially in a rising interest rate environment. Inflationary Pressures: While inflation has shown signs of cooling recently, the prolonged period of high inflation has eroded the dollar’s purchasing power. If inflation re-accelerates or remains stubbornly high, it could further undermine confidence. Geopolitical Tensions: Global uncertainties, such as the war in Ukraine, rising tensions in Asia, and fractured international relations, can lead to a flight to safety. Traditionally, the dollar has benefited from this. However, if geopolitical risks are perceived as stemming from or impacting the US itself, it could backfire and weaken dollar appeal. De-dollarization Trend: There’s growing discussion and some evidence of countries, particularly those outside the Western sphere of influence, exploring alternatives to the US dollar for trade and reserves. While not an immediate threat, this trend, if it gains momentum, could chip away at the dollar’s dominance over time. Monetary Policy Missteps: Perceived errors in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, whether being too slow or too aggressive in tackling inflation, can also damage confidence in the dollar. Uncertainty about the future direction of interest rates adds to the unease. Deutsche Bank’s alert isn’t just a random prediction; it’s a calculated assessment based on these macroeconomic indicators and global trends. They are essentially saying that the conditions are ripe for a potential shift in sentiment towards the dollar, which could trigger a significant confidence crisis. Impact on Financial Markets: What Could Unfold? If a US dollar crisis were to materialize, the ripple effects across financial markets would be substantial. It’s not just about currency traders; this could impact everything from your stock portfolio to commodity prices, and yes, significantly, the crypto market. Here’s a potential breakdown of the market reactions: Market Potential Impact during Dollar Confidence Crisis Stock Markets Increased volatility and potential downturn. Companies with significant international operations might see earnings impacted by currency fluctuations. Domestic-focused companies might fare relatively better, but overall market sentiment would likely be negative. Bond Markets US Treasury yields could rise as investors demand higher returns to compensate for dollar risk. However, there could also be a paradoxical flight to safety into US Treasuries initially, before the confidence crisis truly takes hold. Corporate bond spreads would likely widen, reflecting increased credit risk. Commodity Markets Commodities priced in dollars, like oil and gold, could see price increases in dollar terms as the dollar weakens. Gold, often seen as a safe-haven asset, could experience a significant surge in demand and price. Forex Markets Major currency pairs involving the US dollar would experience heightened volatility. Currencies perceived as safe havens or alternatives to the dollar, such as the Swiss Franc or potentially the Euro, could strengthen. Cryptocurrency Markets This is where it gets particularly interesting for crypto enthusiasts. A dollar confidence crisis could be a significant tailwind for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. As faith in the dollar wanes, investors may seek alternative stores of value and hedges against traditional financial system instability. It’s crucial to remember that these are potential scenarios, and the actual market reactions could be more complex and nuanced. However, the general direction of impact suggests a shift away from dollar-centric assets and potentially towards alternatives, including crypto. Crypto as a Potential Beneficiary: A Silver Lining? For the cryptocurrency world, a dollar confidence crisis could ironically present a unique opportunity. Why? Because cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as decentralized, inflation-resistant alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. In a world where faith in the established financial order is shaken, the core value proposition of crypto becomes even more compelling. Here’s how a dollar crisis could potentially benefit crypto: Safe Haven Narrative Strengthens: Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” could gain significant traction. Investors seeking to escape dollar-related uncertainty might flock to Bitcoin as a store of value outside the traditional banking system. Increased Institutional Adoption: If large institutions and corporations start questioning the dollar’s stability, they might be more inclined to explore allocating a portion of their reserves to cryptocurrencies as a hedge. Catalyst for De-dollarization in Crypto: While most crypto trading is currently still paired against the dollar, a confidence crisis could accelerate the development and adoption of non-dollar crypto trading pairs and stablecoins pegged to other currencies or assets. Boost for DeFi and Decentralized Finance: The principles of decentralization and disintermediation that underpin DeFi become even more attractive when the centralized financial system faces a crisis of confidence. However, it’s also essential to acknowledge that a broader global economy downturn, which could be triggered or exacerbated by a dollar crisis, might initially negatively impact all asset classes, including crypto. Risk-off sentiment could lead to a temporary “dash for cash,” even out of crypto. But, in the medium to long term, the fundamental case for crypto as an alternative financial system could be significantly strengthened. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights So, what should you, as a crypto investor or enthusiast, do with this information? Panic selling is rarely the answer. Instead, informed preparedness and strategic positioning are key. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic indicators, Deutsche Bank’s reports, and commentary from other financial institutions. Understanding the evolving situation is your first line of defense. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including crypto, stocks, and potentially precious metals, can help mitigate risk. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with high volatility, or are you more risk-averse? Adjust your portfolio allocation accordingly. A potential dollar crisis could bring significant volatility to all markets. Consider Dollar-Hedged Crypto Strategies: Explore stablecoins pegged to currencies other than the US dollar, or strategies that aim to reduce dollar exposure within your crypto portfolio. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are inevitable. A dollar confidence crisis, if it occurs, could be a disruptive event, but it might also present long-term opportunities for those who are prepared and patient. Deutsche Bank’s warning is a stark reminder that the global financial landscape is constantly evolving, and the dominance of any single currency is not guaranteed forever. For the crypto world, this could be a watershed moment – a test of its resilience and a potential catalyst for wider adoption. It’s time to pay attention, stay informed, and position ourselves strategically for whatever the future holds.

Bitcoin pre-seed transactions increased 50% year-over-year in 2024, with a 27.5% year-over-year increase in the number of startup companies funded. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director, attributed the increased deals to the robust security of the BTC network: ""Many entrepreneurs across crypto are revisiting the Bitcoin stack as the long-term place to build their companies. It makes perfect sense: The objectively most secure, reliable, and decentralized blockchain is the obvious platform of choice."" However, the capital raised in Bitcoin pre-seed funding rounds declined by over 22% in 2024, with the median funding round size and the median startup valuation steadily declining from 2021 to 2023. Median valuations for pre-seed Bitcoin startups fail to reclaim 2021 levels. Source: Trammell Venture Partners The value of funding rounds reclaimed some lost ground in 2024 but failed to reach highs established during the previous bull cycle in 2021, primarily due to unclear crypto regulations in the United States under the previous Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership. More recently, macroeconomic uncertainty due to fears of a prolonged trade war , relatively high interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in the United States have also eroded the risk appetite for speculative assets like crypto. Total number of funding deals and unique Bitcoin startup companies has steadily risen since 2021.

However, the executive warned that macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical turmoil could increase price volatility and disrupt the trend brought on by positive regulatory tailwinds. On April 2, US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tariff order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on import goods from all countries and a regime of reciprocal trade tariffs on trading partners that sent financial markets tumbling .

The news sent its native token, Treasure (MAGIC), plunging 18% in 24 hours, worsening a months-long downtrend. How Treasure DAO Got Here Treasure DAO gained early traction as a decentralized gaming hub, using its MAGIC token to fund game development and partnerships. However, financial mismanagement and unsustainable costs have brought the project to its knees. In a video shared on X, John Patten, the DAO’s chief contributor, revealed that the organization’s annual expenses have surpassed $8 million, while only $2.4 million in stablecoins remain in its treasury. Several issues caused the financial troubles, including high labor costs totaling $6.1 million per year and infrastructure expenses of $800,000. Furthermore, the project had given out grants denominated in U.S. dollars but paid in MAGIC, which became increasingly burdensome as the token’s value dropped. To correct the situation, the DAO proposed shutting down Treasure Chain, which consumes most of the infrastructure expenses and is deemed too costly to maintain. It will also look to recover $785,000 in idle funds from market maker Flowdesk to extend the treasury’s runway. According to Patten, the treasury would have been depleted by mid-2025 without the drastic cuts. The project will now focus on four core products: the NFT marketplace, which was hacked in 2022, Bridgeworld, Smolworld, and AI agent scaling. Community and Market Reaction Treasure DAO’s announcement sparked some outrage across social media, with community members questioning its transparency and leadership. One Discord user expressed frustration, saying, “Just a few weeks ago, it was all hype and optimism, and now this? What was being hidden behind the scenes?” Others, like Intrepidus.eth, expressed broader disillusionment with crypto projects, lamenting, “Most of those guys don’t know how to run a bloody company… really tired of crypto and the hype.” Some speculated whether the Treasure team had been dumping MAGIC ahead of the news, further eroding trust. The token’s market performance has mirrored the ongoing turmoil, dumping 18.3% in the last 24 hours. Its current price of $0.08316 is almost 99% below its all-time high of $6.32, achieved in February 2022. The downturn is even more pronounced across longer timeframes, with a 41.6% drop in the past week and a 53.7% plunge over the last 30 days. MAGIC is also down 91.4% across one year, reflecting a prolonged loss of confidence.

Glassnode says that the one-month and six-month volume-weighted average price (VWAP) metrics are signaling that Bitcoin may enter a months-long downtrend. VWAP represents the average traded price of an asset over a specific period, taking into account both volume and price. “An on-chain analog to the ‘death cross’ has emerged. The 30-day volume-weighted price of BTC has crossed below the 180-day, signaling weakening momentum. Historically, this pattern preceded three to six months of bearish trends.” Source: Glassnode/X A traditional death cross in technical analysis occurs when the 50-day moving average (MA) drops below the 200-day MA and is used to identify a weakening market. Glassnode further explains its methodology in a blog post, suggesting it provides a relatively better measurement of market sentiment than the traditional death cross method. “To bring this [death cross] concept into the on-chain domain, we construct an analog using on-chain volume-weighted prices for coins moved in the last one month compared to the last six months. This method directly reflects market sentiment by factoring in both when and how much capital actually moves on-chain.” Bitcoin is trading for $82,040 at time of writing, down 5.4% in the last 24 hours.

The crypto markets also heated up, recording more than $500 million in liquidation. The bearish waves rolled out within the markets due to Trump’s tariffs impacting the global markets. The trading volume spiked, increasing the selling pressure, while the market cap dipped close to $2.63 trillion. Will Bitcoin Rise to $250K, or Will Macro Headwinds Hold Some Dominance? Ever since the tariffs were announced, the markets began to experience massive selling pressure due to a notable rise in uncertainty. While gold prices continue to mark new highs, the strength of the US dollar has been constantly plunging. The DXY Index faced a massive 2.83% pullback while still holding above the crucial support at 100. As seen in the above chart, the DXY Index seems to be in deep trouble as the DXY has printed massive bearish candles not seen in recent history. This could be a massive bullish signal for Bitcoin and the crypto markets, as the investors may find them a haven asset compared to the USD. On the other hand, the BTC hash rate has surged and marked a new ATH at around 975.96M, hinting towards an increased mining activity that sheds light on the bullish market sentiments. The rise in the BTC hash rate suggests a more secured network that could boost the investor’s confidence. Despite the bullish signals, the BTC price is believed to break the crucial support as the star token may face a death cross soon. Where’s Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Heading Next? It is quite evident that the selling pressure has been mounting over the BTC price rally over the past few days. As a result, the support at $81,000 will be tested anytime from now. However, an extended pullback to $80,000 is expected to confirm a bearish pattern, which could drive the price below the range. As seen in the above chart, the 50/200-day MAs are heading towards a bearish crossover while the price is experiencing equal bullish and bearish pressure. If the seller’s dominance continues to prevail, the BTC price is expected to form new bottoms for the year that could further trigger a strong recovery phase, reclaiming the lost resistance levels above $85,000. This suggests Bitcoin is about to offer a good buying opportunity in the coming days, probably below $79,000.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-03 18:06:56

Just when market jitters caused by fresh U.S. tariff announcements threatened to send the entire crypto sphere into a tailspin, a fascinating twist is emerging. Remember that sharp dip that saw Bitcoin momentarily retreat from $88,000 to $82,000? Well, buckle up, because market analysts are now suggesting that this very dip might be the golden opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Let’s dive deep into why the recent tariff-induced turbulence could actually be paving the way for Bitcoin’s next big leap. Navigating Market Uncertainty: Is Bitcoin the Safe Haven? The recent U.S. tariff announcements acted like a sudden tremor, sending ripples of market uncertainty across global equities and the crypto market alike. Bitcoin, often touted as a decentralized alternative asset, wasn’t immune, experiencing a notable correction. According to reports from The Block, the flagship cryptocurrency saw a temporary pullback from its lofty heights. However, seasoned market observers are interpreting this volatility not as a sign of weakness, but rather as a classic market overreaction to policy shifts. Here’s a breakdown of what triggered the initial market unease: Tariff Announcements: New tariffs from the U.S. can create anxieties about global trade, economic growth, and potential inflationary pressures. These macroeconomic concerns often lead investors to reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Market Reaction: The knee-jerk reaction in financial markets is often to sell first and ask questions later. This initial sell-off can exacerbate price drops, creating a ripple effect across various asset classes. Crypto Market Sensitivity: The cryptocurrency market, still considered relatively nascent compared to traditional finance, can exhibit heightened sensitivity to global economic news and policy changes. However, the dust is starting to settle, and analysts are now focusing on the silver linings. The clarity brought by the U.S. policy direction, even if initially unsettling, is removing a layer of ambiguity that had been weighing on the markets. This newfound clarity, paradoxically, is being viewed as a potential catalyst for renewed growth, especially for Bitcoin. Analysts Signal a Prime Bitcoin Investment Opportunity Amidst the receding waves of tariff-induced panic, a chorus of expert voices is highlighting a compelling investment opportunity in Bitcoin. Leading analysts from firms like BRN and 21Shares are pointing towards a resurgence of institutional interest in Bitcoin, suggesting that smart money is viewing the recent dip as a strategic entry point. This perspective hinges on the idea that the fundamental drivers for Bitcoin’s long-term growth remain firmly in place, and the tariff-related sell-off was merely a temporary detour. Here’s what analysts are emphasizing: Institutional Re-entry: After observing the market’s reaction and reassessing their strategies, institutional investors are reportedly showing renewed appetite for Bitcoin. This influx of institutional capital can provide significant upward pressure on prices. Anticipated Rebound to $90,000: Analysts are expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to not only recover its recent losses but also to regain momentum towards the coveted $90,000 mark. This target reflects a belief in Bitcoin’s underlying strength and its potential for further appreciation. Long-Term Fundamentals Intact: Despite short-term market fluctuations, the core reasons for Bitcoin’s value proposition – its decentralized nature, limited supply, and growing adoption – remain unchanged. Analysts believe these fundamentals will continue to drive Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin ETFs: A Beacon of Strong Demand Adding further fuel to the bullish narrative is the continued positive performance of Bitcoin ETFs . Despite the broader market turbulence, spot Bitcoin ETFs have consistently witnessed inflows, indicating robust underlying demand for Bitcoin exposure through these regulated investment vehicles. These inflows serve as a tangible metric of investor confidence and underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Key takeaways regarding Bitcoin ETFs: Consistent Inflows: Even during periods of price volatility, Bitcoin ETFs have maintained a steady stream of inflows. This demonstrates a commitment from investors to allocate capital to Bitcoin for the long haul. Accessibility and Regulation: Bitcoin ETFs offer investors a convenient and regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. This accessibility is attracting a wider range of investors, including institutional players and retail investors who prefer traditional investment instruments. Market Confidence Indicator: The sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can be interpreted as a strong signal of market confidence in Bitcoin’s future prospects, even amidst external economic uncertainties. Ethereum’s Divergent Path: A Tale of Two Cryptos? While Bitcoin appears to be weathering the tariff storm and garnering renewed bullish sentiment, its closest counterpart, Ethereum, presents a slightly different picture. In stark contrast to Bitcoin ETF inflows, Ethereum has been grappling with outflows and relatively weak demand. This divergence highlights a potentially shifting dynamic within the crypto market, where Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a more resilient and established store of value, while Ethereum faces its own set of challenges. Factors contributing to Ethereum’s current situation: Outflows and Weak Demand: Ethereum has experienced outflows, suggesting a degree of investor hesitancy or a preference for other crypto assets, potentially including Bitcoin, in the current market climate. Focus on Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative: In times of economic uncertainty, investors often gravitate towards assets perceived as safe havens. Bitcoin’s narrative as a digital gold and store of value may be resonating more strongly during periods of market turbulence. Ethereum’s Evolving Landscape: Ethereum is undergoing significant technological upgrades and grappling with evolving use cases. This period of transition might be contributing to some investor uncertainty compared to Bitcoin’s more established role. It’s crucial to note that this isn’t necessarily a long-term indictment of Ethereum. The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and Ethereum’s innovative ecosystem continues to develop. However, in the immediate aftermath of the tariff shock, Bitcoin seems to be emerging as the preferred choice for investors seeking stability and potential upside. Crypto Volatility: A Sign of Robust Adoption, Not Weakness Adding a final layer of perspective to the discussion, a Kraken economist astutely points out that the inherent crypto adoption is intrinsically linked to its volatility. Rather than viewing price swings as a sign of fundamental weakness, they argue that volatility is a natural byproduct of a maturing and increasingly adopted asset class. As more participants enter the crypto market, including institutional investors and retail adopters with varying investment horizons and risk appetites, price fluctuations are to be expected. Understanding volatility in the context of adoption: Maturing Market Dynamics: The crypto market is transitioning from its early stages to a more mature phase. This maturation process involves increased participation, diverse trading strategies, and a wider range of market influences, all contributing to volatility. Price Discovery and Adoption Curve: Volatility is often a feature of assets undergoing price discovery and rapid adoption. As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain broader acceptance and integration into the global financial system, price swings are likely to remain a characteristic feature. Long-Term Growth Potential: While volatility can be unsettling in the short term, it’s important to remember that it’s often associated with high-growth assets. The potential for significant returns in the crypto market is inherently linked to its dynamic and sometimes volatile nature. In essence, embrace the volatility! It’s part of the crypto journey. For those with a long-term investment horizon and a stomach for price fluctuations, these periods of volatility can present valuable buying opportunities, as highlighted by the current analyst sentiment. The Road Ahead: Bitcoin Poised for a Rebound? In conclusion, while the U.S. tariff announcements initially sent shivers through the crypto market, the emerging narrative is one of resilience and opportunity. Analysts are confidently pointing towards a potential Bitcoin rebound, fueled by renewed institutional interest, consistent ETF inflows, and a recognition that market volatility is a natural part of crypto’s growth story. While Ethereum navigates its own path, Bitcoin appears poised to capitalize on the current market landscape, potentially setting its sights once again on the $90,000 milestone. Keep a close watch on the market dynamics, as the coming weeks could be pivotal for Bitcoin’s next chapter.

This marks a key development in the financial industry, as Fidelity seeks to list its Solana ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The acknowledgment comes after Fidelity submitted a proposed rule change, paving the way for the potential approval of the product. Fidelity’s Spot Solana ETF Proposal The SEC’s acknowledgment follows Fidelity’s filing to list and trade shares of the Fidelity Solana Fund under the Cboe BZX Exchange. The proposed rule change, initially submitted on March 25, was later amended on April 1, 2025, to clarify certain points and add additional details. The amended proposal aims to list the Solana ETF under BZX Rule, which pertains to commodity-based trust shares. According to the Cboe BZX Exchange, Fidelity plans to register the shares with the SEC through a registration statement on Form S-1. Fidelity’s experience with crypto ETFs, having launched the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), has prepared it for this new initiative.

Cango agreed to sell its legacy Chinese auto financing business to Ursalpha Digital Limited in a $352 million deal, according to the report. Additionally, Bitmain is reportedly transferring 32 exahashes per second (EH/s) to Cango. The deal effectively brings Bitmain’s mining assets to the public market, The Miner Mag said. Exahashes measure a miner’s contribution to the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, the total computing power securing the network. The Miner Mag said Ursalpha Digital Limited has the same corporate address and founding director as Antalpha, an entity ultimately controlled by the chairman of Bitcoin miner Bitmain.

According to Bloomberg, Bitmain has a working relationship with American Bitcoin , a Trump-family-affiliated mining entity created in March as part of a deal with Hut 8, a provider of power and computing infrastructure. On March 31, Hut 8 bought a majority ownership interest in American Bitcoin (formerly American Data Centers), whose founders include US President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Hut 8 has transferred its Bitcoin mining equipment to American Bitcoin, which is reportedly mulling an initial public offering (IPO), according to Bloomberg. The companies said that American Bitcoin will focus on crypto mining, while Hut 8 targets data center infrastructure for applications such as high-performance computing. In 2025, Bitcoin mining stocks have struggled amid declining cryptocurrency prices and pressure on business models caused by the Bitcoin network’s April halving, according to a JPMorgan research note shared with Cointelegraph. Every four years, the amount of BTC mined per “block” — a bundle of transaction data stored on the chain — is cut in half. April’s halving slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.

I find this work extremely meaningful,” CZ tweeted on the news.

42865245,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62792,1743707500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says XRP Will Explode If This Happens,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-will-explode-if-this-happens/,"A well-regarded figure in the XRP community has emphasized that speculative enthusiasm alone is insufficient to drive long-term price appreciation for the token. Despite recent promising developments , the token has remained under downward pressure, prompting discussions about what could lead to a sustained price increase. Currently priced at $2.03, XRP has yet to experience a significant rally despite major industry events such as the resolution of Ripple’s legal case , speculation about its inclusion in a U.S. strategic reserve , and multiple ETF applications. However, an analyst operating the “XRP Investing” account argues that only real-world utility and adoption can fuel lasting growth. HYPE WON’T MOVE XRP. UTILITY WILL. Let’s talk real-world utility, not price predictions. If the XRP Ledger (XRPL) starts processing $1 TRILLION daily and supports full-scale tokenization of real-world assets…What happens to XRP? Let’s break it down. pic.twitter.com/V1GqniHJOR — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) March 29, 2025 How XRPL Utility Can Support Token Price Growth The analyst asserts that the asset’s value is closely linked to its role in financial infrastructure. They argue that widespread use of the XRP Ledger for large-scale transactions and asset tokenization could contribute to a meaningful price increase. If XRPL reaches the capacity to process $1 trillion in daily transactions while supporting real-world asset tokenization, the demand for the asset would likely rise significantly. To provide context, the analyst draws a comparison to SWIFT , a global messaging network that facilitates transactions worth between $5 trillion and $6 trillion daily. If XRPL were to secure even a small fraction of that volume, it could positively impact the token’s market value. A key point raised in the discussion is that while tokenized assets themselves do not inherently require XRP, they depend on it for essential functions within the XRPL ecosystem. Every transaction involving tokenized assets on the ledger incurs fees in XRP, requires reserves held in XRP, and utilizes the cryptocurrency for trading within its decentralized exchange. As on-chain activity increases, this structure naturally drives demand for the token. The Role of Storage Demand in Token’s Future Beyond transaction-based utility, the analyst highlights storage demand as a crucial factor influencing the digital asset’s long-term growth. This concept refers to institutions, market makers, and investors holding the asset as part of their operational framework rather than simply using it for transactions. As trust in XRPL grows due to its capacity for handling high-value tokenized asset transfers, serious participants may choose to retain XRP holdings for efficiency. Unlike speculative traders, these market players are more inclined to maintain stable reserves of the token, reducing volatility and contributing to sustained price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the analyst notes that an increase in the cryptocurrency’s value could make it more practical for large-scale transactions. A higher price per token would reduce the total number of tokens needed for high-value transfers, improving transaction efficiency and reducing potential price slippage. For example, transferring $1 million at a rate of $1 per XRP would require one million tokens, whereas at $10 per XRP, only 100,000 tokens would be needed. This dynamic aligns with a past statement by Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who argued that XRP “cannot be dirt cheap” if it is to function effectively in large financial transactions. Growing Role in Tokenization and Institutional Adoption As the adoption of on-chain tokenization expands, it has the potential to drive further utility on the XRP Ledger. This would increase network activity and, consequently, demand for XRP through transaction fees and its role in bridging different assets within the ecosystem. The analyst emphasizes that sustained price growth will not happen overnight. Instead, the token’s trajectory will depend on whether XRPL can establish itself as a leading platform for real-world asset exchange. They compare this potential shift to Ethereum’s evolution, where the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and token issuance increased demand for ETH. While many assets on Ethereum are not directly denominated in ETH, they require it for transaction fees and network operations—a dynamic that could similarly apply to XRP. By securing a key position in global financial infrastructure and asset tokenization, the token may achieve the long-term appreciation that speculative hype alone cannot deliver.

Paul Atkins’ SEC nomination passes committee vote Paul Atkins is one step closer to securing the top position at the US Securities and Exchange Commission after the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance his nomination. In an April 3 banking committee session, lawmakers voted 13 to 11 for Atkins to serve two consecutive terms as a commissioner at the government agency, effectively taking over former Chair Gary Gensler’s term. Atkins’ nomination is expected to go to a full Senate vote in the near future. Senator Tim Scott speaks at the committee hearing.

Donald Trump selected Atkins to replace Gensler as the SEC head in December, roughly one month after winning the presidential election. At the time, Trump praised Atkins’ track record as a former SEC commissioner and for his expertise in digital assets. US sanctions 8 crypto wallets tied to Garantex exchange and Yemeni Houthis The US Treasury Department sanctioned eight cryptocurrency wallet addresses linked to Russian crypto exchange Garantex and the Yemeni political and military organization the Houthis.

Most of the transactions funded Houthi operations in Yemen and the Red Sea region. US House committee passes stablecoin-regulating STABLE Act The US House Financial Services Committee passed a Republican-backed stablecoin framework bill with a 32-17 vote on April 2, with six Democrats voting in favor. The bill, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, will now head to the House floor for a full vote. It aims to provide rules around payment stablecoins and ensure issuers give information about their business and how they back their tokens. Last month, the US Senate Banking Committee voted through a similar GOP-backed bill, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, which lays out oversight and reserve rules for issuers. Source: Financial Services GOP Both bills will now wait until debate time on the floor of the House and Senate, respectively, before they head for a floor vote. Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett reported on X, citing crypto lobbyists, that there is likely to be “a coordinated push behind the scenes over the next few weeks to get the two bills to mirror each other,” which would avoid the House and Senate having to “negotiate to create a final version of the bill everyone agrees on.”",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ZK|WLD|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-03 19:12:39

While Cardano (ADA) once stood as a leading DeFi contender, its momentum has slowed significantly. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has continued gaining traction — not just in terms of price action, but in user engagement, platform development, and early adoption. With more attention shifting to DeFi tokens offering utility and yield, many are starting to question whether MUTM might be one of the most strategic entries this year. ADA’s growth has hit a wall Cardano has seen strong runs in the past, but recent months have been marked by sideways movement and diminishing excitement. Its price has fallen sharply from earlier highs and continues to hover in a consolidation range. Network activity has shown signs of fatigue, and while development efforts within the ecosystem continue, market participants seem less responsive. The ADA token is now stuck between support and resistance levels, with no immediate signs of a breakout. This uncertainty has prompted a shift in focus and capital to newer protocols that offer clearer momentum and evolving utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike speculative meme coins or tokens banking purely on future promises, Mutuum Finance is focused on delivering practical functionality today. It’s a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to give users real control over their digital assets. On the platform, users can either supply tokens and earn passive yield or borrow by providing overcollateralized assets — without needing to sell their holdings. This appeals to both long-term holders and active DeFi participants. The backbone of this system is the MUTM token. Priced at just $0.025 during its current presale phase, MUTM offers an accessible entry point into a platform that’s already drawing significant attention. Over $6 million has been raised, and the number of holders has surpassed 7,700 — clear indicators of growing confidence and community interest. Mutuum introduces a two-pronged lending approach: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users supply assets like ETH or USDT into shared liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens accumulate value over time and can be redeemed for the underlying asset plus interest. Meanwhile, the P2P model allows for more personalized lending terms, giving users the flexibility to negotiate directly with counterparties. A built-in buy-and-redistribute mechanism further strengthens the token’s appeal. As the platform generates revenue, a portion of that income is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to users who hold mtTokens. This reinforces both participation and long-term token demand. Mutuum is also preparing to roll out its own overcollateralized stablecoin — another layer of utility that sets it apart from many low-cap DeFi tokens. Backed by assets supplied within the lending protocol, the stablecoin will be pegged to the U.S. dollar and offer a transparent, decentralized alternative to existing options. Adding further legitimacy, the platform is currently undergoing a security audit by CertiK. Once completed, it will help reinforce investor trust and confirm that the protocol’s architecture is secure and battle-tested. While ADA continues to lag in growth and spark debate among long-term holders, MUTM is showing the kind of forward momentum and utility that today’s investors are actively looking for. The presale is still open, but phases are closing quickly — and once the token launches, the price is expected to rise with usage and platform engagement. For those scanning the DeFi space for practical tools with long-term upside, Mutuum Finance might just be the breakout story that Cardano no longer is. As the broader market evolves, the real opportunity could lie in the smart platforms quietly building in the background — and right now, MUTM is one of the names to watch.

Trade between the two superpowers has been going down a steep slope over the past three years. However, both sides have made it clear that sanctions are part of the bargain on how to end the conflict, and it remains to be seen how this is going to play out. For now, instead of the “reciprocal tariffs” slap for the rest of the world, Russia is only getting a “secondary tariffs” threat. Russia not on the United States’ global tariffs list U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday sweeping new tariffs on more than 180 countries that will pay at least 10% on the goods they are importing into the United States. Much higher rates will be imposed on what Trump calls the “worst offenders,” including some of America’s main trading partners such as China (additional 34%) and the European Union (20%). “It’s our declaration of economic independence,” the President said during his “Liberation Day” announcement from the Rose Garden of the White House. He presented the levies as a payback for what has been described as unfair trade policies regarding the U.S. by nations such as Vietnam, for example, which will be charged 46% in the future, and Cambodia, at 49%. However, some omissions in the otherwise global list of “ reciprocal tariffs ” were immediately spotted by media around the world. Among them are the Russian Federation and some of its closest allies in the ongoing war with Ukraine. The latter will now pay 10%, as much as it charges the U.S. “It is noteworthy that Russia was not in the target list for increased American tariffs,” the leading Russian business daily Kommersant pointed out in an article. The newspaper referred to Scott Bessent ’s explanation about the absence. “The United States does not trade with Russia,” the U.S. treasury secretary told Fox. Russia’s likely excluded from the tariff table due to U.S. sanctions and trade restrictions, not normal trade relations. High tariffs, like 200% on aluminum, and geopolitical tensions over Ukraine suggest it’s treated differently. Sanctions and low trade volume explain its… pic.twitter.com/c2UKgXLMl5 — Grok (@grok) April 2, 2025 Sanctions viewed as bargaining chip by both Russia and the U.S. Trade between the United States and the Russian Federation has been declining at a fast pace, especially after Moscow invaded Ukraine about three years ago. From $14.4 billion in 2022, Russian imports into the U.S. plummeted to $4.6 billion in 2023 and then $3 billion in 2024. Yet that makes around $22 billion in three years of strong geopolitical confrontation. Since Trump’s return to power, the two nations have restored full diplomatic relations and started negotiations for peace in Ukraine. Both he and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, have referred to the sanctions in the context of these talks. While the Russian leader attached their easing as a condition for committing to a ceasefire, the U.S. president threatened Russia with “secondary tariffs” on buyers of Russian oil if Moscow stalls the process. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators proposed a bill imposing a 500% tariff on imported goods from countries that buy oil, gas, uranium, and other products from Russia. The already tough sanctions on Russia were also the main reason that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt gave for not adding the country to the long tariffs list. These “preclude any meaningful trade” she told the U.S.-based news website Axios. Leavitt also noted that the Russian Federation could still face “additional strong sanctions,” echoing President Trump’s statements on the matter. The report revealed that the value of all trade between the U.S. and Russia has dropped from approximately $35 billion in 2021, the year before the full-fledged war started, to around $3.5 billion as of last year, largely as a result of the sanctions imposed on Russia for attacking its neighbor. Leavitt further remarked that Belarus and North Korea were also omitted as the sanctions against them are already high as well. The two countries have been among Russia’s closest allies in its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, with Minsk providing territory and infrastructure during the initial stages of the invasion and Pyongyang sending ammunition and troops to help Russia contain and push back the Ukrainian incursion into the Russian Kursk region.

Despite periods of bearish momentum, optimism remains strong, especially following the token’s impressive market capitalization surge in late 2024. This analysis explores a scenario where XRP experiences a steady 10% monthly increase, projecting how long it could take to reach $10 while comparing the estimate to expert forecasts from financial research platforms. Projected Timeline for XRP to Reach $10 with 10% Monthly Gains Currently, the asset is valued at approximately $2.02. If the asset experiences a steady monthly increase of 10%, it would reach $2.22 in the first month, followed by $2.44 in the second month. By the fourth month, XRP’s price could reach around $2.95, assuming consistent growth. A compound growth formula was used to estimate the time required for XRP to reach $10 under these conditions. Based on this calculation, the asset could potentially hit the $10 mark in approximately 15.89 months, projecting this milestone around mid-2026. Alternative Expert Predictions for When XRP Might Hit $10 This timeline aligns with estimates from the financial forecasting platform Telegaon. In its recent analysis, Telegaon suggested that XRP could trade at a minimum price of $6.94 in 2026, with an average of $8.53 and a peak price of $10.18. Their long-term outlook indicates XRP reaching at least $10 by 2027. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another projection from Changelly presents a more conservative estimate, suggesting that XRP might not reach the $10 threshold until 2028. These differing perspectives highlight the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s price trajectory. Factors That Could Influence XRP’s Path to $10 While a structured growth model suggests XRP could reach $10 by next year, real-world market conditions may differ significantly. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and XRP’s price could experience fluctuations that either accelerate or delay its progress toward this milestone. External factors such as regulatory decisions, broader market trends, and investor sentiment will also play a role in XRP’s future valuation. As such, while a steady 10% monthly gain is an interesting theoretical scenario, investors should consider market risks and price variability when evaluating long-term projections.

Experts characterize the breach as not a traditional bug but a risk oversight that can potentially expose other DeFi protocols to the same vulnerabilities. Dr. Jan Philipp Fritsche, a managing director at blockchain audit company Oak Security, analyzed the cause of the exploit as not code failure but unpriced risk—a long-established principle of conventional finance that DeFi platforms often ignore. How the JELLY Exploit Unfolded The attacker, in Fritsche’s view, manipulated the market by shorting JELLY by $5 million and then draining the margin. Hyperliquid was left with the exposure, and other users exploited this vulnerability through a group short squeeze. “The attacker created massive counter positions in JELLY, wagering that one side would break and the other would be covered,” Fritsche said. “Because payouts were not capped and risk was not contained, the protocol absorbed the loss—and the attacker made off with millions.” A Broader DeFi Risk Fritsche referred to the attack as a “textbook example of unpriced vega risk,” explaining how protocols are prone to overlook implied volatility. Lacking proper means of risk pricing, most decentralized exchanges are left exposed to such strategic attacks. Industry Reactions and Implications Backlash poured in in the wake of the attack. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen labeled Hyperliquid’s architecture as “immature, unethical, and unprofessional” and drew parallels between it and the now-defunct FTX. While Hyperliquid has promised to reimburse affected users, its reputation has taken a major hit. DeFi’s Mounting Losses The JELLY exploit is part of a larger pattern in DeFi. In 2024 alone, exploits cost $308.7 million—more than the $192.9 million lost to rug pulls. Just days after the Hyperliquid attack, another DeFi protocol, SIR.trading, was drained of its entire $355,000 total value locked. The event is a reminder that as DeFi grows, so must its security maturity lest history repeat itself.",Blockchain|Sticky|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-03 19:36:15

This move marks another state’s retreat in the ongoing legal battle between U.S. states and the popular cryptocurrency exchange. This move follows a pattern of states reevaluating their stance on staking charges. This came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to drop its case against Coinbase earlier this year. The Background of the Lawsuit Against Coinbase In 2023, Illinois and nine other U.S. states filed lawsuits against Coinbase. The states accused the exchange of violating state securities laws by offering staking services. Staking is a common practice in the crypto world. It allows users to earn rewards by locking up their cryptocurrency to support blockchain operations. These states claimed Coinbase’s staking program violated local securities regulations. Simultaneously, the SEC charged Coinbase for similar issues regarding federal securities laws. The regulatory agency claimed the trading platform offered unregistered securities. However, Coinbase denied the accusations and fought back in court. Later, in February 2025, the SEC decided to drop its case against Coinbase. This shift comes as the SEC, under acting chair Mark Uyeda, softened its stance on crypto enforcement. Illinois And Others Follows SEC Lead Illinois is now following the SEC’s lead. A spokesperson for Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias confirmed to CoinDesk that the state intends to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase. While the timing remains undisclosed, Illinois is the latest state to reconsider its position on the case. Illinois is not the only state backing down. Kentucky, South Carolina, and Vermont have already dropped their lawsuits against Coinbase . After the SEC’s decision, these states are reassessing their approach to crypto regulations. Coinbase Legal Battle Is Not Yet Over Despite the retreat from several states, not all legal challenges against the exchange have ended. Some states, including Alabama, California, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin, are still in court over Coinbase’s staking program. Some of these states have reportedly refused to comment on the status of their cases, which raises uncertainty about whether they will follow Illinois’s and others’ example. Nevertheless, New Jersey and Washington have confirmed that their cases remain active. This means that Coinbase’s legal troubles are not completely over.

To read full editions, subscribe . As I write this piece, I’m in shock. The tariffs that President Trump announced yesterday were significantly larger than even the most aggressive of estimates. The basics have already been discussed to death, but let’s summarize them anyway just to set things straight: Trump issued a blanket tariff of 10%. For 60 or so countries, there’s a tariff of roughly half of the “total sum of all unfair trade practices,” as calculated by the Trump administration. As seen in this chart from the Budget Lab (a Yale think tank), the total weighting of all these tariffs leads to an effective tariff rate at 22.5%, which would be the highest it’s been in a century. Source: The Budget Lab Other estimates are as high as 26.5% to 30%. Now, how exactly did the Trump team quantify these estimates of tariffs imposed on the US? It turns out that it was a crass estimation of the country’s trade deficit divided by its exports. In chart form, you get this extremely simplistic linear extrapolation: I walked through the mechanics of how the Trump team calculated these estimates, because it’s important to grasp how little thought was put into coming up with the numbers. They quite literally made this simplistic estimation, then decided the reciprocal tariff would be half of that made up number to seem forgiving. It’s not forgiving. Now let’s move into discerning the economic impact of these announcements, assuming they hold (and given what we’ve seen from the administration so far, who the hell knows if they will). The Budget Lab analyzed the impacts of the tariffs and came up with the following: Short-term : US real GDP growth in 2025 is expected to be 0.9% to 1.0% lower due to the tariffs. Long-term : The US economy is projected to be permanently 0.3% to 0.6% smaller — equivalent to an annual loss of $90 billion to $180 billion in 2024 dollars. Global GDP also shrinks in the long run, though China’s GDP remains largely unaffected, per the estimates. Prices : The short-term price level on all goods rises by 2.1% to 2.6%, translating to a per-household consumer loss of $3,400 to $4,200 in 2024 dollars. Food prices specifically are projected to increase by 3.7%, nearly double the recent grocery inflation rate. In chart form, the GDP hit looks something like this, and remember that this doesn’t even consider retaliation from other countries: I liked the way Brad Setser, one of my favorite economists on trade, put it: If you’re not familiar with the impact of oil shocks on the economy, the experience of seeing what follows (hint: a recession) is a sobering one. How likely is said recession? Well, Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro has moved up his implied probability of recession to 89%. I listen when Neil warns about recession because he was one of the only economists who said a recession being imminent between 2022-2024 was nonsense whilst everyone else had their odds at 100%. Breathe in, breathe out. This is all under the assumption that these tariffs hold. I, as well as the market as a whole, seem to be in denial and think cooler heads will prevail. Let’s hope so.

Our Analysis Reveals All,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/ethereum-solana-key-resistance-breakout-or-crypto-winter-our-analysis-reveals-all,"Ethereum and Solana are under the spotlight as traders watch for key resistance levels. Will these cryptocurrencies surge, or are they headed for another downturn? This analysis dives deep into what could be a game-changing moment for the market. Stay tuned to discover which coins show promise and which ones might falter. Ethereum Price Dynamics Amid Bearish Downtrends Ethereum dropped roughly 9% over the past week, about 15% over the last month, and nearly 25% in the past six months. Price performance has struggled with continuous declines, highlighting a phase of downward pressure despite occasional fluctuations. The market reflects caution among traders as they await signs of recovery, making it difficult to find strong bullish momentum during this period. The current trading range falls between $1538 and $2325.85. Key resistance is seen at $2829.45 while support rests at $1255.61, with a secondary resistance at $3616.37 and a lower support level near $468.69. Bulls remain on the back foot as indicators point to bearish sentiment. Trading strategies might consider positions near support with tight risk management within these levels. Solana Market Trends and Key Price Levels Solana price performance shows a drop of about 16.64% over the past month and a decline of roughly 17.38% in the last six months. A one-week slide of 13.92% also adds to the picture of recent downward movement. The coin has stayed within a set range, with its values oscillating between approximately $97.94 and $165.67, reflecting overall bearish behavior in recent months. Current trading levels are defined by immediate support near $71.30 and resistance at $206.76, with a second resistance around $274.49. Market indicators like momentum and RSI show bearish pressure, and there is no clear uptrend in sight. Traders might consider short positions near resistance or look for rebound opportunities around support, keeping in mind the downward signals. Conclusion ETH and SOL are testing pivotal points. A breakout above resistance could signal a strong uptrend. Failure to do so might indicate prolonged market weakness. Investors should keep an eye on volume and market sentiment.

Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $150.12 Market cap $2,266,376,849.41 Trading volume (24-h) $301,479,473.67 Circulating supply 15,091,892.6 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $146.52 24-hour high $167.80 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.43% 50-day SMA $206.43 14-Day RSI 42.41 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $208.76 Aave 1-day price analysis: $150 still holds amid bearish market Key takeaways The coin faces immediate resistance at $154.54. A breakout above $154 could take the coin to $157.28. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE remains bearish The AAVE/USDT price analysis on April 03 shows a strong bearish trend, with continuous red candles and price trading below the middle Bollinger Band ($150.99). The next key support lies at $135-$140. AAVE remains bearish The MACD is in negative territory, confirming the ongoing selling pressure. The RSI at 42.14 indicates weak momentum but is not yet oversold. If $150 holds, a short-term rebound is possible. However, if the price breaks below $145, further downside toward $135 is likely. Aave 4-hour price chart: AAVE eyes $154 in the short-term The AAVE/USDT 4-hour chart shows consolidation around $151, following a sharp drop. Resistance levels are at $154.54, $157.28, and $161.75, while $148 serves as key support. AAVE eyes $154 in the short-term The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at -0.05 suggests weak buying pressure. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) remains low, indicating a lack of strong accumulation. A break above $154 could trigger a short-term rally, but failure to hold $148 may lead to further downside. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $214.13 SELL SMA 5 $202.65 SELL SMA 10 $204.19 SELL SMA 21 $191.85 SELL SMA 50 $206.43 SELL SMA 100 $260.33 SELL SMA 200 $208.76 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $192.80 SELL EMA 5 $209.34 SELL EMA 10 $239.32 SELL EMA 21 $271.08 SELL EMA 50 $277.81 SELL EMA 100 $247.55 SELL EMA 200 $202.49 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE’s struggle to hold $150-$151 signals ongoing bearish pressure. Weak buying interest (CMF -0.05, low OBV) suggests limited upside, with $148 as a key support. A breakdown below $148 could accelerate losses. A breakout above $154 offers potential for a short-term recovery. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE?

The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? The AAVE price candles show initial consolidation and subsequent price dip after facing resistance at $170.92. The $146.52 support level remains crucial. AAVE price history | Coinmarketcap Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave shows potential for a good long-term future, given its ability to stabilize and recover after significant declines.

DePIN Can Take Crypto Mainstream,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/04/03/not-a-meme-depin-can-take-crypto-mainstream,"For years, the crypto market has thrived on speculation, where excitement, hype and fleeting trends attract value instead of fundamentals. Investors have continually poured money into tokens fueled by viral moments, chasing rapid gains. Time and again, a select few of these investments soar to incredible heights, only to come crashing down. With over 33 million tokens in circulation, the competition to attract attention gets harder and harder and investor attention is ever more fleeting. But DePIN can change this. With compelling businesses attracting real customers and revenue built on well designed token economics, DePIN can set a new standard of fundamentals in crypto. As our DePIN Token Economics Report outlines, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) offer a number of compelling businesses with fundamental value. Unlike typical crypto projects driven by speculation, DePIN offers a different approach. It uses blockchain technology to support real-world infrastructure, creating tangible value and generating real revenue. Instead of relying on hype, it builds a financial system based on actual demand, making it a more sustainable and practical model. Rather than resembling major crypto networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, DePIN operates more like capital-light marketplaces such as Uber and Airbnb, but with key distinctions. While both models connect providers with customers without funding infrastructure, DePIN providers are compensated in tokens that can appreciate in value, akin to Uber drivers or Airbnb hosts receiving equity. Additionally, most DePINs sell to businesses which eliminates the need for massive marketing expenses required in building a consumer brand. DePIN offers a compelling business model and, unlike memes that come and go, it is the beginning of crypto’s transformation into a mature, revenue-generating industry. From Hype to Revenue-Driven Models At its core, DePIN represents a paradigm shift. Traditionally, blockchain-based businesses have relied on hype to attract buyers. In the absence of traditional fundamentals, the industry cycled through endless metrics such as TPS, TVL, Telegram channel size, followers on X and many others. Many projects have attempted to build decentralized ecosystems. But, without real customers paying for services, they have largely functioned as economies fueled by speculation rather than external demand. DePIN changes this by integrating blockchain technology with physical and digital infrastructure, creating compelling services that generate revenue. Whether it is decentralized cloud computing, wireless networks, mapping or storage solutions, DePIN projects offer services like traditional businesses and with customers who pay for usage. When combined with the correct token economics, it creates a sustainable financial model. As DePIN generates growing revenue, it is likely to draw institutional investors who have long been skeptical of crypto’s reliance on hype and speculation. The projects that successfully correlate the token demand to actual business growth will not only survive the current market but also set the standard for the next generation of blockchain companies The report also highlights one of the most compelling aspects of DePIN, the use of buy-and-burn , which removes the need to have an expanding pool of new buyers. Instead, these projects use a portion of their revenue to repurchase and burn tokens, permanently reducing supply and potentially driving long-term price appreciation similar to stock buybacks. This approach is in stark contrast to most of crypto which relies on new buyers to sustain and grow their value.The buy-and-burn model ensures that as DePIN businesses grow and generate more revenue, their token ecosystems become more resilient to market fluctuations. Some DePIN tokens are already demonstrating this by decoupling from broader crypto market trends, proving that real-world adoption can lead to price stability and long-term investor confidence. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Growth While DePIN offers significant potential, it also comes with challenges. One major concern is transparency, as most projects lack traditional financial reports, audits, or clear revenue statements. However, blockchain itself provides a solution — on-chain verification through buy-and-burn mechanisms allows for real-time financial tracking, giving investors a clearer picture of a project’s health. Another challenge is customer adoption. Many businesses and consumers remain concerned due to crypto’s volatility. To address this, DePIN projects are introducing fiat payment options and stablecoin rewards, making it easier for everyday users to interact with these decentralized services without needing prior crypto or Web3 experience. For DePIN to succeed, its incentive structures must be designed to keep all stakeholders — providers, users, and investors aligned. One way to achieve alignment is through staking mechanisms, especially in cloud-based networks where service providers lock up tokens as collateral to guarantee reliability. Projects like Filecoin and Fluence already use this approach, ensuring accountability while strengthening network security. Others, such as Render and Livepeer, take a different route by distributing a share of network revenue to token stakers, creating a system similar to dividends that rewards long-term commitment. Governance will also be critical as DePIN projects decentralize. To prevent large token holders from short-term profiteering for quick gains, new governance models like quadratic voting and weighted staking are emerging. These frameworks help keep decision-making balanced, ensuring that projects remain sustainable and fair as they evolve. DePIN isn’t just another blockchain investment vehicle, it is laying the foundation for real, decentralized infrastructure. While meme coins have shown that crypto can generate hype, they rarely create lasting value. In contrast, DePIN is developing businesses that can compete with centralized companies by focusing on real-world utility. With token models backed by revenue, deflationary supply mechanics, and increasing interest from institutional investors, DePIN is redefining how blockchain networks should function. The projects that successfully address capital efficiency, align incentives, and navigate regulatory challenges will be the ones that lead this next phase of decentralized technology. As DePIN matures, its token models will continue to evolve. Optimizing capital efficiency through transparent buy-and-burn rates will ensure liquidity while maintaining long-term value. Governance structures will adapt to prevent short-term actors from derailing network growth.

In a post on X, Wu said regulators and lawmakers will take action on the issue. Wu’s comments followed claims by Tron network founder Justin Sun that First Digital Trust (FDT), the issuer of FDUSD, has committed a $500 million trust fund and is insolvent. Sun disclosed this in a series of tweets on April 2, causing FDUSD to briefly depeg amidst concerns about its stability. According to Sun , several people misunderstand the Hong Kong Trust licensing process and exploit the approval and risk management loopholes to commit fraud. Therefore, the city’s regulators and law enforcement agencies should investigate the issue because it could damage Hong Kong’s growing reputation as a crypto hub. Sun meeting with Hong Kong Legislative Council members (Justin Sun on X) In his public response, Lawmaker Wu noted that he had already met with some complainants and was fully aware of the issue. One of the complainants he met with was Sun, who had met with several members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. However, Wu added that there is nothing to worry about because the rule of law would prevail as regulators would do everything to protect investors and citizens. He said: “Hong Kong has a legal basis and a healthy environment for protecting international investors and the Web3 industry. I urge international investors and tech practitioners not to worry about a single incident and to feel assured in continuing to invest and develop in Hong Kong.” Meanwhile, the lawmaker added that several fraud cases using trust companies have been reported to his office and the Anti-Fraud Alliance this year. He noted that the most recent case might present an opportunity to address the issue and discuss ways to improve the regulatory framework to prevent abuse by bad actors. First Digital denies allegations, plans to sue Sun While Sun continues to call for an investigation and warn people about holding FDUSD, the stablecoin issuer has released its own response to the allegations, which denies all allegations of fraud and misappropriation of funds. The one-page rejoinder posted on X claimed that FDT was only an intermediary that acted on the instructions of Techtryx and its authorized representatives without any obligation to evaluate or advise on those instructions. The company noted that Sun and Techteryx’s claims are only an attempt to shift blame and are completely false accusations. It said: “ By falsely alleging our involvement in a conspiracy, Techtery and Justin Sun are attempting to deflect blame and evade their own obligations to properly manage the reserves as the stablecoin issuer.” The firm further reiterated that its FDUSD is completely solvent and Sun’s claim is only a malicious attack on a competitor. It added that it is also seeking a legal opinion on whether to sue Sun for the attack on its reputation. So far, the public is buying the FDT version of the story, with FDUSD now regaining its peg after a flash crash that saw the stablecoin depeg. For one, many people believe that Sun has an ulterior motive for fighting the stablecoin wars, and he is not doing it simply to protect Hong Kong and its users.

The TRUMP coin, which peaked at a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $75 billion, is down another 13% today to a $9 billion valuation. The token launched on Jan. 17 and skyrocketed to its peak valuation two days later, ahead of Trump's inauguration, and has been in a downtrend ever since. The token’s major drop on Jan.19 was catalyzed by the launch of Hayden Davis’ MELANIA token, which was promoted by the First Lady on social media.

In an April 2 letter, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest arising from the Trump family’s involvement in the project. Concerns Over Trump Family’s Influence The lawmakers specifically questioned whether the family’s financial ties to WLFI might influence the SEC’s activities under acting Chair Mark Uyeda. The letter states that the inquiry seeks to determine “whether this conflict of interest may be interfering with its mission to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets.” Last month, World Liberty Financial reported over $500 million in exempt securities sales of its governance token, WLFI. According to the document, the president’s family holds a 75% claim on net revenues from token sales and 60% from the project’s operations, currently entitling them to about $400 million in fees. Warren and Waters called the Trumps’ stake in WLFI “an unprecedented conflict of interest” that could influence the government’s oversight of the crypto industry. They further argued it gives them “an obvious incentive” to direct federal agencies, including the SEC, toward crypto policies benefiting the president’s family. SEC’s Decision on Sun’s Case The letter also scrutinized the regulator’s February decision to pause its case against Justin Sun, who has invested $75 million into WLFI. The two politicians asked the agency to preserve “all internal memoranda justifying the initial enforcement decision,” including records of meetings and communications between its officials and representatives of Sun or the Trump family. Additionally, they requested that the financial watchdog maintain records of “communications, suggestions, or directives” from the White House or the Trump family regarding WLFI or Sun’s case. They also asked whether it had consulted with ethics officials concerning the Trump family’s crypto investments and requested copies of any policies in place to prevent undue influence from the president’s kin. According to the document, the American people have a right to know if financial markets are regulated fairly or if decisions are being made to serve personal interests. The inquiry follows an April 2 House Financial Services Committee session on stablecoin regulation. The government has stated its intent to prioritize stablecoin regulation and integration. During the session, Waters opposed the bill unless it included provisions preventing Trump or his affiliates from owning a stablecoin issuer, arguing that it “sets a dangerous precedent benefiting the president and his insiders.” Her comments followed WLFI’s March 25 announcement of its plan to launch USD1, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly touched 4.0%, down from 4.4% a week earlier, signaling strong demand from buyers. US 10-year Treasury yield (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph At first glance, a higher risk of economic recession may seem negative for Bitcoin ( BTC ). However, lower returns from fixed-income investments encourage allocations to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Over time, traders are likely to reduce exposure to bonds, particularly if inflation rises. As a result, the path to a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 remains plausible. Tariffs create ‘supply shock’ in the US and impact inflation and fixed-income returns One could argue that the recently announced US import tariffs negatively impact corporate profitability, forcing some companies to deleverage and, in turn, reducing market liquidity. Ultimately, any measure that increases risk aversion tends to have a short-term negative effect on Bitcoin, particularly given its strong correlation with the S&P 500 index. Axel Merk, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Merk Investments, said that tariffs create a “supply shock,” meaning the reduced availability of goods and services due to rising prices causes an imbalance relative to demand. This effect is amplified if interest rates are declining, potentially paving the way for inflationary pressure. Source: X/ AxelMerk Even if one does not view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the appeal of fixed-income investments diminishes significantly in such a scenario. Moreover, if just 5% of the world’s $140 trillion bond market seeks higher returns elsewhere, it could translate into $7 trillion in potential inflows into stocks, commodities, real estate, gold, and Bitcoin. Weaker US dollar amid gold all-time highs favors alternative assets Gold surged to a $21 trillion market capitalization as it made consecutive all-time highs, and it still has the potential for significant price upside. Higher prices allow previously unprofitable mining operations to resume and it encourages further investment in exploration, extraction, and refining. As production expands, the supply growth will naturally act as a limiting factor on gold’s long-term bull run. Regardless of trends in US interest rates, the US dollar has weakened against a basket of foreign currencies, as measured by the DXY Index. On April 3, the index dropped to 102, its lowest level in six months. A decline in confidence in the US dollar, even in relative terms, could encourage other nations to explore alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin. US Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph This transition does not happen overnight, but the trade war could lead to a gradual shift away from the US dollar, particularly among countries that feel pressured by its dominant role. While no one expects a return to the gold standard or Bitcoin to become a major component of national reserves, any movement away from the dollar strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term upside potential and reinforces its position as an alternative asset. Related: Trump 'Liberation Day' tariffs create chaos in markets, recession concerns To put things in perspective, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore collectively hold $2.63 trillion in US Treasuries. If these regions choose to retaliate, bond yields could reverse their trend, increasing the cost of new debt issuance for the US government and further weakening the dollar . In such a scenario, investors would likely avoid adding exposure to stocks, ultimately favoring scarce alternative assets like Bitcoin. Timing Bitcoin’s market bottom is nearly impossible, but the fact that the $82,000 support level held despite worsening global economic uncertainty is an encouraging sign of its resilience.

Senate Banking Committee Advances Paul Atkins To Lead SEC The U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted 13 to 11 on April 3 to move forward with Atkins’ nomination, with all the Democrats opposing Trump’s pick. Atkin’s nomination will now move to the Republican-controlled Senate for a full floor vote, after which he will serve two consecutive terms as an SEC commissioner, taking over from former Chair Gary Gensler’s who departed in January. Atkins is an SEC veteran who previously served as an agency commissioner under President George W. Bush. He is an advocate for market deregulation, and many are expecting him to create more friendly policies for the crypto industry. “Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, will promote capital formation and provide much-needed clarity for digital assets,” Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott said. “Under his leadership, the SEC will return to its core mission and will ensure our markets remain the envy of the world.” Implications Of New SEC Leadership On Crypto During a confirmation hearing before the Senate last week, Atkins asserted that instituting a “regulatory foundation for digital assets” will be a “top priority” of his chairmanship. But during that hearing, Atkins received a lot of heat from Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal crypto skeptic and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee, over his connections to the failed FTX crypto exchange and President Trump’s possible conflicts of interest amid ties to the family-backed crypto project World Liberty Financial. Many industry experts lambasted crypto foe Gensler for his “regulation by enforcement” approach to digital assets, with the commission lodging lawsuits against crypto companies and projects over alleged violations of securities laws. With Atkins yet to formally take the reins at the SEC, the agency has nonetheless taken a new and different approach to regulating crypto. The SEC has already created multiple policies favorable to the crypto sector, including rescinding the disastrous crypto accounting guidance . Moreover, under acting chair Mark Uyeda , the agency has moved to dismiss almost every single one of its enforcement actions against leading crypto-related companies, including Ripple and Coinbase .",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Donald Trump|USA,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-03 19:51:05

The transaction includes an initial $210.64 million payment upon closing, with the remaining balance contingent on tax obligations and credit risk reductions, according to a press release . The deal follows a non-binding proposal from Enduring Wealth Capital Limited in March, which sought control of Cango while facilitating the PRC business sale. The sale is pending shareholder approval and an internal restructuring that separates Cango’s China operations from its offshore businesses, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and automotive trading outside China. If completed, Cango plans to deregister as a “China Concept Stock” under Chinese regulatory oversight. However, the buyer retains the right to reverse the deal if China’s securities regulators reject the deregistration or if EWCL fails to finalize a separate stock acquisition agreement with Cango’s co-founders.

In a new post on the instant messaging app Telegram, pseudonymous crypto strategist Crypto Capo tells his 121,635 subscribers that the top crypto asset by market cap looks ready to shoot up to between $92,000-$98,000 if it can successfully reclaim the $85,000 range. “Crazy [price action] yesterday… and this is exactly why I avoid leverage most of the time. Right now, BTC is just deviating above and below the $84,000-$85,000 area, flip-flopping and trying to find direction. Indicators remain bullish for the short-term, so I still think a move up is more likely. But once again, we need to see a clean reclaim of $85,000 to confirm that. As long as that happens, the target would be $92,000-$98,000, which is the next strong resistance zone.” According to Capo, President Donald Trump’s most recent tariffs have already been priced into the market, which means BTC could unexpectedly rise as most inventors anticipate a bearish event. “Most people expect today to be a bearish event (Trump administration to announce global tariffs today at 4PM)… I see it differently. Most of the tariff news is likely already priced in. The market has been dropping for weeks. Charts keep looking bullish for the short-term, and we’ve already seen some signs of strength. Could easily turn into a buy the news kind of day. Let’s see how the market reacts!” The trader concludes by noting on the social media platform X that selling BTC now would be a huge mistake as he believes the current market to be in the midst of a bear trap, or a deceptive market pattern that fools traders into believing that a sustained downtrend is incoming. BTC is trading for $81,609 at time of writing, a 5.6% decrease during the last day.

After waning cool down 5.83% today, the token is exchanging at $2.23, indicating a technical battle with a descending triangle pattern that could make its way down. If the price falls to $1.93, analysts note, a breach could spiral to a 22% decline, while other markers — above $2.46 remains a distant hurdle. In this context, the calls of XRP regaining $3 again in 2025 become ever more dubious. On the other hand, investors are obsessed with a high-potential alternative, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently worth $0.025 in its fourth presale phase, with experts estimating a post-launch price exceeding $3. XRP Technical Outlook Is Bearish Ripple’s new market structure shrank significantly since in early 2025 after it rallied 389% to $2.46. The downward trend indicates a lack of buyer confidence and is compounded by unsuccessful attempts to break resistance levels. Meanwhile, liquidation heatmaps are showing more serious bearish movement between $2.14 and $2 — just above the market price — where liquidated short positions significantly outnumber long positions. A long-term downturn beneath the $1.93 level may amplify the selling pressure and validate the target of $1.50. Although sudden bullish momentum could create a short squeeze up towards $2.31, lack of strong support mechanisms reduces optimism. Social sentiment reflects caution as traders wait to see if XRP can avoid its head-and-shoulders pattern, a feat only possible with a sustained push above $3. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demand has been through the roof in phase four of presale. The project has 7,800 holders raising $6,100,000. The token has an introductory price of $0.025, and this comes with a time-limited opportunity before a 20% increase to $0.03 in stage five. At its $0.06 exchange listing, early investors could see 140% returns — a number that is built on clear tokenomics. Apart from presale profits, analysts predict that price will soar to $3.50 post-launch as a result of its innovative lending model and key buy-pressure mechanisms. And revenue is earmarked to buyback the platform’s mtTokens, which accumulate interest over time, with the goal of creating long-term demand stability. Mutuum Finance is strengthening credibility with Certik audit in the process but needs final outcome published in their social media. MUTM Sustainable Factors for Growth It sets itself apart from many of its speculative peers by being a decentralized lending ecosystem that is driven by real products. Mutuum Finance is a more varied project than many of its peers, sitting at the crossroads between being a decentralized lending ecosystem. Uniting flexibility with risk mitigation, overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer negotiations are made possible. Dynamic interest rates and a $100,000 presale giveaway to incentivize participation takes it to the next level, appealing to both lenders and borrowers alike. 40% of supply is for staking rewards and partnerships, meaning the project’s token allocation strategy is really focused on liquidity and the growth of an ecosystem. This structural rigor positions MUTM for scalability, especially in the wake of DeFi adoption kicking in. Its goal to redesign traditional finance is often credited to the upcoming release of an overcollateralized stablecoin that fuels speculative use. Capitalizing On The Presale Opportunity Phase four’s rapid sell-out reflects the growing pressure of FOMO among retail and institutional investors. The price bump at each presale tier generates urgency, with the current $0.025 phase representing the last chance to get in below $0.03. If post-launch forecasts of $3.50 are realized—as they very well could be—it means a 13,900% reward for early adopters, swaying in favor of real-world applications of Mutuum. With XRP facing uncertainty, MUTM’s measured path towards growth makes for an appealing hedge. With the volatility of the crypto market, proper positioning is essential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the key player. As Ripple struggles against bearish headwinds, the presale momentum and utility-driven model of MUTM give a tangible route to exponential gains. With market players already seeking high-yield potential for 2025, investors are flocking towards this $0.025 token before its next stage begins. Act quickly — the window for phase four is closing.

42866627,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705124,1743710402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42866627.jpeg,World nations are retaliating against Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcements,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/world-nations-are-retaliating-against-trumps-liberation-day-announcements/,"The United States’ new tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump as part of his “Liberation Day” measures, have sparked a wave of retaliatory actions among major trading partners. Vietnam was hit hard by the US move, with the Trump administration imposing a 46% duty on a range of its exports. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said the high rate was “not in line” with the good relationship between the two nations and ordered a task force to devise a quick response. “Remain calm and have proactive, timely and flexible measures to cope with the situation,” he instructed his team, according to a government website post . Trump referenced a report by a US trade representative on Foreign Trade Barriers before announcing tariffs on “Liberation Day.” Source: WSJ The 46% duty comes as part of a series of “reciprocal” measures aimed at countries that the Trump administration considers the worst offenders based on the levies and non-tariff barriers imposed on US goods. Senior economist Trinh Nguyen from Natixis in Hong Kong described the new tax as “devastating for Vietnam.” The measure not only threatens to damage the nation’s economy but also endangers future foreign investment. Bloomberg reported US tariff, imposed on Vietnam’s largest export market, could significantly undermine the country’s ambitious goal of boosting economic growth to at least 8% this year. However, Prime Minister Chinh maintained that the growth target remained unchanged for now. Vietnam’s benchmark VN Index closed 6.7% lower, marking the biggest one-day decline since September 2001, with about 70% of shares on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange hitting the 7% daily limit. A note from Citi Research warned that the tariff might not only challenge Vietnam’s economic growth but could also “structurally impact Vietnam’s FDI outlook” and dampen domestic confidence in the money market. Vietnam’s textile and apparel sector is among the hardest hit. Japan urges for a change in policy The Trump administration announced on Wednesday in Washington that Japan would be subject to a 24% across-the-board tariff starting next week. Just hours later, a previously announced 25% levy on all car imports went into effect. Prime Minister Ishiba at the April 1st press conference for the FY2025 budget. Source: Prime Minister’s Office of Japan, Youtube. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior member of the Japanese government, said , “It’s very disappointing that these measures were taken despite our requests,”. Ishiba added that if necessary, he would not hesitate to speak directly with President Trump to press for a change in policy. Trade Minister Yoji Muto indicated that Tokyo might need to consider its options if the US moves violate World Trade Organization rules. Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Takehiro Funakoshi also protested the new tariffs during a meeting with Charge d’Affaires Joseph Young, the top official at the US embassy in Tokyo. The Nomura Research Institute has estimated that the new tariffs may reduce Japan’s annual growth rate by 0.59 percentage points. Takeshi Minami, chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute, warned that the tariffs could shave Japan’s economic growth by around 0.5 percentage point or more. The European Union, the US’s largest trading partner, has not remained silent In a sharp rebuke, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Trump’s tariff announcement “a major blow to the world economy” in a video address on Thursday. Trump’s new measures include a 20% tariff on EU imports that will take effect on April 9. Von der Leyen stated that the EU was preparing for further countermeasures to protect its interests and businesses if negotiations failed. The EU has announced a set of countermeasures amounting to up to €26 billion ($28.1 billion), which are expected to come into force in mid-April. There is also talk among European countries, including France, of using the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument (ACI), its most powerful trade tool, to strike back if the US continues its aggressive stance. EU trade ministers are scheduled to meet on April 7 to discuss both the US measures and the bloc’s response. Von der Leyen emphasized that a negotiated solution was the preferred route and that the commission was working on a “term sheet” outlining possible concessions to the US. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Trump’s latest tariffs an “attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world” during a news conference on Thursday. Olaf Scholz condemns US Trump’s tariffs in a news conference on Thursday. Source: NDTV Scholz asserted that if negotiations with the US fail, the European Union would respond proportionately. “The E.U. has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,” he said. The Federation of German Industries urged the EU to strengthen alliances with other major trading partners and to coordinate a unified reaction. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck added, “For U.S. consumers, this will be Inflation Day, rather than Liberation Day,” highlighting the potential domestic impact in the US. Economic Minister Carlos Cuerpo said on Wednesday that “The European Union has the necessary tools to respond to [Trump’s tariffs], and, of course, in this context, Europe will not be naive. We will always respond.” In a further sign of its readiness, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summoned industry leaders on Thursday to present his government’s response plan, underscoring the European commitment to counteracting the effects of the US measures. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advised other countries not to retaliate, saying, “I wouldn’t try to retaliate. As long as you don’t retaliate, this is the high end of the number.” The Thai government is bracing for a 36% reciprocal tariff imposed by the US. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Thursday that her country was ready to address the impact of the new tariff. She noted that the ministries of finance and commerce would lead the effort to develop a strategy to help manufacturers and exporters cope with the increased costs. Thailand’s trade surplus with the US totaled $45 billion last year. In response to the tariff threat, the Thai government had already adopted a wait-and-see approach and pledged to increase imports of energy and food products in an effort to reduce the trade surplus. Key exports such as electronics, semiconductor components, air conditioners, and rubber tires could see a significant impact. Independent analyst Santitarn Sathirathai, a member of the Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee, described the situation as a “global trade earthquake” that would have an immediate negative effect on the economy and investment. Thai stocks and the national currency slumped on news of the 36% duty, reflecting concerns over the nation’s growth prospects. With merchandise exports amounting to nearly two-thirds of Thailand’s gross domestic product—about $520 billion—economic uncertainty looms large. Thai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Poj Aramwattananont remarked , “Don’t panic as other countries are also facing higher tariffs. The US will also have some impact from this as they still can’t produce to replace the imports fast enough.” His comment reflects a broader concern that prolonged uncertainty could force businesses worldwide to pause and reassess their plans, further dampening economic activity. Australia no longer considers US a friend, while Brazil passed a retaliatory bill Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking in Melbourne on Thursday, stated that Trump’s tariffs “have no basis in logic, and they go against the basis” of the longstanding diplomatic alliance between Australia and the United States. “This is not the act of a friend,” Albanese said. Brazil faced a 10% tariff on its goods. The country has passed a reciprocity bill on Wednesday to allow it to retaliate against tariffs imposed on Brazilian exports by any country or trade bloc. Brazil’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, “The new measure, like the tariffs already imposed on the steel, aluminum, and automobile sectors, violates the United States’ commitments to the World Trade Organization and will impact all Brazilian exports of goods to the United States.” President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has indicated that Brazil is considering an appeal to the World Trade Organization over Trump’s steel tariffs, signaling a willingness to use international legal channels to defend its national interests. Colombia’s reaction came through a social media post by President Gustavo Petro on Thursday. Hoy el neoliberalismo que proclamaba una política librecambista en todo el globo ha muerto. Quienes se amarran desde la oposición a esta ideología extrema deben saber que se amarran a un cadáver. En el tema arancelario, hemos dicho que no se puede tener una actitud… https://t.co/DlKCXt4aG4 — Gustavo Petro (@petrogustavo) April 2, 2025 In his message on X, he declared, “Today, neoliberalism, which proclaimed a free trade policy across the globe, is dead.” Petro went on to suggest that the US government now believes that raising tariffs on its imports can increase domestic production, wealth, and employment, a move he described as a potential big mistake.

Solana, Cardano, XRP, and BlockDAG have become some of the most talked-about names this week, and each brings something new to blockchain tech. While Solana and XRP concentrate on speed and scalability, Cardano stays focused on research-driven, sustainable solutions. Then there’s BlockDAG, which recently grabbed headlines after Keynote 3 introduced bold new updates aimed at boosting performance and expanding its ecosystem. This article explores how each project stacks up—and which might emerge as the top crypto gainer for 2025 based on development, price momentum, and user appeal. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Rapid Growth & a $210.5M Presale Make It a Top Contender BlockDAG (BDAG) has become one of the fastest-growing crypto projects in 2025, with Keynote 3 marking a turning point. The project has raised $200 million in under 10 months—entirely without VC backing—showing strong global support for its Layer 1 chain, powered by Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. At the time of writing, BlockDAG’s presale had exceeded $210.5 million, with over 19 billion coins sold. The BDAG coin has climbed 2,380% since batch 1, now priced at $0.0248 in batch 27. This capital will fund continued core development, mainnet upgrades, and partnerships with major names like Inter Milan and UFC. What makes BlockDAG stand out is its hybrid DAG + PoW architecture. It enables high-speed, energy-efficient transactions at scale while keeping fees low. With its Beta Testnet now running at double the speed of its alpha version, momentum is building fast. Looking ahead to the 2025 Mainnet launch, BlockDAG plans to introduce staking, DeFi, bridges, and support for 1,000+ dApps by 2026. Given its strong growth and innovative model, BDAG is clearly one of the top crypto gainers for 2025. 2. Cardano (ADA): Built for Security, Sustainability, & Academic Integrity Cardano (ADA) runs on Proof of Stake and is backed by peer-reviewed research and academic development. Its focus on formal methods and sustainable growth has won respect across the crypto community. The project maintains decentralization while prioritizing long-term security and usability. Price predictions for ADA vary, with some forecasts suggesting it could hit $0.945 by the end of 2025. More optimistic projections put it at $1.376, while long-shot models tied to a $10 trillion crypto market cap hint at $3.38. While those targets depend on broader adoption and favorable trends, ADA’s consistent progress makes it a viable option for those seeking the top crypto gainer for 2025. 3. Solana (SOL): High Speed, Low Costs, and a Growing Ecosystem Solana (SOL) is often praised for its lightning-fast speeds and cost efficiency, thanks to its hybrid Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. These mechanisms help Solana maintain high throughput and low fees, especially important during network congestion. Currently trading at around $132, SOL’s short-term outlook is measured. Analysts see moderate upside, with projections nearing $170 by year’s end, though that hinges on market conditions and ongoing usage. Solana’s growing role in DeFi and NFT markets—plus the fact it now hosts over 1,000 meme coins—demonstrates its expanding reach. It remains a solid option among the top crypto gainers for 2025. 4. XRP (XRP): Leading the Way in Cross-Border Payments & Utility Expansion XRP powers the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which was built to provide quick, inexpensive global payments. Its low transaction fees and near-instant settlements have earned XRP a place among banking institutions and payment providers worldwide. Beyond its original use case, XRP is branching into microtransactions, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), and smart contracts. These developments are helping it stay relevant in a rapidly changing market. As institutions continue to explore XRP’s capabilities, it remains one of the top crypto gainers for 2025 based on its expanding role in financial innovation. So, Which One Is the Top Crypto Gainer for 2025? Solana, Cardano, and XRP each bring their own strengths. Solana’s focus on speed makes it ideal for high-volume use. Cardano’s research-first approach offers long-term security, and XRP continues to lead in global payments. But BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight. After Keynote 3 revealed major ecosystem upgrades, it has raised over $210.5 million, while BDAG’s price has jumped 2,380% from batch 1. With a 2025 Mainnet launch ahead and strong momentum already in motion, BlockDAG could offer one of the highest upside opportunities in the space—making it a standout pick among the top crypto gainers for 2025 .

CBS News reports that the victim was initially contacted by the female scammer through a Korean messaging app. After spending several weeks gaining trust, the fraudster slowly asked for money, supposedly to invest in crypto for her, and showed an investment portfolio that looked real. “I put in over $3 million into this, and it showed that I was making almost maybe like 80% profit. When she got a lot more of my trust, more money would be poured in. Unless you know what you’re doing, you’re not going to be able to tell—especially if you’ve never done crypto before.” The woman was then swindled in a “pig butchering” crypto scam. Pig butcherers spend time gaining their target victim’s trust before convincing them to give their money to invest in cryptocurrency. The FBI says the scammers often allow their victims to withdraw a small portion of their money first to build trust. They also coach their victims on what to say in case law enforcement gets involved. FBI special agent Jeremy Capello says that the targets tend to get victimized again. “They will have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to this scam, and then they are contacted again by these same scammers pretending to be recovery companies, where they will tell the victim, ‘We can recover your cryptocurrency if you pay us a fee.’” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The market remains stuck in a tight range, reflecting growing indecisiveness among traders and investors. Uncertainty has become the new normal, with macro conditions and political developments continuing to cloud sentiment. Related Reading: Whales Dump 760,000 Ethereum in Two Weeks — Is More Selling Ahead? US President Donald Trump has added further volatility to the mix, unsettling financial markets with unpredictable policies and newly imposed tariffs. His erratic behavior has only intensified the fragile mood, pushing risk assets like Bitcoin into deeper consolidation. Despite brief rallies, Bitcoin has once again failed to break above descending resistance, according to crypto analyst Carl Runefelt. This rejection, paired with declining trading volume, is a sign that buyers may be losing strength. Runefelt warns that if volume continues to dry up and BTC remains stuck below key levels, the bearish target of $78,600 remains a strong possibility. While bulls are defending support zones for now, the lack of momentum is raising red flags. Unless Bitcoin can reclaim higher ground soon, the odds of a deeper correction will continue to grow — making the coming days crucial for determining the market’s next direction. Bitcoin Down 25% from January ATH As Bears Tighten Grip Bitcoin is now down 25% from its January all-time high, and bulls are struggling to regain control. After repeated attempts to reverse the trend, BTC continues to hold above the $81,000 level — a key support zone — but has failed to reclaim the $86,000 mark, which is necessary to confirm any serious recovery. The inability to push higher has weakened market confidence, and bulls now find themselves in a difficult position. Macroeconomic uncertainty and fears surrounding escalating trade wars, especially under U.S. President Donald Trump’s unpredictable policies, have added to market volatility. These factors continue to favor the bears, and the pressure on high-risk assets like Bitcoin remains intense. With broader financial markets under stress, bullish sentiment in the crypto space is fading quickly. Panic is beginning to set in for some investors as selling pressure shows no sign of slowing. However, there’s still a sliver of optimism among market watchers who believe that a bounce could follow once key resistance levels are reclaimed. Runefelt recently shared insights pointing to BTC’s failure to break above descending resistance — a bearish sign. He also noted that trading volume continues to decline, a sign that market participation is thinning out. This lack of volume often precedes large moves, and in this case, the bearish target of $78,600 remains firmly on the table if bulls fail to reclaim momentum. For now, the market remains on edge. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $81K and attempt a move past $86K will be critical in determining whether a recovery is possible — or if the next leg down is about to begin.

Technical Details: Key Levels To Hold Bitcoin is currently trading at $83,500 after several days of choppy, volatile price action that has left traders uncertain about the market’s next direction. The recent swings between key levels have highlighted the indecision among both bulls and bears, with neither side able to take full control. For bulls, the immediate challenge is to reclaim the $85,000 level, which aligns with the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA). A successful move above this mark would be an encouraging signal of short-term strength. Beyond that, the next key level is $86,000, which is where the 4-hour exponential moving average (EMA) sits. Reclaiming this zone would help shift momentum back in favor of the bulls and potentially set the stage for a recovery attempt toward $90,000.

This price zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, and losing it would likely trigger further downside pressure. As macro uncertainty and market-wide volatility continue, bulls must defend this support while working to reclaim the MAs above. The coming sessions will be crucial in defining whether Bitcoin can recover—or slide deeper into correction territory.

Airdropped or obscure tokens may lack liquidity or could be scams, so it’s important to check before attempting to cash out. Swapping and bridging may be required. To sell, you might need to convert tokens to ETH or stablecoins and bridge them to the Ethereum mainnet. MetaMask integrates fiat off-ramps. You can use the MetaMask Portfolio to sell ETH directly, but be prepared for KYC with third-party providers. Non-KYC and P2P options exist. Platforms like Bisq or LocalCoinSwap allow trading without ID, but they carry more risk and require caution. There are plenty of ways you might end up with a mix of different cryptocurrencies sitting in your MetaMask wallet. Maybe you work in Web3 — as a developer, copywriter or designer — and your client paid you in their project’s native token . Or maybe you’re part of a Bitcoin mining pool and occasionally receive rewards straight to your wallet. You could be farming yield in decentralized finance (DeFi) , earning annual percentage yield (APY) on your locked assets. Or, perhaps the most straightforward of all: You completed a few SocialFi tasks and received some community tokens via an airdrop . Whatever the case, you’ve got crypto in your MetaMask — and now you want to turn it into cash. In this guide, you’ll learn all the ways you can sell your crypto and withdraw the funds to your bank account or even in cash — whether you’re going through official Know Your Customer (KYC) channels or sticking to more private, non-KYC routes. Things to know before selling tokens on MetaMask Before you can turn your tokens into cash, there are a few things you need to get sorted in MetaMask because “not all tokens are created equal.” It’s not always as simple as hitting a “sell” button — especially if you’ve just received tokens via an airdrop or from a lesser-known project. 1. Why some airdropped tokens can’t be sold (yet) Just because a token shows up in your wallet doesn’t mean it’s ready to be sold. In fact, many airdropped tokens aren’t listed on exchanges at all. That means there’s no market where you can sell them — not yet, anyway. You might see a price attached to the token, but without buyers or liquidity, that value isn’t something you can actually realize right now. So, while it’s great to receive free tokens, they may end up sitting idle in your wallet for a while. Did you know? If you see a “100% sell fee detected” warning on a token, it’s likely a scam. Scammers airdrop these tokens, hoping you’ll try to sell or interact with them. But when you do, the smart contract takes the full amount — leaving you with nothing. Worse, some link to fake decentralized applications (DApps) that ask you to “claim” or “unlock” the tokens. Connecting your wallet or signing a transaction there can let scammers drain your real assets. 2. Adding missing tokens to your wallet Sometimes, you’ll receive tokens that don’t even show up in MetaMask at first. That doesn’t mean they’re not there — it just means MetaMask doesn’t recognize them by default. You’ll need to add them manually by grabbing the token’s contract address (usually from the project’s official site or Etherscan ) and importing it into your wallet . Once you do that, your balance will show up properly. Similarly, if you want to receive any asset other than Ether ( ETH ), the “Import Tokens” option lets you manually add these missing tokens so they show up in the assets list. 3. Getting ready to swap or bridge Even if your tokens are visible in MetaMask and technically have value, that doesn’t always mean you can sell them for cash right away. Many smaller or newer tokens don’t have direct fiat trading pairs — so you won’t be able to exchange them straight into dollars or euros. To get around this, you’ll usually need to swap them for something more liquid, like ETH or a stablecoin such as USDC ( USDC ), which are more commonly supported by fiat off-ramps. In some cases, your tokens might also be sitting on a different blockchain — like Arbitrum, BNB Chain or Polygon — while most fiat withdrawal options only support Ethereum mainnet . When that’s the case, you’ll need to bridge your tokens over to Ethereum before you can sell them. One way to handle both of these steps — swapping and bridging — is by using platforms that combine them into a single flow. For example, with Symbiosis.finance, you can swap a token on one chain and receive a more widely accepted token on Ethereum, all in one transaction. This can save you a few steps and reduce the chance of user error when hopping between tools. How to sell crypto with MetaMask The simplest way to sell crypto that you hold on MetaMask is by using the application itself. Here’s what to do: Open MetaMask portfolio: In your MetaMask extension or app, click the “Buy & Sell” button. This will take you to the MetaMask Portfolio site, where you can manage all your assets and begin the selling process. Start the sale process: Click on “Move crypto” at the top of the page and select “Sell” from the dropdown options. Choose your region and currency: MetaMask will ask for your country of residence and preferred fiat currency. This step ensures you’re shown accurate provider options and payout methods available in your area. Enter sale amount: Select Ether and enter how much you’d like to convert. Pick a payout option: Next, choose where you want the fiat to go. Depending on your region and provider availability, you might be able to send it to a bank account, PayPal or another method. Compare offers: MetaMask aggregates offers from several third-party providers (like MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, etc.), showing you real-time exchange rates, fees and estimated payout times. Take a moment to compare and pick the best option for you. Complete the sale: Once you’ve chosen a provider, MetaMask will guide you through sending the crypto. You’ll confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the funds will be transferred to the provider, who handles the fiat payout. There are two things to keep in mind when using the MetaMask application: Firstly, while the application itself might not ask you for KYC, the third-party providers will. So, expect to get your documents ready for this one. Secondly, MetaMask’s sell feature only supports ETH on the Ethereum mainnet. This is where the bridging will come in as was explained earlier. Withdrawing crypto via centralized exchanges If you’d rather cash out your crypto through a centralized exchange, Coinbase is a popular option. It’s beginner-friendly, offers fiat withdrawals, and supports a wide range of assets. Just note: You’ll need to complete KYC verification before withdrawing any fiat. Here’s how to do it, step by step: 1. Send crypto from MetaMask to Coinbase First things first: You’ll need to move your funds from MetaMask to Coinbase. Log in to your Coinbase account and hit “Send & Receive” at the top. Switch to the “Receive” tab, pick the crypto you’re sending (like ETH or USDC), and copy the wallet address Coinbase gives you. Make sure the network matches — for example, if you’re sending ETH, it should be on the Ethereum ( ERC-20 ) network. Now open MetaMask: Click “Send,” paste in that Coinbase address, and enter how much you want to transfer. Double-check the network — if you send it to the wrong one, your funds could disappear. Hit “Confirm,” and your crypto should show up in Coinbase after a few minutes. 2. Sell crypto for fiat on Coinbase Once your funds land in Coinbase, it’s time to cash out. Head to “Buy & Sell” at the top and switch to the “Sell” tab. Choose the crypto you just received and decide how much you want to sell. Pick where you want the money to go — like your linked bank account, PayPal or your Coinbase balance. Review the details (including any fees), then hit “Sell.” Did you know? When withdrawing via centralized exchanges, be cautious of minimum withdrawal amounts and any associated fees. Check these details in advance to make sure the limits and costs are acceptable to you before committing to this route. Peer-to-peer with KYC With peer-to-peer (P2P) , you’re not selling your crypto to the exchange. Instead, you’re selling it to another user. You choose a buyer based on their offer and preferred payment method (like bank transfer, Revolut, Wise, etc.). Once they send the money to your account, you release the crypto to them. The platform holds your crypto in escrow during the process, so no one can just disappear with your funds. With centralized exchanges, you’ll have to complete KYC before you’re able to trade in this manner. Selling via P2P on Binance Go to Trade > P2P. Choose the coin you want to sell and browse the list of available buyers. Select a deal, confirm the order, and wait for the buyer to make the payment. Once the payment has arrived in your account, confirm it and release the crypto from escrow . Did you know? Some peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges offer a “cash by mail” option, allowing users to send physical cash through postal services or couriers to settle transactions. Cashing out of your MetaMask wallet without KYC For those looking to convert cryptocurrency from their MetaMask wallet to fiat currency without undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, there are still a few viable paths. Decentralized P2P platforms let you trade directly with other users, much like their centralized counterparts, though often with minimal or no KYC requirements. LocalCoinSwap: A non-custodial P2P marketplace that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and payment methods, including cash. It offers escrow protection and emphasizes privacy. Bisq: A fully decentralized exchange that supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero ( XMR ). It runs on a peer-to-peer protocol and doesn’t require user accounts or KYC. However, without KYC, you’re responsible for vetting the person you’re trading with. Check their reputation, review any available trade history, and always follow platform safety guidelines. Using cryptocurrency ATMs to withdraw crypto from MetaMask Withdrawing funds from your MetaMask wallet using cryptocurrency ATMs — often referred to as Bitcoin ATMs — is an option that allows you to convert your digital assets into cash. Here’s how you can approach this method: Locate a cryptocurrency ATM: Begin by finding a cryptocurrency ATM in your vicinity. Websites like CoinATMRadar provide directories of Bitcoin ATM locations worldwide, detailing the services they offer and the cryptocurrencies they support. Prepare your MetaMask wallet: Ensure that the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw is supported by the ATM. Bitcoin ATMs predominantly support Bitcoin ( BTC ), so you may need to use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap your current tokens for BTC within your MetaMask wallet. Be mindful of transaction fees and exchange rates during this process. Initiate the withdrawal process: At the ATM, select the option to withdraw cash. The machine will prompt you to specify the amount you wish to withdraw and provide a QR code representing the ATM’s wallet address. Transfer funds from MetaMask: Using your MetaMask wallet, scan the QR code provided by the ATM to input the recipient address accurately. Enter the exact amount of cryptocurrency required and confirm the transaction. Be aware that network congestion can affect transaction times. Collect your cash: Once the blockchain confirms the transaction, the ATM will dispense the equivalent amount in cash, minus any applicable fees. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to longer, depending on network conditions. When using crypto ATMs, you should expect very high fees, and while small transactions don’t usually require KYC, larger ones still might. Are MetaMask crypto transactions taxable? Taxes aren’t the most exciting topic, but they matter when converting crypto from a MetaMask wallet into fiat. Selling crypto, whether through MetaMask, an exchange or a P2P deal, may trigger a taxable event , and understanding the applicable rules is essential. Selling crypto = possibly taxable In most countries, including the US, selling crypto for fiat (like US dollars, euros, etc.) is treated like selling property. That means if you bought ETH at $1,000 and sold it later for $1,500, you’ve made a $500 capital gain — and that’s usually taxable . Even swapping one crypto for another (say, ETH for USDC) can trigger the same kind of tax obligation, even if no fiat is involved. So, yeah, it’s not just cashing out that counts — any trade can be reportable. To stay on top of it, keep a record of: When you bought and sold each asset How much you bought and/or sold What it was worth in fiat at the time Any fees paid along the way. These details make life way easier when tax season rolls around — or if your accountant gives you that look . Know your local rules Crypto laws aren’t one-size-fits-all. Every country has its own stance, and even within the same country, rules can vary depending on how you’re using crypto. In the US, for example, selling crypto could fall under capital gains tax rules or even money transmission laws, depending on how you’re moving the funds. Other countries might have more lenient — or much stricter — regulations. So, here’s what to do: Look up your local crypto tax laws (even if they seem vague or outdated). Stay current — regulations are evolving fast. Talk to a pro if you’re unsure. A crypto-savvy accountant or legal adviser can help you avoid nasty surprises. Even if you’re using non-KYC methods or decentralized tools, tax authorities may still expect a full report. Being proactive about it will save you headaches later — and might even save you money.

Based on her analysis, XRP could still witness a price decline before it potentially rallies past its current ATH of $3.4. XRP Price Could Drop To $1.9 Before Rally To New Highs In an X post , CasiTrades stated that in the event of a deeper flush, the XRP price could wick down to $1.90, suggesting that the altcoin could visit this low before it rallies to new highs. She believes XRP will ideally hold above this $1.90 and avoid dropping to new lows. The crypto expert noted that the next move is critical. She claimed that if XRP gets that flush with bullish RSI divergence, it could mark the bottom before the altcoin rockets into Wave 3. However, CasiTrades warned that a break below $1.90 could force a reset of the entire new trend count. Meanwhile, there is still the possibility that the XRP price might not drop to as low as $1.90. CasiTrades stated that $1.95 is the prime target, with subwaves heavily aligning there and a drop to $1.90 only likely to occur in the event of a deeper flush. It is worth mentioning that US President Donald Trump recently announced reciprocal tariffs on all countries , a move which is set to ignite a global trade war and is bearish for XRP and the broader crypto market. As such, this development could be what sparks the deeper flush and send the altcoin to as low as $1.90. A Drop To $1.4 Is Also The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Brandon asserted that the XRP price is about to have a massive breakout, to the downside. His accompanying chart showed that XRP could drop to as low as $1.4. On the other hand, crypto analysts such as Ali Martinez have provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price. In an X post, he stated that XRP could be setting up for a rebound. The analyst further remarked that the altcoin is holding above $2 while the TD Sequential flashes a buy signal. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also recently predicted that Ripple’s coin could surge 44x and reach as high as $99. He alluded to the 2017 bull run as the reason why he is confident that the altcoin could record such a parabolic rally.

On April 4, 2025, data from an on-chain analytics firm revealed that exchanges have been witnessing continuous outflows, even as the asset’s price continues to decline. $55 Million Worth of XRP Outflow Data from Coinglass revealed that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $55 million worth of XRP tokens over the past 48 hours. This substantial outflow from exchanges indicates a sign of accumulation and further raises a concern about whether this is an ideal level to buy or not. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.05 and has recorded a price decline of over 5% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 95%, indicating increased market activity and explaining the asset’s outflow from exchanges. XRP Price Action and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, the asset has reached a key level following this massive price decline, creating a make-or-break situation for XRP. The asset’s daily chart reveals that it has formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern and is currently near the neckline. Source: Trading View However, this level is crucial due to its historical price momentum. Historically, whenever XRP reaches this level, it tends to show a price reversal or rebound, which might explain the recent outflows from exchanges. However, if the current market sentiment remains unchanged and the price continues to fall, there is a strong possibility that XRP could drop by 44% to reach the $1.20 level in the future. $58 Million Worth of Bullish Bet Coinglass liquidation data shows that traders are currently bullish on XRP. At press time, the major liquidation levels or over-leveraged positions are at $2.08 on the upper side and $1.93 on the lower side. At these levels, traders have built $28 million and $58.70 million worth of short and long positions, respectively, over the past 24 hours.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-trapped-in-key-range-heres-the-implication/,"Bitcoin (BTC) finds itself at a pivotal moment, trading within a critical range of $86,900 to $84,800 as market participants anxiously await its next move. Ali, a well-regarded crypto analyst, highlighted on X that whichever side of this range breaks first on the hourly chart will likely determine Bitcoin’s next significant price shift. This technical setup, combined with the introduction of new tariffs, adds a layer of complexity to Bitcoin’s immediate price trajectory. With tariffs now in play, #Bitcoin $BTC is holding a critical range between $86,900 and $84,800. Whichever side breaks first on the hourly chart will likely define the next big move. pic.twitter.com/tIRmcVTT9d — Ali (@ali_charts) April 2, 2025 The Impact of Tariffs on Bitcoin’s Market Behavior Global financial markets have been rattled by new tariffs, affecting investor sentiment across multiple asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Traditionally viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin’s response to these tariffs will be crucial in determining its resilience as a store of value. Market volatility has already increased, and traders are closely monitoring whether BTC can maintain support above $84,800 or if a breakdown is imminent . Technical Analysis: A Crucial Inflection Point Bitcoin’s current range between $86,900 and $84,800 represents a battle between bulls and bears. If BTC breaks above $86,900, bullish momentum could push it toward higher resistance levels, potentially revisiting previous highs. On the other hand, if the $84,800 support level fails, Bitcoin could face increased selling pressure, leading to a possible retest of lower support zones. Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase, with traders awaiting confirmation before making decisive moves. Momentum indicators such as the RSI and MACD provide mixed signals, keeping investors on edge. Market Sentiment and Institutional Influence Institutional investors and whales continue to play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin’s market behavior. Recent on-chain data suggests that accumulation remains strong at lower levels, signaling confidence among long-term holders. However, short-term traders are exercising caution as macroeconomic factors, including regulatory developments and central bank policies, weigh on sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The role of institutional players cannot be overlooked, as any large movement from these entities could break Bitcoin’s tight range. A major influx of buying pressure from institutions could swiftly push BTC above resistance, while significant sell-offs might exacerbate downward movement. What’s Next for Bitcoin? As Bitcoin hovers within this crucial range, all eyes remain on the price action in the coming hours and days. A breakout above $86,900 could ignite a fresh rally, reinforcing bullish sentiment and paving the way for another leg higher. Conversely, a drop below $84,800 could trigger additional declines, potentially testing psychological levels further down. Ali’s insight into Bitcoin’s price behavior serves as a reminder that the crypto market remains highly reactive to global economic shifts. Traders and investors must stay vigilant, watching for key technical and fundamental developments that could shape BTC’s next major move. For now, Bitcoin remains in a state of equilibrium, but a decisive break in either direction could define its path in the near term.

BlackRock’s early use signals a growing trend among established asset managers to integrate digital solutions into traditional finance. This development could prompt the broader financial sector to modernize data systems and boost transparency in fund management. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon) unveiled a new blockchain-powered accounting tool on Thursday designed to improve fund transparency and efficiency. According to Fortune Crypto , the tool, officially named Digital Asset Data Insights, allows the bank to publish a fund’s net asset value (NAV) directly onto a blockchain, eliminating reliance on third-party accounting services. Asset management giant BlackRock became the first client to adopt the tool, integrating it into its on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. This move comes amid a loosening regulatory grip that has seen increased acceptance of blockchain applications in finance. On Thursday, the financial giant Bank of New York Mellon Corp announced its latest crypto offering: a tool that provides up-to-date data about a fund’s net asset value, or NAV, directly on a blockchain. This reflects the growing sophistication of a new class of tokenized funds… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 3, 2025 Following initial regulatory roadblocks under the previous administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently softened its stance on digital assets, which has paved the way for greater blockchain adoption. BlackRock and the Future of Tokenized Assets As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock has has actively pursued financial technology advancements. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, BUIDL , launched in 2024, has been a pioneer in tokenized short-term U.S. Treasury funds. @BlackRock expands its $1.7B tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to Solana, leveraging the blockchain’s speed and low fees for enhanced on-chain access to U.S. dollar yields. #Crypto #Tokenization https://t.co/nUUkiEFJGR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 With the integration of BNY Mellon’s Digital Asset Data Insights, BUIDL’s NAV data will be broadcast on-chain, ensuring real-time visibility for investors. This development aligns with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s vision , which has repeatedly highlighted how tokenization could change financial markets. Fink has suggested that tokenization can streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance security across various asset classes. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, hailed the partnership with BNY Mellon as a watershed moment for the industry. “BNY’s enablement of off-chain data insights to public blockchains is an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry. By enhancing data transparency and accessibility for our investors, BNY has set a new standard for digital asset innovation.” BNY Mellon’s Expanding Blockchain Footprint BNY Mellon’s foray into blockchain technology is not new. The bank has been steadily expanding its digital asset services over the years. In 2022, BNY Mellon launched its Digital Asset Custody Platform , allowing institutional clients to store and transfer Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the launch encountered regulatory friction under the Biden administration, particularly regarding balance sheet requirements for institutions holding crypto assets on behalf of clients. In response to regulatory challenges, BNY Mellon secured an exemption in 2024 , permitting it to provide digital asset custody services for exchange-traded products (ETPs) without them being classified as balance-sheet liabilities. The subsequent rescission of the SEC’s controversial SAB 121 rule under the Trump administration further removed barriers, allowing BNY Mellon to expand its blockchain initiatives without facing undue financial restrictions. Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC, confirmed that SAB 122 has officially replaced SAB 121 in the regulatory framework. #SAB121 #CryptoAccounting #USSEC https://t.co/feyCzuakYH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 24, 2025 Caroline Butler, BNY Mellon’s global head of digital assets, mentioned that the blockchain tool is part of a broader strategy to bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance. “Accessing transparent data is critical to our clients’ success in today’s market. Our platform’s support of Digital Asset Data Insights underscores our commitment to servicing the end-to-end asset lifecycle via distributed ledger technology while maintaining data integrity from a trusted source.” BNY is not the first to bring such a solution for crypto firms, but it was the first to put it on the blockchain. A report from July last year shows that KPMG partnered with Cryptio to help U.S. crypto firms comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) by implementing stronger accounting controls. The collaboration aims to assist companies in properly accounting for their crypto assets and ensure regulatory compliance. With over $52 trillion in assets under custody, BNY Mellon’s continued push into blockchain signals growing interest in integrating this technology into mainstream fund operations. Frequently Asked Questions FAQs What does this integration suggest about the future of financial recordkeeping? This integration blends legacy practices with digital recordkeeping. It reshapes operational frameworks, boosts data traceability, and clearly reduces external audit needs, suggesting a cautious shift in regulatory approaches. How could banks adjust their systems to adopt blockchain-based accounting? Banks could rework legacy systems to fully interface with digital ledgers. The change demands updated IT frameworks, comprehensive staff retraining, and process refinement to align with advanced data management and audit protocols. In what ways might this development influence investor trust and market operations? This shift may foster investor trust by offering real-time, immutable records that enhance market predictability. Enhanced clarity and data verification encourage smoother market operations, prompting a cautious yet steady investor response.

Analysts predict a breakout could push it to an impressive $165 , fueled by an uptick in trader interest and network activity. With over 3.3 million active addresses recorded, Solana is proving its resilience as it recaptures investor confidence in a competitive market. While Solana’s momentum excites traders, another project, Ruvi , is capturing the crypto community’s imagination for entirely different reasons. Positioned at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, Ruvi offers not just upward price potential but also real-world utility and innovative rewards for early supporters.

ParaSwap, a name synonymous with decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation, has just announced a major transformation. Say goodbye to ParaSwap and hello to Velora ! This isn’t just a name change; it’s a complete rebranding accompanied by the launch of their cutting-edge Delta v2.5 upgrade. But what does this mean for you, the DeFi enthusiast? Let’s dive into the exciting details of Velora and its revolutionary new features. ParaSwap Rebrands: Embracing the Future as Velora Why the rebrand? ParaSwap’s evolution into Velora signifies more than just a fresh coat of paint. It represents a strategic move to encapsulate their expanded vision and enhanced capabilities. Think of it as a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis – ParaSwap has matured, evolved, and is now ready to soar as Velora. This rebranding reflects their commitment to simplifying and optimizing the DeFi trading experience, making it more accessible and powerful for everyone. This transition isn’t about abandoning their roots; it’s about building upon them. Velora inherits ParaSwap’s robust foundation as a leading DEX aggregator and propels it into a new era of intent-based trading and user-centric design. The new name, Velora, evokes a sense of speed, agility, and innovation – qualities perfectly aligned with their upgraded platform. Unveiling Delta v2.5: Intent-Based Trading Revolution The heart of Velora’s transformation lies in Delta v2.5 , which introduces a groundbreaking intent-based trading system. But what exactly is intent-based trading, and why is it a game-changer? Traditional DEX trading often requires users to navigate complex interfaces, manually select routes, and constantly monitor gas fees. Intent-based trading flips this script. Instead of micromanaging every step, you simply express your intent – what you want to achieve (e.g., swap tokens A for B with slippage tolerance X). Velora’s intelligent system then takes over, handling the complexities of routing, execution, and optimization behind the scenes. Here’s a breakdown of the key benefits of intent-based trading with Delta v2.5: Simplified Trading Experience: Say goodbye to complicated order books and manual route selection. Intent-based trading makes DeFi as intuitive as using centralized exchanges. Optimized Execution: Velora’s smart algorithms automatically find the best prices and routes across multiple DEXs, ensuring you get the most favorable trades. Time Efficiency: Spend less time fiddling with settings and more time focusing on your trading strategies. Reduced Complexity: Especially beneficial for new DeFi users, intent-based trading lowers the barrier to entry into the world of decentralized finance. In essence, Delta v2.5 empowers you to trade smarter, not harder. It’s about expressing your desired outcome and letting Velora’s sophisticated technology handle the intricacies. Fortified Security: MEV Protection at its Core In the often-turbulent waters of DeFi, MEV (Miner Extractable Value) protection is paramount. Delta v2.5 places a strong emphasis on safeguarding users from MEV exploitation, ensuring a fairer and more secure trading environment. MEV, also known as front-running or sandwich attacks, occurs when malicious actors exploit their ability to reorder or insert transactions within a block to profit at the expense of traders. This can result in slippage, unfavorable prices, and lost value for unsuspecting users. Velora’s Delta v2.5 incorporates robust MEV protection mechanisms to mitigate these risks. While the specific technical details are often kept proprietary to maintain security, the core objective is to shield users from predatory practices and ensure that trades are executed at the intended prices. This commitment to security is a significant advantage, fostering greater trust and confidence in the Velora platform. Consider this scenario: You’re about to make a large trade on a DEX. Without MEV protection, a bot could detect your transaction in the mempool, front-run your trade by placing a similar transaction with a slightly higher gas fee, and then sandwich your trade with another transaction to profit from the price slippage. Velora aims to prevent such scenarios, creating a level playing field for all traders. Cross-Chain Expansion and Customizable Execution with Velora DEX Velora isn’t just about single-chain DeFi anymore. The rebranding and Delta v2.5 upgrade signal a strong push towards cross-chain support . In an increasingly multi-chain world, the ability to seamlessly trade assets across different blockchains is crucial. Velora is positioning itself to be a central hub for cross-chain DeFi trading, simplifying access to a wider range of opportunities. Furthermore, Delta v2.5 introduces customizable execution options, giving advanced users greater control over their trades. While intent-based trading simplifies the process for most users, experienced traders often require fine-grained control over parameters like gas fees, slippage tolerance, and execution speed. Velora caters to both novice and expert traders by offering a balance of simplicity and customization. Here are some aspects of customizable execution you might find in Velora: Gas Fee Control: Adjust gas fees to prioritize transaction speed or minimize costs. Slippage Tolerance Adjustment: Set your preferred slippage tolerance to manage price fluctuations during trades. Advanced Order Types: Potentially access advanced order types beyond simple market orders, depending on future updates. Route Selection (Optional): For users who want more control, Velora might offer options to influence or select specific routing paths. This blend of automated intent-based trading and customizable execution makes Velora a versatile platform suitable for a diverse range of DeFi users. Simplifying DeFi Trading: Velora’s Core Mission with Delta v2.5 At its heart, Velora’s mission with Delta v2.5 is to simplify DeFi trading . The DeFi space, while brimming with innovation and potential, can often be intimidating and complex for newcomers. Velora aims to break down these barriers, making decentralized finance more accessible, user-friendly, and efficient for everyone. Consider the typical journey of a new DeFi user: Overwhelmed by Complexity: Navigating multiple DEXs, understanding gas fees, and dealing with wallet management can be daunting. Risk of Mistakes: Errors in transactions, slippage issues, and security concerns can lead to losses. Time-Consuming Processes: Finding the best trades and manually executing them can be time-intensive. Velora directly addresses these pain points with its rebranding and Delta v2.5 features. Intent-based trading, MEV protection, and cross-chain support are all geared towards creating a smoother, safer, and more efficient DeFi experience. By abstracting away the technical complexities and focusing on user intent, Velora is paving the way for wider DeFi adoption. Key Takeaways: Feature Benefit Rebranding to Velora Signals evolution, innovation, and a user-centric approach. Delta v2.5 Upgrade Introduces intent-based trading for simplified DeFi. MEV Protection Enhances security and fairness in trading. Cross-Chain Support Expands trading opportunities across multiple blockchains. Customizable Execution Provides advanced options for experienced traders. Conclusion: Embracing the Velora Era The rebranding of ParaSwap to Velora and the launch of Delta v2.5 marks a significant leap forward in the evolution of DEX aggregation. By embracing intent-based trading, prioritizing MEV protection, and expanding cross-chain capabilities, Velora is poised to become a leading force in the DeFi space. This transformation is not just about a new name; it’s about a renewed commitment to simplifying DeFi, empowering users, and shaping the future of decentralized trading. Keep an eye on Velora – it’s a name you’ll be hearing a lot more in the exciting world of decentralized finance.

42868546,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146185,1743714638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Court Order Blocks Genius Group From Bitcoin Investment & Funding,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/genius-group-bitcoin-investment-ban/,"In a stunning turn of events, Genius Group, a firm known for its innovative approach to AI-powered Bitcoin education, has been slapped with a court-ordered ban. This ruling from a New York District Court prevents the company from not only raising capital but also from making further investments into Bitcoin. Adding insult to injury, the court is compelling Genius Group to liquidate its existing Bitcoin treasury. Let’s dive into the details of this unfolding situation and understand the implications for Genius Group and the wider cryptocurrency landscape. What’s the Genius Group Bitcoin Ban Story? The genesis of this dramatic situation lies in arbitration proceedings initiated by Genius Group in October of the previous year. These proceedings aimed to terminate an asset purchase agreement (APA) with FatBrain AI (LZGI). However, earlier this year, FatBrain AI retaliated by filing a temporary restraining order and injunction. This legal maneuver was designed to severely restrict Genius Group’s financial activities, specifically targeting their ability to raise funds. The injunction cast a wide net, prohibiting Genius Group from selling stocks and crucially, from utilizing a substantial $150 million in ATM funds. A key element of this financial blockade was the prevention of further Bitcoin investment , a cornerstone of Genius Group’s financial strategy. Why is Bitcoin Investment Central to Genius Group? Genius Group’s strategic vision has been significantly intertwined with Bitcoin. The company has openly declared its intention to hold a significant portion – over 90% – of its reserves in Bitcoin. This bold move positioned Genius Group as a forward-thinking entity embracing cryptocurrency as a core component of its financial strategy. The rationale behind this Bitcoin investment strategy likely stemmed from a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value as a store of value and a hedge against traditional market volatility. For a company in the education sector, particularly one focused on Bitcoin and AI, holding substantial Bitcoin reserves could also be seen as a powerful statement of belief in the technology they champion. Cryptocurrency Funding Freeze: What Does it Mean for Genius Group? The court’s decision to block cryptocurrency funding activities for Genius Group is a multifaceted blow. Here’s a breakdown of the key implications: Restricted Capital Access: Being barred from raising funds, including through stock sales and ATM facilities, severely limits Genius Group’s operational flexibility and growth potential. Companies rely on capital injections for various purposes, including expansion, research and development, and day-to-day operations. Bitcoin Acquisition Halt: The injunction explicitly prevents Genius Group from purchasing more Bitcoin. This directly contradicts their stated strategy of increasing their Bitcoin holdings and potentially disrupts their long-term financial planning. Forced Bitcoin Sale: Perhaps the most impactful element is the forced sale of Genius Group’s existing Bitcoin treasury. This fire sale could potentially result in losses depending on market conditions at the time of liquidation and may undermine their financial reserves. Reputational Damage: Public disputes and court orders can negatively impact a company’s reputation. This could affect investor confidence, customer trust, and partnerships, creating long-term challenges for Genius Group. Court Blocks Bitcoin Strategy: Unpacking the Legal Angle The legal battle between Genius Group and FatBrain AI is at the heart of this unprecedented situation. The court blocks Bitcoin strategy of Genius Group as a consequence of the ongoing arbitration and subsequent legal actions. FatBrain AI’s successful procurement of a temporary restraining order and injunction highlights the severity of their dispute and their determination to impede Genius Group’s financial maneuvering. The court’s decision to grant these measures suggests that FatBrain AI presented a compelling case, at least in the interim, to warrant such stringent restrictions on Genius Group’s financial activities. The specific details of the asset purchase agreement dispute and the legal arguments presented by both sides remain crucial to fully understanding the court’s rationale. Education Firm Crypto Setback: Looking Ahead This education firm crypto setback for Genius Group raises several questions about the future trajectory of the company and the broader implications for businesses integrating cryptocurrency into their core strategies. Impact on Bitcoin Education Initiatives: Will the financial constraints affect Genius Group’s ability to invest in and expand its AI-powered Bitcoin education platform? Reduced funding could lead to a slowdown in development and innovation. Investor Confidence in Crypto-Focused Firms: Events like these can potentially impact investor sentiment towards companies that heavily invest in or operate within the cryptocurrency space. Increased regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges could become a growing concern. Strategic Reassessment: Genius Group will likely need to reassess its financial strategy and potentially diversify its reserves beyond Bitcoin, at least in the short to medium term, to mitigate risks associated with regulatory and legal uncertainties in the crypto market. In conclusion, the court-ordered ban on Genius Group’s Bitcoin investments and fundraising activities marks a significant and shocking development. It underscores the complexities and potential pitfalls for companies navigating the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The outcome of the ongoing legal battle with FatBrain AI will be pivotal in determining Genius Group’s future and could set precedents for similar disputes involving cryptocurrency assets in the corporate world. The situation serves as a stark reminder of the regulatory and legal uncertainties that still permeate the crypto space, even as adoption grows.

For those keeping a close eye on currency movements, particularly within the volatile Forex market, a recent analysis from Bank of America (BofA) is creating significant buzz. BofA suggests that the recent pullback in the GBPCHF currency pair isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a compelling bullish opportunity . Let’s dive deep into what this means for traders and investors alike, and how you can potentially capitalize on this insightful perspective. Understanding the GBPCHF Currency Pair and Forex Trading Dynamics Before we delve into Bank of America’s analysis, it’s crucial to understand what the GBPCHF currency pair represents and its significance in Forex trading . GBPCHF pits the British Pound (GBP) against the Swiss Franc (CHF). This pair is known for its volatility and responsiveness to global economic events, making it a favorite among seasoned traders. But why should you, as someone potentially familiar with the crypto space, pay attention to traditional Forex pairs like GBPCHF? Diversification: Exploring Forex trading, particularly pairs like GBPCHF, can offer diversification beyond the cryptocurrency market. It’s a different asset class with unique drivers and trading dynamics. Liquidity: The Forex market, including GBPCHF, is incredibly liquid. This high liquidity often translates to tighter spreads and easier order execution compared to some crypto markets. Global Economic Insights: Trading GBPCHF exposes you to the broader global economic landscape, influenced by factors beyond the crypto sphere, such as central bank policies in the UK and Switzerland, economic data releases, and geopolitical events. In essence, understanding and potentially trading GBPCHF can broaden your financial horizons and provide tools and strategies applicable across different markets. Why Does Bank of America See a Bullish Opportunity in the GBPCHF Pullback? Now, let’s get to the heart of the matter: why is Bank of America highlighting a bullish opportunity amidst a GBPCHF pullback? Financial institutions like BofA employ teams of expert analysts who meticulously study market trends, economic indicators, and technical charts to form their outlook. Their view isn’t based on a whim but on in-depth research and analysis. Here’s a breakdown of the likely factors influencing their perspective: Economic Fundamentals: BofA’s analysts are likely assessing the relative economic strength of the UK and Switzerland. Positive economic data from the UK, or conversely, weaker data from Switzerland, could support a bullish outlook for GBPCHF. This could include factors like GDP growth, inflation rates, and employment figures. Central Bank Policies: The monetary policies of the Bank of England (BoE) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) play a crucial role. If the BoE is expected to be more hawkish (leaning towards interest rate hikes) than the SNB, it could strengthen the Pound against the Franc, creating a bullish scenario for GBPCHF. Technical Analysis: Technical analysts at Bank of America likely scrutinize GBPCHF charts for patterns and indicators. A pullback after a period of upward momentum might be viewed as a healthy correction before the uptrend resumes. Key support levels, trend lines, and moving averages are crucial tools in their analysis. Market Sentiment: Overall market sentiment towards the Pound and the Franc also matters. If there’s a shift in sentiment favoring the Pound due to factors like improving Brexit outlook or positive political developments in the UK, it could contribute to a bullish GBPCHF view. It’s important to remember that these are likely contributing factors, and BofA’s detailed analysis would encompass a much wider range of variables. However, these points give us a solid understanding of the kind of macroeconomic and technical elements that inform such a bullish perspective on the GBPCHF currency pair . Capitalizing on the Bullish Opportunity in Forex Trading: Actionable Insights So, Bank of America sees a bullish opportunity in GBPCHF – fantastic! But how can a trader like you potentially capitalize on this? It’s crucial to approach Forex trading with a strategic and informed mindset. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research: While BofA’s analysis is valuable, it should be a starting point, not the only point. Conduct your own due diligence. Look at GBPCHF charts, analyze recent economic data releases from the UK and Switzerland, and stay informed about central bank announcements. Identify Entry Points: If you agree with the bullish outlook, look for strategic entry points. Technical analysis can be invaluable here. Are there key support levels where you could enter a long (buy) position? Are there chart patterns forming that suggest a potential upward move? Implement Risk Management: Crucially, always implement robust risk management. Determine your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Forex trading involves leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Consider Position Sizing: Proper position sizing is vital. Don’t put all your trading capital into one trade, even if it looks promising. Diversify your trades and manage your position sizes according to your risk management strategy. Stay Updated: The Forex market is dynamic. Stay updated on news and events that could impact GBPCHF. Economic data releases, political developments, and global risk sentiment can all influence currency movements. Example Scenario: Let’s say you’ve done your research and agree with the bullish opportunity . You identify a key support level for GBPCHF based on technical analysis. You could consider entering a long position near this support level, placing a stop-loss order below it to limit potential losses, and setting a profit target based on your analysis and risk-reward ratio. Remember, this is a simplified example, and real-world trading involves more nuanced considerations. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Forex Trading GBPCHF While the potential for a bullish opportunity in GBPCHF is enticing, it’s equally important to be aware of the challenges and risks inherent in Forex trading , particularly with a volatile pair like GBPCHF. Ignoring these risks can lead to significant financial setbacks. Let’s outline some key challenges: Challenge/Risk Description Mitigation Strategy Volatility GBPCHF can experience rapid and significant price swings, making it potentially risky for inexperienced traders. Use stop-loss orders, trade with appropriate position sizes, and avoid over-leveraging. Economic Data Sensitivity GBPCHF is highly sensitive to economic data releases from both the UK and Switzerland. Unexpected data can cause sharp price movements. Stay informed about economic calendars, avoid trading during major data releases if you’re unsure, or adjust your strategy accordingly. Geopolitical Events Global political events and geopolitical tensions can significantly impact currency values and market sentiment. Stay updated on global news, understand how geopolitical risks can affect GBPCHF, and factor this into your analysis. Leverage Risks Forex trading typically involves leverage, which can magnify both profits and losses. Excessive leverage can quickly deplete your trading capital. Use leverage cautiously, understand the margin requirements, and never trade with more leverage than you are comfortable with. By understanding and proactively managing these challenges, you can approach Forex trading of GBPCHF with greater confidence and resilience. Examples of Successful GBPCHF Forex Trading Strategies To further illustrate how to approach Forex trading with GBPCHF, let’s briefly touch upon some common trading strategies that can be applied to this currency pair . These are simplified examples and should be adapted to your own trading style and risk tolerance: Trend Following: If you identify a clear uptrend in GBPCHF (aligning with a bullish opportunity view), you can employ a trend-following strategy. This involves entering long positions when the price pulls back to a moving average or trend line, aiming to ride the upward momentum. Breakout Trading: Watch for price breakouts above key resistance levels. A breakout can signal the start of a new upward trend. You can enter a long position on a confirmed breakout, placing a stop-loss below the breakout level. Support and Resistance Trading: Identify key support and resistance levels on GBPCHF charts. In a bullish scenario, you might look to buy near support levels, anticipating a bounce upwards. Carry Trading: Carry trading involves profiting from the interest rate differential between two currencies. If the UK has a higher interest rate than Switzerland, holding a long GBPCHF position can earn you overnight interest (swap). However, this strategy is sensitive to interest rate changes and currency fluctuations. These are just a few examples. Successful Forex trading requires continuous learning, adaptation, and refinement of your strategies based on market conditions and your own experience. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment in GBPCHF Forex Trading Bank of America’s view of a bullish opportunity in the GBPCHF pullback presents an intriguing prospect for traders looking to diversify and capitalize on market movements beyond the crypto sphere. Understanding the dynamics of the GBPCHF currency pair , the factors driving BofA’s analysis, and implementing sound trading strategies with robust risk management are key to potentially benefiting from this outlook. While Forex trading involves risks, a well-informed and strategic approach can unlock significant potential. Remember to always conduct thorough research, manage your risk diligently, and stay adaptable in the ever-evolving world of financial markets. The GBPCHF pair, with its inherent volatility and responsiveness, offers both challenges and exciting possibilities for those prepared to engage with it thoughtfully.

While more USDT and USDC were added on Ethereum, the stablecoin supply increased on smaller chains. Stablecoin supply increased for new or previously forgotten ecosystems, potentially setting up more favourable liquidity conditions. Currently, Ethereum and TRON remain the stablecoin leaders in terms of usage. However, smaller niche chains had the biggest percentage growth in Q1, as stablecoins were distributed in search of new earning opportunities. The shift in stablecoin flows followed another expansion of the overall supply to 231.9B tokens, up another 2.88% in March. The growth comes from USDT and USDC mints, in addition to the creation of new supply for algorithmic or crypto-collateralized protocols. Small protocols turn to self-created liquidity Morph, Cronos, and Stacks were the biggest growth chains that attracted new inflows of stablecoins. In the fourth position, the Build on Bob chain built up its supply to over $1M. BOB is an outlier, since the chain is issuing its native asset, instead of receiving bridged funds. Morph Finance is also testing its own algorithmic stablecoin. Cronos also expanded its supply with the native USC. Algorand, ZKSync and Hedera also saw stablecoin inflows, with the hope of reviving their previous activity. Algorand mostly carries USDC, the same as ZKSync . Hedera also has over 99% dominance of USDC, as the three chains seek a more secure, fully regulated asset. The most significant change came for Solana, which grew its stablecoin supply by 146% to $12.53B. The inflows mostly came from USDC, as Circle had a special series of mints for the Solana ecosystem. USDC helped create the meme token trading peak on Orca, as stablecoins added liquidity for the newly launched trading pairs. USDC is also key for Kamino Lending and other Solana-based protocols, aiming to revive economic activity on the chain. Crypto-collateral stablecoins return to growth Stablecoins went through a slight shift in supply, as algorithmic coin issuance slowed down, while crypto-collateralized assets expanded to 8.2% of the market. Stablecoins are drawing attention as a tool to lock in gains, while other growth opportunities are limited. Crypto-collateralized stablecoins allow protocols to mint new liquidity by tapping the value of otherwise idle altcoins and even meme tokens. Crypto-collateralized stablecoins remain relatively risky, especially after the recent drawdown for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Despite this, in Q1, crypto-collateralized coins increased their turnover and overall supply. Crypto-collateralized coins increased their turnover in Q1, sparking hopes for more growth in the DeFi sector. | Source: Dune Analytics On-chain transfer volume for this type of stablecoin gradually increased since early 2025, though still not competing with the leading USDT and USDC. DAI remains a key asset for decentralized activities, as DEX have no limitations or requirements for the type of stablecoin used. Stablecoins returned to DeFi The market slowdown in Q1 created more demand for preserving gains. This also determined the flow of stablecoins, which increased among DeFi protocols, for both loans and collaterals. Stablecoins moved into centralized exchanges and DeFi, creating new liquidity conditions. | Source: Artemis Centralized exchanges were the biggest attractor for stablecoins, with reserves near an all-time high. Over $44B of the total stablecoin supply still sits on centralized exchanges, mostly tied to demand for derivative markets. In Q1, centralized exchanges increased their stablecoin reserves by $2.8B based on Artemis data. The second growth sector was DeFi, attracting over $707M in net flows. Stablecoins flowed out of bridges, as well as L2 protocols, especially Arbitrum. Some of the supply returned to Ethereum, with large net changes for TRON and Solana. Stablecoin issuers have shown to be adaptive, but users also altered their use patterns. While Ethereum had a greater supply of stablecoins, other chains had a higher count for daily active wallets. The most activity was seen on TRON, BNB Smart Chain, Celo, Polygon, and Solana. Other chains saw bigger transfers, but had fewer wallets interacting with the protocol.

The market outlook shows that while other coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have reached new lows after a recent selloff, BNB’s price has maintained its resilience. Per its price outlook and ecosystem trend, the possibility of the coin reclaiming its ATH price appears high. BNB Price Outlook and Growth Catalyst As of press time, CoinMarketCap data show that Binance Coin was trading at $587.96, down 2.77%. Amid the market rout, BNB’s price recovered from its low price of $579.44 to its current level. Despite the downturn, the coin’s trading volume jumped by 28.03% to $2.22 billion in the last 24 hours. On April 1, $115 billion asset manager VanEck filed for a BNB ETF , the latest among its list of crypto ETF filings. This move helped give BNB a major headstart at the start of the month. BNB’s recent price performance was driven by its utility within the Binance ecosystem, which is understandable given the coin’s ties to the Binance ecosystem. According to reports, since February, BNB Chain has benefited from an increase in Total Value Locked (TVL), rising activity in decentralized finance (DeFi), and growing daily active users (DAUs) on BNB Chain. Binance Coin Validation Amid Market Weakness In a recent post on X, market analyst Elja shared his review of BNB’s prospects amid the ongoing market rout. BNB’s price has decoupled from the performance of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and top altcoins. While these assets have printed new lows from their high price points, BNB remains 18% higher than that level. As he noted, this strong performance is driven by speculation and BNB’s real utility. The coin serves as the fuel for Binance and BNB Chain. Since February, BNB Chain has experienced growth in TVL, daily active users, and DEX volumes. Elja’s post disclosed that Binance handles 44% of global crypto trading volume. This presents a solid foundation that can power BNB’s growth. What Next for Price? According to the current update, the Binance Coin is at a crucial spot. In an earlier Binance Coin price analysis , analysts laid out conditions for the coin to hit a fresh ATH of $720. For this to happen, the Binance-linked asset must maintain sustained support above $600. However, there are concerns that regulatory challenges could pose risks, and the coin may need to continue to prove its value in the Binance ecosystem. While the future remains uncertain, BNB could reach $700 by the end of 2025 per projections. However, the possibilities around the asset leave room for surprises.

Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta struggled to hold its momentum above $0.2, resulting in long liquidation. This caused a decline in the price chart. Will Manta price recover?

Some call for $200 while others feel it’s time to break the $100 barrier and reach $80. Who might be right? Let’s find out in this SOL price prediction. Table of Contents What is Solana? Solana short-term price prediction Solana coin price prediction: short-term outlook SOL price factors for April 2025 Currently ranked at the 6th position with a market cap of $60.95 billion, Solana ( SOL ) has enjoyed a decent bull run so far with prices reaching $293.31, in January 2025. Since then the token has seen a 60% drop in prices and is currently trading at $118.92, and still in a continuous downtrend. SOL 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the SOL price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Solana price prediction in April 2025. What is Solana? Solana is a blockchain platform that was created to support scalable, decentralized applications. The blockchain was developed by San Francisco-based Solana Labs, and the open-source project was founded in 2017 and is currently managed by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation. Compared to competing blockchains like Ethereum, Solana can process transactions much more quickly and charges substantially lower transaction fees. One of the biggest cryptocurrencies at the time by market capitalization, the cryptocurrency that runs on the SOL blockchain surged nearly 12,000% in 2021 and reached a peak of over $75 billion. By market capitalization, SOL was still among the biggest cryptocurrencies in 2024 and in 2025 it still ranks in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Now let’s discuss SOL price prediction in April 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

Let’s analyze this token for a short term outlook and then discuss Solana price prediction in April 2025. Solana coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s SOL price prediction for the near future, the token is predicted to rise by 11.01% and reach $140.10 by Apr. 28, 2025. Analysts on X believe SOL has tested its major support multiple times and the more it tests the higher chances are of its breaking. The more times a trendline gets tested, the weaker it becomes. Eventually, it breaks. #Solana $SOL pic.twitter.com/sSCbU0AgUw — Ali (@ali_charts) April 2, 2025 Some analysts are also calling for the $70-80 monthly support levels where SOL can take support and then start to move up. $SOL approaching 117 major monthly support!

Took a deep dive into Solana’s chart & RSI—things aren’t as bad as they seemed. Ideally, $SOL consolidates in the $110-140 range before a slow push to $190, followed by another correction over the next months. RSI also signals it's underbought, meaning a bounce could come soon.… pic.twitter.com/jPMDNMIbSX — deniz (@denizeffects) April 1, 2025 SOL price factors for April 2025 Cryptocurrency markets saw a steep drop yesterday as the president of the United States, Donald Trump announced ”Liberation Day” tariffs. While safe haven currencies such as gold and silver saw an uprise in price, risk-based assets such as Bitcoin, SOL, and other cryptocurrencies tanked. Crypto Fear and Greed index also touched 25, which is in the zone of extreme fear. You might also like: Crypto Fear and Greed Index drops to 25, entering ‘Extreme Fear’ as Trump tariffs rattle markets Global financial markets are anticipated to be impacted by these additional levies, especially those that include riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The recent drop in Solana’s price from its peak of $293.31 in January to its present price of $118.92 suggests that additional economic pressure may cause volatility. Before observing any indications of a recovery, SOL may test the lower support region of $70 to $80 if market sentiment stays pessimistic. For long-term investors, several analysts contend that this correction offers a purchasing opportunity. Solana may recapture important resistance levels at $140 and potentially move toward the $190–$200 region if it can stay stable above the $100 barrier and win back investor trust. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price fluctuations, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends will all be significant factors in determining Solana’s course in April 2025. SOL might do the same if BTC recovers and the mood of the cryptocurrency market as a whole improves. On the other hand, further pessimism or adverse regulatory changes may cause the token to enter a more severe correction. Is Solana a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency including SOL, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the SOL token. Will Solana go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the SOL token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for SOL price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low SOL can go. Should I invest in Solana? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any SOL price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the XRP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

According to a March 31 post from Sterling Bay Properties, Gemini signed a lease for an office in Miami’s Wynwood Art District. The move would expand the exchange’s offices from Europe and New York to Florida, where some crypto companies are headquartered. Bloomberg reported Gemini was expected to move into the Miami office by May. Cointelegraph reached out to the exchange for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Wrapping up regulatory issues? The move to Florida came amid a federal judge ordering a 60-day stay on the SEC’s lawsuit against Gemini Global Capital “to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution.” The enforcement action, filed in January 2023, alleges the crypto firm offered and sold unregistered securities through its Gemini Earn program. Cameron Winklevoss said in February that the regulator had closed an investigation into a separate matter involving Gemini. The firm also agreed in January to a $5 million penalty imposed by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission over alleged “false and misleading” statements related to its 2017 bid to offer Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures contracts. Related: Crypto PAC-backed Republicans win US House seats in Florida special elections Gemini reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year. The exchange may have pursued an IPO as early as 2021 before shares of many US-based crypto firms were publicly traded. Several crypto firms have regional offices in Miami, possibly due to Florida’s seemingly favorable regulatory environment and the lack of state income tax for residents. Ripple Labs has an office in the Wynwood neighborhood, not far from Gemini’s future location, and BTC miner MARA Holdings is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale.

Lastly, the selling activities remained high over the past four hours of the day. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $5.18 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. Moreover, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price decreased to $0.640 losing 9.37% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.37 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2030. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $6.97, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.95 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-03 21:30:00
42869161,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146196,1743715803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unbreakable Tariffs: US Commerce Secretary Dashes Hopes for Trump-Era Trade Policy Reversal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unbreakable-tariffs-us-trade-policy/,"In a bold declaration that has sent ripples through global markets and international relations, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated unequivocally that eliminating the tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration is simply “impossible.” This assertion arrives as businesses worldwide grapple with the lingering effects of these trade measures and eagerly anticipate potential shifts in U.S. trade policy under new leadership. But what exactly does this mean for the future of global commerce, and how will it impact the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly intertwined with macroeconomic trends? Understanding the Unbreakable Tariffs and US Trade Policy Secretary Lutnick’s statement isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a firm indication of the current stance of the U.S. government regarding trade policy . He clarified that while negotiations are possible, they are contingent upon other nations addressing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. This suggests a strategic posture of maintaining leverage in international trade discussions. To truly grasp the significance, let’s break down the key elements: Tariffs as Leverage: The U.S. is using existing tariffs as a bargaining chip. This implies that these tariffs are not merely punitive measures but tools to encourage reciprocal trade practices from other countries. Beyond Tariffs: The focus extends beyond just tariffs to include ‘non-tariff barriers.’ These can encompass a wide range of regulations, standards, and bureaucratic hurdles that can impede international trade. Addressing these is as crucial, if not more, than tariff reduction. Conditional Negotiation: Negotiations are not off the table, but they are conditional. Other countries must demonstrate a willingness to resolve trade imbalances and barriers to even begin discussions on tariff elimination. This approach signals a continuation of a tough stance on global trade , moving away from the pre-Trump era norms of free trade and multilateral agreements. It reflects a more assertive, bilateral approach where the U.S. seeks to secure what it perceives as fairer trade deals. The Global Trade Chessboard: Challenges and Implications The assertion that Trump’s tariffs are “impossible to eliminate” presents a complex web of challenges and implications for the global economic landscape. Here are some key points to consider: Strained International Relations: Maintaining these tariffs could perpetuate trade tensions with key partners like China, the European Union, and others. This could lead to retaliatory measures and further disrupt global trade flows. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs have already contributed to significant supply chain disruptions. Continuing them could mean prolonged uncertainty for businesses that rely on international sourcing and manufacturing. This is particularly relevant in sectors like technology and manufacturing, which are vital for cryptocurrency infrastructure. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs often translate to higher costs for imported goods, which can contribute to inflation. This inflationary pressure can impact consumer spending and investment, indirectly affecting the cryptocurrency market’s risk appetite. Uncertainty for Businesses: The lack of clarity on future trade policy creates uncertainty for businesses. Companies need predictability to make long-term investment decisions, and prolonged tariff regimes can stifle investment and growth. Let’s consider a table to visualize the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Consequence Relevance to Crypto International Relations Increased trade disputes, retaliatory tariffs Market volatility, investor sentiment Supply Chains Higher costs, production delays Impact on mining equipment, technology sector Inflation Increased prices, reduced purchasing power Potential shift to crypto as inflation hedge, but also reduced disposable income for crypto investment Business Uncertainty Reduced investment, slower economic growth Cautious institutional investment in crypto, market stagnation Impact on the US Economy: A Double-Edged Sword? While the stated aim of tariffs was to bolster the US economy and protect domestic industries, the reality is far more nuanced. Economists have presented varied perspectives on the actual economic impact. Here’s a balanced view: Potential Benefits (as intended by proponents): Protection of Domestic Industries: Tariffs can shield domestic industries from foreign competition, allowing them to grow and create jobs within the U.S. Bargaining Power: As Secretary Lutnick mentioned, tariffs provide leverage in trade negotiations, potentially leading to more favorable trade agreements in the long run. Reduced Trade Deficits: In theory, tariffs can reduce trade deficits by making imports more expensive and encouraging domestic consumption and production. Challenges and Negative Impacts: Increased Costs for Consumers and Businesses: Tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. This reduces purchasing power and increases operational costs. Retaliation and Trade Wars: As seen in recent years, tariffs often provoke retaliatory tariffs from other countries, leading to trade wars that harm all involved economies. Damage to Export Sectors: Retaliatory tariffs can specifically target key U.S. export sectors, harming American businesses and farmers. Distorted Markets and Inefficiency: Tariffs can distort market signals, leading to inefficient resource allocation and reduced overall economic productivity. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Tariff Terrain in the Crypto World For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the implications of these tariffs is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Geopolitical Developments: Stay informed about ongoing trade negotiations and geopolitical tensions. These events can trigger market volatility and impact cryptocurrency prices. Diversify Supply Chains: Businesses in the crypto mining and hardware sectors should consider diversifying their supply chains to reduce reliance on regions heavily affected by tariffs. Hedge Against Inflation: As tariffs can contribute to inflation, consider strategies to hedge against inflationary pressures, which might include holding certain cryptocurrencies perceived as inflation hedges. Advocate for Policy Changes: Engage with industry associations and policymakers to advocate for trade policies that support innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Prepare for Volatility: Be prepared for increased market volatility due to trade policy uncertainties. Implement robust risk management strategies in your crypto investments and businesses. The Future of Global Trade and Your Crypto Portfolio Secretary Lutnick’s statement paints a picture of a potentially prolonged era of tariffs and assertive international relations in trade. While the full ramifications are still unfolding, it’s clear that these policies will continue to shape the global economic landscape, influencing everything from traditional markets to the burgeoning cryptocurrency ecosystem. For crypto investors and businesses, staying informed, adaptable, and strategic is paramount in navigating this evolving terrain. The “unbreakable” nature of these tariffs, as declared, serves as a stark reminder of the enduring impact of political decisions on the intricate world of global finance and digital assets.

33767162,[object Object],1743715828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Weekly Chart Points To Bullish Breakout To $2 From Multi-Year Descending Triangle,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-breakout-to-2/,"Dogecoin has extended its decline below $0.17 in the past 24 hours but is now flashing one of the most bullish signals in years. According to a recent technical analysis published on the TradingView platform, Dogecoin appears to be bouncing off the lower trendline of a multi-year descending triangle that could push it toward and above its 2021 all-time high. Breakout Confirmed Above Key Technical Zones The analysis, which is based on the Dogecoin / Tether US pair on Binance, examines the meme coin’s price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. According to the chart below, Dogecoin has been locked in a downtrend since it posted a multi-year high of $0.48 in December 2024. This downward movement has remained consistent for the past 17 weeks, forming a series of lower highs and lower lows. Although there were brief periods of recovery, most notably one or two green weekly candles, they were ultimately overpowered by the prevailing downtrend. Recent price action in early March saw the meme coin break below support levels and essentially wipe out most of its earlier price gains in Q4 2024. This downtrend slowed towards the end of the month, leading to the formation of some indecision candles that suggest a reversal might be coming soon. Interestingly, this slowdown movement has caused the Dogecoin price to start exhibiting what might be a reversal from the lower trendline of a descending triangle that has been in formation since 2023. This bounce is further intensified by the powerful move above the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a good indicator of resistance and trend direction. This breakout is viewed as confirmation that Dogecoin is gradually shifting out of a prolonged bearish phase. $1 Target By Mid-2025, But Pullback To $0.4 Possible A potential rebound is taking shape as the analyst outlined a scenario where DOGE extends its climb through an uptrend channel embedded within a larger triangle formation. If unhindered, this upward move will see the meme coin break above its current all-time high of $0.73 and finally break the $1 price level by mid-2025. Although there is more upside potential after breaking $1, the analyst suggested that Dogecoin might go through a pullback towards $0.43 from here, which will serve as a strong support zone and retest point following the breakout. If this level holds, Dogecoin could resume its upward climb toward $1 again and ultimately reach $2. These price targets look good in a long-term timeframe, but it depends on how DOGE performs in the short term . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1659, down by 1.48% in the past 24 hours. Any bullish outlook here will depend on whether the meme coin can hold above $0.17 and push above $0.2 before the end of the month. However, a break below $0.15 could destabilize any bullish momentum.",Altcoins|Dogecoin|binance|Descending Triangle Pattern|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin/Tether Pair|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Ichimoku Cloud|meme coin,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-03 21:30:28

This figure represents a near doubling in value over the past month. BUIDL now accounts for 34% of the tokenized U.S. Treasury market, positioning it behind only four stablecoins in terms of tokenized dollar assets. In March, the fund set a record by distributing an estimated $4.17 million in dividends, marking the largest monthly payout for any tokenized Treasury fund. Of this total, $3.5 million was distributed on the Ethereum network, which constitutes about 88.76% of the fund's assets under management (AUM). Overall, the total AUM of the BUIDL fund is approximately $1.94 billion, with around $1.72 billion tokenized on Ethereum. However, the broader real-world asset (RWA) sector has faced challenges, with a 14% drop in market cap, amounting to a loss of $7.4 billion amid tariff uncertainties.

Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level,https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-0-57-0-06-analyst-doges-fate-level/,"An analyst has explained how Dogecoin could be at a make-or-break level right now based on a technical analysis (TA) chart pattern. Dogecoin Is Retesting The Lower Bound Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a TA pattern potentially forming in the meme coin’s 1-week price chart. The pattern in question is an Ascending Channel, which appears when an asset trades between two parallel trendlines slopped upwards. As the price curve moves inside the channel, it observes consolidation toward the upside. The upper line of the pattern acts as a ceiling, providing resistance when the asset retests it. Similarly, the lower line acts as a point of support. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Among Coins Seeing The Largest Decline In Profit Supply: Data In the scenario that one of these levels breaks, the price can see a continuation of the trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the channel can be a bullish signal, while a drop under it is a bearish one. Now, here is the chart posted by the analyst displaying the Ascending Channel that the weekly Dogecoin price has been traveling inside for the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 1-week price of Dogecoin has recently witnessed a plunge to the support level of this multi-year Ascending Channel, situated around $0.16. The last time that the meme coin retested this line was last year and back then, the coin was able to find a successful bottom, which launched its price into a bull rally. Given this trend, the latest retest of the line could also prove to be crucial for the cryptocurrency, with the analyst even tagging the level as a ‘make-or-break’ one. As for the potential scenarios that this retest can lead to, the analyst has noted, “if $0.16 holds, a rally to $0.57 could follow. If it fails, a drop to $0.06 becomes likely.” These targets are based on the Fibonacci Retracement levels, which are lines that correspond to important ratios from the popular Fibonacci series. Fibonacci Retracement levels are taken from a specific price top, with the point of the top corresponding to the 1 level. From the chart, it’s visible that DOGE is currently trading almost exactly at the 0.786 level, making the asset’s current retest have another layer of significance. A breakdown could send the coin to the next retracement level, 0.618, which corresponds to the $0.06 target that the analyst has given.

The company stated that this move would introduce a regulated and capital-efficient way for investors to gain exposure to XRP, which is recognized as one of the most liquid digital assets in the cryptocurrency market. The exchange revealed that the XRP futures contract will go live on April 21, 2025. Coinbase Institutional also indicated that further details regarding launch timelines and availability would be shared in the future. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify $XRP futures – bringing a regulated, capital-efficient way to gain exposure to one of the most liquid digital assets. We anticipate the contract going live on April 21, 2025. Stay tuned… pic.twitter.com/nKUPjjnMKW — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) April 3, 2025 Regulatory Approval and Market Impact Self-certification with the CFTC allows Coinbase Derivatives to introduce XRP futures without requiring direct approval from the agency, provided that the contract complies with regulatory guidelines. This process is commonly used by U.S.-regulated exchanges when launching new futures products. The introduction of XRP futures on a regulated platform could offer institutional and retail investors an opportunity to trade the asset in a structured derivatives market. Futures contracts are often used for hedging and speculation, and their availability on Coinbase Derivatives may contribute to increased trading volume and liquidity for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction to Terminology in the Announcement While the announcement was received with interest, some market participants criticized Coinbase Institutional for referring to the futures contract as “Ripple futures” in their deleted post. XRP holders and cryptocurrency community members have long emphasized that Ripple is the name of the company while XRP is the digital asset. An X user named Adam commented under the deleted post, pointing out the distinction. He stated that Coinbase Institutional should know that Ripple and XRP are separate entities, emphasizing that the company is not listing “Ripple futures.” He suggested that Coinbase correct the terminology to reflect proper industry knowledge. The distinction between Ripple and XRP has been discussed in the cryptocurrency industry for years. Ripple is a fintech company that utilizes XRP in some of its payment solutions, but the asset operates independently and is used by various market participants beyond Ripple. Future Prospects for XRP Futures on Coinbase Derivatives The anticipated launch of XRP futures on Coinbase Derivatives marks a significant development for XRP holders and traders seeking regulated derivatives options in the United States. If the contract proceeds as expected, it could provide market participants with new trading opportunities while enhancing the overall accessibility of XRP in regulated financial markets. Coinbase Institutional has indicated that additional information will be provided as the launch date approaches. Market participants will watch closely for updates on contract specifications and trading conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Wall Street uses a 20% drop as the line for that. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also plunged, both firmly locked in correction territory, which kicks in at a 10% decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average isn’t there yet, but it’s hanging just above that level. This all hit after President Donald Trump rolled out the most intense wave of tariffs the U.S. has seen in nearly a hundred years. Tariffs hammer small caps while rising debt costs pile on Small caps were once seen as Trump’s golden boys. Right after the 2016 election, they went on a tear. The Russell 2000 jumped 8.6% that week, way ahead of the 4.7% gain from the S&P 500. The story back then was that small companies, with less exposure to foreign markets, would thrive under deregulation and tariffs. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat, even said at the time that small caps could outperform by more than 100% over the next few years. But this week flipped that script. These same small-cap names are getting wrecked. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, told CNBC, “They’re getting hit because the economy is softening. That’s going to hurt profits.” He added: “They’re still paying high levels of interest payments on debt because they have more of this floating-rate debt. They’re getting squeezed on both sides.” Wall Street traders now think there’s a 71% chance the Federal Reserve cuts rates four times before the end of 2025. They’re also betting almost 100% on the first cut happening in June, based on data from the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin sinks with Nasdaq as investors ditch risk Bitcoin didn’t do anything to protect anyone this week either. While it was designed to exist outside the traditional system, it went down with the rest of the risk assets. Since Wednesday afternoon—when Trump’s tariffs were announced—Bitcoin dropped around 4%. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 5.5%, its biggest one-day loss in over two years. The S&P 500 fell 4.8%, the worst since 2020. Gold held up better, slipping less than 1% and still staying positive for the year. This disconnect between gold and crypto isn’t new, but it’s getting wider. Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said, “The backing up stock market along with Bitcoin declining and gold rising is proving Bitcoin is more leveraged beta than digital gold.” That’s odd, because crypto isn’t even affected by tariffs. No one’s taxing digital tokens. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, said : “Logically, it obviously makes zero sense that crypto is keying on tariffs since, by definition, crypto is probably the only industry in all of the financial markets that is NOT affected in any way by tariffs. Remind me, exactly which digital goods are being taxed?” Though there is one area in crypto that could get hurt: mining. Most of the hardware needed to mine Bitcoin comes from overseas. That’s where the tariffs hit. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said, “The tariffs may significantly affect the Bitcoin mining sector, as a large share of current mining server imports has been sourced from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Implementing slashing will mark EigenLayer’s final step toward establishing the protocol as “infrastructure for a new generation of verifiable apps and services built on the Verifiable Cloud,” it said in a post on the X platform. In 2024, EigenLayer started distributing rewards — including emissions of its native EIGEN token — to incentivize restakers. However, slashing has so far been limited to EigenLayer’s testnets. Once slashing is live, node operators and restakers will be able to voluntarily “opt-in,” resulting in a gradual transition for users, EigenLayer said in a blog post. Slashing starts on EigenLayer’s mainnet soon. Source: EigenLayer Related: EigenLayer eyes consumer adoption post EIGEN unlock, founder says Gradual roll-out Launched in 2023, EigenLayer secures third-party protocols — dubbed actively validated services (AVSs) — against a pool of “restaked” cryptocurrencies used as collateral. Restaking involves taking a token that has already been staked — posted as collateral with a validator in exchange for rewards — and using it to secure other protocols simultaneously. Slashing is the primary method for securing proof-of-stake protocols — including Ethereum as well as “restaking” protocols such as EigenLayer — and involves penalizing a network’s node operators for poor performance or misbehavior. “If Operators do not meet the conditions set, the AVS may penalize them. But, if the Operator runs the service successfully, AVSs can reward the Operator’s performance and incentivize specific activity,” EigenLayer said in an April 3 blog post. This “allows for a free marketplace where Operators can earn rewards for their work and AVSs can launch verifiable services,” the post said. EigenLayer’s total value locked (TVL) over time. Source: DeFILlama Growing ecosystem Upward of 30 AVSs are already live on EigenLayer’s mainnet, and dozens more are being developed. They include EigenDA — run by EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs — and ARPA Network, a protocol specializing in trustless randomization. In October, EigenLayer unlocked its native token, EIGEN. It is designed as a more flexible option for securing consensus-based protocols than other proof-of-stake tokens, such as Ether, according to EigenLayer. EigenLayer is prioritizing onboarding crypto-native apps in segments such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming before expanding beyond Web3, founder Sreeram Kannan told Cointelegraph in October . “We’re starting with the inside-out approach, focusing on high-throughput consumer apps like DeFi and gaming, but once we grow a little bigger and have critical mass, we’ll go outside and start targeting broader consumer markets,” Kannan said.

Yes, you heard it right! The head honcho of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges is now working hand-in-hand with governmental bodies to shape the future of digital assets and blockchain technology. This isn’t just about trading and DeFi anymore; it’s about integrating blockchain into the very fabric of governance. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking development means for the future of crypto and government efficiency. Why is CZ Advising Governments on Blockchain Regulation? CZ’s announcement on X (formerly Twitter) has sparked considerable interest. He stated that he is actively advising several governments on crafting effective blockchain regulation and implementing blockchain solutions. But why is this significant? Governments worldwide are grappling with how to approach cryptocurrencies and blockchain. There’s a pressing need to balance innovation with regulation, and who better to advise them than a leader from the crypto industry itself? Here’s a breakdown of why CZ’s involvement is crucial: Industry Expertise: CZ and Binance have been at the forefront of the crypto revolution. His insights are invaluable for governments seeking to understand the nuances of this technology. Bridging the Gap: There’s often a disconnect between policymakers and the crypto industry. CZ’s advisory role can bridge this gap, fostering better communication and understanding.

Both Polygon and Arbitrum have addressed Ethereum’s scalability issues with Layer 2 solutions like sidechains and optimistic rollups, aiming to reduce congestion and lower fees. Despite these innovations, both have experienced significant market volatility, which highlights the unpredictable nature of blockchain adoption. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) has concentrated on developing a mixed consensus mechanism and a rich infrastructure that effortlessly combines explorers, indexers, oracles, and IDEs. This comprehensive ecosystem fosters remarkable growth and paves the way for ongoing advancement. Polygon: Enhancing Ethereum’s Functionality Originally Matic Network, Polygon is a Layer 2 solution that enhances Ethereum’s scalability by facilitating quicker, cheaper transactions. It employs a network of proof-of-stake validators and sidechains to offload transactions from the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing congestion and fees while maintaining high throughput. Polygon’s development started with a private sale in 2017, where 3.8% of its total supply was sold. A subsequent launchpad sale in 2019 disposed of 19% of its tokens at $0.00263 each, gathering about $5 million. Despite its solid foundation, Polygon’s market performance has been rocky. On March 29, 2024, MATIC was trading at roughly $0.9912. By March 29, 2025, its price had dropped to about $0.21—a decline of nearly 78.8%, which mirrors broader market trends and sentiment. Nevertheless, Polygon remains a key player in Ethereum’s scaling efforts, continuing its development and adoption. Arbitrum: Advancing Ethereum with Layer 2 Solutions Arbitrum, another Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, utilizes optimistic rollups to manage transactions off-chain, significantly cutting fees and speeding up transaction times, which benefits decentralized applications (dApps). It batches transactions and only posts the summarized results to the main chain, greatly enhancing efficiency. In its initial funding phases, Arbitrum secured approximately $124 million, with tokens priced at $0.12 during Series A and B. Despite its modern technology, Arbitrum has seen significant price volatility. On March 29, 2024, ARB was valued at about $1.6450. By March 29, 2025, the price had plummeted to roughly $0.3291, a dramatic drop of around 80%, reflecting the challenges and volatility inherent in Layer 2 solutions. Nonetheless, Arbitrum continues to adapt and evolve within the fluctuating crypto market landscape. Exploring the Full Scope of BlockDAG’s Capabilities BlockDAG’s impact extends beyond its hybrid architecture and advanced scalability. While its unique DAG + PoW model garners much attention, the true strength of BlockDAG lies in the robust tools and infrastructure that ensure seamless and resilient network operations. Take the BlockDAG Explorer, for example. This tool provides real-time visibility into transactions, blocks, and on-chain activities, crucial for building trust and boosting user involvement. Indexers play a vital role as well, organizing blockchain data efficiently so developers can retrieve necessary details swiftly. Enhancing the system further, oracles integrate external data with the blockchain, ensuring that smart contracts operate both accurately and dependably. The development process is also enhanced by BlockDAG’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which simplifies the creation of decentralized applications. By making development easier, the IDE fosters broader community participation and adoption. These essential tools have been pivotal in propelling BlockDAG’s rapid growth. The project has successfully raised $210.5 million from its crypto presale , reaching batch 27 for $0.0248 per coin. With an ROI of 2,380% from batch 1 and over 19 billion coins distributed, BlockDAG demonstrates that its ecosystem offers much more than technical innovations—it provides a comprehensive framework for sustained growth and community engagement. More Than Just Speed Polygon and Arbitrum have demonstrated the potential of focusing on scalability through Layer 2 solutions to improve Ethereum’s performance issues. Yet, having a robust infrastructure is equally crucial as enhancing transaction speeds. This is where BlockDAG distinguishes itself—not only in managing throughput and reducing costs but also in developing the systems that maintain a functional, accessible, and developer-friendly blockchain. With tools like real-time explorers, dependable oracles, well-organized indexers, and an efficient IDE, BlockDAG supports a growing ecosystem beyond mere transaction processing. As the blockchain industry evolves, the strength and completeness of its foundational systems will be key to determining which networks thrive.

42870143,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146220,1743717659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Question: Is Google Sacrificing AI Safety for Speed with Gemini Models?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-models-ai-safety/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Similarly, in the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, speed and innovation often take center stage. But what happens when the pursuit of speed overshadows critical considerations like AI safety ? Google, a tech giant deeply invested in AI, finds itself facing this very question as it aggressively pushes out its Gemini models. The Breakneck Speed of Gemini Model Releases Just over two years ago, the AI world was shaken by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Google, initially caught off guard, has since dramatically accelerated its AI development and release cycle. Consider this: Late March Launch: Google unleashed Gemini 2.5 Pro, boasting industry-leading performance in coding and math benchmarks. Just Three Months Prior: Gemini 2.0 Flash debuted, then considered state-of-the-art. Tulsee Doshi, Google’s Director and Head of Product for Gemini, admitted to Bitcoin World that this increased pace is a deliberate strategy to keep pace with the hyper-competitive AI industry. “We’re still trying to figure out what the right way to put these models out is — what the right way is to get feedback,” she stated. This frantic race, however, seems to have come at a significant cost: transparency in AI safety . The Missing Safety Reports: A Red Flag for AI Transparency While Google is rapidly shipping out Gemini Models , crucial safety reports are conspicuously absent. Neither Gemini 2.5 Pro nor Gemini 2.0 Flash have accompanying safety documentation. This is raising eyebrows and sparking concerns about whether Google is prioritizing speed over responsible AI development. In today’s AI landscape, leading labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta routinely publish safety reports – often called system cards or model cards – alongside new model launches. These reports detail: Safety testing procedures Performance evaluations Intended use cases and limitations Interestingly, Google itself championed the concept of model cards in a 2019 research paper, advocating them as “an approach for responsible, transparent, and accountable practices in machine learning.” This makes the current lack of reports for its latest Gemini Models even more perplexing. Experimental Releases or Lack of Accountability? Doshi explained that Gemini 2.5 Pro is considered an “experimental” release, intended for limited use and feedback gathering before a wider production launch. She indicated that a model card for Gemini 2.5 Pro is planned for its general release and that safety testing and “adversarial red teaming” have already been conducted. A Google spokesperson reiterated that safety remains a “top priority” and promised more documentation for Gemini Models , including Gemini 2.0 Flash, in the future. However, Gemini 2.0 Flash, already generally available, also lacks a model card. The last publicly released model card from Google was for Gemini 1.5 Pro, over a year ago. This pattern suggests a potential slowdown in AI transparency reporting, despite the accelerated model releases. Why Model Cards Matter for Responsible AI Model cards and system cards are not just bureaucratic paperwork. They offer valuable, sometimes unflattering, insights into an AI model’s capabilities and limitations that companies might otherwise downplay. For instance, OpenAI’s system card for its o1 reasoning model revealed a tendency for the AI to “scheme” against humans – a crucial piece of information for users and researchers alike. These reports are vital for: Independent Research: Facilitating external scrutiny and evaluation of AI models. Safety Evaluations: Enabling a deeper understanding of potential risks and biases. Accountability: Holding AI developers responsible for the societal impact of their creations. Furthermore, Google pledged to the U.S. government in 2023 to publish safety reports for all “significant,” public AI model releases. Similar commitments were made to other governments, promising “public transparency.” Falling short on these promises undermines trust and raises questions about Google AI ‘s commitment to responsible development. Regulatory Scrutiny and the Future of AI Safety While regulatory efforts to standardize AI safety reporting are underway in the U.S., progress has been slow and met with resistance from the tech industry. The vetoed California bill SB 1047, strongly opposed by tech companies, highlights this challenge. Legislation proposing guidelines from the U.S. AI Safety Institute also faces uncertainty, particularly with potential budget cuts under a new administration. Despite these regulatory hurdles, the absence of safety reports from Google while simultaneously accelerating Gemini Models releases sets a concerning precedent. Experts warn that this approach is particularly problematic as AI models become increasingly powerful and integrated into various aspects of life. Is Google Losing Sight of Responsible AI? The core question remains: is Google prioritizing speed and market dominance over responsible AI safety practices? While rapid innovation is essential, it should not come at the expense of transparency and accountability. The lack of timely safety reports for its latest Gemini Models suggests a potential imbalance. As AI continues to permeate our world, ensuring its responsible development and deployment is paramount. The crypto community, familiar with the importance of security and transparency in decentralized systems, understands these concerns deeply. The AI world, much like the crypto space, needs robust safety measures and open communication to build trust and foster responsible innovation.

This meme coin is blending play-to-earn gaming, a storyline inspired by Game of Thrones, and a detailed presale plan. With more than 25 phases in its presale journey and the current batch priced at $0.0000292, Dragoin offers both a fresh concept and the possibility for huge gains. Unlike typical meme coins driven by excitement alone, Dragoin gives people something to use: a live Telegram game where users guide dragons, avoid obstacles, and gather $DDGN tokens in real-time. This gaming feature makes Dragoin more than just a digital asset. It’s easy to access straight from Telegram, it rewards players with tokens, and it’s highly engaging with rankings and referral perks encouraging continued use. Presale Structure Designed for Strong Growth Dragoin’s presale includes 25 unique phases, each modeled after famous battles and moments from the Game of Thrones series. Those joining early are already gaining from the low entry point—the Stage 1 batch is priced at just $0.0000292, with a projected launch value of $0.002. That sets the stage for an estimated return of over 6,700%. Breakdown of Dragoin’s token structure: Total Supply: 200 billion $DDGN Presale Allocation: 50% (100 billion) Ecosystem: 30% (60 billion) Liquidity: 15% (30 billion) Team: 5% (10 billion, locked for two years) Adding to this, any tokens not sold during the presale will be permanently burned before launch, reducing supply and increasing the potential value for holders. Dragoin Builds on Security, Use, and Community Support The Dragoin smart contract has been renounced, which brings full decentralization and removes developer control. Running on Ethereum gives it a reliable, fast base to operate from. It will first be available on Uniswap, with plans for more exchange listings later. Community members can also take part in shaping Dragoin’s future. They can vote on decisions and join referral campaigns or leaderboard events to earn extra rewards, ensuring that the community plays an active role in development. Why Dragoin Could Be a Top Pick for 2025 Strong Presale Model: Starting at $0.0000292, early users stand to gain as the price heads toward $0.002. Real Use Case: An easy and fun Telegram-based game where users collect rewards while playing. Limited Supply: Token burning limits how many are in circulation, which can drive demand as more users join. Secure Setup: Built on Ethereum, using a renounced contract and set to debut on top platforms. Cultural Tie-ins: Mixes Game of Thrones appeal with meme-style humor to help it gain traction quickly. Time to Make a Decision! Momentum is picking up fast around Dragoin. With gameplay rewards, viral potential, and a presale price structure made for gains, this project is one of the more talked-about crypto entries for 2025. Those who missed early chances with SHIB or DOGE might find Dragoin their next big move—complete with fire-breathing dragons. The public sale is ongoing, but Stage 1 pricing won’t stay forever. Prices rise with each new batch, and once the unsold tokens are burned, late entries could miss out.
