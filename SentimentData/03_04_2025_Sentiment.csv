Galaxy Digital secures FCA approval, expands institutional trading reach in the UK Leon Marshall, chief executive officer of Galaxy Europe, said that the approval is a pivotal achievement for the Galaxy group, as it allows them to deliver innovative trading solutions to institutional clients while maintaining the highest regulatory standards. He noted: “London is a critical financial hub, and this authorisation allows us to deepen our presence in the UK, aligning with our mission to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem.” This FCA authorization represents a significant trading milestone for Galaxy Digital . It contributes to the firm’s established reputation for pioneering trading solutions for an institutional client base while satisfying stringent regulatory requirements. The approval contributes to Galaxy Digital’s growing regulatory footprint. The Company, which is headquartered in New York and has offices in Chicago, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, has a client base that includes over 1,300 institutional trading counterparties. Galaxy Digital expands as the UK strengthens its crypto-friendly stance Galaxy Digital is also planning to expand its workforce to meet the demand for digital asset services. With its roughly 40-employee team based in London, these developments align with the UK’s relatively forward-looking approach to the regulation of crypto assets, making the UK a destination for high investment and innovation. ​ Galaxy sees the FCA license as a major milestone that will enhance the company’s compliance efforts. It also positions the digital asset and blockchain firm to meet rising demand from the rapidly expanding institutional investor market. Marshall says the UK government has created a thriving environment for transformative technologies like digital assets. He believes the country is on the right track, with a strong push to attract innovation capital. He added that this clarity is drawing top talent, investment, and innovation to the region, bolstered by the nation’s deep talent pool, world-class academic institutions, and entrepreneurial spirit. Galaxy Digital recently made headlines after the New York Attorney General revealed a $200 million settlement over its involvement with LUNA. The firm also attracted bullish sentiment with its announcement of a 15-year artificial intelligence hosting deal with CoreWeave. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital’s derivatives trading license approval by the FCA comes amid a growing wave of institutional interest in digital assets. Traditional finance companies have also sought the FCA’s approval as crypto asset firms in the UK. One of the notable companies on this list is asset management giants like BlackRock.

After a five-year wait, CoinList , a prominent name in the cryptocurrency exchange and launchpad arena, is making a sensational comeback to the U.S. market. For those who’ve felt locked out due to political and regulatory hurdles, this news is nothing short of a breath of fresh air. But what exactly does this mean for you, and why should you be excited? Let’s dive into the details of CoinList’s triumphant return and explore the opportunities it unlocks. Why is CoinList US Returning Now? The big question on everyone’s mind is, why now? For half a decade, U.S.-based users have been on the sidelines, unable to access CoinList’s services. The platform cited political circumstances and regulatory issues as the reasons for their absence. Navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation in the United States has been a significant challenge for many cryptocurrency platforms. However, it seems the tides are turning, or at least, CoinList believes they have found a viable path forward. While specific details regarding the changed circumstances remain under wraps, this relaunch strongly suggests a more favorable regulatory environment or perhaps a refined strategy by CoinList to operate within the existing framework. This return signals a potentially positive shift in the accessibility of cryptocurrency platforms for US users. It suggests that despite the hurdles, there are pathways for platforms like CoinList to offer their services while adhering to regulatory requirements. This could pave the way for other platforms to reconsider or expand their operations in the US market, fostering greater competition and innovation. CoinList: More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Exchange For those unfamiliar, CoinList isn’t just another cryptocurrency exchange . It’s a platform renowned for its role as a launchpad for promising new crypto projects. Think of it as a springboard that propels innovative blockchain ventures into the crypto sphere. CoinList has a track record of hosting token sales for some of the most successful and well-known projects in the crypto space. This includes names like Filecoin, Solana, and Flow, all of which gained significant traction and are now major players in the industry. Here’s what makes CoinList stand out: Launchpad Expertise: CoinList specializes in identifying and launching high-potential crypto projects. Their rigorous vetting process aims to bring quality projects to their community. Early Access Opportunities: Participating in token sales on CoinList often provides early access to tokens at potentially favorable prices before they hit mainstream exchanges.

With its return to the US, US investors now regain access to this unique platform and the opportunities it offers. This is particularly exciting for those looking to get in on the ground floor of promising crypto projects. Token Sale Alert: DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) To mark its U.S. relaunch, CoinList is immediately jumping into action with a token sale for the DoubleZero Foundation (2Z). According to reports from The Block, this sale is scheduled to run from April 2nd to April 22nd. This isn’t just a symbolic event; it’s a real opportunity for accredited investors in the U.S. to participate in a new token offering right out of the gate. Key details of the DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) Token Sale: Aspect Details Project DoubleZero Foundation (2Z) Platform CoinList Sale Dates April 2nd – April 22nd Eligibility Accredited Investors in the U.S. If you are an accredited investor in the U.S. and are looking to explore new investment opportunities in the crypto space, this token sale on CoinList US is something you should definitely investigate further. Remember to conduct thorough research on the DoubleZero Foundation and the 2Z token to make an informed investment decision. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Investors? CoinList’s return is a significant win for US investors .

CoinList’s return opens doors to future token sales and project launches, providing US investors with more diverse investment options within the crypto ecosystem. Increased Competition: CoinList’s presence in the US market can foster healthy competition among cryptocurrency exchanges and launchpads, potentially leading to better services and more innovative offerings for users. Positive Market Signal: This move could be interpreted as a positive signal regarding the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US, potentially encouraging further growth and adoption. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and investing in token sales carries risks. Always conduct your own due diligence, understand the projects you are investing in, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities The cryptocurrency industry in the US has been navigating a complex and often unclear crypto regulation environment. Different agencies have varying perspectives, and the rules are still evolving. This has led to uncertainty and challenges for platforms operating in the space, as evidenced by CoinList’s previous withdrawal from the US market. CoinList is Back in the USA! CoinList’s return suggests that either the regulatory climate is becoming more accommodating, or platforms are finding innovative ways to comply and operate within the existing rules. This could involve strategies such as focusing on accredited investors initially, implementing robust KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) procedures, and carefully structuring token sales to comply with securities regulations. While challenges remain, CoinList’s re-entry is a positive sign. It indicates that despite the regulatory hurdles, there are opportunities for growth and expansion within the US crypto market. This could encourage more platforms to engage with regulators, seek clarity, and work towards establishing a sustainable and compliant crypto ecosystem in the United States. Conclusion: A New Chapter for CoinList and US Crypto CoinList’s return to the U.S. market after a five-year hiatus marks a significant and exciting development for the American cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a triumphant comeback that not only benefits US investors by providing them with access to a leading launchpad and cryptocurrency exchange , but also signals a potentially more favorable environment for crypto innovation in the United States.

Historical market trends offer insights into how SHIB price could react if Ripple (XRP) price races towards the $5 mark in the months ahead. Will Ripple (XRP) Rally Impact Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price? Ripple’s XRP remains one of the most relevant crypto altcoins in 2025, with market watchers speculating on out it potential long-term price trajectory could impact prominent memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Ripple (XRP) Price Action, April 2, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple price is currently consolidating above the $2 level according to CoinMarketCap data. If it reaches the $5 milestone, it would mark a significant achievement, exceeding its current all time high of $3.84 recorded back in 2018. Based on recent market reports, XRP’s potential growth drivers in 2025 include institutional adoption from Spot ETF filings, regulatory clarity from the ongoing US Stablecoin Bill review by the US Congress, and expanding use cases for Ripple’s RLUSD blockchain-based payment solutions. A rally to $5 would push XRP’s market capitalization beyond $250 billion, potentially sparking renewed institutional interest in the broader crypto market. But, historically, when large-cap altcoins experience parabolic gains, capital rotations into mid-cap and small-cap assets, such as memecoins like Shiba Inu, tend to follow. Historical Correlation Between XRP and Shiba Inu Shiba Inu price action has often shown a tendency to react to major market shifts, particularly during bullish altcoin cycles. In the 2021 bull run, SHIB experienced an explosive rally alongside XRP and other major altcoins, fueled by increased retail participation and speculative trading. This trend repeated in 2024, when SHIB price surged by more than 100% in Q3 2024 after Donald Trump won the US elections in November. Shiba Inu prices is current holding steady above the $0.000012 mark as of Wednesday, April 2. If XRP price reaches $5, it could signal an extended altcoin season, leading to increased demand for speculative assets like SHIB. Additionally, memecoins often benefit from surges in retail enthusiasm, social media trends, and whale accumulation. However, SHIB’s price action will also depend on independent factors, including burn rate efficiency, ecosystem developments, and overall sentiment in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Price Projections If XRP Hits $5 At press time on April 2, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000012, with a market capitalization of $7.14 billion. If XRP’s surge triggers broader altcoin momentum, SHIB could see notable upside. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action, April 2, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Here are possible scenarios for Shiba Inu price forecast based on historical trends and capital flow dynamics: Conservative Target: $0.000015 – $0.000017, if SHIB experiences a moderate reaction from XRP’s gains, supported by increased risk appetite in altcoins. Moderate Bullish Target: $0.000020 – $0.000025, if memecoins gain traction alongside XRP, and increased whale accumulation occurs) Parabolic Scenario: $0.000035, if SHIB benefits from a major jump in speculative trading from large investors along with persistent token burns. Key Market Risks Ahead While an XRP rally to $5 could provide positive momentum for Shiba Inu, several external factors will influence its trajectory: Bitcoin’s Market Direction: BTC’s performance often dictates overall market sentiment. Shiba Inu Burn Rate: A sustained burn mechanism can create supply shocks, positively impacting price. Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rate decisions and regulatory clarity could affect investor risk appetite. Social Media Hype & Whale Activity: SHIB’s price remains sensitive to retail-driven momentum and large transactions from whales. In Summary If XRP price reaches $5, it could trigger an altcoin rally, potentially benefiting Shiba Inu Inu price action. While historical data suggests SHIB price could gain from heightened market speculation, its trajectory will depend on broader crypto market trends, fundamental developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and continued investor interest. Along with XRP price action, strategic Shiba Inu traders would watch key resistance levels around $0.000015, for confirmation, while also monitoring Bitcoin’s price movement, and broader macroeconomic signals to gauge SHIB’s potentia price breakout scenarios.

The announcement came during what he labeled “Liberation Day,” when he unveiled a plan to apply baseline tariffs of 10% to all countries and higher rates on selected nations. The latest 34% US tariffs on China add to an existing 20% charge tied to fentanyl trafficking and to tariffs already on items such as solar panels. This means many imports from China may face rates above 50%. Trump described the new approach as a way to make foreign nations pay “for the privilege of selling in the US market.” He argued that while the United States could have matched tariff rates dollar for dollar, his administration chose a lower figure to show restraint. “The tariffs wil l be not a full reciprocal,” he said. “I could have done that yes, it would have been tough for a lot of countries. We didn’t want to do that.” Trump announcing the list of countries for reciprocal US tariffs on “Liberation Day”. Source: Fox 35 Orlando, Youtube In his remarks, Trump emphasized that China has not always provided fair access to American goods and services. “They charge us, we charge them less, so how can anybody be upset?” he said. He suggested that in earlier years, the US had been more successful in trade but had lost ground recently. “We had a great country four years ago in terms of the economics, and we were doubling up on China. Nobody was going to catch us but so much of it slipped away in the last four years under Biden,” he said. Trump recalled that seven years ago, the United States collected “hundreds and billions of dollars” in tariffs from China and said Chinese leaders understood why Washington felt it needed to take firm action. “President Xi, he understood. They all understand that we are gonna have to go through tough love maybe. They are ripping us off, and they understood it,” he said. China has taken steps to restrict local companies from investing in the US According to a Bloomberg report , China’s National Development and Reform Commission instructed several of its branches to suspend registrations and approvals for any firms planning to invest in the US. The exact timing of these steps and the duration of the suspension remain unclear. China has long placed certain limits on overseas investments for reasons linked to national security and concerns about capital outflows, but these new restrictions come at a time of heightened trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Official data put Chinese outbound investments into the US at $6.9 billion in 2023. It is not apparent whether existing commitments or major financial holdings, such as China’s US Treasury purchases, would be affected. Although this new restriction is mainly focused on corporate investment in the US, it throws another element of uncertainty into global trade as firms look for ways to move production or strike alternative deals to avoid the effects of new barriers. The situation further complicates relations between China and the US, especially with the freshly announced 34% tariffs. China couldn’t dodge US tariffs In an apparent last-ditch effort to ease tensions, China’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily, published an article highlighting the benefits that US farmers and technology companies have gained from trade with China. The piece, credited to “Zhong Sheng,” a pen name that translates to “Voice of China,” underlined how US agricultural imports have helped American growers and addressed China’s own demand. This commentary arrived before Trump’s announcement of global tariffs. Observers noted that the piece was the second in a series looking at China-US ties, timed alongside the president’s plan to finalize his reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Bloomberg reported that some saw the article as a way for Beijing to remind Washington of the economic upsides of working with China. John Gong, once a consultant to China’s Commerce Ministry and now a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said: “This article appears to be Beijing’s last effort to avert Trump’s tariffs against China in the hope of changing his mind.” China has hinted towards further retaliation in trade tariffs A previous article on Monday showcased how China’s market scale and production abilities benefited high-profile American companies like Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. While the piece argued for cooperation and mutual gains, it also laid out areas where China could retaliate. Beijing has already targeted US agricultural and energy goods in response to the 20% blanket tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese products earlier this year. Authorities also investigated Alphabet Inc.’s Google and placed US gene-sequencing company Illumina Inc. on a blacklist of entities under special scrutiny. At the diplomatic level, China has been vocal in its criticism of the tariffs, with its top envoy calling on Trump to remove them. Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to the Russian state-run outlet RIA Novosti on Tuesday, saying the US duties cited China’s alleged role in the fentanyl crisis without adequate evidence. “If the US side persists in exerting pressure and even continues to engage in blackmail, China will resolutely counteract it,” Wang stated. Analysts caution that these moves could be the start of prolonged trade disagreements as both nations show signs of readiness for further escalation. Some expect more Chinese efforts to protect local industries and control where capital flows. In contrast, others believe Washington may add new duties or expand enforcement actions against products that Trump deems unfairly traded. For now, the 34% reciprocal tariff stands out as a steep figure, though Trump insists it is lower than what he could have imposed to match China’s rates.

42821856,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145735,1743634201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Intriguing Twist: Elon Musk’s Shocking Exit from Public Office After DOGE Role,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/elon-musk-public-office-doge/,"In a surprising turn of events, the cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the news that tech mogul Elon Musk will be stepping down from any potential future in public office. This revelation comes on the heels of his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that, while perhaps unconventional, had many speculating about Musk’s broader political ambitions. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s recent statement on X, as reported by Sina Finance, has definitively put these speculations to rest. But what does this mean for the future of Dogecoin, the crypto market, and Musk’s influence within these spheres? Let’s dive into the details. Elon Musk’s Departure from Public Office: A Definitive Stance The announcement, delivered via social media and traditional news outlets, leaves no room for ambiguity: Elon Musk will not be transitioning into a career in public service after his stint at DOGE. This confirmation aligns with previous assertions from both Musk himself and former President Trump, painting a consistent picture of Musk’s intentions. While his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) might have sparked curiosity and debate, it appears to be a unique chapter rather than a prelude to a political saga. Here’s a quick rundown of the key points: Official Confirmation: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Musk’s exit on X. Consistent Messaging: Musk and former President Trump previously indicated Musk’s lack of interest in public office. DOGE Role Limited: Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency was a specific role, not a stepping stone to further political positions. Focus on Private Sector: This announcement reinforces Musk’s continued dedication to his private ventures and technological pursuits. What Does This Mean for Dogecoin? Given Elon Musk’s well-known affinity for Dogecoin, it’s natural to wonder how his decision to stay out of public office might impact the popular meme-coin. Musk’s tweets and endorsements have historically sent Dogecoin’s price on rollercoaster rides. While his political decisions might seem indirectly related to cryptocurrency, Musk’s overall influence on public sentiment and market trends is undeniable. His focus remaining in the private sector, particularly with companies like Tesla and SpaceX, could mean continued, albeit perhaps less politically charged, engagement with Dogecoin and the broader crypto space. Analyzing the Impact on the Cryptocurrency Landscape The broader cryptocurrency market is always sensitive to news involving influential figures like Elon Musk. While this announcement isn’t directly crypto-related policy, it does clarify Musk’s direction. Some might have anticipated a scenario where Musk could leverage a public office to influence crypto regulations or policies. With that possibility now off the table, the market may adjust its expectations. However, Musk’s influence as a tech innovator and business leader remains potent. His companies’ potential adoption of cryptocurrencies, or his continued commentary on digital assets, will likely continue to shape market sentiment. Consider these aspects: Factor Potential Impact on Crypto Musk not in public office Reduced speculation of direct political influence on crypto policy by Musk. Musk’s continued private sector focus Potential for ongoing crypto integration within his companies (Tesla, SpaceX, etc.). Musk’s social media presence Likely to remain a significant, albeit potentially less politically angled, driver of crypto market sentiment. Public Office and the Road Not Taken The concept of public office often conjures images of political power and policy-making influence. For someone like Elon Musk, known for disrupting industries and challenging norms, the idea of entering this arena was intriguing to many. His DOGE role, however unconventional, seemed to flirt with this possibility. Now, with the confirmation of his exit, we see a clear path chosen – one that remains rooted in the entrepreneurial and technological realms rather than the political one. This decision might be seen as a strategic move to maximize his impact through innovation and business, areas where he has already established a formidable presence. Navigating the Crypto Market After the Announcement The crypto market is known for its volatility and responsiveness to news and trends. While Musk’s decision isn’t a direct market catalyst in itself, it removes one layer of uncertainty – the ‘what if’ of Musk in politics. Investors and enthusiasts can now refocus on other fundamental factors driving the market, such as technological advancements, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Dogecoin, in particular, might see some recalibration as the market digests this news and assesses the future drivers of its value, independent of potential political affiliations of its most prominent supporter. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Monitor Market Reactions: Keep an eye on how Dogecoin and the broader crypto market react in the days following this announcement. Focus on Fundamentals: Shift focus to the underlying technology, adoption rates, and regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t rely solely on celebrity endorsements or political speculation when making investment decisions in the crypto space. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with credible news sources and market analysis to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Musk’s Future Path and Crypto’s Trajectory Elon Musk’s decision to forgo public office clarifies his trajectory and removes a layer of speculation from the cryptocurrency narrative. While his influence on Dogecoin and the crypto market remains significant, it will likely continue to be exerted through his private ventures and public commentary rather than political channels. For the crypto community, this news underscores the importance of focusing on the core principles and developments within the blockchain and digital asset space. The market will continue to evolve, driven by innovation, adoption, and regulatory frameworks, with or without the direct political involvement of figures like Elon Musk. The future remains exciting and full of potential, even as certain paths are clarified and others remain open.

The registration, announced on Tuesday , comes after a multi-year process that required exchanges to meet higher standards for investor protection and governance. Kraken said it worked closely with Canadian regulators during this pre-registration phase, upgrading its compliance systems and internal controls to meet expectations set by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). To lead its Canadian expansion, Kraken named Cynthia Del Pozo as general manager for North America. Del Pozo, a fintech and operations veteran, will oversee strategy, regulatory engagement and business development across the region. “Canada is at a turning point for crypto adoption,” said Del Pozo in a statement, pointing to growing interest from both retail and institutional investors. A recent survey cited by Kraken found that 30% of Canadian investors currently hold crypto assets. Kraken also announced it will offer free Interac e-Transfer deposits for Canadian users, a move aimed at reducing friction for newcomers to the platform. The exchange claims it doubled its team and user base in Canada over the last two years and now manages over $2 billion CAD in client assets.

42822281,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ey-updates-ethereum-scaler-nightfall-zk-rollup,1743634800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,EY updates privacy L2 as nixed Tornado Cash sanctions ease fears,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ey-updates-ethereum-scaler-nightfall-zk-rollup?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Big Four accounting firm EY, formerly Ernst & Young, has changed its enterprise-focused Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Nightfall to a zero-knowledge rollup design as it says corporate clients are more comfortable with privacy solutions with easing US sanctions. EY said in an April 2 announcement that Nightfall’s new source code, “Nightfall_4,” simplifies the network’s architecture and offers near-instant transaction finality on Ethereum while making it more accessible to users than its previous optimistic rollup-based version. EY’s global blockchain leader, Paul Brody, told Cointelegraph that switching to a ZK-rollup model “means instant finality, but it also makes operations simpler since you don’t need a challenger node to secure the network,” which verifies the correctness of transactions. The move away from optimistic rollups means Nightfall users won’t need to challenge potentially incorrect transactions on Ethereum and wait out the challenging period, leading to faster transaction finality. No such feature is present with zero-knowledge rollups, meaning that a transaction becomes final as soon as it is added into a Nightfall block, EY said. It is the fourth major update to Nightfall since EY launched the business-focused Ethereum layer 2 in 2019. Nightfall enables the firm’s business partners to transfer tokens privately using Ethereum’s security while being cheaper than the base network. It also uses a technology that binds a verified identity to a public key through digital signatures to try to stem counterparty risk. Nixed Tornado Cash sanctions “helped people feel comfortable” Brody said the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions on the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash “had a chilling effect on legitimate business user interest.” “Even though we long ago took steps to make Nightfall unattractive to bad actors, since it cannot be used anonymously, the removal of OFAC sanctions has really helped people feel comfortable that using a privacy technology will not be risky,” he added. Nightfall’s code is open source on GitHub but remains a permissioned blockchain for EY’s customer base, competing with the likes of the IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and the Consensus-built Quorum. Brody said that EY’s blockchain team is working toward “a single environment that supports payments, logic, and composability.” Currently, the firm requires Nightfall and Starlight, a tool that can change smart contract code to enable zero-knowledge proofs “to enable complex multiparty business agreements under privacy,” he added. “We’ll spend some time supporting Nightfall_4 deployments initially,” Brody said. “Then we’ll move on to the development of Nightfall_5.” Magazine: What are native rollups?

Despite previous recovery attempts, sellers remain dominant, preventing any meaningful upside momentum. If SOL fails to hold this key support, it could trigger a wave of panic selling, accelerating losses and exposing the price to deeper declines. With market sentiment hanging in the balance, all eyes are on whether bulls can stage a defense or if bears will finally break through, setting the stage for further downside. Solana Ongoing Bearish Trend In Focus The Solana price chart is currently displaying a bearish triangle formation, signaling a continuation of the downward trend. Initially, SOL attempted to break out above the upper boundary of the triangle, but the breakout lacked strong bullish momentum, leading to a swift rejection. This failure to sustain an upward move pushed the asset back toward the lower boundary of the triangle, where the $118 support level now comes into focus. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Steady After Decline—Breakout or More Downside? With continued selling pressure, Solana could face an extended bearish move, breaking below its current key support level and accelerating its decline. A confirmed breakdown beneath the bearish triangle would lead to a drop toward $118, the first major support zone. However, if the bearish momentum intensifies, this level may not hold. Below $118, the next significant support lies at $99, where some buyers could attempt to slow the decline. Should this level fail to provide stability, SOL could slide toward $79, a crucial psychological and technical support zone. Continued weakness in market sentiment may push the price even lower, with $58 coming into play. For now, bulls must step in to defend these levels, or Solana risks an extended bearish phase. Can $118 Spark Up Bullish Again The $118 support level has emerged as a critical zone for SOL, with many traders watching closely to see if it can trigger a bullish turnaround. Historically, this level has acted as a strong demand zone, where buyers stepped in to absorb selling pressure and push prices higher. If similar market behavior plays out, SOL could see a rebound from this point. Related Reading: Solana Bears Eye $113 Target If Ascending Structure Breaks Down – Details According to CURB, in an X post on March 15, he forecasted that Solana’s price eyes decline to the $118 support level before experiencing a potential rebound. He believes that strong demand in this zone could trigger a significant price surge to the $1,000 mark in the long run. Fundamental factors, such as positive news on Solana’s ecosystem, increased network adoption, or improved overall market sentiment, could also act as catalysts for a price recovery. A surge in buying volume, particularly from whales and institutional investors, is likely to provide the momentum needed to shift market sentiment.

42822193,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145799,1743634858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary DTCC Platform Unveils Tokenized Collateral Management for a Secure Financial Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dtcc-platform-tokenized-collateral/,"In a groundbreaking move poised to reshape the landscape of institutional finance, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a premier post-trade market infrastructure provider, has officially launched its highly anticipated platform for tokenized collateral management . This development, first highlighted by Solid Intel on X, signals a significant step forward in the integration of blockchain technology within traditional financial systems. Are you ready to witness how this innovation could redefine efficiency and security in the world of collateral? What is Tokenized Collateral Management and Why is DTCC’s Platform a Game Changer? Before we delve into the specifics of DTCC’s new offering, let’s understand the core concept. Tokenized collateral management essentially involves representing traditional financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or even real estate, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This process unlocks a host of benefits, primarily by enhancing the efficiency, transparency, and speed of collateral management. Why is this important? In traditional finance, managing collateral—assets pledged to secure loans or trades—can be a cumbersome and often slow process. It involves multiple intermediaries, manual paperwork, and can be prone to operational inefficiencies. Tokenization aims to streamline this by: Reducing settlement times: Transactions on a blockchain are typically faster than traditional settlement systems, potentially moving from T+1 or T+2 to near real-time. Improving operational efficiency: Automation through smart contracts can minimize manual intervention, reducing errors and operational costs. Enhancing transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency provides a clear and auditable record of collateral movements and ownership. Expanding accessibility: Tokenization can potentially fractionalize assets, making them more accessible as collateral and opening up new liquidity pools. DTCC, as a critical infrastructure in the financial markets, stepping into this space is a powerful endorsement of blockchain adoption in mainstream finance. Their platform isn’t just another experiment; it’s a strategic move that could set a new industry standard. Exploring the Benefits of the DTCC Platform for Tokenized Collateral The launch of DTCC’s platform is not just about keeping up with technological trends; it’s about addressing real-world challenges in collateral management. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Description Impact Increased Efficiency Automated processes and faster settlement reduce operational drag. Lower costs, faster transaction cycles. Enhanced Security Blockchain’s cryptographic security strengthens the integrity of collateral data. Reduced risk of fraud and data breaches. Improved Liquidity Tokenization can unlock previously illiquid assets as potential collateral. Greater flexibility in collateral usage and potentially lower borrowing costs. Greater Transparency Immutable blockchain records offer a clear audit trail of collateral movements. Improved regulatory compliance and trust among participants. Imagine a scenario where a financial institution needs to quickly mobilize collateral to meet margin requirements. With a DTCC platform for tokenized assets, this process could be significantly accelerated and simplified compared to the traditional methods that involve manual reconciliations and slower transfer mechanisms. This speed and efficiency are paramount in today’s fast-paced financial markets. Challenges and Considerations for Institutional Crypto Adoption While the potential of tokenized collateral management is immense, the path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is not without its hurdles. What are some of the challenges that DTCC and the broader industry might face? Regulatory Clarity: Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are crucial for the widespread adoption of tokenized assets. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, which can create complexities for global institutions. Interoperability: For tokenized collateral to be truly effective, platforms need to be interoperable. Ensuring seamless interaction between different blockchain networks and legacy systems is a technical challenge. Scalability: As adoption grows, blockchain networks must be able to handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising speed or cost. Scalability solutions are continuously evolving. Security Risks: While blockchain is inherently secure, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or custody solutions can pose risks. Robust security protocols and best practices are essential. Market Education and Acceptance: Widespread adoption requires educating market participants about the benefits and mechanics of tokenized collateral and overcoming any skepticism or resistance to change. DTCC’s initiative is a significant step in addressing these challenges head-on. By providing a robust and regulated platform, they are paving the way for greater comfort and confidence in using digital assets for collateral purposes within the institutional space. Examples of Tokenized Collateral in Action While DTCC’s platform is a recent development, the concept of tokenized collateral is already gaining traction in various forms. Here are a few examples to illustrate its potential: Stablecoins as Collateral: Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, are increasingly used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Their price stability makes them attractive for this purpose. Tokenized Securities: Companies are beginning to tokenize traditional securities like stocks and bonds. These tokenized securities can then be used as collateral in lending and borrowing activities. Real-World Assets (RWAs) Tokenization: Beyond financial instruments, real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and art are being tokenized. This opens up vast new possibilities for collateralization, although it’s still in early stages. DTCC’s platform is geared towards institutional clients, focusing initially on securities. However, the underlying technology and principles can be applied to a much broader range of asset classes as the ecosystem matures. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance? The launch of DTCC’s tokenized collateral management platform is more than just news; it’s a signal of a fundamental shift in how financial infrastructure is evolving. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: For Financial Institutions: Start exploring the potential of tokenized collateral and assess how it can enhance your operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve risk management. Engage with platforms like DTCC’s to understand the practical implications. For Technology Providers: Focus on developing interoperable and secure solutions that support the growing demand for tokenized asset infrastructure. Regulatory compliance and scalability should be top priorities. For Regulators: Proactively develop clear and balanced regulatory frameworks that foster innovation in tokenized assets while mitigating potential risks. Collaboration with industry players is crucial. For Investors: Keep an eye on the developments in institutional crypto and tokenization. Understand the potential investment opportunities that may arise as this space matures. The move by DTCC is a powerful validation of the transformative potential of blockchain technology in finance. It’s a clear indication that blockchain adoption is no longer a fringe concept but a mainstream evolution. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Tokenized Financial Ecosystem DTCC’s launch of its platform for tokenized collateral management is a watershed moment. It represents a significant leap towards a more efficient, transparent, and secure financial ecosystem. While challenges remain, the benefits of tokenization are becoming increasingly undeniable. This initiative by a market infrastructure giant like DTCC will undoubtedly accelerate the adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology within traditional finance, paving the way for a future where tokenized assets are commonplace. The revolution in collateral management is here, and it’s being driven by the power of tokenization.

The debate highlights tensions between corporate ambitions and public advisory work. The issue prompts reconsideration of role definitions in government advisory positions. Tesla founder Elon Musk will reportedly step away from his new role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the coming months, NBC News and Politico reported Wednesday. Is Elon Musk Stepping Back From DOGE? According to Politico’s April 2 report , three sources close to President Donald Trump revealed that the president and Elon Musk have discussed plans for the X CEO to step back from his government role. The billionaire entrepreneur will reportedly refocus on running his multiple businesses. Just last month, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields alleged that Musk would stay until his “mission” at DOGE was “completed.” A February Politico report cited an anonymous insider who claimed that the controversial tech billionaire was “here to stay” despite widespread public scrutiny. SCOOP: Pres Trump has told his inner circle & members of his Cabinet that @elonmusk will be stepping back in the coming weeks from his current role Trump remains pleased w/ Musk & DOGE, but both men have decided in recent days that it will soon be time for Musk to return… — Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) April 2, 2025 As a special government employee, Musk is only allowed to work 130 days out of 365, with the South African-born engineer expected to reach that limit either next month or June. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took to X Wednesday to deny the claims, calling the scoop “garbage.” “Elon Musk and President Trump have both *publicly* stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,” she wrote. However, a senior White House official confirmed to NBC News Wednesday afternoon that Trump had discussed Musk’s departure at a March 24 Cabinet meeting. While the status of Elon Musk’s government position remains unclear, his involvement with the Trump administration has already created consequences for his businesses. X CEO Faces Backlash Over DOGE Policies, Tesla Attacked Musk has faced broad pushback commercially for his role alongside the Trump administration, with several Tesla charging stations, vehicles, and dealerships attacked in recent months. During a Wisconsin town hall on Sunday, Elon Musk addressed how his political involvement has affected his businesses. He also clarified that despite the acronym’s similarity to the cryptocurrency , the federal government does not plan to use Dogecoin. “My Tesla stock, and the stock of everyone who owns Tesla, has roughly halved,” he said at the event hosted by his crypto-friendly America PAC . “I mean, it’s a big deal.” The post Conflicting Reports Emerge Over Elon Musk Stepping Down From DOGE appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-02 23:03:34

And what if some are already stacking their gains while others still scroll, searching? The digital battleground for dominance is heating up, and three names are rising faster than most: Qubetics , Toncoin, and Litecoin, one of the best crypto for quick profit. Each brings something rare to the table: speed, scalability, and a chance for early community members to secure serious profits. And right now, the right move could make all the difference. Just look at Toncoin (TON). A surge past the $4 resistance level has flipped heads in the derivatives market, triggering a 35.86% jump in open interest. Litecoin (LTC) is testing the patience of long-term holders. After slipping below the $97.12 support, it hovers in uncertain territory, possibly drifting toward $57.70 if current patterns persist. But here’s where things get wild: Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t here to play catch-up—it’s here to change the rules. By confronting real-life failures in cross-border transfers, inefficient smart contracts, and fragmented systems. It’s more than just a presale—it’s a signal that the future is already forming. Qubetics ($TICS): The Infrastructure Crypto Built for Life Qubetics delivers something blockchain desperately needs—seamless interoperability. Not theoretical. Actual plug-and-play connections across chains, systems, and devices. Picture a logistics platform in Brazil instantly syncing transactions from multiple vendors—Ethereum-based, Solana-based, and even legacy payment APIs—without gas fee traps or hour-long confirmations. Or imagine a freelancer in Chile finally getting paid across chains, settled in seconds, minus middlemen. This isn’t hype; it’s structured utility. One of Qubetics’ most powerful strengths lies in its adaptive consensus layer, designed to align with both public and private networks. This helps traditional businesses plug into crypto infrastructure without costly backend overhauls. That’s like giving a 90s car a self-driving system—and having it work flawlessly. Through advanced sharding mechanisms and modular infrastructure, Qubetics minimizes congestion and keeps data throughput fast and secure. What a $1,000 in Qubetics Looks Like—And Why Waiting Might Cost More Than You Think Imagine dropping just $1,000 into Qubetics ($TICS) today. At the current crypto presale price of $0.1430, that grabs around 6,993 tokens. Now picture this—if $TICS hits just $1, that $1,000 becomes $6,993. At $5, you’re staring at $34,965. Stretch that to $10, and the figure climbs to $69,930. If it hits $15, that same initial entry could grow into a stunning $104,895. These numbers aren’t pulled from thin air—they’re based on actual projections tied to Qubetics’ structured growth model. With more than 24,200 holders, over $15.8 million already raised, and 506 million tokens sold as of April 2, 2025, the momentum isn’t coming—it’s already accelerating. And with every new presale stage, the price ticks up. The window for maximum profit is narrowing fast. In crypto, hesitation isn’t harmless—it’s expensive. For those looking for the best crypto for quick profit, Qubetics offers more than just potential. It offers timing. And right now, that timing couldn’t be sharper. Toncoin (TON): Bullish Charts, Big Bets, and a Fresh Breakout Toncoin’s push beyond the $4 line this April isn’t just technical noise. It signals renewed confidence. The open interest spike—up 35.86% in just 24 hours—tells a story of serious capital repositioning. People aren’t just watching; they’re acting. The RSI, sitting at 60, suggests there’s still breathing room before things get overheated. And the MACD’s bullish crossover? That’s more fuel in the tank. The TON network itself continues evolving under the Telegram ecosystem, giving it the type of built-in distribution others only dream of. With tools like TON DNS and TON Payments already gaining traction in Venezuela and El Salvador, the project feels grounded—not in ideology, but in use. Developers are integrating dApps on TON’s scalable architecture, while casual users benefit from its low transaction costs and high-speed transfers. While not a presale coin like Qubetics, Toncoin is carving its own route to mass adoption. Those entering now are positioning themselves in a strong uptrend, especially if it breaks past $4.62. For those seeking the best crypto for quick profit, TON’s upward trajectory makes it hard to ignore. Time, though, is rarely this generous twice. Litecoin (LTC): Digital Silver Faces Critical Pressure Litecoin has earned its reputation as digital silver—reliable, consistent, and battle-tested. But even legends stumble. Dropping below the $97.12 support level has raised alarms. The next test sits way lower, near $57.70. It’s a big gap, and the LTC community is watching closely. Still, seasoned market participants know: when others hesitate, real opportunities unfold. Litecoin continues to serve practical purposes. Its ultra-low fees make it a favorite for fast, cross-border microtransactions. In Argentina and Cuba, where fiat volatility runs high, LTC is still used by local merchants and digital freelancers. That real-life relevance keeps Litecoin in the conversation, even during market dips. However, this isn’t a hype cycle moment—it’s a grind phase. And in that grind, entries could lead to major rebounds. Litecoin may not be flashy, but its infrastructure is proven. For those looking to balance their portfolio with a project that’s stood the test of time, LTC still holds appeal. As a contender for the best crypto for quick profit, it may trail Qubetics and Toncoin in short-term hype—but sometimes, patience pays bigger than speed. Why These 3 Projects Matter Now More Than Ever Crypto isn’t about luck—it’s about timing and information. Qubetics offers raw potential with a proven model, wrapped in a smart presale structure. Toncoin is surging with real strength, fueled by growing adoption and bullish technicals. Litecoin, while under pressure, remains a staple—steady, reliable, and quietly essential in regions that need fast and stable payments. This April 2025 window is short—and wide open. Whether it’s Qubetics’ game-ready interoperability, Toncoin’s bullish wave, or Litecoin’s time-tested network, these aren’t coins to ignore. They’re engines. And right now, the throttle is up. For community members seeking the best crypto for quick profit , the next move should be strategic—not delayed. Dive deep, decide fast, and take your place ahead of the shift.

Qubetics is built for interoperability and real-world problem-solving, making it attractive for early buyers. Its $0.1430 presale price offers massive upside potential. Why is Toncoin gaining momentum in April 2025? Toncoin recently broke the $4 resistance, with a 35.86% rise in open interest. Technical indicators point to continued bullish momentum, increasing market confidence. Is Litecoin still a good crypto to hold despite recent dips?

The ACT team emphasized the crash was market-driven, not due to project flaws. This incident has raised concerns about the risks of sudden exchange policy changes on token stability. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT), a token associated with the eponymous project focused on artificial intelligence, released a post-mortem about the fall of their token on Wednesday.. On Tuesday, the token experienced a sudden and severe price drop, plunging 58% from $0.19 to $0.08 in less than an hour. According to CoinGecko data , the token’s market capitalization shed $96 million. ACT Team Addresses Crash, Says Liquidations Triggered Sell-Off The sharp decline coincided with Binance’s update to leverage and margin tiers for multiple tokens, including ACT. The adjustment triggered a wave of liquidations, with blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reporting that a whale was liquidated for $3.79 million at $0.1877. The impact of these liquidations intensified selling pressure across the market. In response, Act I addressed the community, assuring that the project was investigating the situation and working with the relevant parties, before then releasing this latest report. Post Mortem Dear ACT Community, Over the past 24 hours, the ACT token experienced a significant and sudden price drop. We want to address the incident transparently and provide context. As you know, we are a community-driven project with no centralized leadership, and our… — Act I : The AI Prophecy (@ACTICOMMUNITY) April 2, 2025 According to the team, Binance’s leverage adjustments were announced with short notice, forcing traders and market makers with large positions to close or downsize, leading to cascading sell-offs. Binance’s preliminary findings indicated that four users, including three VIP traders and one non-VIP, collectively sold over $1 million worth of ACT on the Binance spot market, accelerating the price decline. Act I emphasized that the crash was not due to any internal failure or fundamental flaw in the project. “No single party appears to have profited disproportionately from this sequence of trades,” the team stated. It also clarified that the full circulating supply of ACT is live on the open market, meaning centralized exchanges like Binance cannot restrict user behavior once tokens are held in personal accounts. Despite the turbulence, Act I reaffirmed its commitment to its long-term mission of integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized ecosystems. “Although we are unable to directly impact the price of the token, we remain focused on our core mission: to build real AI infrastructure for Web3,” the team stated. Regardless of recent price action, $ACT 's vision extends far beyond market fluctuations. While volatility is inevitable in crypto markets, our team's commitment to building remains unwavering. Our mission has never changed: to serve as the definitive bridge between AI & crypto… — Act I : The AI Prophecy (@ACTICOMMUNITY) April 2, 2025 The project plans to present its developments at Token2049 later this month. Act I acknowledged the frustration among its holders but remained steadfast in its goals. “This incident, while difficult, does not change our fundamentals, our partnerships, or our long-term vision,” the statement read. “If anything, it has made us double down on decentralization, transparency, and resilience.” As the project works to regroup after this market event, the token’s price continues to face pressure in the broader market. ACT Token Bleeds 70% in a Week, CZ Urges AI Projects to Build First The sell-off in Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) has intensified, with the token plunging 37.4% in the past hour and down 70.8% over the last week, according to CoinGecko . Source: CoinGecko Currently trading at $0.05643, ACT has lost nearly 94% from its all-time high of $0.9198, though it remains 340% above its lowest price. Market activity has also declined, with 24-hour trading volume dropping 21.6% to $477.7 million. Amid the turmoil, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has weighed in on the broader AI and crypto intersection, criticizing AI projects that prioritize token launches over real utility . In a post on X, CZ stated that “many AI agent developers focus too much on their token rather than the agent’s actual usefulness.” Too many AI agent developers focus too much on their token and not enough on the agent's usefulness. I recommend making a really good agent first. Only launch a token when there is product-market fit. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) April 2, 2025 He urged teams to build a strong product first and only introduce a token after achieving product-market fit. His remarks echo previous criticisms of AI-focused crypto projects. On March 17, he argued that while crypto can serve as the currency for AI, most AI agents don’t need their own tokens. Looking forward, he suggested charging fees in existing cryptocurrencies so AI project teams could focus on real-world adoption instead of token performance. The ACT token crash shows the delicate interplay between exchange policies, market dynamics, and project fundamentals in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While factors like leverage adjustments can trigger immediate price movements, long-term project viability ultimately depends on delivering real utility. As the dust settles on this particular event, the broader conversation about responsible tokenomics and the relationship between centralized exchanges and token projects is likely to intensify across the industry.

This claim led to a sharp drop in the price of FDUSD, which was supposed to be pegged at $1, dropping to as low as $0.87. While the token has since recovered somewhat, it has not fully returned to its intended $1 parity. Following the market backlash, Sun issued a new statement reiterating his concerns about First Digital Trust (FDT) and its operations. In his latest statements, Sun claimed that FDT had failed to meet customer fund repayments and was effectively insolvent. Despite this, he claimed that the company continued to operate as a public trust in Hong Kong, suggesting significant legal loopholes. Expressing strong concerns about the integrity of Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem, Sun said: “As seen in the case of FDT, there appear to be obvious loopholes in the trust industry in Hong Kong to circumvent financial and banking regulations. These will not only pose a risk to the public, but also jeopardise Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial centre.” He called on regulators and law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong to take decisive action to address these issues and prevent further financial risks to the public. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Makes First Official Statement on FDUSD Drop In addition to raising regulatory concerns, Sun noted that TUSD stablecoin Techteryx is actively pursuing legal action against FDT: “I am determined to support Techteryx and ensure that all scammers are held under the full force of the law. Never again should they be allowed to defraud the public under the guise of a licensed entity in Hong Kong or elsewhere.” At the time of writing, the FDUSD price is trading at $0.9795 and is extremely volatile.

We would like to remind you that all cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, are high risk and that there is a high risk of losing all invested money, including the principal.

We’re in the golden age of digital memes-as-assets between Arctic Pablo Coin’s mystical expedition and the meme coin frenzy driven by projects like Fartcoin and Dogwifhat. Investors are chasing the top new meme coins to join now—not tomorrow, not next week, but right now—as early entries offer mind-blowing returns that traditional markets can’t imagine. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) leads this wave, a project that isn’t just a coin—it’s an adventure wrapped in mystery, scarcity, and some serious ROI juice. It’s unlike anything the meme coin world has seen before. Think frozen tundras, forgotten treasures, and a snowmobile-riding explorer who’s out to share the wealth. Arctic Pablo Coin – Unlock Hidden Mysteries and 9,084.48% ROI Potential In the land where glaciers whisper ancient secrets and snowstorms shield long-lost treasure, Arctic Pablo surges ahead with a mission unlike any other meme coin. He’s not just minting tokens—he’s revealing the undiscovered. The current chapter? Glacial Glade—the 17th hidden location in a saga that has captivated early investors. Forget “phases.” Arctic Pablo’s presale unfolds like a quest. With every location Pablo reaches, a new treasure trove of opportunities opens up. Those who joined him early have already seen wild gains—and now, at just $0.000087, the window to secure 5,747,125 APCs for a $500 investment is wide open. And once it hits its launch price of $0.008, that same investment could grow to $45,977. That’s the kind of life-changing math meme coin hunters dream of. And it gets better. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about fast flips. With 66% APY staking, investors can stake their APC and earn passive rewards while being part of an ever-expanding legend. All staked tokens will be vested for two months from launch, ensuring a stable and rewarding ecosystem. Arctic Pablo features weekly token burns to maintain long-term growth, slicing away unsold tokens to increase scarcity and boost value. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), it supports various payment methods—from BTC and ETH to SOLANA and XRP—making it wildly accessible. No traditional stages. No boring roadmaps. Just a storytelling-driven economy where Pablo charts new territories, unearthing ROI opportunities and captivating a community that’s all-in on the journey. Top new meme coins to join now ? Arctic Pablo is not just on the list—it’s rewriting the rules. This might be the last moment to join before the price jumps with the next location. Every new step forward means fewer tokens, higher demand, and a bigger price tag. Get in before the story changes. Fartcoin – Blowing Up in All the Right Ways Not every meme coin needs to take itself seriously. And Fartcoin ($FART)? It’s the loudest example. In a market full of polished whitepapers and stiff branding, Fartcoin cuts through the noise with its unapologetically immature humor—and somehow, it’s working like magic. Fartcoin took the crypto world by storm, launching on the Ethereum blockchain with an irreverent and clever mission: to become the king of comedy coins. With a max supply of 69,000,000,000 FARTs, it’s clear they’re leaning hard into the meme culture. And with over $15 million in trading volume during its peak debut week, the market is responding. Unlike other joke coins, Fartcoin has built a loyal, rowdy community fueling its growth on socials like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Discord. They’re turning fart memes into fuel for financial gain, creating viral challenges, and even teasing a P2E fart battle game that’s reportedly in the works. Dogwifhat – When the Internet’s Favorite Pup Meets Market Madness Dogwifhat (WIF) isn’t just a meme coin. It’s a movement powered by the internet’s collective obsession with Shiba Inu aesthetics, chaotic humor, and the ever-ironic “dog with a hat” meme. What started as a joke became one of the fastest-growing Solana meme coins, and it’s still running hot. Dogwifhat skyrocketed after listing on major exchanges, including Binance and OKX, giving it a huge liquidity boost. It reached a market cap of over $2 billion at its peak, positioning itself as one of the most successful meme coins launched recently. With a community-driven approach, Dogwifhat keeps its roadmap loose but ambitious. It’s all about virality and vibes, from meme contests to merchandise drops and community grants. Holders don’t just support a token—they become part of a cultural moment constantly evolving in real-time. Final Thoughts: The Meme Coin Moment Is Now Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is experiencing an unprecedented boom. Between the mystical journey of Arctic Pablo Coin, the chaotic comedy of Fartcoin, and the viral dog-energy of Dogwifhat, there’s never been a better moment to explore the top new meme coins to join now.

Cuomo, a New York-registered attorney, advised OKX on legal issues stemming from the probe sometime after August 2021 when he resigned as New York overnor, Bloomberg reported on April 2, citing people familiar with the matter. “He spoke with company executives regularly and counseled them on how to respond to the criminal investigation,” Bloomberg said. The Seychelles-based firm pled guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business in violation of US Anti-Money Laundering laws on Feb. 24 and agreed to pay $84 million worth of penalties while forfeiting $421 million worth of fees earned from mostly institutional clients. The breaches occurred from 2018 to 2024 despite OKX having an official policy preventing US persons from transacting on its crypto exchange since 2017, the Department of Justice noted at the time. A spokesperson for Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, told Bloomberg that Cuomo has been providing private legal services representing individuals and corporations on a variety of matters since resigning as New York governor. “He has not represented clients before a New York city or state agency and routinely recommends former colleagues for positions,” Azzopardi added. OKX reportedly wasn’t willing to comment on its relationships with outside firms. Cuomo also influenced OKX to make executive appointments: Bloomberg Cuomo, who is now running for mayor of New York City, also advised OKX to appoint his friend US Attorney Linda Lacewell to OKX’s board of directors, Bloomberg said. Lacewell, a former superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, was added to the board in 2024 and was named OKX’s new chief legal officer on April 1, according to a recent company statement. Source: Linda Lacewell Related: New York bill aims to protect crypto investors from memecoin rug pulls After the investigation concluded, OKX said it would seek out a compliance consultant to remedy the issues stemming from the federal probe and bolster its regulatory compliance program. “Our vision is to make OKX the gold standard of global compliance at scale across different markets and their respective regulatory bodies,” OKX CEO Star Xu said in a Feb. 24 X post.

Pi Coin is falling rapidly, SUI is slowly recovering, and BlockDAG is moving forward with strong traction. While Pi Coin battles to maintain credibility during a massive token unlock, and SUI gains momentum from possible institutional backing, BlockDAG is steadily delivering on its goals. With the Beta Testnet now active, a $60K prize pool launched, and over $210.5 million collected in presale stages, BDAG is showing real-world progress. Unlike the uncertainty surrounding Pi and SUI, BlockDAG’s structure, with its engaged community and growing testnet utilities, places it ahead. The question now isn’t whether BDAG will rise, but how far it can go. Pi Coin’s Price Crash: Can It Recover After the Token Release? Pi Coin is currently seeing a steep decline, with a 30% drop this week pushing it down the charts and out of the top 30. The price now stands at $0.77—far below its recent high, cutting billions from its overall market value. Experts believe it may fall further, with $0.60 as the next crucial level. The market is bracing for a supply spike as 105.96 million Pi Coins are expected to be released within 30 days. A major unlock of 6.8 million is scheduled for April 3, raising concerns of more selling pressure. Another source of concern is the lack of a Binance listing, despite ongoing support from the Pi community. Yet, some traders believe a reversal could be on the horizon. Technical indicators suggest a potential surge, and if momentum flips, Pi Coin may climb back near $5. With current low prices, some are considering this a dip worth buying. SUI’s Price Recovery: Will It Continue Climbing After $2.40? SUI is gaining attention again with a 10% rise this week, crossing the important $2.40 mark. After hitting a recent low of $1.96, it has bounced back, driven by growing institutional interest and speculation about a possible SUI ETF. This Wednesday, SUI briefly reached $2.65 before pulling back, pointing to strong upward pressure. Experts suggest that a break from its long-standing wedge formation could fuel further gains. If it stays above $2.40, the next levels to watch are $2.80 and possibly its January peak of $5.37. SUI has a track record of major moves after such technical breakouts. With large firms showing interest, the possibility of another price jump is back on the table. For many, the current rally is a signal to act before the next potential run-up. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Launch: Reward Pool Live as Mainnet Nears BlockDAG (BDAG) has crossed a major development milestone by activating its Beta Testnet, as presented in its third Keynote. This step brings the project closer to its mainnet rollout. To add to the progress, BlockDAG has unveiled a $60,000 reward pool, encouraging participation from its already large base of over 170,000 members. The presale is now in Batch 27, offering BDAG at $0.0248. So far, more than 210.5 million dollars have been raised, and over 19 billion BDAG coins have been purchased. Those who bought at the initial $0.001 price point have already seen a 2,380% potential return, placing BDAG among the strongest presale performers in recent history. Performance-wise, the Beta Testnet has doubled in speed compared to its alpha stage. New updates include an improved blockchain explorer and a user-friendly Token & NFT Wizard that allows anyone to build tokens without coding knowledge. According to CEO Antony Turner, this testnet phase plays a key role in refining the network before the official mainnet release. What sets BlockDAG apart is its approach to rewarding active users. Top contributors, whether they’re miners, high-balance holders, or frequent wallet users, receive recognition and benefits. The platform is growing quickly, boasting over 800,000 users on the X1 Miner App and more than 400,000 in the TG Tap Miner Game. With presale funds now above $210.5 million, BlockDAG is setting itself up as one of the most strategically prepared blockchain projects, pointing to a major mainnet launch expected in 2025. Final Remarks! Speed and progress matter in crypto, and BlockDAG is moving faster than the rest. Pi Coin continues to face high selling volumes, while SUI is still building on early signs of recovery. In contrast, BDAG’s Beta Testnet is already up and running, rewarding participants and fine-tuning its platform ahead of its 2025 mainnet launch. The $60K Testnet reward pool isn’t just an incentive—it’s a way to test and strengthen the system under real usage. Combined with 800K+ X1 Miner users and presale funding that now exceeds $210.5M, BlockDAG is not just another altcoin contender—it’s shaping up to be the leading project to watch. While Pi and SUI work to regain momentum, BlockDAG continues to push forward.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 889,000 YouTube subscribers that the S&P 500 may continue to show weakness in April, which, based on historical precedence, may result in ETH also declining. “What I’m wondering is what happens if you do see the S&P 500 continue to show weakness into early to mid-April? Remember, we said there’s going to be weakness by the stock market between February OPEX (Option Expiration Week) and March OPEX. We got that, but I also said there’s a possibility that it could extend into early to mid-April as well before there’s a larger counter-trend rally. And the reasons for that could be due to tariff uncertainty on April 2nd. It could also just simply be due to, there’s a lot of macro data coming out in early to mid-April that I think the markets are going to be interested in. And one of the reasons I think the markets are going to be interested in it is because with all these tariffs, it could potentially have an effect on inflation.” Cowen says ETH may drop to its logarithmic trendline, potentially as low as $1,044, amid recessionary pressures, before reclaiming the $3,000 level as support. “I’m just looking over here at ETH/USD [on the weekly chart], and I see a triple top, and I just have to wonder does it ultimately culminate in a recession, where everyone thinks that by the time the recession is declared it’s over, but the reality is the market was pricing it in well ahead of time, so that you get this big drop and then a big move out of it. We’ve been talking about that for a while, and it’s the whole idea that ETH goes home.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube ETH is trading for $1,909 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.

NEAR Protocol and Aptos are advancing with enhancements in scalability and developer support, but tend to require a technical knack from users. BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart by integrating user-friendly tools such as the X1 Miner App, TG Tap Miner game, and no-code token wizards, simplifying entry for most. While NEAR and Aptos focus on performance enhancements, BlockDAG is dedicated to making crypto accessible, bridging the gap between enthusiasts and the general public in ways not yet fully accomplished by the competition. NEAR: Pioneering Sharding and User Benefits NEAR Protocol operates as a sharded Layer 1 blockchain optimized for speed, scalability, and user-friendliness. Its Proof-of-Stake consensus paired with Nightshade sharding processes thousands of transactions each second at low cost and almost immediate finality. This setup not only ensures a fluid developer experience but also strong dApp functionality. NEAR further prioritizes user accessibility through human-readable accounts and straightforward onboarding processes. For those engaged early with NEAR, the rewards have been significant. In the past year, its token value has increased from $2.72 to about $4.90 by March 2025—a rise of 80%. Meanwhile, its market cap has soared to approximately $5.77 billion, ranking NEAR among the top 30 cryptocurrencies worldwide. With ongoing expansions in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world applications, NEAR is continually attracting interest. Predictions suggest a potential rise to $8.21 by year”s end, strengthening confidence in its future and technological prowess. Aptos: High-Performance Layer 1 with Solid Basics Aptos stands as a Layer 1 blockchain engineered for supreme throughput, minimal latency, and enhanced security. It employs the Move programming language—originally crafted at Meta—affording developers secure, adaptable smart contract options. Aptos distinguishes itself with its parallel processing engine and swift transaction finalization, marking it as an effective platform for dApps and business applications. From a financial perspective, Aptos has maintained positive growth. Its token has appreciated about 17% over the past year, hitting near $13.00 in March 2025. Analysts expect the token could peak at $15.23 by the end of the year, with an average of about $13.34, indicating potential growth exceeding 50%. With its consistent progress and strong backing from venture capitalists, Aptos continues to capture attention, positioning itself as a formidable contender against major players like Ethereum and Solana. Its sustained development and increasing ecosystem engagement underscore Aptos as a stable choice in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Makes Crypto Easy for Everyone BlockDAG is redefining how we interact with blockchain technology, aiming to make participating in crypto as straightforward as using your favorite mobile app. Central to this approach are user-friendly tools designed to welcome not only tech-savvy users but everyone. For example, the X1 Miner App , now boasting 800,000 users, simplifies mining BDAG coins to just a few smartphone taps. Similarly, the TG Tap Miner game, available via Telegram, attracts users with its easy play-to-earn model, engaging over 400,000 players who earn while they play. Furthermore, BlockDAG is eliminating the complexities of digital creation. With its no-code token wizard, anyone can create tokens and NFTs without any coding knowledge—perfect for crafting community tokens or launching new collectibles with ease. The impact of these innovations is evident in the numbers. With over 19 billion coins already sold and more than $210 million raised in the presale, BlockDAG”s appeal is undeniable. The price per coin in Batch 27 is $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase for early participants from Batch 1. This shift in approach signals a new era where blockchain is not just accessible but also fun and profitable, paving the way for a diverse and inclusive decentralized future. Making Blockchain Easy for All Despite their advanced capabilities, platforms like NEAR and Aptos primarily cater to developers and experienced crypto users, excelling in speed and scalability but not in ease of use. BlockDAG is changing the game by prioritizing simplicity. With innovations like the X1 App for straightforward mobile mining , the TG Tap Miner game for easy crypto earning, and no-code solutions for token creation, BlockDAG is democratizing blockchain technology. In the race for widespread blockchain adoption, the platform that simplifies technology to make it most accessible will likely lead the way.

FLOKI and Popcat (POPCAT) have seen viral success thanks to meme culture and growing communities. But now, a new contender has entered the arena: Dragoin ($DDGN) . Unlike its Solana and BNB-based peers, Dragoin is blazing its own trail on Ethereum, combining Game of Thrones-inspired fantasy, a live Telegram-based game, and real token utility. Here’s why Dragoin’s public sale—now live at just $0.0000292—could be the meme coin bet of the year, with the potential to outperform even the likes of FLOKI and POPCAT in 2025. Dragoin’s Public Sale Is Live: 6,700% ROI Potential Sparks Buying Frenzy Forget buying into hype after the peak—Dragoin gives you the rare chance to enter early. The public sale is now live, with $DDGN priced at $0.0000292 in Stage 1. With a final launch price of $0.002, early buyers could see a 6,700% return if the token hits its target. That’s not speculation—it’s baked into the presale structure, which spans 25 stages, each one raising the token price while reducing availability. To add more fuel to the fire, all unsold tokens will be permanently burned—no rollovers, no second chances. That built-in deflation mechanism creates an urgency few meme coins can offer. It’s simple: if you wait, you’ll pay more. If you miss out, the opportunity’s gone for good. This deflationary model is designed to favor those who move fast—a stark contrast to coins like FLOKI and POPCAT, where massive circulating supplies can dilute returns. Dragoin isn’t just a coin—it’s a full-blown interactive experience. Players can hatch their own dragons and guide them through a Telegram-based game, dodging obstacles and earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s one of the few meme coins that delivers real-time utility before it hits exchanges. With upcoming roadmap milestones including expanded gameplay, leaderboard competitions, and exchange listings in Q3 2025, Dragoin is building momentum—not just with memes but with engagement. In an era where most meme coins are passive holdings, Dragoin gives users a reason to participate every day. This interactivity is attracting growing social chatter—and history proves social volume is a key trigger for major rallies in the meme coin world. Just look at what happened with FLOKI and PEPE: once the internet took notice, prices soared. FLOKI: Multi-Chain Growth, But Headwinds Ahead FLOKI Inu started as a joke, but it”s now grown into a recognizable brand with real market presence. Its multi-chain functionality—on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain—has been a key strength. Recent data shows FLOKI is trading around $0.00005964, up over 31% in the past month, with analysts forecasting a 2025 range between $0.000066 and $0.000333. The upcoming Valhalla metaverse upgrade in Q1 2025 could give FLOKI a fresh boost. But despite strong derivatives sentiment and a bullish Fear & Greed Index, FLOKI’s large market cap means exponential gains like 1000x are far less likely today than during its early days. Popcat (POPCAT): Viral Sensation, But Treading Water Popcat launched in December 2023 on Solana, built around the viral image of a cat named Oatmeal. At its peak in November 2024, POPCAT reached $2.08—a remarkable climb from its low valuation. Currently trading near $1.65, the coin has already rewarded early backers with over 400% returns. Analysts now forecast POPCAT could reach $2.79 in 2025, and even $5.87 by 2030, depending on adoption and sentiment. But as meme coin fatigue sets in across Solana, growth may slow. Network congestion, token saturation, and declining DEX volumes on Solana are creating headwinds. Which Meme Coin Will Dominate 2025? FLOKI has proven it can build a long-term brand. Popcat gave the market a viral hit. But Dragoin is giving investors what they really want right now—an early-stage chance at outsized returns, backed by real engagement and a play-to-earn model that’s already live. If you missed FLOKI at $0.000005 or POPCAT under $1, this is your shot to catch the next big one early. Dragoin’s public sale is live. The burn is real. The dragons are flying. Grab your $DDGN now—before the next stage hits and prices rise again.

Trump’s new blanket tariffs target a long list of nations and go further than many analysts expected, sparking widespread economic uncertainty and volatility in both traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin’s price has plummeted from a 24-hour high of $87,790 down to $82,223 at time of publishing, with $518 billion in liquidations hitting BTC and the digital asset market at large in the last day, according to CoinGlass. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,000 points in after-hours trading, the S&P 500 futures have dropped by 3.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures have dropped 4.2%. Trump has signed an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, effective April 5th, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. At a Rose Garden address, Trump said the reciprocal tariffs are designed to address decades of unfair trade practices and restore economic fairness for the United States.

After experiencing significant volatility and undergoing a consolidation due to recent price declines, technical indicators now show support for XRP’s bullish outlook. As a result, the analyst has provided a short—and long-term price target for the cryptocurrency. XRP Price Projected To Reverse To $3.5 According to ‘Setupsfx’, a crypto analyst on TradingView, XRP is now in a bullish reversal phase, meaning its price is expected to break out of its recent downturn and rise to new highs. Based on the expert’s chart analysis of XRP, the cryptocurrency is predicted to see an explosive increase to $3.5 following the end of its consolidation phase. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support The chart indicates that the price of XRP is expected to rise to $3.5 in the coming months. However, from a fundamental analysis perspective, the analyst believes XRP is not limited to this bullish price target and could potentially surpass it to exceed current all-time highs of $3.84. While the TradingView expert’s analysis of XRP maintains a neutral stance, implying uncertainty in the trend, he has also emphasized the cryptocurrency’s strong potential for growth. Hence, XRP could experience significant upward movement if market conditions align favorably and investor sentiment and confidence strengthen. For his short-term price target, the crypto analyst forecasts that XRP could rally to a level above $3.5. He advises traders who intend to hold their positions for a short period to aim for this price level, as it could be a strategic exit point before a potential pullback. Notably, the analyst’s long-term price target for XRP has been set at $4.0 or higher. Considering XRP’s price is currently trading at $2.09, a surge to $4 would represent an almost 100% increase in its price. Technical Elements Supporting Bullish Reversal In his chart analysis, Setupsfx highlights XRP’s price action in a 12-hour time frame, showcasing key movements, trends, and technical elements that support his bullish projection. These elements include liquidity and IMB zones, which are areas where price action is expected due to pending orders. Related Reading: XRP Price To $110? Bollinger Bands Creator Reveals Why It Will Become A Market Leader The analyst also highlights an accumulation phase, as XRP has been consolidating at lower levels, signaling the possibility of a potential breakout. The appearance of strong low wicks further indicates that buyers are regaining control of the market. Finally, the TradingView analyst has indicated that the altcoin has already undergone a three-point trendline rejection, which means it has tested and rejected a resistance level multiple times. The expert’s price chart also provides an ideal entry point for both short and long-term traders, marked at $1.8. A stop loss has also been placed significantly lower around $1.2 to minimize potential losses.

MUTM has already surpassed $6 million in funding, with more than 7,700 holders taking their positions early, and at just $0.025 in phase four of its presale, the time is now! That’s why investors are piling into Phase 4 before it sells out, as they expect a 20% price move to $0.03 for the next stage. The math is simple for newcomers: a $530 at this price could expand to $530,000 if MUTM only achieves a portion of its projected targets post-launch. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Unlike meme coins or some other over-hyped asset, Mutuum Finance provides real utility offering decentralized lending and borrowing. Their unique model introduces mtTokens, which are a product of deposited assets in mpTokens and which automatically start accruing interest after their creation, allowing liquidity providers to earn passive income. Overcollateralized loans are used by borrowers to see to it that the system is stable. That real world functionality is what differentiates MUTM from 100% speculative plays. It has a built-in buy pressure mechanism, which increase its appeal. A part of the platform proceeds are used to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens on the market and then distributed among the stakers. That creates a constant demand, which brings growth in price in the long run. Given such a strong economic architecture, experts forecast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surging past $1 after launch, representing life-changing gains for early supporters. Presale Momentum Builds Phase 4 is filling up quickly, with the following phase poised to raise the price to $0.03—a 20% jump from the existing $0.025. If purchased now, that guarantees instant 140% profit at the official listing price (0.06 USDT). But the true opportunity is after launch. Or if the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) breaks conservatively over post-listing estimate $1.50, early investors would be able to profit from up to 5900% gains. A Certik audit of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project’s smart contract is in progress, providing another layer of legitimacy. This news will send investor confidence to a whole new height, an official confirmation on Mutuum Finance social channels will be made once confirmed. Pepe (PEPE) and Ethereum (ETH) On the Losing End Though Pepe (PEPE) spins off meme culture and Ethereum (ETH) stands on the blockchain short list, neither can serve the rotor-based growth attractively presented by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). PEPE is volatile, so it is a risky bet, while ETH’s high entry price is limiting explosive gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) needs no new marketing in 2025, which is why at sub-$0.05 in presale it could be the even smarter play. As Phase 4 marches toward its conclusion, time is running out for early investors to lock in even the tightest prices for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The 20% jump in the next phase will squeeze margins for latecomers. With the project fundamentals and aggressive buy-back system, this entry point may be one that you do not want to miss, as it could lead to generational wealth. Last Chance: Will You Do It, or Will You Hate Yourself Later Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an all-in-one financial solution, and it’s paving the way for a new decentralized economy. The numbers don’t lie: a $530 investment today could potentially be 100x by the end of 2025. With presale selling out stage by stage and exchange listings on the horizon, it’s time to act.

The public presale has just gone live, and crypto buyers are getting in quickly. With its Game of Thrones-style theme, a live Telegram game that pays users, and an entry price of only $0.0000292, Dragoin is turning heads fast—and those who get in early could be looking at up to 6,700% in returns. What makes Dragoin different is how it combines meme appeal with real utility. It’s not just another token riding hype. Right from day one, users can play and earn $DDGN, all while joining a growing, gamified community. There are 25 presale stages in total, and the current price is the lowest it will ever be—making Stage 1 the ideal time to join. Dragoin Picks Up Speed as a Top Meme Coin for 2025 The excitement around Dragoin isn’t just for show—it’s being driven by timing, features, and a clear use case. As more people discover the presale, it’s not just the theme they’re drawn to—it’s what Dragoin delivers. From seasoned investors to newcomers in the meme coin space, the appeal is wide. Dragoin stands out by blending crypto with storytelling. Every presale stage is named after a memorable Game of Thrones event, giving each stage a sense of purpose and energy. But there’s more to it than clever names. The project’s structure rewards early buyers and creates urgency as prices increase. Here’s why people are paying attention: Play & Earn: The Telegram Game That Pays in $DDGN Dragoin focuses on getting users involved. Anyone can play the Telegram-based mini-game right away—no downloads or apps needed. Just jump in, guide your dragon through challenges, and earn tokens along the way. It’s easy, fun, and actually pays you to play. This kind of engagement builds interest fast. The game gives $DDGN real purpose and makes it more than a buy-and-hold coin. As more players join and earn, the token’s ecosystem grows stronger—and demand goes up. Plus, early buyers get access to staking, decision-making votes, and exclusive game perks, giving them extra reasons to stick around. What really draws attention is Dragoin’s deflationary model. All unsold tokens in every stage get burned for good. That means the token supply shrinks while demand rises—giving extra strength to its price over time. The supply is capped, the game is active, and the burn is already happening. Stage 1 Is the Cheapest Entry—Don’t Miss Your Window Dragoin’s presale is broken into 25 stages, each one priced higher than the last. That means those buying in Stage 1 are getting the best deal. Once it sells out, the price goes up, and there’s no going back. As the project gains steam and tokens get burned, that low entry disappears fast. Buying is simple. Use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet to buy with ETH, USDT, or BNB. No KYC, no paperwork—just a quick, easy way to join before the next price jump. Right now, every minute matters. Dragoin is trending on Telegram and meme coin discussion boards, and interest is rising quickly. The sooner you act, the better your spot when the token launches in Q4. Buy Before the Burn—This Could Be the Start of Something Big Dragoin is changing the game for meme coin launches. It’s not just a flashy token—it’s an active project where users play, earn, and connect. With a working game, a shrinking token supply, and up to 6,700% ROI potential, the first stage of this presale could be a turning point for early buyers. The presale is open now, and savvy investors are already locking in their spots. Don’t wait to hear about Dragoin’s success after it’s too late. Buy now, before the next stage kicks in—because once the burn hits and prices climb, your chance to get in early will be long gone.

With multiple nations including India and the United Kingdom (UK), now weighing retaliatory responses, BTC price remains at risk as safety trades drive Gold (XAU) price to all time highs near $3,200. Trump’s Tariff Sends Global Markets into Turmoil The Bitcoin price took a sharp dive, hitting lows of $82,000 on April 2, 2025, as financial markets reeled from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement. During his ‘ Liberation Day ’ speech, Trump revealed aggressive reciprocal tariff rates on numerous trade partners, declaring it a long-overdue correction to America’s trade imbalances. The new tariffs, which include a 26% “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on Indian imports, 20% on European Union goods, and 34% on Chinese exports, have ignited concerns about escalating global trade tensions. Key details from Trump’s tariff speech In a highly charged speech at the White House, Trump emphasised that new trade policy, aimed at counteracting what Trump calls “unfair trade practices,” imposes significant tariffs on major trading partners. The key highlights include: China: 34% European Union: 20% South Korea: 25 India: 26% Japan: 24% United Kingdom: 10% Taiwan: 32% Vietnam: 46% Trump particularly criticised India, citing its high tariffs on U.S. goods. “India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. They charge us 52%. For years, we charged them almost nothing. The Prime Minister just left. He’s a great friend of mine, but I said, ‘You are a friend of mine, but you are not treating us right” US President Donald Trump, April 2, 2025 Market Reaction: Gold hits new all-time highs as BTC Faces Instant Sell-off The cryptocurrency market reacted swiftly, with Bitcoin leading the decline. Within hours of the announcement, Bitcoin price tumbled to $82,200, erasing gains from the previous days, when prices surged as high as $87,400 on Wednesday. Bitcoin Price Action After Announced New Tariffs, April 2 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap Investors fear that the aggressive tariff stance could disrupt global economic stability, reducing liquidity in speculative assets like Bitcoin and drive demand towards safe-haven assets such as Gold ( XAU ). Gold (XAU) Price Action After Trump Announced New Tariffs, April 2 2025 | Source: KitcoNews Validating this stance Gold price surged to new all time highs above $3,150, within hours of Trump’s tariff announcement. Historically, Bitcoin has often benefited from its status as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, since Trump’s inauguration, BTC has exhibited close correlation to US Stocks, due to to heavy involvement of the US government and the direct exposure from Wall Street big wigs like Blackrock and Michael Saylor’s Strategy (Fomerly known as Microstrategy). Consequently, Bitcoin price is likely to track US Stocks’ movements in the coming weeks, according to Martrixsport Bitcoin Price Forecast: What’s Next After Finding Support at $82,000? Bitcoin price is stabilising near $83,178 after testing the $82,000 support level, but technical indicators on the BTC price forecast charts suggest bearish pressure still persists. First, the Bollinger Bands indicate contracting volatility, with the price nearing the lower band at $80,871. A break below this could open the door to further losses. Meanwhile, the VWAP at $82,886 suggests Bitcoin is hovering near a key liquidity zone, with buyers defending this area. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSDT The MACD indicator is bearish, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, reinforcing downside risks. The histogram remains negative, indicating weakening momentum. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the 20-day moving average at $84,498, sellers could push it towards $80,000. Conversely, a close above $84,498 may trigger a short-term rebound, targeting the upper Bollinger Band at $88,125. However, with declining volume and weakening bullish momentum, the upside scenario remains uncertain. Bitcoin price forecast remains cautiously bearish unless buyers reclaim key resistance levels. A break below $82,000 could intensify selling, aligning Bitcoin with broader market uncertainty following Trump’s tariff announcement.

Binance is proceeding with the decentralized listing program but Pi Network is noticeably absent from the raft of cryptocurrencies. Pi Network Fails To Make Binance List Pi Network enthusiasts are in limbo following the absence of the token in Binance’s Vote to List initiative. According to a press release , Binance has opened voting for its second Vote to List initiative. This time, 12 tokens are up for community voting, with Binance proceeding to spot-list successful tokens. Apart from vote count, Binance says it will consider trading demand, a risk assessment, and a compliance check to decide on tokens that will make the listing. The selected tokens include VIRTUAL, BIGTIME, UXLINK, MORPHO, GRASS, ATH, WAL, SAFE, ZETA, IP, ONDO, and PLUME. While the first focused on memecoin, the second iteration beams a searchlight on utility tokens cutting across several verticals. Back in March, Binance excluded Pi Network from its first edition of the Vote to List initiative. Binance has clarified that only BNB-based projects will be allowed to participate in the Vote to List initiative, dousing optimism for Pi Network enthusiasts. When Will Binance List The Asset? Despite Pi missing out on the Vote to List program, there is still a ray of hope for community members. Binance can list Pi via a direct listing in the future but a timeline is unavailable. Experts say a lack of transparency by The PiCoreTeam (PCT) is a reason why Binance has not listed Pi Network. Particularly, the exchange took swipes at the PCT for failing to give proper disclosures on the Pi Network’s locking and burning mechanism. Pi Network secured a major listing on the BTCC Exchange, bringing the token closer to being listed on mainstream exchanges. While a listing hovers on the horizon for Pi, the PCT’s domain auction is gathering steam with over 200,000 bids. Pi price has been largely underwhelming over the last day, losing nearly 5%. Pi trades at $0.6646 to drop below the $0.7 mark for the first time in over a month.

The Trump administration has hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5 , with some countries facing even larger rates, such as China facing a 34% tariff, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. During an April 2 speech in the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said the US is charging countries “approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.” 🚨 @POTUS signs an Executive Order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. It's LIBERATION DAY in America! pic.twitter.com/p7UnfE617B — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) April 2, 2025 The crypto market briefly went up at the news of a 10% sweeping tariff, but once the full scope became known, it dipped with bleeding across the board. Bitcoin ( BTC ) had been staging a rally, reaching a session high at $88,500 but dropped 2.6% back to around $82,876. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data shows Ether ( ETH ) dropped over 6% from $1,934 to $1,797 following the tariff announcements and the total crypto market cap dropped 5.3% to $2.7 trillion. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 25, classed as extreme fear, in its latest April 2 update. However, prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 0.8% to $83,205. While Ether regained 1.2% to take back $1,810. The crypto Fear & Greed Index score has returned an average rating of fear for the last week but has now dipped to extreme fear. Source: Alternative.me Stock markets didn't fare much better; trading resource The Kobeissi Letter said in an April 2 post to X that the stock market index S&P 500 erased over $2 trillion in market cap, working out to be roughly $125 billion per minute. Trump tariffs could bring certainty to markets Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the brief surge was a case of “uncertainty relief,” then a sell-off as the full tariff details were released. “On BTC Markets, trading volume surged 46% as local traders scrambled to reposition. Big players took profit on the spike, while smaller investors hesitated,” she said in a statement. Source: Daan Crypto Trades She added that if China or the European Union “hit back hard,” expect another round of panic selling . US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response, which could provide a “ceiling” and certainty for markets. David Hernandez, a crypto investment specialist at crypto asset manager 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that markets experienced significant volatility during Trump’s speech, but the clarity could be a good thing in the long term. “Although the tariff rates were slightly higher than expectations, the announcement provided much-needed clarity on the scope and scale of the policy,” he said. Related: 70% chance of crypto bottoming before June amid trade fears: Nansen “Markets thrive on certainty, and with speculation now largely removed, institutional investors may see an opportunity over the coming days to take advantage of compressed valuations.” Hernandez says global responses will be key for the market going forward, speculating that Mexico and key East Asian economies, including China, South Korea, and Japan, could be evaluating countermeasures.

Solana and Avalanche have made big moves—Solana with its hybrid PoH-PoS model and Avalanche with its multi-chain setup. Both offer speed, modularity, and impressive adoption figures. But while they rack up headlines and returns, BlockDAG is taking a different route. Its Beta Testnet focuses on practical testing, not promises. With $210.5 million raised and 19 billion coins already sold, BlockDAG’s live testing phase is less a teaser and more a readiness trial for mainnet. Solana: Ultra-Fast Network Building Momentum Solana relies on a mix of Proof of History and Proof of Stake to keep transactions fast and fees low. It handles more than 65,000 transactions per second, putting it among the top contenders for blockchain speed. Those who joined Solana’s $0.22 seed round in 2020 saw huge gains as it surged past $200 in earlier bull markets. From March 2024 to March 2025, Solana jumped from $20 to over $175—an increase of more than 750%. Its daily active addresses have grown 450%, and in January 2025 alone, it brought in $250M in fee revenue—outpacing Ethereum. Solana now counts over 3.25 million users and leads in developer activity, drawing in DeFi and NFT builders alike. It’s pushing hard to stay a top choice for scalable blockchain use. Avalanche: Flexible Layer-1 with a Big Year Behind It Avalanche, developed by Ava Labs, uses a three-chain system—X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain—to keep things scalable and efficient. Its Snowman consensus protocol delivers near-instant finality, helping it support more traffic. Early buyers who got AVAX at $0.50 during its 2020 sale saw big returns when the token passed $60 in early 2025. From March 2024 to March 2025, AVAX gained nearly 250%, thanks to upgrades like Avalanche9000. That update made launching subnet blockchains easier, bringing more developers to the ecosystem. Daily transactions went up more than 300% year-over-year, and total value locked (TVL) more than doubled. Avalanche’s flexible approach to blockchain design is attracting both enterprises and DeFi teams looking to build real-world solutions. BlockDAG’s Beta Is a Stress Test, Not a Showcase Launched on March 28, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet isn’t just a technical preview—it’s a live-fire testing ground. Designed to stress every layer of the network, the testnet pushes for over 15,000 daily transactions and 200 active mining nodes, exposing weak points and measuring decentralization in real time. It also puts token logistics under the microscope, simulating the vesting and distribution process for more than 110,000 presale buyers—making sure everything works before mainnet goes live. Behind the scenes, a 24/7 Freshdesk pipeline logs issues and escalates them directly to dev teams for rapid response. What’s backing this no-room-for-error rollout? A huge wave of support. BlockDAG has already raised $210.5 million in presale funds, selling over 19 billion coins. At a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27, early adopters have seen a 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. Bottom line: this phase isn’t about theory—it’s real-time validation under pressure. Stress-Tested vs. Live-Deployed Solana and Avalanche have proven they can grow fast and scale high—but both are already deep into live deployments. BlockDAG, in contrast, is focusing on proving its reliability first. From vesting simulations for more than 110,000 wallets to performance benchmarks across thousands of transactions and mining operations, the Beta Testnet is built around real validation. With a 2,380% return since Batch 1 and strong community engagement, BlockDAG is prioritizing long-term reliability over short-term headlines. And when the mainnet finally launches, that careful testing may prove to be its biggest asset.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Close To Neutral Region The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking These Levels Could Be The Catalyst For Next Bull Run, Analyst Says To determine this sentiment, the index uses data on five factors: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The metric makes use of a numeric scale running from zero to hundred for representing this estimated mentality. All values above 53 correlate to a sentiment of greed, while those under 47 that to fear. The territory between these cutoffs represents a net-neutral mentality. Now, here is what the current Bitcoin sentiment is like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 44 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of fear. This crowd despair is only slightly dominant, though, as the metric is just three units away from the neutral zone. The same wasn’t the case just yesterday, however, as the indicator held a value of 34, firmly placing it in the fear region. Below is a chart that shows how the index’s value has developed during the past year. Looks like the metric has seen a sharp improvement compared to a few days ago | Source: Alternative From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was around the neutral zone in the final week of March, but the price plunge that came during the last couple of days of the month led to a rapid deterioration of sentiment. At its lowest, the indicator touched the 26 mark during the plummet. This value was so deep into the fear region that it was on the entryway to a special zone called the extreme fear (25 and under). Historically, Bitcoin and other digital assets have tended to move in the direction that the crowd least expects. The probability of such a contrary move rises, and the stronger investor sentiment becomes, so extreme fear is where bottoms are likely to take place. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Down, But Whale Wallets Quietly Climb to 4-Month High During the recent plunge, the index didn’t enter into this zone, but it did come close, which may be why BTC’s price was able to reach a local bottom. Since the low, the asset has made some recovery and has now broken past $85,000. With investor sentiment no longer being strong in any direction following this recovery, the cryptocurrency might be roughly equally probable to move in either direction. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $85,000, down almost 4% in the last seven days.

The two Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. have raised concerns about former President Donald Trump’s financial ties to the cryptocurrency sector. They urged acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda in an April 2 letter to preserve all WLFI records and share details with Congress. They fear that Trump’s financial stake in the company might maneuver regulations in the crypto business. The legislators are especially worried that Trump’s administration will lean on the SEC to reach favorable decisions for crypto companies that benefit him and his family. The letter stated: “The financial interest that the Trump family has in World Liberty Financial presents an unprecedented conflict of interest that has the potential to shape the Trump Administration’s oversight — or absence of oversight — of the cryptocurrency industry.” They contend that government agencies — the SEC is just one of them — must not be swayed by personal business interests. Experts have concerns about Trump’s crypto plans Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency has ballooned recently, with lawmakers expressing worry. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) recently issued a stablecoin named USD1 on several major blockchain networks. Since January, Trump has launched various crypto approaches, including a national cryptocurrency stockpile that would serve as a government reserve to hold large proportions of digital currency. He has also launched the TRUMP memecoin, a cryptocurrency connected to the political brand he can use to raise money or rally his base. Lawmakers worry that Trump’s rising power in the crypto sphere could result in policy shifts that directly profit him. The risk here, in particular, is that he could advocate for WLFI’s stablecoin to be adopted for government transactions, enabling his family to profane directly from public funds. Representative Maxine Waters voiced those concerns in a hearing on April 2 in the House Financial Services Committee, saying that without adequate oversight, Trump could set up WLFI’s stablecoin as an official mode of payment for government services. That, she contended, raised significant ethical concerns because it would enable Trump and his family members to profit financially from the government policies enacted during his presidency. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have urged more transparency about Trump’s financial transactions in the cryptocurrency industry in response to these concerns. They have formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to retain records of any communications with Trump’s family regarding WLFI and any back-and-forths with Trump campaign donors connected to crypto firms. They also seek documentation relating to changes in SEC policies surrounding cryptocurrency since Trump took office. They are concerned that the SEC will be an independent regulator without political influence and that financial policy does not put Trump’s business interests ahead of the public good. The SEC is changing its leadership and crypto regulations Since Trump was inaugurated, the SEC has undergone significant leadership turnover, which has changed the agency’s approach to virtual currency regulation. Under Trump, with Mark Uyeda as acting SEC chair, the agency shelved investigations and enforcement actions against multiple crypto companies. Some companies employ executives who donated to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. This has raised concerns that political and financial interests are polluting the SEC and distracting it from its mission of implementing financial laws fairly. Now, Trump is formally nominating Paul Atkins as the next permanent chair of the SEC. Famous for his pro-business orientation and deregulatory outlook, Atkins is a controversial pick to supervise financial markets. His nomination was scheduled to be voted on by the Senate Banking Committee on April 3. If confirmed by the full Senate, he will become the official chair of the SEC. It was important that the American people know — whether their money markets were being regulated objectively, or whether decisions were being made regarding regulatory issues for the financial benefit of the president’s family,” their letter concluded.

With its presale already surpassing $14.3 million and a growing reputation for utility in the real world, Remittix is attracting serious attention. The project’s crypto-to-fiat payment system solves a serious global need, making it stand out in a market dominated by hype-driven projects. As ETH and MATIC traders continue to double down, RTX is gradually becoming the most recommended token to purchase in 2025. Ethereum Price: ETH Must Reclaim $2,300 to Confirm a Bullish Reversal Ethereum has endured a rough ride over the past year. While BTC is up by 18% in the same period, ETH has remained nearly 50% below its previous high, leaving early adopters to anticipate a rebound. For ETH holders, the frustration has been building, but analysts like Ali Martinez believe the story is not yet over. According to his recent analysis, Ethereum needs to return to the $2,100 price mark and then the $2,300 price region before it can trigger the bulls. Until the asset returns to those levels, it may continue to experience sideways movement. ETH’s last attempt to break the level came on March 9 when the asset hit $2,100 briefly before slipping to $1,754, a move that triggered the bulls in the short term before testing the resistance zones. For Ethereum to register an upward price movement, the asset needs to move above the $2,300 price mark. Some analysts are still hopeful, while others like Rookie suggest Ethereum price could still drop as low as $1,200 by the middle of the year before recovering. In the current market, both outcomes are likely, which is why many Ethereum and Polygon investors are splitting their assets, looking for new layer-1 tokens with a big upside potential. Polygon Struggles to Recover as Bearish Pattern Persists Polygon is currently facing one of the toughest market stretches in years, with long time traders suddenly cautious about the market. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently mentioned that POL has remained in a descending triangle for a long time, a sign that shows that the bears have been in the market for the past four years. Despite several attempts to rebound, the $0.32 support eventually gave way in late february, confirming that another slight drop could send the token to as low as $0.04. The drop will represent an 86% drop from the token’s previous levels, a situation that has made many traders reconsider their positions. The recent trading activity has not helped the confidence in the market either. POL showed a brief rise, but quickly returned to a tight range between $0.2035 and $0.2136. With the volume drying up and no buying pressure, investors are seeing monthly losses, with the asset down 35% in the last 30 days and 70% in the year. Recovery looks far-fetched unless a new catalyst enters the market. For now, the market behavior shows that the bears are still in control. In response to these market conditions, early investors in polygon alongside Ethereum holders are seeking fresh opportunities in the market, and one name keeps coming up: Remittix (RTX). With POL presently stuck in a zone, Remittix is looking like the best alternative that experienced POL investors never knew they needed. The asset offers them potential and real use cases that POL, which is still struggling presently, should be delivering. Remittix Gains Momentum With Over $14.3 Million Raised in Presale Among the many tokens that have been catching the attention of investors in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is standing out, not because of its hype, but for its innovation. Now priced at $0.0734 with about $14.3 million already raised and 525 million tokens sold, Remittix is attracting serious attention. The project is not focusing on flashy tech or untested narrative, as it wants to solve a big global problem: real-time, affordable, cross-border payments. And that is what early Ethereum and Polygon investors are betting on. Unlike speculative tokens like Arbitrum or unproven ones like Celestia, Remittix has already its niche as a PayFi platform with purpose. The project allows users to instantly convert crypto into fiat currencies for bank deposits, removing high fees and long delays that affect traditional payment systems. Whether it’s an NGO sending urgent funds across continents or freelancers moving payments between wallets and bank accounts, Remittix makes the process easy. This kind of utility is what early Polygon and Ethereum investors saw in the projects, and that is why they are moving to RTX. While most tokens remain in their experimental phase or are stuck with the resistance levels, Remittix offers something better: a working model that delivers speed, cost efficiency, and a better way to reach the unbanked. Early ETH and MATIC Holders Bet Big on Remittix As April continues to unfold and the market shows a cautious sign, traders are now carefully selecting their preferred tokens. They are no longer chasing every new chain or meme coin. Instead, they are moving funds to projects that offer value and with the power to last long in the market and Remittix checks all the boxes. It has already become the most talked about presale in Ethereum and Polygon circles, and with demand increasing, many believe that RTX could be the best-performing new token of the year.

With meme coins lighting up social feeds and portfolio dashboards alike, 2025 is shaping up to be another breakout year for high-risk, high-reward tokens. From the hilarious to the oddly philosophical, coins like Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), Book of Meme ($BOME), and Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT) are riding viral waves. But behind the scenes, an exclusive meme coin presale is stealing the spotlight among crypto insiders—and it’s called Troller Cat ($TCAT). While Dogs ($DOGS), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), Degen ($DEGEN), Comedian ($BAN), and Simon’s Cat ($CAT) compete in the open market, Troller Cat is still in stealth mode, quietly building hype through a private whitelist-only entry. Those watching the best meme coin presale scene closely already know getting in early can make all the difference. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT): The Private Presale That Could Define 2025’s Meme Run Troller Cat isn’t just a crypto project—it’s a movement. A digital trickster loaded with community mischief and layered utility, $TCAT is built on Ethereum and surrounded by heavy buzz. The project combines meme culture with tokenomics that reward early believers, and it’s designed to be deflationary by nature. From its rebellious branding to its loyal Discord-driven community, Troller Cat could claw its way into the spotlight once the presale ends. Here’s the big play: Troller Cat is currently in a private meme coin presale phase, available only through whitelist access. That means early investors can grab $TCAT at pre-launch pricing—with whispers of a play-to-earn Game Center and high-yield staking on the horizon. This project could grow more valuable over time because tokens will reportedly be burned as users play, reducing supply. The community is already rallying around this early access event. Sign up now to avoid being late to the game. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s not even live yet, but Troller Cat is already on track to become the best meme coin presale of 2025. 2. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY): The Calm Meme Coin in a Chaotic Crypto World Some meme coins go hard; CHILLGUY takes the opposite route. Built around laid-back vibes and a lifestyle of nonchalant winning, CHILLGUY embodies a new generation of meme tokens where attitude is everything. With a clean aesthetic and massive meme potential, this coin speaks to crypto traders tired of chaos and craving something a little cooler. The token has taken off on social media, helped by simple but effective visuals and organic meme engagement. The project team also teases casual NFT drops and gamified interactions without overpromising. Why This Coin Made It to the List: CHILLGUY is the most relaxed yet oddly magnetic meme coin of 2025. 3. Book of Meme ($BOME): Turning Meme History into On-Chain Legacy Book of Meme is a meme coin philosophy wrapped in the blockchain. BOME stands out for documenting, archiving, and tokenizing memes into on-chain legacy. It positions itself as the holy grail of meme lore—a decentralized archive for internet culture. Beyond concept, the project is building out tools that make meme minting, sharing, and staking possible within its ecosystem. This isn’t just about laughs; it’s about legacy. BOME also actively partners with other meme communities to ensure cultural preservation and crypto synergy. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Memes deserve a blockchain museum, and BOME is building one. 4. Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT): Where AI, Lore, and Crypto Collide ACT is the intersection of crypto memes and speculative fiction. It combines AI-generated storylines with crypto-powered characters to offer a truly narrative-driven token experience. Each holder contributes to the unfolding plotline—a decentralized story economy fueled by ACT tokens. While the tech is still evolving, its concept of merging storytelling and meme culture has already turned heads. The token is gaining traction on niche storytelling forums and among Web3 creators. Why This Coin Made It to the List: ACT is a narrative-driven meme coin with real storytelling chops. 5. Dogs ($DOGS): The Meme Coin With a Tail-Wagging Mission The dog meme never dies—and DOGS knows it. This project capitalizes on the endless love for canine tokens but shakes it up by supporting dog rescue initiatives through its DAO. It’s wholesome, meme-worthy, and well-timed for Gen Z and Millennial dog lovers. Thanks to its influencer-packed launch and real-world charity tie-ins, DOGS has grown rapidly. The roadmap includes NFT adoption certificates and metaverse dog parks. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DOGS brings heart to the meme market, proving memes can matter. 6. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Crude, Loud, and Surprisingly Effective Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. FARTCOIN is absurdly monetized. It’s loud, it’s crude, and it’s oddly refreshing. The coin has built a hilarious presence on TikTok and X with prank campaigns, funny sound NFTs, and community stunts. FARTCOIN doesn’t try to be serious, and that’s its strength. It delivers raw meme power to a crowd that craves entertainment over formality. Why This Coin Made It to the List: FARTCOIN proves that humor is still useful in the meme coin universe. 7. Degen ($DEGEN): Where High Risk Meets Meme Glory DEGEN is the meme coin that salutes its wildest holders. Built by traders, for traders, DEGEN is all about high-risk, high-reward play. It taps into trader culture with hilarious self-aware memes and a brutally honest tone. The community thrives on chaos—they love the volatility and wear it like a badge. The roadmap includes leaderboard trading games and a “Degen of the Week” spotlight. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DEGEN embraces the rollercoaster of crypto and builds a tribe around it. 8. Comedian ($BAN): Where Crypto and Comedy Share the Stage BAN is what happens when a stand-up set meets DeFi. It’s a meme coin dedicated to comedy, parodying everything from Web3 buzzwords to influencer scams. $BAN memes are some of the most creative in the space.

Eventual approvals in both the overall House and Senate would let lawmakers start melding the two versions into a unified piece of legislation that could get a final nod. Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump have aimed toward an August goal in getting the effort completed. Though the crypto industry and their most reliable Republican allies in Congress were happy to welcome many Democrats to the yes side on moving the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) out of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, the Democrats on the panel consistently raised concerns about Trump's connections to the industry and stablecoins. Still, five Democrats joined 27 Republicans on the committee to advance the bill after a marathon markup session. A week before the House committee focused on the bill in Wednesday's markup — a session in which lawmakers make changes and debate amendments on legislation — the Trump-tied World Liberty Financial (WLFI) announced it's supporting its own stablecoin (USD1). Trump has been highly active in crypto, including in selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and memecoin $TRUMP, even as he pushes for crypto-friendly policies at the federal level. U.S. regulation of stablecoins — generally dollar-tied tokens, such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC — is one of the two top policy priorities for the industry. And committee Chairman French Hill argued on the industry's behalf that ""innovation needs guardrails, not roadblocks."" Republican members declined to discuss President Trump's industry involvement in any explicit terms. When Waters and other Democrats pushed amendments to block the potential conflicts raised by the president's business interests and his direct authority over regulators who would make decisions about stablecoins, they were rejected by the panel's Republicans, who repeatedly called such protections ""unnecessary."" ""We don't discriminate on entrepreneurs based on who they are and where they come from,"" Hill said. If the government wants clear guardrails around this space, he repeatedly argued, the best move is to pass the bill that establishes oversight. Representative Maxine Waters, the senior Democrat on the panel, said that Trump ""leveraged the power of the presidency to establish multiple crypto schemes to enrich himself and his family,"" calling it a ""display of greed."" ""He's unlike any other issuer, because he's the president of the United States,"" said Representative Stephen Lynch, the ranking Democrat on the panel's digital assets subcommittee, who argued Trump would be in a position to sign off on any government help needed by his own business interests were they to fail. ""If this was a Democratic president who was trying to do this, the Republicans' hair would be on fire, and rightly so. This should not be happening."" Another Democrat, Illinois Representative Sean Castin, argued that Tron's Justin Sun has put tens of millions of dollars into WLFI for no clear return other than its relationship to the Trump family. He contended that government officials tied to stablecoins could be influenced by foreign investors in a way that's hidden from public scrutiny. The Democratic arguments failed to move the committee's Republican majority, so no new amendments stuck to the effort. Supporters have said this House version is largely parallel to the Senate's. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican, said the House version properly maintains sufficient authority in the hands of state regulators, which offers a ""lighter touch, at times."" ""We have an administration that is ready to embrace these products, and the time is now,"" Huizenga said. This was one of a few bills before the House Financial Services Committee dealing with crypto-tied topics. Another piece of legislation debated on Wednesday was one that would form a cross-government group of law-enforcement agencies to address illicit crypto use and another that would ban U.S.-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC). Lawmakers also voted on dozens of amendments to the stablecoin bill before voting to advance the bill itself, prompting Rep. Lynch to joke that the panel may have set a record for the most failed votes in a row. The cross-government bill, the Financial Technology Protection Act, passed with unanimous support, 49-0. The anti-CBDC bill passed with 27 votes, with 22 lawmakers voting against. Though lawmakers initially had issues with their electronic voting system, they began making good time after starting votes near 10:30 p.m. ET – nearly 12.5 hours after the markup began. Voting on all five bills wrapped up by 11:15 p.m. ET. As the stablecoin bill continues to move forward, Trump is also poised to sign the first pro-crypto congressional action: a resolution that erases an Internal Revenue Service rule that targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. The president is expected to sign the resolution, though he hasn't announced a schedule to do so.

Neuralink is looking for people with quadriplegia — those who are not able to use their arms or legs — to sign up for a clinical trial, it said in an April 2 post on X, the social media platform also owned by Musk. As of January, Neuralink has said that three patients have been implanted with a device. All are quadriplegic and are testing a small brain implant that tracks neural activity to control a computer or smartphone as part of a clinical trial called the Precise Robotically Implanted Brain-Computer Interface, or PRIME study. Neuralink is one of several companies and academic institutions developing and testing so-called brain-computer interfaces, which vary from small wire-like implants as part of clinical trials to non-invasive devices akin to a hat. Source: Neuralink Neuralink’s website says its clinical PRIME study, which will take around six years, is looking for quadriplegics with spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to use their thoughts to control a computer. Musk also heads vehicle maker Tesla and is the Trump administration's government cost-cutting czar . He has said he wants Neuralink to move beyond just allowing humans to operate computers by thinking and wants to help “give people superpowers.” First Neuralink patient reports no side effects after a year Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink's first patient, said in a March 28 X post that he’s “had no negative side effects, neither physically nor psychologically” in the year after receiving his brain implant. Arbaugh, a quadriplegic, demoed his brain chip about a year ago by controlling a computer cursor to play chess and surf the web. https://t.co/OMIeGGjYtG — Neuralink (@neuralink) March 20, 2024 Arbaugh said he’s now using his brain chip “for all sorts of things” and guessed he’s using it for over 10 hours a day.

This steep drop follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s Apr. 2 announcement of aggressive new “ Liberation Day ” tariffs, which unsettled both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Trump’s policy sets a 10% baseline tariff on imports, with much higher rates for specific countries. China is now subject to a 54% tariff, which combines a new 34% rate with an existing 20% duty. A 20% rate will be imposed on the European Union, while Vietnam (46%), Taiwan (32%), India (26%), and Japan (24%) will also be affected by increased rates. However, Canada and Mexico are exempt from the 10% baseline tariff and additional reciprocal levies for now. The 10% tariff would only be imposed if Trump withdraws the 25% duties that are currently in place on these nations, which were put in place initially because of concerns about drug trafficking and crime.

Although investors responded with skepticism, he claimed that the measure would protect American industries and result in lower prices for consumers. Following Trump’s tariffs announcement, U.S. stock markets plummeted, with Dow futures dropping over 1,000 points and significant losses in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Crypto markets followed suit. The broader crypto market cap shrank 4% to $2.7 trillion, as per crypto.news price tracker . Bitcoin ( BTC ) initially spiked to $88,500 as Trump took the stage but quickly dropped to $83,073, down 2% in the last 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies also saw losses. Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 4% to $1,816, while Solana ( SOL ) dropped 5.2% to $119. The sell-off triggered $514 million in 24 liquidations, with $290 million coming from long positions, according to Coinglass data . Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, noted via X that while the market has reacted negatively to the the “Liberation Day” tariffs, the market would be “out of the woods” if Bitcoin stays above $76,500 until U.S. tax day on April 15.

However, newer, more efficient blockchain projects are emerging, offering lower fees, faster transactions, and greater scalability. This has caused ETH and SOL to drop by 50% and 37%, respectively, in the last year, pushing investors to reconsider their positions. One hidden crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quickly gaining traction and could outperform both Ethereum and Solana. This innovative project offers AI-powered investment tools and real-world asset integration. Could it be the next market leader? Why Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Struggle to Maintain Their Lead Ethereum and Solana, two leading blockchain platforms, have struggled to keep dominating the rapidly evolving market. Their challenges have created opportunities for emerging competitors to gain traction. Ethereum suffers from scalability issues, high gas fees, institutional hesitation, governance inefficiencies, and fierce competition from emerging blockchains. Ethereum’s scalability issues have led to high transaction fees and frustrating users and developers. While Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum aim to mitigate these problems, they have not fully resolved the network’s inefficiencies. Slow decision-making within Ethereum’s decentralized governance model has delayed critical upgrades, such as sharding, which is essential for improving scalability. This has weakened its ability to adapt quickly to market demands. Solana’s biggest challenge is its network stability issues. Solana has faced repeated outages that undermine its reliability as a blockchain platform. These disruptions have raised questions about its ability to handle large-scale adoption. There are also centralization risks, capital outflows, and competition from multi-chain platforms. These Ethereum and Solana struggles are pushing investors to newer cryptos that address their shortcomings and offer more tangible value, like RCOF. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Crypto Quickly Gaining Traction Compared to Ethereum and Solana, RCO Finance is emerging as a strong alternative that provides ingenious solutions and transforms how investors interact with the market.

Which Of These Could 50x By August According To Top Crypto Analysts",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-solana-or-remittix-which-of-these-could-50x-by-august-according-to-top-crypto-analysts/,"As crypto markets regain momentum, investors are asking which tokens could deliver the next breakout. While Cardano and Solana remain top-tier contenders with solid ecosystems, a surprising challenger has entered the race Remittix (RTX) . With over $14.3 million raised in presale and a practical solution for cross-border payments, analysts are now tipping Remittix as the dark horse with the highest upside. Could this underdog project outpace the giants and deliver 50x returns by August? Cardano Struggles Below Key Resistance as Bears Take Control Cardano has hit a technical snag, and top analysts are watching closely as the price shows signs of weakness. After a strong attempt to break above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average near $0.73, ADA was firmly rejected falling nearly 7% in just a week. That 200-day EMA aligns almost perfectly with a key resistance level around $0.74, making it a critical ceiling the bulls have failed to break. Cardano price briefly recovered towards $0.69 on Tuesday, but has fallen back below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement from the crypto’s August low of $0.27 to the December high of $1.32. Now trading at $0.67 , Cardano price risks an extended correction that could send it down to the February 28 low of $0.58, marking a further 13% drop from its current level. ADA’s near-term picture raises questions in a market where investors are eyeing high-upside plays. Can it be 50x by August? Unlikely, according to many analysts, who argue that Cardano’s upside is capped unless it breaks out of this technical slump and finds new momentum. Solana Holds Strong at $129 as Network Activity Climbs Solana is holding steady at around $128.7 after a modest 1.3% gain in the past 24 hours, but what’s happening under the surface may matter more than the price action. With on-chain activity growing and fresh technical proposals on the table, analysts are beginning to ask whether Solana could be gearing up for something bigger. A newly introduced proposal to increase the block limit to 60 million compute units (CUs) would significantly expand the network’s capacity boosting scalability without raising account-level constraints. For developers and users alike, this move signals that Solana isn’t just surviving, it’s upgrading for long-term dominance. Beyond the tech, stablecoin adoption on Solana continues to soar. Circle minted an additional $250 million in USDC this week alone, bringing the total minted in 2025 to a staggering $11.5 billion. That kind of growth across DeFi, payments and other financial primitives is a strong sign that Solana’s infrastructure is gaining real-world traction. Adding fuel to the momentum, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Solana just hit a new all-time high with 11.12 million unique addresses on the network, another signal of rising user engagement. Martinez also notes that if SOL pushes past $140 , it could trigger a short squeeze, with $69 million in short positions at risk of liquidation. That pressure could quickly flip into a sharp rally, especially if market sentiment turns more bullish. Analysts Tip Remittix to Outpace Cardano and Solana by August While major altcoins like Cardano and Solana continue to capture headlines, a growing number of analysts are betting on a lesser-known contender Remittix (RTX) as the one with the highest upside potential. With over 525 million tokens sold and $14.3 million raised in presale, Remittix is already rewarding early participants with returns above 1000%, despite broader market volatility. Priced at just $0.0734, RTX has emerged as the top pick for investors seeking real-world use cases and scalable impact. Remittix isn’t just another DeFi project chasing the next trend, it solves a multi-trillion-dollar problem with a focused approach. Its cross-border payment system converts over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies in minutes, cutting out days of wait time and excessive banking fees. In a remittance market worth over $190 trillion annually, this kind of efficiency isn’t just innovative, it’s game-changing. Remittix’s tech integrates directly into merchant platforms through its Pay API, allowing businesses to accept crypto and receive fiat instantly. Traders Eye Remittix as the Top 50x Candidate This Year While Cardano and Solana are respected for their tech foundations, much of their projected growth depends on developer activity and future network upgrades. Remittix , by contrast, is already delivering utility. Its public ledger infrastructure adds transparency and security to every transaction, offering practical value to crypto purists and newcomers alike. The timing could not be better. As altcoin price action grows choppier, investors are rotating into projects with a clearer route to adoption. Cardano’s future hinges on ecosystem upgrades. Solana’s depends on managing scalability and staying ahead of congestion. Remittix is already pushing live payments into the real world and analysts think that could lead to a 50x explosion by August if its momentum continues. In a market where speculation often trumps substance, Remittix is flipping the narrative. And that’s why many are starting to believe RTX won’t just compete with Cardano and Solana, it could surpass them altogether.

Global DDoS activity increased by 12.7% in the second half of 2024 compared to the first half, totaling almost 9 million attacks, according to the firm. A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal web traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. The largest increases have been in Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions, with around 30% and 20% increases from the first half, respectively. Netscout reported that there were a total of 7.9 million DDoS attacks in the first half of 2024, with a combined total of 16.8 million for the full year, up almost 30% from the 13 million attacks the firm recorded in 2023. Attackers have been using the internet disruption tool to “exploit moments of national vulnerability to amplify chaos and erode trust in institutions,” the researchers said. The report described DDoS attacks as “precision-guided digital weapons” capable of disrupting infrastructure at critical moments, highlighting how they have been deployed during sociopolitical conflicts, elections, protests and policy disputes. Weekly DDoS statistics, 2024. Source: Netscout AI is supercharging DDoS attacks DDoS-for-hire services, including booters and stressors, are “more powerful than ever,” they added, as cyber criminals leverage AI and automation to bypass CAPTCHA, with automation “advancing toward capabilities such as behavior mimicry and real-time attack adjustments.” The researchers concluded that DDoS attacks “are no longer just about raw bandwidth,” adding that they are “adaptive, persistent, and deeply embedded in modern cyber and geopolitical conflicts.” “The shift to high-powered enterprise infrastructure, turnkey reconnaissance, the rise of AI-enhanced automation and the expansion of DDoS-for-hire services mean that attackers are evolving faster than ever.” The role of DDoS attacks is evolving, Corero Network Security chief technology officer Ashley Stephenson told Forbes recently, adding, “By automating tasks that were once labor-intensive or required specialized skills, AI lowers the barrier to entry for attackers.” Related: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: Chainalysis A DDoS attack targeted Elon Musk’s social media platform X in August, aimed at disrupting his interview with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Miner volume share has spiked to 15% in 2023, highlighting a shift in Bitcoin adoption and a lack of on-chain usage. Despite Bitcoin's price correction, the global hash rate continues to rise, exacerbating the economic challenges for miners due to decreasing block subsidies. Even though WGMI is clearly allocating more toward miners that are prioritizing HPC/AI services, the largest holdings are still highly reliant on mining for top line revenue. When I last wrote about the CoinShares Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) for Seeking Alpha, the fund was trading near $22 per share. In a little over two months, WGMI shares have a negative total return approaching 40% and have drastically under-performed both the US equity market and the top digital asset by market cap: Data by YCharts In my late January article covering the fund, I highlighted the potential headwinds facing the mining-turned-HPC companies in the public markets. The takeaways from that piece were largely hypothetical. So in this update, we'll dig a little deeper into the raw data and highlight some very real headwinds these companies face through their primary revenue segment - mining Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Miner Volume Share Is Spiking In the chart below, I've taken out data for both 2009 and 2010 because they skew the chart due to how little adoption of Bitcoin there was at that time. The average miner share of volume was almost 95% in 2009 and 60% in 2010. By 2011, that average fell all the way to 19.3%. This metric should theoretically fall over time as users engage with the network to a larger degree. IntoTheBlock, Author's Chart During the 8 years between 2012 and 2019, miner share of volume averaged 13.2%. Miner volume share then dropped all the way to 3.6% in 2022. This was very much viewed as normal and beneficial to the broader network. Again, in an environment where Bitcoin adoption continues to grow on-chain, miner share of volume should go down. However, in the last three years, we've seen the opposite happen. The average for 2023 spiked up to 11.5%. Last year, the average hit 15% - the highest miner volume share reading since 2015. And through the first quarter of 2025 it doesn't look like all that much has changed. This is indicative of a larger problem that I have been pointing out through Seeking Alpha articles for at least the last year; namely, that off-chain 'adoption' of Bitcoin moves BTC-based activities largely off-chain. This squeezes the miners who have an economic incentive to secure the blockchain. Hashprice Keeps Falling CoinMetrics In spite of a Bitcoin price that has corrected from all-time highs, global mean hash rate continues to grind higher month after month. At the end of March the 30-Day Average mean hash rate was 817 EH/s. Dollar-denominated hash price ended the month at a little over $46 per PHS/Day. This is within sniffing distance of an all-time low, which would almost certainly be triggered by a deeper drop in the price of BTC: 5 Year BTC Hash Price (HashRateIndex) The fundamental problem is that the block subsidy from mining goes down over time. Thus, transaction fees must ultimately become a larger share of mining rewards than the block subsidy. IntoTheBlock, Author's Chart During Q1-25, daily revenue from transaction fees averaged 1.35% - this was the lowest level since Q3-2018. On April 1st, the median transaction fee on the Bitcoin network was 36 cents. It's perhaps easy to hand wave away the lack of fees paid by Bitcoin users as 'FUD,' but someone must pay to secure this network. If it isn't users paying directly, it's somebody else. And what we've seen over the last few years is the ability of public mining companies to raise capital through debt and dilution to fund rapid exahash growth while operating at steep losses. This squeezes out home miners and hobbyist miners and presents long term centralization risks. Most WGMI Stocks Still Primarily Mine BTC Ultimately, there probably has to be a balance between network usability and network profitability since such a large share of global exahash is operated by publicly listed mining companies. That figure generally falls somewhere between 20-25% of global exahash. While we certainly wouldn't want median fees to be so high that most on-chain holders would be priced out of using the network, we also need miners to have an incentive to hash. As I've laid out in a prior WGMI article , the fund's management seems keenly aware of the problematic economics of mining and has very much shifted toward a more HPC-based holding allocation than a pure-play mining allocation. Meaning, WGMI has a larger allocation to miners with large HPC/AI ambitions rather than those that have steadfastly remained focused on mining. We can see this even more clearly through the change in the top holdings in just the last two months: WGMI Top Ten Holdings (Seeking Alpha) For instance, CleanSpark ( CLSK ) - a company focused on mining - was a top 5 WGMI holding back in late-January and now it doesn't even crack the top 10 despite having the fifth largest mining market cap and second largest exahash capacity in the public markets. For a fund that claims to allocate to Bitcoin miners, this is quite telling. Furthermore NVIDIA ( NVDA ), a company that doesn't mine Bitcoin at all, is now a top 5 holding with a 5.3% allocation in a Bitcoin mining-themed ETF. Despite what I view as a clear pivot in strategy from mining to HPC services, WGMI's top holdings are still very much reliant on BTC mining for top line revenue: Year Ended December 2024 Self-Mining Revenue Total Revenue % From Self-Mining IREN Ltd ( IREN ) $113.5* $116.5* 97.4%* Core Scientific $408.7 $510.7 80.0% Riot Platforms $321.0 $376.7 85.2% Cipher Mining $151.30 $151.30 100.0% Source: Company Filings, revenue in millions. *3 months ended December 2024 I'm not including NVDA in this table for obvious reasons. But the table speaks for itself; despite plans to grow HPC/AI services, these companies still generated the overwhelming majority of their top line revenue from Bitcoin mining. Core Scientific generated just 6% of its total revenue from HPC hosting last year. Data by YCharts Those stocks in the chart above collectively account for 48.6% of WGMI AUM and yet none of them were able to produce a positive operating income in 2024. To be fair, the verdict is technically still out on IREN, but the sector trend is clear. Closing Takeaways WGMI a confusing fund. Bitcoin mining is in the name of the fund and most of the large holdings generate most of their top line revenue from Bitcoin mining - yet there is clearly allocation favor being given to the companies that want to get into HPC/AI or are already in those spaces to a small degree. The fact that most of these companies still derive their revenue from mining anyway should not be ignored due to the worsening fundamentals of that business. Hash rate keeps grinding higher, hash price grinds lower, and fees paid to miners through real usage keeps eroding. It's a fairly brutal setup and not one that I would say justifies a position in the fund.",BTC-USD|WGMI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-03 03:21:35

ETH is now trimming all gains and remains below the $1,880 resistance zone. Ethereum failed to stay above the $1,850 and $1,880 levels. The price is trading below $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,865 and $1,890 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Fails Again Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,800 support zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,920 resistance zone. However, the bears are active near the $1,950 zone. A high was formed at $1,955 and the price trimmed most gains. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $1,781 and the price is now consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,781 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,850 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,865 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,781 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,920 level. A clear move above the $1,920 resistance might send the price toward the $1,950 resistance. An upside break above the $1,950 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,865 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level. The first major support sits near the $1,780 zone. A clear move below the $1,780 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,680 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,620.

In an Apr. 3 update on the company’s blog, Binance stated it had reviewed First Digital USD’s ( FDUSD ) reserve data twice, once after the February attestation report was released and again recently to ensure accuracy. As of Mar. 1, FDUSD had $2.05 billion in reserves, according to the audit, which was carried out by Prescient Assurance. These reserves, which are kept in fixed deposits and U.S. Treasuries, are greater than the amount of stablecoin in circulation and guarantee a 1:1 redemption with USD. The update comes after Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun accused the stablecoin’s issuer, First Digital Trust, of being insolvent, causing FDUSD to momentarily lose its peg and drop by 5%. Sun called for regulatory action, criticized Hong Kong’s financial system, and advised investors to withdraw their funds.

Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) April 2, 2025 You might also like: Fidelity launches no-fee crypto IRA for US investors His claims caused panic selling, which led to FDUSD’s price dropping as low as $0.87 before recovering. In response, FDT refuted the claims, claiming that Sun’s remarks were deceptive and that FDUSD is fully backed. The company insisted the issue was unrelated to FDUSD and instead linked to a dispute involving TrueUSD ( TUSD ), another stablecoin it manages. FDT also accused Sun of launching a smear campaign against its business and has threatened to take legal action against him. Given that Binance owns roughly 94% of the supply of FDUSD, the situation has sparked worries about the exchange’s exposure. Some industry analysts have pointed out the risks of relying on a single stablecoin for key trading pairs. As of the time of press, FDUSD seems to have stabilized, trading at $0.99 despite market volatility. Binance intends to carry out another review after the next attestation report is published in two weeks and has reiterated its commitment to keeping an eye on the FDUSD’s stability.

Despite the initial surge in price, the cryptocurrency has faced a decline of 3.7% in the past week and nearly 10% in the past month, signaling a period of stagnation in its upward momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $84,263, raising questions about the future trajectory of the asset as investors await a clear direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reverses Losses—Analysts Say $100K Is On The Horizon The Dead Cross: A Signal for a Potential Price Drop? BilalHuseynov, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, has offered valuable insights into Bitcoin’s current market behavior. In his latest post, titled “Will Bitcoin Drop Anymore?”, he sheds light on key on-chain metrics that may help predict the next movement in Bitcoin’s price. His analysis revolves around the behavior of two important metrics: Realized Cap and Thermo Cap, particularly focusing on their recent crossover, which could have significant implications for Bitcoin’s price direction. Huseynov explains that the Realized Cap metric, which tracks Bitcoin’s total value based on its last movement price, gives a more accurate representation of the network’s economic value. On the other hand, Thermo Cap measures the total capital introduced into the BTC network through mining. When Thermo Cap crosses below Realized Cap — known as a “Dead Cross” — it signals that Bitcoin might be heading toward a price decline. Huseynov points out that this situation is unfolding and predicts that BTC’s price could drop to as low as $75,000 if the second Dead Cross materializes. Is The Bitcoin Market Condition Still Healthy? In addition to Huseynov analysis, another CryptoQuant’s analyst Banker has provided insight into the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, which tracks the movement of long-dormant BTC. Since March 2025, the CDD 60-day moving average has remained low, indicating that long-term holders are not selling their Bitcoin in large quantities. This behavior is often a sign of confidence among seasoned investors, suggesting that they believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Watch This Key Price The absence of major CDD spikes indicates that the market is not experiencing extreme price volatility, which could signal a period of consolidation or eventual upward momentum as selling pressure remains low.

Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing with anticipation— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves in its presale, Celestia is rolling out groundbreaking developments, and Terra Classic is stirring excitement among investors. As the market heats up, each of these projects is making significant strides, but one stands out for its unique presale model and explosive ROI potential. Celestia recently unveiled updates on modular blockchain scalability, while Terra Classic continues its revival efforts, drawing attention from seasoned investors.

With an entry price of just $0.000087 and an ROI potential of 9,084.48% at launch, investors are scrambling to secure their stake before the next price hike. This article will cover the latest developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic. Arctic Pablo Coin: Token Burns Driving Long-Term Value | Best Crypto To Invest One of the most powerful mechanisms behind Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model is its aggressive token burn strategy. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. Once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, ensuring a consistent reduction in supply and increasing scarcity over time. This burn process is fully recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency. With scarcity driving value, Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn model is strategically designed to enhance investor confidence and long-term price appreciation. The project’s structured approach aims to create a sustainable economic model, setting it apart as the Best Crypto To Invest in right now. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Glacial Glade Reached – Time Is Running Out | Best Crypto To Invest The presale journey of Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached its 17th phase, Glacial Glade, where APC is priced at just $0.000087. Investors who enter at this stage stand to gain an ROI of over 9,084.48% by the time the token lists at $0.008. Over $2 million has already been raised, proving strong investor confidence. Unlike traditional presales with rigid stages, Arctic Pablo Coin introduces a unique location-based presale model. As APC “travels” through different locations, the price steadily increases. This means that the current entry price won’t last long—once Glacial Glade concludes, the price will rise again. With the next phase imminent, hesitation could mean missing out on one of the most lucrative investment opportunities in 2025. Many investors are securing their positions now, ensuring they lock in the best possible price before the meme coin presale moves forward. Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the Best Crypto To Invest before it moves to the next phase. Celestia’s Game-Changing Modular Blockchain Expansion Celestia continues to redefine blockchain scalability with its modular approach. The latest update introduces enhanced data availability layers, making transactions faster and more efficient for developers building on the platform. With the growing adoption of modular blockchain solutions, Celestia is cementing itself as a leader in innovation. As more projects integrate Celestia’s technology, its impact on the broader crypto ecosystem is becoming increasingly evident. Terra Classic’s Community-Led Revival Gains Momentum Terra Classic has seen a renewed push from its community, focusing on network upgrades and a revitalized burn mechanism. The latest proposal aims to restore investor confidence by implementing governance changes that enhance network stability. With ongoing discussions on reducing token supply and attracting new developers, Terra Classic is proving that its revival is far from over. As more stakeholders rally behind the project, its resurgence could shape the future of decentralized finance. Final Words While Celestia’s advancements in modular blockchain and Terra Classic’s revival efforts make them noteworthy, Arctic Pablo Coin is dominating the conversation with its groundbreaking presale model. With Glacial Glade marking its 17th phase and a price of $0.000087, the window for early investors is closing fast.

In a series of tweets on X, the exec called “tarriffing Layer 2s” “one of the most toxic ideas” for the blockchain’s future. Ye Zhang Opposes L2 Fees Zhang argued that such a move would trade long-term scalability and ecosystem growth for short-term revenue, a strategy he believes is better suited to centralized corporations than to Ethereum’s decentralized model. He went on to highlight that Ethereum’s true strength lies not in extracting revenue through protocol fees but in its potential to serve as the central asset across a growing number of rollups. With Ethereum already a dominant force in ecosystems like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync, Zhang suggested that more rollups would lead to greater adoption of ETH, expanding its role as a store of value. He warned that imposing fees on Layer 2s could drive developers away and leave Ethereum with limited scalability and relevance in the long run. “Ethereum doesn’t need to extract – it needs to enable. Ship faster, scale blobs 1000x more, scale execution to some degree. Make Ethereum DA attractive, ideally provide more value beyond security (interoperability, other shared components, liquidity bridges). Empower more aligned players.” Value Leakage Concerns While Zhang contended that Ethereum should focus on enabling Layer 2 expansion over imposing fees, the broader economic picture presents a growing challenge. As execution moves off-chain, Ethereum’s core network has seen a sharp decline in fee revenue, which, in turn, has raised concerns about value leakage. As reported by CryptoPotato , Ethereum’s fee generation has plummeted from nearly $30 million in March 2024 to just $500,000 a year later, as Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base capture most of the economic benefits. The shift has also impacted ETH’s burn rate, which led to a rise in net issuance and an increase in inflation to 0.79%.

Bessent, speaking Wednesday to Bloomberg Television, said, “I wouldn’t try to retaliate. As long as you don’t retaliate this is the high end of the number.” His comments came shortly after Trump unveiled a minimum 10% tariff on all exporters to the United States, plus additional duties on about 60 nations with the biggest trade imbalances with the US. The 10% tariff would take effect at midnight Saturday, followed by the higher, customized duties by 12:01 a.m. on April 9. According to the administration’s plan, certain partners are now facing far steeper penalties. China was singled out for a tariff of at least 54% on many goods. The European Union, Vietnam, and other major exporters will also see rates above 10% when the policy goes into effect. Bessent suggested these levels might stay where they are if other governments avoid countermeasures: “This is the high end of the number barring retaliation,” he said. “As far as negotiations go—we’ll see.” Trump during the speech on “Liberation Day”. Source: Fox 5 Atlanta Those existing tariffs will remain. Neither country will be subject to the new tariff schedule as long as the current measures stay in force. Products covered by the USMCA agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term, will remain exempt. The president has long argued that tariffs can be used to restore American manufacturing strength and protect US businesses, even though many economists fear this approach could set off rounds of retaliation. After World War II, the US and allies worked for decades to reduce duties and encourage trade, viewing international commerce as a safeguard against future conflicts. Trump’s latest move goes in the other direction, raising the prospect of higher costs for importers and possible retaliation by foreign capitals. The stock market responded quickly to the announcements According to Bloomberg’s report , major stock benchmarks lost at least 2% in the hours after the announcement, as investors and traders had been hoping for a less severe plan. Automaker shares slid in after-hours trading in New York before recovering some ground, while crude oil prices in New York opened around 2% lower. Analysts pointed out that the US relies on oil imports from Europe for its East Coast refineries, though it also exports some crude to other countries. Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, expressed alarm at the scale of the administration’s move. She called the new tariffs “much worse than we feared” and warned of major consequences for how goods flow around the globe. Questions remain about how the new rates will actually be administered. China bears the heaviest burden, while Canada and Mexico are exempted from additional tariffs On top of the 34% levy tied to Trump’s “reciprocal” plan, China already faces a 20% tariff due to fentanyl trafficking, as well as separate duties on items such as solar panels. Combined, these surcharges mean many imports from China could exceed a 50% duty. Trump has claimed those numbers are still not fully “reciprocal,” though the administration has not explained in detail how it arrived at the 54% figure. Bloomberg Economics estimates suggest that a 54% rate could cut China’s exports to the US by up to 90% by 2030. The European Union, according to White House documents, will face a 20% tariff. and Vietnam’s figure is set at 46%. Other countries singled out for higher rates include Japan at 24%, South Korea at 25%, India at 26%, Cambodia at 49%, and Taiwan at 32%. BREAKING: U.S. REVEALS RECIPROCAL TARIFF RATES LIST pic.twitter.com/52bCf73wuU — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) April 2, 2025 Canada and Mexico, the two neighbors, appear safe from the latest list for now because of the already existing 25% tariffs. In the event those measures are ended, any items not covered by USMCA provisions would see a 12% tariff. The White House statement made it clear that USMCA-compliant goods would remain free of the new levies. Trump called these tariffs “kind reciprocal,” saying that many foreign markets are still far more closed to US exports than America is to their goods. He also hinted that the US may lower its new tariffs if other countries reduce their own import barriers and stop what he calls currency manipulation. Administration officials have insisted that the tariffs will bring factories back to the US and generate job opportunities. Critics counter that the higher import costs will be painful for consumers and businesses. The president’s team, for its part, has asked the public to be patient, saying the final gains will outweigh any short-term problems. “We’ll see where it goes from here,” Bessent said, suggesting that any next steps would be slow. Other nations have signaled they are open to trade discussions, but the administration wants to “let things settle for a while” before deciding on its next move. Trump didn’t spare his ‘friend’ Modi’s government from tariffs India also got slapped with high tariff rates despite being a major US trading partner. Trump mentioned that he has good personal ties with India’s Prime Minister, and his ties didn’t affect the tariff outcome for India. The country is now facing a 25% tariff on imports, higher than the EU, Japan, and South Korea. However, it is certainly less than China and Vietnam. Nevertheless, these tariffs for India are a setback for the Indian government, which tried to dodge the tariffs by offering sweeping concessions on issues aligning with Trump’s agenda. Trump said at the White House earlier today, “India, very, very tough. Very, very tough.” He added, “The prime minister just left, and he’s a great friend of mine. But I said, you’re a friend of mine, but you’re not treating us right. They charge us 52%.” According to one Indian government official, it’s just a “mixed bag” and not really a setback for the country. Ajay Sahi, the director general at the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, said, “Our competitors like Vietnam and Cambodia have been hit harder than us.” He added, “solace in the fact that we are already engaged with the US” on a trade agreement.

42832494,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145800,1743652828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary OpenAI Plan: Expert Group to Advise on Crucial Nonprofit Goals Amidst For-Profit Transition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-expert-group-nonprofit-goals/,"In a significant move that has the AI and cryptocurrency worlds buzzing, OpenAI, the powerhouse behind groundbreaking AI models, is taking a strategic step to solidify its philanthropic mission. As the company navigates a complex transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit structure, it’s seeking guidance to ensure its charitable arm remains impactful. This news highlights the increasing intersection of cutting-edge technology and social responsibility, a topic of keen interest to crypto enthusiasts who believe in leveraging innovation for a better future. Expert Group to Shape OpenAI Nonprofit Goals OpenAI is not just developing advanced AI; it’s also deeply considering its societal impact. The company has announced the formation of an expert group specifically tasked with advising its philanthropic endeavors. This initiative comes at a pivotal moment as OpenAI prepares to shift from its original nonprofit foundation to a for-profit model. This group of experts is designed to provide critical insights into the most pressing challenges faced by nonprofits today, ensuring that OpenAI’s philanthropy is both effective and relevant. Here’s what we know about this crucial development: Expert Consultation: OpenAI is convening a diverse group of experts from various sectors including health, science, education, and public services. Focus on Urgent Issues: The group’s primary goal is to identify and understand the most urgent and intractable problems that nonprofits are currently grappling with. California Focus: While global in scope, there will be a particular emphasis on incorporating feedback from leaders and communities within OpenAI’s home state of California. Timeline: The expert group will be announced in April and is expected to deliver its insights to OpenAI’s board of directors within 90 days. Board Consideration: The OpenAI board will then consider these insights as it works to evolve the OpenAI nonprofit, with a target completion date well before the end of 2025. Why is OpenAI Focusing on AI Philanthropy Now? The timing of this initiative is particularly noteworthy. OpenAI, initially founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, has seen its operational needs and ambitions grow exponentially. The development of sophisticated AI models requires significant capital, leading OpenAI to evolve its structure to attract external investment. This evolution included creating a unique for-profit arm controlled by the nonprofit, allowing for investments from venture capitalists and major players like Microsoft, while capping profits for investors and employees. However, the ultimate goal, as indicated in OpenAI’s recent blog post, is a full transition of its existing for-profit structure into a traditional corporation with ordinary shares. This transition would involve the nonprofit ceding control in exchange for billions of dollars – resources earmarked for, presumably, AI philanthropy. The establishment of this expert advisory group underscores OpenAI’s commitment to strategically deploying these resources for maximum societal benefit. It’s a clear signal that as OpenAI’s for-profit ventures grow, so too will its dedication to leveraging AI for good through its nonprofit arm. The Stakes in OpenAI Transition and the Future of OpenAI The urgency to complete this transition is not just about strategic growth; it’s also tied to financial obligations. OpenAI faces a critical deadline: if the for-profit conversion isn’t successful by the end of the year, at least one major backer, SoftBank, has the option to claw back billions of dollars in pledged capital. This financial pressure adds another layer of complexity to OpenAI’s strategic planning and highlights the high stakes involved in this organizational metamorphosis. Key Challenges and Considerations: Balancing Profit and Purpose: Successfully navigating the transition to a for-profit model while maintaining a strong commitment to nonprofit goals is a delicate balancing act. Effective Philanthropy: Ensuring that the billions channeled into the nonprofit arm are used effectively to address urgent global issues requires careful planning and expert guidance. Stakeholder Alignment: Aligning the interests of various stakeholders – from investors and employees in the for-profit entity to beneficiaries of the nonprofit initiatives – is crucial for long-term success. Regulatory and Public Scrutiny: As AI becomes increasingly powerful and pervasive, OpenAI’s actions will be under intense scrutiny from regulators and the public, especially concerning ethical considerations and societal impact. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the AI and Crypto Space? For those in the cryptocurrency and AI sectors, OpenAI’s move offers several key takeaways: Increased Focus on AI Ethics and Social Impact: OpenAI’s emphasis on expert-led philanthropy signals a broader trend towards integrating ethical considerations and social impact into AI development. This is a space where blockchain and crypto technologies, with their emphasis on decentralization and transparency, can play a significant role. Opportunities for Collaboration: The formation of an expert group opens doors for collaboration between AI researchers, nonprofit organizations, and potentially, blockchain-based philanthropic platforms. Investment in AI for Good: The potential influx of billions into AI philanthropy could spur innovation in using AI to address global challenges, creating new investment and development opportunities in the ‘AI for Good’ space. Model for Tech Companies: OpenAI’s approach could serve as a model for other tech companies looking to balance commercial success with social responsibility, particularly as AI becomes more integral to society. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap for OpenAI and AI Philanthropy OpenAI’s initiative to convene an expert group to advise on its nonprofit goals is a strategic and forward-thinking move. As the company embarks on a significant organizational transition, ensuring its philanthropic arm is robust and impactful is paramount. This development underscores the growing importance of aligning technological innovation with societal benefit, a principle that resonates deeply within the cryptocurrency community. The insights from this expert group will not only shape the future direction of OpenAI’s philanthropy but could also set a new benchmark for how AI companies engage with and contribute to the greater good. The future of OpenAI and AI philanthropy is poised for a revolutionary transformation, and the world will be watching closely.

Reports recently surfaced suggesting that the tech mogul was preparing to step down from his intriguing role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). But hold your horses, crypto enthusiasts! Musk himself has stepped into the digital arena to vehemently deny these claims, branding them as nothing more than ‘fake news’. Let’s dive into this unfolding story and dissect what it means for the crypto community and beyond. Elon Musk and DOGE: Unpacking the ‘Fake News’ Frenzy The initial reports, which spread like wildfire across crypto news platforms and social media, hinted at a supposed transition in leadership at D.O.G.E. Given Musk’s already packed schedule overseeing Tesla, SpaceX, and now X (formerly Twitter), the news, while surprising, wasn’t entirely out of the realm of possibility for some. However, Musk wasted no time in setting the record straight. In a characteristically concise and impactful post on X, he declared the reports as unequivocally ‘fake news’. This swift denial has sent ripples through the crypto world, leaving many to question the origin and intent behind the initial reports. Was it a misunderstanding, a deliberate attempt to stir controversy, or simply unfounded speculation? Whatever the case, Musk’s direct response underscores the power of social media in today’s fast-paced information age, particularly within the volatile and often rumor-driven crypto market. What is the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) Anyway? For those new to this narrative, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) might sound like a formal governmental body. However, it’s crucial to understand the context. D.O.G.E. is not a real government department. It’s more of a playful, albeit significant, title associated with Elon Musk’s involvement in, and perhaps influence on, certain governmental or regulatory discussions, particularly concerning technology and innovation. The acronym itself is a clear nod to Dogecoin (DOGE), the cryptocurrency that Musk has famously championed. This tongue-in-cheek naming highlights Musk’s unconventional approach and his ability to blend serious technological endeavors with internet culture and humor. It’s a strategy that resonates strongly with the crypto community, which often embraces memes and online trends. The Backstory: Musk, Trump, and D.O.G.E. – Real or Rhetorical? The narrative around Musk and D.O.G.E. gained traction following public statements from both Musk and former U.S. President Donald Trump. They jointly indicated that Musk would eventually step down from his ‘assignment’ once it was completed. This statement, while vague, fueled speculation about the nature of Musk’s role and the ‘department’ itself. Adding another layer to the story, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also posted on X, seemingly confirming Musk’s eventual departure. It was in response to Leavitt’s post that Musk directly replied, dismissing the stepping down reports as ‘fake news’. This interaction further complicates the narrative and raises questions about the intended message from the White House and the subsequent interpretation by various news outlets. Why Does This ‘Fake News’ Matter to the Crypto World? Elon Musk’s pronouncements carry significant weight in the crypto market. His tweets and statements have often triggered dramatic price movements in cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin. Therefore, any news related to Musk, especially concerning his involvement (or perceived involvement) in crypto-related initiatives or even jokingly named departments like D.O.G.E., is closely watched by investors and enthusiasts. Here’s why this ‘fake news’ incident is noteworthy for the crypto community: Market Volatility: Misinformation, especially concerning influential figures like Musk, can exacerbate the already volatile nature of the crypto market. False reports can lead to panic selling or irrational buying, causing price swings. Investor Sentiment: Musk’s endorsements and actions often shape investor sentiment towards specific cryptocurrencies. ‘Fake news’ can cloud this sentiment, making it harder for investors to make informed decisions. DOGE’s Price Action: Dogecoin, being directly referenced in the D.O.G.E. acronym, is particularly sensitive to news related to Musk and this ‘department’. Any perceived shift in Musk’s involvement could impact DOGE’s price and market dynamics. Credibility of Crypto News: Incidents like these highlight the importance of verifying crypto news sources. In a space rife with rumors and speculation, discerning credible information from ‘fake news’ is crucial. Navigating Crypto News: How to Spot Real from Fake In the fast-paced and often sensational world of crypto news, it’s vital to develop a discerning eye. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the information landscape and identify credible crypto news from ‘fake news’: Tip Description Verify the Source Check the reputation of the news outlet. Are they known for reliable reporting? Cross-reference information with multiple reputable sources. Look for Official Statements Whenever possible, seek official statements from the individuals or organizations involved. In this case, Musk’s X post is a direct official denial. Be Wary of Sensational Headlines ‘Fake news’ often uses sensational or clickbait headlines to attract attention. Be critical of overly dramatic or unbelievable claims. Check for Evidence Reliable news reports are based on evidence and factual reporting. Be skeptical of articles that lack sources or rely on anonymous claims. Community Scrutiny The crypto community is often quick to debunk ‘fake news’. Check crypto forums and social media for community discussions and fact-checking efforts. The Future of DOGE and Musk’s Crypto Influence While the immediate ‘fake news’ claims have been addressed by Musk, the broader questions about his role and influence in the crypto space remain. His continued engagement with Dogecoin, his commentary on other cryptocurrencies, and his interactions with governmental figures all contribute to his significant impact on the market. Whether D.O.G.E. remains a playful moniker or evolves into something more tangible in the realm of crypto policy or technology, one thing is clear: Elon Musk’s pronouncements will continue to be a major factor in the crypto narrative. For investors and enthusiasts, staying informed, verifying information, and understanding the nuances of Musk’s statements are crucial for navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion: The Unfolding Drama of Crypto and ‘Fake News’ The saga of Elon Musk and the ‘fake news’ surrounding his supposed departure from D.O.G.E. serves as a potent reminder of the information dynamics within the crypto world. In an era where news travels at lightning speed and misinformation can spread rapidly, critical thinking and diligent verification are your best tools. As the crypto market continues to mature and attract wider attention, expect more twists, turns, and yes, even ‘fake news’. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always question the narrative. The world of crypto is anything but boring, and the Elon Musk D.O.G.E. episode is just another chapter in its fascinating, ongoing story.

The regulatory body decided to drop its appeal, marking the end of over four years of legal disputes. This decision means Ripple no longer faces SEC challenges, giving the company and its supporters a sense of relief. The appeal had been filed in January, following a series of cases where judges ruled in Ripple’s favor. Despite Former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation in January , the agency continued with the appeal, which frustrated Ripple and the broader crypto community. The SEC had claimed Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted securities violations , but the judge ruled otherwise, stating XRP is not a security. However, the entire community is now eagerly awaiting confirmation from the SEC. While the SEC has recently confirmed that it has dropped cases against Kraken and Cumberland, Ripple’s case has not yet been officially confirmed. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price To Revisit $2 Before ‘Final Blastoff’ , Why is April 3 Important?

Then, on April 9th, a US House crypto hearing is likely to help clarify regulations for digital assets. Recently, the SEC and Gemini requested a 60-day pause in their lawsuit to explore a potential resolution. The SEC had sued Gemini in January 2023, alleging that the company offered unregistered securities through its Earn product. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42833965,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145825,1743655251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Tariff Attack: Trump Accuses Korea of Trade Injustice,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-korea-tariff-attack/,"In a stunning move that has sent ripples through international trade circles, former President Donald Trump has reignited the tariff debate, this time setting his sights on South Korea. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Trump didn’t mince words, accusing Korea of imposing unfair tariffs on American goods and highlighting what he perceives as imbalanced trade practices. For those keeping a close eye on global economics and its potential spillover into the volatile cryptocurrency market, Trump’s statements are a stark reminder of how geopolitical tensions can quickly escalate and impact market sentiment. Let’s delve into the specifics of Trump’s accusations and what they could mean for global trade and beyond. Trump’s Tariff Tirade: Decoding the Accusations During his address, Trump focused heavily on the automotive industry and agricultural imports , specifically rice. He asserted that a staggering 81% of Korean cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured in Korea itself, implying a lack of reciprocity. Furthermore, he claimed that Korea effectively slaps a 50% tariff on American rice, making it incredibly difficult for U.S. farmers to compete in the Korean market. Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s key accusations: Korean Auto Imports: Trump highlighted the high percentage of Korean-made cars imported into the U.S., suggesting an imbalance in the automotive trade relationship. Rice Tariffs: He specifically called out the alleged 50% tariff on U.S. rice entering Korea, portraying it as a significant barrier to American agricultural exports. Broader Criticism: Trump broadened his critique to include Thailand, Vietnam, and India, accusing them of also maintaining high tariffs on U.S. products, signaling a wider dissatisfaction with global trade practices. To put these claims into perspective, it’s important to understand the existing trade framework between the U.S. and South Korea. The two nations have a significant Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) in place, designed to reduce tariffs and facilitate smoother trade . Trump, however, has consistently expressed skepticism about the benefits of such agreements, often advocating for what he terms ‘reciprocal tariffs ‘. What Exactly Are Tariffs and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the world of international economics, let’s quickly define tariffs . Simply put, a tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imported goods and services. Governments use tariffs for various reasons, including: Protecting Domestic Industries: By making imported goods more expensive, tariffs can make domestically produced goods more competitive, theoretically safeguarding local jobs and industries. Generating Revenue: tariffs can be a source of revenue for the government, although this is often a secondary goal compared to protectionism. Retaliation: tariffs can be used as a tool to retaliate against another country’s trade practices that are deemed unfair or harmful. This is often seen in trade disputes. National Security: In certain strategic sectors, tariffs might be imposed to reduce reliance on foreign imports for national security reasons. However, tariffs are not without their downsides. They can lead to: Increased Consumer Prices: When tariffs are imposed, the cost of imported goods often increases, which can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Reduced Consumer Choice: Higher prices on imported goods can also reduce consumer choice, as people may be less willing or able to purchase them. Retaliatory Tariffs: Imposing tariffs can provoke retaliatory tariffs from other countries, leading to trade wars where multiple countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods, harming global trade and economic growth. Supply Chain Disruptions: tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, making it more difficult and expensive for businesses to source components and materials. Korea’s Perspective and the Reality of Trade It’s crucial to consider that trade relationships are complex and multi-faceted. While Trump paints a picture of unfair tariffs imposed by Korea, the reality might be more nuanced. Korea, like any nation, has its own trade policies designed to protect its domestic industries and promote economic growth. For example, regarding automotive imports , while a significant portion of Korean cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured in Korea, many American car brands also have a strong presence in the Korean market. Furthermore, the KORUS FTA has aimed to reduce tariffs on automobiles and other goods, promoting bilateral trade . Regarding rice, agricultural tariffs are a sensitive issue globally. Many countries, including the U.S. to some extent, protect their agricultural sectors through various measures. Korea, with its emphasis on food security and a significant agricultural population, likely has its own reasons for maintaining tariffs on rice imports . The exact figure of a 50% tariff on U.S. rice, as claimed by Trump, would need further verification and contextual understanding of Korea’s agricultural trade policy. The Ripple Effect: How Trade Disputes Impact Global Markets and Crypto Why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts care about trade disputes and tariffs ? The answer lies in the interconnectedness of global markets. International trade is a major driver of economic growth, and disruptions to trade flows can create economic uncertainty. This uncertainty often translates into market volatility, which can significantly impact all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s how trade tensions can affect the crypto market: Economic Uncertainty: trade disputes and the potential for trade wars create economic uncertainty. Investors tend to become risk-averse during uncertain times, which can lead to sell-offs in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Currency Fluctuations: tariffs and trade tensions can lead to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations can impact the value of cryptocurrencies, particularly when paired against fiat currencies. Inflationary Pressures: tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing the cost of imported goods. Inflation can, in turn, influence central bank policies and investor sentiment, indirectly affecting the crypto market. Safe Haven Assets: In times of economic turmoil, some investors may seek refuge in assets perceived as safe havens. While Bitcoin is sometimes touted as a digital gold or safe haven, its behavior during periods of trade -related uncertainty has been mixed. Navigating the Trade Winds: What Can We Learn? Trump’s recent remarks on tariffs serve as a potent reminder that trade policy remains a dynamic and potentially volatile area. For anyone involved in global markets, including the cryptocurrency space, staying informed about trade developments is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of trade policy news and announcements from major economies. Follow reputable news sources and economic analysis to understand the potential impact of trade disputes. Diversify Investments: Diversification is key in any investment strategy, but it’s particularly important when facing economic uncertainty. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto or traditional assets. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment and investor reactions to trade news. Market sentiment can often be a leading indicator of short-term price movements. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that trade disputes are often cyclical. While they can create short-term volatility, the global economy and trade relationships are constantly evolving. Maintain a long-term perspective when making investment decisions. Conclusion: Trade Tensions and the Ever-Evolving Global Landscape President Trump’s criticism of tariffs on U.S. goods and Korean auto imports highlights the ongoing complexities and sensitivities surrounding international trade . While the immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market may be indirect, the broader economic uncertainty generated by trade disputes can certainly influence market sentiment and investor behavior. As the global trade landscape continues to evolve, staying informed, adaptable, and maintaining a balanced perspective will be essential for navigating the choppy waters of international economics and the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

On Wednesday, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on imports from 180 nations , including higher taxes on trading partners identified as worst offenders, such as China and the European Union. Trump imposed a new 34% tariff on goods from China in addition to the existing 20% tax, bringing the total levy to 54%, the highest for any nation. Meanwhile, the latest action did not affect Canada and Mexico. Observers say the ball is now in China's court, and the nature of its retaliation could determine the market reaction. ""Everything now depends on China. If China devalues the Yuan in response to today's large, additional US tariffs, that sets off a global risk-off that hits EMs first and then - if it persists - spills back to the US. China has so far kept a very low profile. That may now end,"" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance, said on X . Early Thursday, Beijing urged the U.S. to lift tariffs while vowing retaliation immediately. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan dropped to a seven-week low of 7 RMB/USD alongside losses in the Asian equities and an impending death cross on bitcoin (BTC). Letting the yuan depreciate, which makes Chinese goods more attractive in international markets, is one way to counter Trump's tariffs. That said, it could spell trouble for carry (currency) trades and scare financial markets, as observed in 2015 and 2018. Besides, potential intervention by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to stall a rapid yuan decline can boost the dollar index, inadvertently weighing over risk assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. It's no coincidence that Asian equities traded in the red at press time, with Japan's Nikkei hitting an eight-month low. The U.S. stock futures fell over 2%, pointing to risk-off mode. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $83,300, having dropped from $88,000 to $82,500 following Trump's tariffs announcement, according to CoinDesk market data. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the cryptocurrency's spot price appears on track to cross below its 200-day SMA, confirming what is known as the ""death cross"" bearish technical pattern. Though it has a mixed record of predicting price trends, the latest cross happening against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions warrants attention – more so, as options pricing now shows bias for puts or downside protection out to the June end expiry, according to Deribit and Amberdata.",Markets|Bitcoin|Yuan|Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 04:46:44

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few low-cap DeFi tokens offering just that — real-world function, visible progress, and an entry point that suggests strong upside potential in 2025. At $0.025, MUTM stands out not because of hype — but because of what’s happening under the hood. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently deep into its presale phase, and interest has been building fast. Over $6 million has already been raised, and the project now boasts a base of more than 7,700 early holders. That’s not just momentum — it’s a sign of growing trust in the long-term direction of the platform. What makes this especially noteworthy is the quality of the participants. Many of those getting in early are experienced crypto investors — people who’ve previously backed large-scale projects like Solana and Cardano during their early stages. The fact that they’re now looking to Mutuum shows that it’s more than just another speculative token. It’s being recognized for its long-term potential and structural design. Mutuum Finance is not a meme or hype-driven project. It’s being built as a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing crypto assets, with systems that allow both passive earning and flexible borrowing. Users who supply assets to the protocol receive tokenized representations of their deposits, known as mtTokens. These aren’t just placeholders — they accumulate value over time as interest builds, making them ideal for those looking to put their crypto to work instead of letting it sit idle. Borrowers, on the other hand, can unlock liquidity by providing more collateral than they borrow — a common structure that protects the system while giving users fast access to capital without having to sell their holdings. What truly sets Mutuum apart is how utility and ecosystem health are baked into the protocol’s model. The platform is integrating a buy-and-distribute mechanism that takes a portion of revenue generated by protocol activity and uses it to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. Those tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, ensuring that users who contribute to the protocol are rewarded directly and consistently. This approach encourages long-term participation while aligning incentives with platform growth. It’s not just a reward system — it’s a cycle that supports the token’s value as adoption increases. Another reason investors are moving quickly: this isn’t a “build later” kind of project. The team behind Mutuum is planning to launch a beta version of the platform around the token’s public release. That means early holders will be stepping into a live product environment — not waiting months or years for development to catch up. This kind of early access to functionality gives the token real purpose from day one and positions it to start capturing value right out of the gate. Mutuum Finance is currently priced at $0.025, but everything about its structure, steady progress, and expanding community signals that this entry point may not last much longer. With key features set to roll out soon, strong momentum in the presale, and growing interest from seasoned investors, MUTM is positioning itself as more than just another DeFi token — it’s shaping up to be one of the most strategic opportunities in the market right now.

While emphasizing that current market sentiment remains in what he calls a “boredom phase,” Egrag’s technical breakdown highlights several critical levels that may define the token’s trajectory this month. XRP Price Prediction For April Egrag’s chart, constructed on a monthly time frame (XRP/USDT), underscores an anticipated April candle that could see a substantial price swing. The visual forecast places XRP in a position where both upper and lower bounds may be “wick-tested” before the month concludes. According to the analyst, a potential downside wick may pull the price back into the $1.90–$1.79 region. Egrag describes this process as a short-lived “wick,” indicating that if XRP tests these lows, it may not spend significant time there. Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst On the other end of the spectrum, the chart suggests that a spike toward $2.80–$3.00 is also possible during April. Similar to the low-range testing, any move within this zone would likely form a wick, marking a brief probe of higher price territory. “We will also test the upper range at $2.80-$3.00, which will also be a wicking process,” the analyst states. One of the most striking points on the chart is a potential 62–70% rally measured from the lowest point of the downside wick (around the $1.79–$1.90 area). The analyst highlights that this upside, if materialized, could be swift once certain technical thresholds are broken. “We could see an upside of 62-70% from the lowest point of the downside wick,” Egrag writes. Several price notations on the chart (such as $2.00, $2.05, $2.17, and $2.44) hint that XRP may oscillate around the $2 handle. Egrag’s mentions the possibility of a final stop near $2 before a more explosive move: “After revisiting the $2 region one last time, we could see a significant blastoff in this cycle!” Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Dips Below The 200-Day MA – Trend Shift Underway? Egrag also reiterates a theme he has mentioned in previous analyses: many market participants grew frustrated after the post-SEC-case price action failed to meet their expectations of an instant surge. The analyst attributes the current range-bound conditions to a “boredom phase” driven by waning interest and mental fatigue among traders. He warns that only “the mentally strong” will endure this period of minimal excitement and sideways trading. For those who remain confident in the broader utility of XRP, Egrag suggests that accumulating during these doldrums might be more beneficial than attempting to time every short-term fluctuation. “Do nothing except buy if you can, and sit on your ass. Do you really think XRP will change the world and they will give it to you on a golden plate? We are now in a phase where only the mentally strong will survive,” the analyst concludes. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1465.

After the announcement, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana dropped by 4%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, pushing the total crypto market capitalization down by nearly 5%. The coins have seen some recovery after hitting these lows. However, one project continued to show resilience. Bitcoin Pepe ‘s presale has seen continued momentum over the past weeks. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs President Donald Trump confirmed sweeping reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners, marking a major escalation in his trade policy. The new levies aim to match the trade barriers faced by American exporters, with tariffs reaching as high as 54% on Chinese imports, 20% on the European Union, 26% on India, and 24% on Japan. Markets reacted sharply, with US stocks reversing earlier gains. Dow futures plunged 1,007 points, or 2.3%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 3.4% and 4.2%, respectively, reflecting investor concerns over economic fallout and potential retaliation from affected nations. Multinational stocks tumbled after hours, with Nike and Apple each down 7%. Retailers reliant on imports were hit hardest—Five Below fell 15%, Dollar Tree lost 11%, and Gap slid 8.5%. Tech stocks also saw sharp declines, with Nvidia dropping 4.5% and Tesla down 6%. Bitcoin Pepe’s sustained momentum Bitcoin Pepe has defied the downturn in the broader crypto market, maintaining strong momentum since its presale launch in mid-February. Bitcoin Pepe is drawing attention with an explosive presale, raising over $5.9 million in just weeks. Early investors have seen steady gains, with projections suggesting cumulative returns could surpass 300% by the end of its 30-stage presale. The Bitcoin Pepe presale has rapidly gained traction, progressing through its first seven stages with strong investor interest. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe blends Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability. An anticipated exchange listing in the second quarter of 2025 could further drive its price, reinforcing its position as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale details Bitcoin Pepe is bringing the viral meme culture to the most trusted crypto platform. It is introducing the PEP-20 token standard, allowing investors to launch meme coins directly on the Bitcoin network. This unique infrastructure has attracted strong interest from investors looking to accumulate BPEP tokens ahead of its public debut. Bitcoin Pepe follows a 30-stage presale model, with prices rising approximately 5% at each phase. Launched at $0.021, it has climbed to $0.0295 in stage 8, set to increase to $0.031 in the next phase. By the presale’s conclusion, BPEP could reach $0.0864, offering early investors potential gains exceeding 300%. With strong fundamentals, increasing traction, and favourable market conditions, Bitcoin Pepe is well-positioned to benefit from the next crypto rally.

This marks the second time the world’s largest exchange has ignored Pi, shutting down hopes of an imminent listing. Meanwhile, Pi Network’s price is taking a beating, dropping to its lowest level in over a month. Pi Network Price Crashes Hard With Binance leaving Pi out of its listing program, the token has tumbled to $0.7012, marking a fresh low since February 25. Pi Network is now down a staggering 76% from its all-time high, wiping out around $14 billion in market value. Once valued at nearly $20 billion, Pi’s market cap has now shrunk to just $4.76 billion, raising concerns among investors. Why Binance Keeps Saying No to Pi Binance recently launched the second phase of its Vote to List initiative, where users vote for which tokens they want listed on the exchange. This time around, 12 tokens made the cut, including VIRTUAL, BIGTIME, ONDO, and UXLINK, with Binance set to pick winners based on vote count, trading demand, risk assessment, and compliance checks. But the Pi Network is nowhere in sight, and there’s a big reason behind it. Binance has made it clear that only BNB-based projects qualify for this program, automatically disqualifying Pi. Moreover, the PiCoreTeam (PCT) has been criticized for lacking transparency, especially regarding how Pi tokens are locked and burned. Binance wants clear disclosures before listing Pi, but so far, the PCT has not provided enough details. Is There Still Hope for a Binance Listing? Despite missing out on Binance’s Vote to List, Pi Network still has a chance to land on the exchange through a direct listing in the future. However, Binance has given no timeline , leaving Pi enthusiasts guessing. In the meantime, Pi Network did secure a listing on BTCC Exchange , bringing it a step closer to wider adoption. Additionally, Pi’s domain auction is seeing a lot of action, with over 200,000 bids, proving that the community is still engaged. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: 125K Sellers at PiFest, Yet Pi Coin Nears All-Time Lows After 60% Drop , Community Questions Binance’s Priorities Selçuk TOPAL, Ph.D., criticized Binance for ignoring Pi Network while supporting meme coins with liquidity incentives. He argued that if Binance valued real innovation, it would back research-driven projects instead of hype-based tokens. He also questioned why Binance’s investor protection fund (SAFU) isn’t consistently applied. Further, he raised concerns about Binance’s leadership, suggesting its vision might be more about PR than real progress. What’s Next for Pi Network? Pi’s price has dropped 5% in the past 24 hours, now struggling to stay above $0.6646. With Binance still hesitant and Pi’s value slipping, all eyes are on the PiCoreTeam to improve transparency and push for mainstream exchange listings. Until then, Pi holders will have to wait and see if Binance finally gives the green light. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ADA is consolidating near $0.650 and remains at risk of more losses. ADA price failed to recover above the $0.70 resistance zone. The price is trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.6720 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.70 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Again In the past few days, Cardano saw a recovery wave from the $0.6350 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to climb above the $0.680 and $0.6880 resistance levels. However, the bears were active above the $0.70 zone. A high was formed at $0.7090 and the price corrected most gains. There was a move below the $0.650 level. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.6720 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. A low was formed at $0.6356 and the price is now consolidating losses near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7090 swing high to the $0.6356 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.6720 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7090 swing high to the $0.6356 low. The first resistance is near $0.6950. The next key resistance might be $0.700. If there is a close above the $0.70 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.7420 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.7650 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6720 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.6420 level. The next major support is near the $0.6350 level. A downside break below the $0.6350 level could open the doors for a test of $0.620.

As ADA struggles to maintain momentum, a new contender is rising fast: Remittix (RTX) . This practical crypto-to-fiat payment solution has already raised over $14.3 million in presale and is gaining strong investor backing. With exchange listings expected soon, experts believe Remittix could surge 50x by July, making it a compelling alternative for ADA holders. Cardano faces heavy pressure as analysts predict drop below $0.30 Cardano news today shows that ADA has slipped by 12% over the past week, retreating from $0.7707 to $0.6768 , and the pressure isn’t easing. Despite moments of optimism, some analysts are now forecasting a deeper correction ahead. One leading expert has issued a stark warning that ADA could plunge below $0.30 by June if market conditions continue to deteriorate. While bullish sentiment once hinged on Cardano’s potential partnerships and ecosystem growth, short-term reality paints a different picture. Even news of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, exploring a partnership with Ripple to onboard the $RLUSD stablecoin hasn’t reversed the declining trend. Although the collaboration could eventually inject liquidity into the ecosystem, it may come too late to stop ADA’s near-term slide. Resistance at $0.72 remains firm and without significant volume or broader market strength; ADA could face a steep drop. With uncertainty looming over ADA’s next move, many early Cardano investors are reallocating funds toward more promising plays like Remittix (RTX). The up-and-coming PayFi project is gaining traction for its real-world utility, and Cardano news today suggests Remittix could 50x by July, making it a compelling hedge for those bracing for continued downside in ADA. As Cardano teeters near crucial support levels, eyes are shifting toward newer, utility-focused tokens with explosive growth potential. Experts predict Remittix could 50x by July with listings ahead While Cardano battles bearish momentum and experts warn of a potential slide below $0.30 by June, a growing number of crypto investors are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) , a project showing none of ADA’s current weakness. Remittix isn’t built on speculation or hype; it’s gaining traction because it solves an actual global problem. With international money transfers still plagued by high fees, slow processing, and outdated infrastructure, Remittix offers a modern fix. It allows users to convert crypto into fiat and send it directly to bank accounts in over 30 currencies without relying on legacy systems like SWIFT or Western Union. What makes Remittix especially appealing right now is its timing. The token remains in presale at $0.0734, but it has already attracted over $14.3 million in investment and distributed 525 million tokens to early adopters. Unlike many flashy coins that disappear as quickly as they rise, Remittix was built with long-term impact in mind. It integrates fiat on-ramps and KYC compliance from day one, aligning itself with global financial regulations and preparing for large-scale partnerships in traditional finance. Analysts believe this strong foundation is exactly why Remittix could surge 50x by July, particularly as Q2 exchange listings draw closer. With tokenomics designed to reward early holders and a product tailored for real-world utility, RTX continues to separate itself from the flood of gimmick-driven altcoins that fade in bear cycles. Cardano declines as Remittix emerges as a practical market leader While ADA’s short-term outlook grows shakier facing technical resistance and macroeconomic pressure, Remittix is showing the qualities that veteran investors seek: momentum, practicality, and scalability. Institutional interest has already begun to flow in, with fintech veterans and crypto insiders quietly backing the project during its early funding rounds. Their confidence points to one thing: Remittix isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a payment solution designed to work now and thrive later. As ADA holders contemplate their next move, Remittix is shaping up to be the better bet for 2025 and beyond.

While Stellar and Hedera once dominated the headlines, a plethora of investors are now rushing to Remittix’s innovative solution to cross-border payments. The new thinking signals a shift in dynamic in an industry that tends to prefer established names. Here, we explain why Remittix could surpass legacy networks in utility, growth potential and risk-adjusted returns and what this means for Stellar and Hedera going forward. Remittix’s Edge Over Stellar Remittix is special in the sense that it focuses on real-world tangible solutions. While Stellar , trading at $0.2677 (down 1.76%) with a market cap of $8.24 billion, once enabled instant transfers but may no longer be as promising, Remittix addresses a $190 trillion remittance market by making speed and low cost its number one priority, logging each transfer on a public ledger for greater transparency far beyond what traditional wire services provide. Source: Tradingview Local banking rails shorten multi-day wait times to hours, outdoing what Stellar is capable of with risky corporate partnerships or layer-2 scaling. Remittix’s auditing, liquidity locks and renounced contract also enhance security, reassuring investors who prefer less complicated, consumer-focused tech. Remittix’s Advantage Over Hedera Likewise, Hedera is around $0.1671 (0.76% lower) with a market capitalization of $7.05 billion and based on hype about the past but unable to retain a strong grasp. Remittix, though, addresses cross-border payments head-on in a way that satisfies merchants, freelancers and families sending funds abroad. Source: Tradingview Removing typical multi-day wires, Remittix turns transactions into as fast as near-instant exchanges. Its public ledger also promotes transparency, trumping private transactions or business pilots traditionally linked with Hedera. Security remains paramount: auditing, liquidity locks and renounced contracts minimize the potential for fraud. For most, Remittix’s consumer model trump’s Hedera’s more gradual path to adoption. Why Investors Skeptical of Stellar and Hedera’s Future While both Hedera and Stellar have solid consensus mechanisms, recent statistics present mixed trends. Stellar’s 15.74% increase in daily volume to $174.58 million may reflect renewed interest or temporary speculation. Hedera’s 9.67% volume increase to $204.28 million likewise indicates some action but not necessarily long-term trend upward. Critics point to limited user-facing dApps on such chains, questioning their potential for exponential adoption. For Stellar, the challenge is one of differentiating from newer competitors. Hedera, with its award-winning hashgraph architecture, has yet to take advantage of enterprise partnerships with tangible market surges. Enthusiastic holders remain, but market appetite for rapid returns has overshadowed steady, incremental growth. While neither platform appears to be a goner, the genesis of altcoins with fresher tales or more contemporary solutions is hogging the spotlight. The majority of those who once championed older blockchains are having second thoughts, in light of the evolving nature of crypto tech. If Remittix can keep breaking barriers, Stellar and Hedera might have a more difficult climb to remain in contention. Remittix: A $14.3m+ Presale with Real Possibilities Firing up the hype, Remittix brought in more than $14.3 million in presale, selling more than 525 million tokens for $0.0734. Compared to hype-only tokens, it satisfies a gargantuan cross-border market plagued by days-long wires and hidden fees. Through its connection of crypto and fiat rails, Remittix decreases settlement time to hours from days, which is why it is attractive to freelancers, migrant workers, and e-commerce operators, among others. Picture a Mexican freelance graphic designer billing a client in Singapore. Instead of struggling with exchange rates and days-long delays, they receive payment in stablecoins that are swapped into pesos almost in real-time by Remittix’s system. That seamless experience trumps old wire paths, bringing the project an extra measure of credibility beyond marketing hyperbole. It’s a theme that sounds good to fidgety individuals eager for real crypto utility. Small business adoption adds another layer. Remittix’s pay API offers merchants the option of accepting cryptocurrencies while paying out in fiat. This solution circumvents volatility problems, a barrier that previously dissuaded mainstream businesses from getting their hands on crypto. Most see Remittix as bridging the gap between everyday commerce and blockchain speed, thereby sidestepping the more theoretical tales of older chains like Stellar and Hedera. Balancing Legacy vs. Innovation The contrast with behemoths like Stellar or Hedera points to a broader shift in crypto. While previous networks set the groundwork for fast transfers and business partnerships, they haven’t always sealed the deal in mass user adoption. Remittix has an easy, consumer-friendly mission that resonates immediately particularly in a world that’s hungry for streamlined payments. Stellar, which was once celebrated for connecting bankless communities to digital finance, now finds itself competing with a wave of solutions that improve or outdo its model. Hedera, with corporate sponsorship, is questioned as to whether token value can be driven by large-scale institutional transactions alone. Wish to become a part of Remittix’s presale wave?

For several hours across April 2 and 3, Bitcoin core developers and researchers were unable to interact on Google Groups after Google banned the group for spam. “Bitcoin Development Mailing List has been identified as containing spam, malware, or other malicious content,” Google’s warning stated at the time. The Bitcoin Development Mailing List’s warning before the ban was lifted. Source: Google Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop told Cointelegraph that the ban may have been triggered by individuals or bots mass-reporting the Bitcoin mailing list from multiple accounts. It’s a common tactic by attackers looking to ban or censor a community, Bishop said, noting that similar incidents occur on YouTube, X and TikTok fairly often. “So it’s possible that this whole thing might have been triggered through something like that. It might have just been someone clicking those links on a massive scale to report it.” Google Workspace Support’s X account confirmed that the issue had been resolved on April 3 at 2:23 am UTC in response to one of the Bitcoin mailing list’s other moderators, Ruben Somsen. Bitcoin advocate and head of Block Inc, Jack Dorsey, also called attention to the ban, urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to investigate the issue. Related: Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto may be wealthier than Bill Gates Mailing lists typically involve one moderator email sending information to subscribers in a group to discuss and collaborate on a topic or shared interest. The Bitcoin mailing list is used by Bitcoin core developers and researchers to discuss potential protocol changes to Bitcoin, which secures more than $1.6 trillion worth of value for network users around the world. It has become one of the main Bitcoin mailing lists since the network’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, shared Bitcoin’s white paper on the Cryptography Mailing List on Oct. 31, 2008. Bitcoin mailing list moderators plan to stay on Google Groups Despite the incident, Bishop said the Bitcoin mailing list moderators have no intention of moving away from communicating via email: “The reality of the situation is that this particular mailing list has always been email, and so the contributors that discuss Bitcoin protocol development through email, in order to provide continuity of service, you have to replace it with email.” The Bitcoin mailing list officially migrated to Google Groups in February 2024. Source: Bryan Bishop Before that, the mailing list was hosted on the Linux Foundation, Oregon State University Open Source Lab’s infrastructure and SourceForge.net.

However, Bitcoin price managed to hold $82K despite the US event-driven sell-off. With this strength from BTC, here are two macroeconomic events to watch out for this week that could further impact BTC price. Trump’s Liberation Day and Reciprocal Tariffs End, Bitcoin Price Holds $82K On April 2, President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on more than 100 trading partners like China, India, European Union and so on. This move has rattled the US & Crypto markets alike. While the US stock market saw $1.3 trillion in liquidations, cryptocurrencies saw more than $500 million in liquidations with Bitcoin price crashing 7.21% from $88.5K to $82.1. Trump Reciprocal Tariffs Despite this news-based sell-off, BTC’s value holding above $82K, which signals strength. However, this could come undone as two key macroeconomic events are yet to unfold this week that could rock Bitcoin and broader crypto markets. Key Macroeconomic Events To Watch This Week Although Trump’s Liberation Day and sweeping tariffs are behind us, investors must be cautious due to the upcoming macroeconomic events. Two key events that could influence Bitcoin price and crypto market moves include – Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) and Fed Chair Powell’s Speech on April 4. Although the ADP jobs data came in higher than expected, the forecast for March NFP data is 80K, much lower than the previous data of 151K. This would put further pressure on the Fed, which could perhaps be addressed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on April 4. The CME Fed Watch Tool shows a 78.5% probability that the target interest rate will remain the same at 4.25% to 4.50%. However, the probability table shows a 61.3% chance that the Fed could cut rates by 25 basis points in June 2025. What’s Next for Bitcoin (BTC)? BitMEX founder and recently pardoned by Trump, Arthur Hayes, added that, “if BTC can hold $76.5k now and on US tax day April 15, we’re out of danger.” RektProof, a popular crypto trader, shared his thoughts . Based on his Bitcoin price forecast , there could be a deviation in BTC price either below $81K up to $76K, which will be a great buying opportunity. BTC/USDT 12-hour chart On the contrary, if Bitcoin does not sweep lower, says RektProof, BTC could climb higher and sweep the $82K to $91K, which would also provide an opportunity to short the markets. Either way, the outlook from RektProof remains uncertain with and short-sighted due to the current market conditions and upcoming events that could easily influence moves.

Expert Insights on Market Volatility appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market experienced heightened volatility in the past 24 hours, triggering significant liquidations. The total crypto market cap slipped 2% to hover about $2.68 trillion on Thursday, April 3, during the mid-Eastern financial market trading session. As a result, more than $490 million was rekt in the past 24 hours from over 160k traders, mostly involving long traders. The largest liquidation order in the past 24 hours happened on the Binance exchange involving ETH/USDT valued at around $12 million. Major Forces Behind Today’s Crypto Market Drop Trade Tensions from U.S. Tariffs and Inflation Fears On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump concluded the Make America Wealthy Again event with an average 10 percent increase in reciprocal tariffs . Among the most hit by the new reciprocal tariffs are European countries and nations associated with the BRICS movement, led by China, and South Africa. As the ""Make America Wealthy Again Event"" concluded, markets held losses. Then, the White House posted a full list of tariffs on X, as shown below. This sent futures to a new low with the S&P 500 now indicated to open in correction territory. So, what does this all mean? pic.twitter.com/xnmsprXsxI — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 2, 2025 Although the Trump administration will side at least $600 billion per year from the new tariffs, experts project an increase in inflation to around 5 percent. Heavy Selloff in the Stock Market The mainstream adoption of crypto assets by institutional investors and retail traders has significantly increased the correlation of digital assets with the stock market. In the past 24 hours, following the announcement of the reciprocal tariffs by the United States, the S&P 500 futures erased around $2 trillion of market cap in 15 minutes. As a result, the crypto market was prone to taking a bearish hit amid heightened levels of further selloff. Technical Fears In the past few days, Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market in forming a rising wedge pattern, in the four-hour time frame. With Bitcoin price having been rejected above $87k in the past few days, a crypto correction was imminent, led by Ethereum (ETH). .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In West Virginia, lawmakers are advancing a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill aimed at increasing financial sovereignty and hedging against the potential rollout of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms has secured a $300 million loan from Macquarie Group to finance the development of its high-performance computing (HPC) data centers, signaling a broader industry shift toward AI infrastructure and diversified revenue streams amid post-halving pressures. West Virginia’s Bold Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill Aims to Secure Financial Sovereignty and Hedge Against CBDC Future West Virginia is positioning itself at the forefront of a growing movement in the United States to bring Bitcoin into the financial arsenal of state governments. In a recent interview, State Senator Chris Rose emphasized that the state’s newly proposed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill is not merely an investment strategy but a proactive step toward financial sovereignty and resistance to what he calls a creeping centralization of money in the form of a potential US central bank digital currency (CBDC). Excerpt of West Virginia Bitcoin reserve bill (Source: West Virginia Legislature ) Senator Rose, a Republican representing West Virginia’s 13th District, explained that the bill was crafted with the explicit intent of protecting the financial autonomy of the state and its citizens. “You hear these rumors that there are people at the federal government that will want to have a central bank digital currency,” Rose said. “And people don’t want that. People want decentralized currency. They want freedom.” The proposed legislation, introduced earlier this year in February, would allow the West Virginia state treasury to allocate up to 10% of its long-term public funds into a combination of precious metals like gold and silver, stablecoins, and digital assets. However, there’s a significant qualifier: any digital asset selected must have maintained a market capitalization of at least $750 million over the preceding 12 months. By these metrics, the only digital asset currently eligible is Bitcoin (BTC). The market capitalization filter is an intentional move by Senator Rose to avoid exposing state funds to riskier crypto assets or “meme coins,” which are infamous for their speculative price swings and lack of underlying utility. Rose added that Bitcoin adoption at the state level would grant West Virginia greater financial independence and “a little more state sovereignty.” Risk and Reward: Balancing Public Funds Exposure The bill proposes that the 10% allocation would be drawn from two key financial pillars of the state: The pensions fund The severance tax fund These funds are responsible for long-term financial commitments, making them more suitable for holding non-liquid, potentially volatile assets like Bitcoin. The bill deliberately excludes West Virginia’s petty cash fund, which manages daily operational expenses. Rose further explained that the 10% cap was selected to introduce Bitcoin to the state’s balance sheet without triggering fear among those unfamiliar with digital assets. “It’s a good way to cap that where they feel comfortable, but also give us at least a decent exposure as well,” he added. According to Rose, the bill has garnered positive feedback from key figures within the state government, including Governor Patrick Morrisey. The Governor, known for his pro-technology and crypto-forward policies, has envisioned a future economy in West Virginia powered in part by blockchain innovations. Rose also confirmed he consulted the state treasurer prior to introducing the bill to ensure institutional alignment. However, not everyone is convinced. Some lawmakers and financial experts, including those cited by WVNews , have raised concerns over Bitcoin’s high volatility and historical price swings. Critics argue that while Bitcoin may serve as a long-term hedge against inflation and centralized financial control, its unpredictable short-term movements could put public funds at risk. West Virginia is not alone in this legislative experiment. According to Bitcoin Laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 US states. However, the majority have either stalled in committees or had key provisions stripped. Only three states—Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas—have seen meaningful progress in moving these bills forward. Bitcoin: An Investment and a Political Statement For Senator Rose and his supporters, however, the bill is about more than just a portfolio diversification strategy—it’s a political message against federal overreach and centralized control. The bill’s progress could serve as a bellwether for how far US states are willing to go to integrate decentralized digital assets into public finance systems and challenge the increasing conversation surrounding a potential Federal Reserve-backed CBDC. As debate continues within the legislature, the outcome of West Virginia’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill could set an important precedent—not just for crypto adoption, but for the balance of financial power between state and federal governments in the digital age. Bitfarms Secures $300 Million Loan from Macquarie to Develop High-Performance Computing Data Centers In other news, leading Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms has secured a significant financial lifeline as it continues its strategic pivot toward high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. On April 2, Bitfarms announced it has entered into a $300 million loan agreement with global financial services giant Macquarie Group, a move designed to fund the development of its ambitious Panther Creek HPC data center project in Pennsylvania. The deal sheds light on the shifting dynamics of the Bitcoin mining industry as major players like Bitfarms look to diversify revenue streams amid the rapidly changing crypto market landscape and the exponential demand for AI computing capacity. Under the agreement, Macquarie’s private debt facility will provide an initial $50 million in funding to jumpstart the Panther Creek project. The remaining $250 million will be released in stages as Bitfarms hits predetermined development milestones at the site. According to Bitfarms’ announcement, the Panther Creek facility will ultimately boast nearly 500 megawatts of capacity, powered by a diversified energy mix. The company believes the project will attract a wave of interest from HPC tenants, including AI firms and cloud computing clients, once construction is fully underway. Bitfarms’ expansion into the HPC and AI sectors is part of a broader trend within the Bitcoin mining industry, as companies grapple with tighter profit margins in the wake of the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event. The reduction in Bitcoin block rewards has forced miners to search for alternative, more stable revenue streams. The surge in AI-driven data processing needs has presented a unique opportunity. GPU infrastructure originally intended for crypto mining is now being retooled for AI and HPC workloads, which offer significantly higher profit margins. According to Hive Digital executives, AI applications can generate upwards of $2.00 per hour per machine, compared to a mere $0.12 per hour from traditional Bitcoin mining. While the Panther Creek project offers long-term upside, Bitfarms acknowledged in its latest quarterly report that it faces regulatory hurdles in expanding its energy infrastructure. The company noted that the timeline to receive the necessary approvals could range anywhere from 12 to 36 months, potentially delaying full operational capacity. To address short-term capacity concerns, Bitfarms is banking on its recent $125 million acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining, which is expected to significantly bolster its operational power base while Panther Creek remains under development. Additionally, the company has recently sold its Paraguay site to Hive Digital for $85 million, signaling a broader strategic shift to consolidate operations in the United States and Canada while refocusing on HPC and AI opportunities. HODLing Bitcoin as a Hedge Despite its diversification strategy, Bitfarms remains firmly committed to Bitcoin as a long-term investment. The company reported mining 654 BTC in Q4 2024 at an average all-in cash cost of $60,800 per Bitcoin. Rather than liquidating its entire output, Bitfarms has opted to hold a significant portion of its mined Bitcoin , a practice known as HODLing within the crypto community. Currently, Bitfarms holds 1,152 BTC, making it one of the top 25 publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies in the world. Other major miners have adopted similar strategies. Hive Digital has increased its Bitcoin holdings to 2,620 BTC, while MARA Holdings has amassed an industry-leading 46,374 BTC and announced plans for a $2 billion stock offering to further expand its Bitcoin reserves. Bitfarms is not alone in its move toward HPC and AI. Industry peers such as Core Scientific, Hut8, Hive Digital, and Bit Digital have all begun to pivot portions of their operations away from pure Bitcoin mining toward AI-focused services. Hive Digital, for example, has reallocated part of its fleet of Nvidia GPUs—originally purchased for crypto mining—toward running AI applications and data-intensive workloads. The shift is widely seen as a defensive play in the face of shrinking Bitcoin mining rewards, increased energy costs, and growing regulatory scrutiny across global markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-03 05:30:00

Market expert Ali Martinez revealed that a roughly 250% rally for the dog-themed meme coin to the $0.5 level looms. However, this bull run is possible given that the meme token holds above key support at $0.16. DOGE price exchanged hands at $0.1662 as of press time, igniting optimism over a rally ahead. Dogecoin Price Eyes Over 250% Gains; Top Analyst Highlights Conditions Ali Martinez on April 3 revealed that the $0.16 price level presents itself as a ‘make-or-break’ point for Dogecoin price via a post on X . According to him, if the price holds this level, a potential rally to $0.57 awaits, which is up nearly 256% from the current level. However, failing to hold this level could result in a drop to $0.06, per the analyst. As a result, the key support level remains much-eyed by market watchers as the meme coin currently trades near it. Source: Ali Charts, X As mentioned above, the price is trading at $0.1662 with an intraday loss of over 3%. It bottomed and peaked at $0.1624 and $0.1787 over the past day, preventing losing support of $0.16. In an upshot, market watchers eye the token optimistically, expecting a sustained movement and thereby, a rally. What Are The Next Resistance Levels For Dogecoin Price? In another X post shared previously, the same analyst highlighted vital resistance levels for the dog-themed meme coin . Notably, the price faces two key resistance barriers at $0.18 and $0.21. Source: Ali Charts, X A sustained breakthrough above these resistance levels paves the way for a +250% bull run for DOGE price. In the wake of these price dynamics, crypto traders and investors are now glued to the meme coin’s price chart and await a trajectory shift. Derivatives Data Sparks Speculations However, Coinglass data has sparked contrary investor speculations by showcasing a decline in futures OI. DOGE futures OI was down over 3% to $1.56 billion today. This stat underscored slightly reduced investor interest in the meme token despite bullish predictions. Besides, the derivatives volume witnessed a 40% jump to $5.24 billion, adding a layer of intrigue to the market sentiment. Crypto market traders and investors expect short-term volatility amid the dynamic market stats, whilst long-term prospects remain bullish. Also, a Dogecoin price prediction by CoinGape revealed that the technical chart on the weekly time frame showcases a bullish engulfing pattern.

Only a short period after Trump announced the tariffs at the White House Rose Garden on April 2, some X users claim they were able to duplicate the same tariff plan with a rudimentary prompt using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “I was able to duplicate it in ChatGPT,” NFT collector DCinvestor told his 260,000 followers on X following the Donald Trump announcement of reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries on April 2. “It also told me that this idea hadn’t been formalized anywhere before, and that it was something it came up with,” he added, referring to the chatbot’s ability to calculate the tariff rates. “FFS. Trump admin is using ChatGPT to determine trade policy,” he added. Of course, the similarities between the artificial intelligence-generated tariff plan and Trump’s plan could also be simply coincidental. DCInvestor’s observation came in response to crypto trader Jordan Fish, also known as Cobie, who also asked ChatGPT using the prompt: “What would be an easy way to calculate the tariffs that should be imposed on other countries so that the US is on even playing fields when it comes to trade deficit. Set a minimum of 10%.” ChatGPT response to question on tariff calculations. Source: Cobie Journal of Public Economics editor Wojtek Kopczuk also experimented with ChatGPT , which generated the same results. “I think they asked ChatGPT to calculate the tariffs from other countries, which is why the tariffs make absolutely no fucking sense,” he said . Author Krishnan Rohit postulated on X that this “might be the first large-scale application of AI technology to geopolitics.” ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok all give the same answer to the question on how to impose tariffs easily, he observed. Trump's reciprocal tariffs lead to crypto dip Founder and CEO of supply chain logistics platform Flexport, Ryan Petersen, said his firm had reverse-engineered the formula the Trump administration used to generate the reciprocal tariffs. “It’s quite simple, they took the trade deficit the US has with each country and divided it by our imports from that country,” An editor at The Yale Review, James Surowiecki, said something similar, “they just took our [US] trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us.” Related: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which come into effect on April 5, have hit all countries with a 10% levy, with some nations facing even larger rates, such as China with a 34% tariff, Japan with 24%, and the European Union with 20%. Crypto markets reacted particularly badly, plunging 5% after the announcement as Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by $5,500 to $82,277 before recovering marginally, according to CoinGecko.

On Wednesday, 16:00 UTC, the exchange began trading the stablecoin and allowed its users to interact with it. So far, the stablecoin has already processed over $10 billion in cumulative trading volume, indicating massive momentum for the token. Kraken lists RLUSD, joining Archax, Bitso and Bitstamp In its press release, Kraken stated, “We’re thrilled to announce that RLUSD is now available for trading on Kraken!” and even detailed the asset. The exchange mentioned that the stablecoin is fully backed by a reserve of cash and cash equivalents, redeemable 1:1 for USD. It even added that the token is suitable for financial operations such as payments, global settlements, on/off ramping, and trading collateral. Kraken users can now deposit Ripple USD by heading to the funding tab on their account, selecting RLUSD, and using one of the supported networks. However, users cannot access RLUSD through their mobile Kraken application as yet. Moreover, the instant Buy feature is still unavailable for RLUSD holders until all liquidity requirements are met. But now that Kraken is on board, it adds to the token’s availability on Archax, B2C2, Bitso, Bitstamp, Bullish, Coinmena, Flowdesk, Independent Reserve, JST Digital, Keyrock, LMAX Digital, Mercado Bitcoin, Moonpay, Revolut, Uphold, and Zero Hash. Ripple adds RLUSD to its cross-border payments platform, Ripple Payments In addition to the Kraken token listing, Ripple has included its RLUSD in its enterprise-grade cross-border payments platform, Ripple Payments. Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of stablecoins at Ripple and CEO of Standard Custody & Trust Co., commented on the move, stating that RLUSD is now integrated into Ripple Payments, which offers near-global coverage through over 90 payout markets. It provides instant connections to banks, financial institutions, payment service providers, and exchanges, as well as many other entities around the world. As a result, it delivers enterprise utility right out of the box. In its press release, the company also claimed that the integration would allow for fast, low-cost, and scalable cross-border payments. So far, only a select number of users, including BKK Forex and iSend, are using the token for cross-border payments. However, Ripple plans to add more enterprise customers in the long run, especially since the token is better suited for institutional flows. A while back, Ripple also collaborated with Chainlink to add RLUSD data feeds to make the token more accessible to retail customers. Meanwhile, the stablecoin‘s market cap has surged to almost $250 million, reaching the $ 200 million mark just three months after its launch. Also, its monthly transfer volume grew from $466 million to over more than $720 million last month, a 55% increase. The token has also crossed the $10 billion trading volume mark, with most analysts crediting its listings on global exchanges and increased adoption among financial institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as the primary growth catalysts.

Trump Tariffs Rattle Markets The market slump follows US President Donald Trump’s April 2 confirmation of trade tariffs that will impact many countries across the globe. Trump announced tariffs on 185 countries at once in one of the largest tariff impositions in US history. As a result, S&P 500 futures erased around $2 trillion in market cap in under 15 minutes, reported the Kobeissi Letter. Economists described Trump’s new reciprocal tariff plan as a “tsunami” that will “slam into the global economy and have repercussions that are hard to quantify.” “This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession,” said Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings. Trump has hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5, with some countries facing even higher rates, including China, which faces a 34% tariff, Vietnam 46%, the European Union 20%, and Japan 24%. Describing the announcement as “Liberation Day,” Trump said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the US and other countries. Moreover, imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation. “Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,” said Trump. Trump is set to sign reciprocal tariffs into effect.

This turmoil was primarily triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs, which injected uncertainty into global markets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s price dropped from a high of approximately $88,500 to around $83,400 following the tariff news. The market experienced significant liquidations totaling approximately $500 million, with $300 million occurring within the last four hours. Initially the short positions were hit, then long ones, almost equally. In just one hour, the market wiped out over $100 million in long positions. $489M Wiped Out as 159K Traders Liquidated In the past 24 hours, 159,333 traders were liquidated , the total liquidations comes in at $489.07 million. The biggest single liquidation order was $11.97 million in ETHUSDT on Binance. Of the total, $257 million came from long positions and $232.06 million from short positions. These liquidations have impacted various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. Consequently, the overall market capitalization has decreased by $200 billion since its peak during after-hours trading.​ The recent market fluctuations have been largely affected by macroeconomic factors particularly, the anticipation of Liberation day tariffs announced by Trump. These tariffs have led to a high degree of market uncertainty leading to price volatility across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for instance, has seen its price fluctuate between $73,000 and $88,000, and is currently trading around $83,500, down by 0.9%. Liquidation Day or Liberation Day? This has left X users wondering if it was really a ‘Liberation Day’ or just a ‘Liquidation Day,’ given the massive wave of liquidations that shook the market. Bitcoin plunged to $82,000 on April 2, 2025, as global markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s bold tariff move. In his ‘Liberation Day’ speech, Trump announced aggressive reciprocal tariff rates on key trade partners, calling it a much-needed fix for America’s trade issues. Despite these short-term challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Forecasts suggest that Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025, with some projections reaching as high as $500,000 if the U.S. establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve. ​",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-03 05:47:35

President Donald Trump officially levied a 25% tariff on auto imports and a minimum 10% tariff on all exporters to the U.S. Additional duties were imposed on the nation’s biggest trading partners in Asia and the European Union, with China facing a 50% hike on several goods and a 26% fee on some Indian goods. Turmoil in markets ensued with gains from the past three days wiped out in U.S. indices and cryptocurrencies. Asian markets tumbled early Thursday and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slumped to the lowest level in more than five months. Gold set yet another record high. Bitcoin inched above $87,000 as investors hoped for leaner long-term effects of the economic changes, with signs of a risk-on environment emerging at the start of the week. Majors ether (ETH) and xrp (XRP) traded above $1,900 and $2.15, respectively, with technical analysis suggesting higher moves in the near term. But the euphoria was short-lived as crypto majors dipped as much as 5% from Wednesday’s highs before gradually stabilizing. In Asian morning hours on Thursday, bitcoin traded just above $83,500 while ether traded slightly over $1,800 — effectively reversing all gains from Tuesday after a sudden drop following the Tokyo open. That caused over $230 million in liquidations on both bullish and bearish bets, data shows , in an unusual move. BTC-tracked futures registered over $172 million in long and short liquidations alone, followed by ETH futures at $120 million and smaller altcoins at $50 million. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open). Single-sided large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.

With the dominance of this exchange, its action often has a significant impact on the industry, especially around listing and delisting, affecting the value of digital assets and the investors’ holdings. Crypto Trader Lost $3.79M on ACT Price Crash According to the Lookonchain post , Binance’s implementation of updates to leverage and margin tiers on Acet (ACT) tokens has affected the holders significantly. As the changes took effect on April 1, 2025, investors with holdings before that were impacted. One crypto trader alone faced a $3.79M liquidation as the ACT price crashed to $0.1877. This highlights the risk of sudden adjustments in leverages, as the traders who fail to adjust their positions end up facing massive liquidation losses. Besides, this is not the only affected crypto investor. Another lost nearly $2.17M with the ACT price crash. Lookonchain reveals that the individual’s holding’s worth was $2.49M months ago, but it is worth only $320k when they reported. ACT Price Crash Persists, Should You Worry? The Binance exchange update is considered a major mistake among the community as the event led to the massive Acet price crash . With major liquidation, the ACT’s worth crashed by more than 50%. The token is still down, bearing a 15% loss on the 24-hour frame. This reveals that the selling sentiments are high, as the investors’ confidence is declining on the asset. It currently trades at $0.06137 with a market capitalization of $77.2M. Also, its trading volume is down by 56% to $1.21M, showcasing fearful investor sentiments. This serves as a reminder that investors should stay informed about market news. More importantly, manage their actions accordingly; otherwise, massive losses may happen, similar to those of the aforementioned crypto trader. Although this is a standard part of the crypto trading industry, investors must manage their risk exposure carefully. More importantly, trades should be made carefully around this token. This is because volatility is high in the current scenario, especially as Trump escalated the trade war.

Alongside Senator Elizabeth Warren, Waters also urged the SEC to preserve records related to Trump’s crypto ties, and raised concerns about regulatory influence. Meanwhile, Trump made headlines with a new executive order imposing sweeping reciprocal tariffs on imports. He proposed a shift away from income tax toward tariff-based federal revenue collection. Maxine Waters Slams Trump Over Stablecoin Ties California Representative Maxine Waters voiced strong criticism against President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the cryptocurrency sector. During an April 2 markup hearing of the US House Financial Services Committee, Waters accused Trump of using his political influence to profit from various crypto ventures, including the recent launch of a US dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by his family. Maxine Waters speaking at the markup hearing In her opening remarks, Waters argued that Trump and his associates were using the regulatory process to enrich themselves through “multiple crypto schemes.” She specifically referenced World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is a company backed by Trump’s family, that launched the USD1 stablecoin in March. Waters also mentioned Trump’s previously launched meme coin and his reported ambitions to create a national cryptocurrency stockpile as part of a larger plan to replace the US dollar with his own digital currency. Waters warned that the stablecoin bill currently under discussion could set a dangerous precedent by allowing political figures to shape financial rules that benefit their own financial interests. She suggested that Trump’s ultimate goal could be to embed his stablecoin in government systems, from social security payments to tax collection, putting national financial stability at risk. Other lawmakers agreed with her concerns, and experts raised questions about potential conflicts of interest stemming from Trump’s crypto activities. Committee Chair French Hill acknowledged that the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto sector complicates efforts to draft effective legislation. Waters went on to declare that she will oppose the bill unless it included provisions to prevent a sitting president from owning a stablecoin business, and also urged her colleagues not to enable these kinds of conflicts. Markup hearing (Source: YouTube ) Meanwhile, Representative Bryan Steil, who introduced the STABLE Act, focused on the need to establish clear consumer protections and did not immediately address the specific concerns that were raised about Trump’s stablecoin. The committee also reviewed amendments to the STABLE Act alongside other legislative proposals aimed at curbing illicit financial activity and preventing the issuance of a US central bank digital currency. Overall, the markup hearing was a crucial step in determining whether the bills will actually advance to a full vote in the House of Representatives. Warren and Waters Demand SEC Transparency on Trump Ties Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters also recently urged the acting chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mark Uyeda, to preserve records related to World Liberty Financial (WLFI). In a letter dated April 2, the two Democratic lawmakers raised some concerns over what they described as an “unprecedented conflict of interest,” and suggested that Trump’s financial ties to WLFI could influence regulatory decisions in favor of the crypto industry. Part of the letter that was sent to Uyeda (Source: House Financial Services Committee ) Warren and Waters pointed out that Trump’s family stake in WLFI presents a very serious risk of interfering with the SEC’s mission to protect investors and ensure fair markets. They argued that this financial relationship may incentivize the Trump administration to pressure federal agencies, including the SEC, to adopt policies that directly benefit Trump’s crypto ventures. The letter followed WLFI’s announcement that it launched a stablecoin, USD1, on both the BNB Chain and Ethereum blockchain. The lawmakers referenced this launch along with Trump’s recent cryptocurrency-related initiatives, including the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile and the release of the TRUMP meme coin, as examples of potential conflicts of interest. Warren and Waters also placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the American public deserves transparency regarding whether the SEC is acting independently or being influenced by the financial interests of the president’s family. They called on Uyeda to preserve all communications and documents between Trump, his family, and the SEC, as well as any records involving WLFI. The letter also drew attention to some of the recent changes at the SEC under Trump’s administration. Since appointing Uyeda as acting chair, the SEC reportedly dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against crypto firms, including some whose executives contributed to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Trump’s nominee to permanently lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, is set to face a Senate Banking Committee vote, with a full Senate confirmation to follow if approved. Trump Orders Reciprocal Tariffs to Protect US Economy In other Trump-related news, the President signed an executive order imposing sweeping tariffs on imports in a move that is aimed at reshaping the US economic framework. The order establishes a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from every country and introduces reciprocal tariffs based on the rates US goods face abroad. Under this policy, the US will levy tariffs equal to roughly half the amount trading partners charge on American imports. For instance, since China imposes a 67% tariff on US products, the US will now place a 34% tariff on Chinese goods. Additionally, a flat 25% tariff has been introduced on all automobile imports. Trump’s reciprocal trade tariffs (Source: YouTube ) In announcing the order, Trump framed the tariffs as a return to a historic model of economic protectionism, and even suggested that the US experienced its greatest prosperity when it relied on tariff revenue rather than income tax. He specifically referenced the period from 1789 to 1913, and claimed that the country was wealthier and more economically secure before the introduction of the federal income tax. Trump also revived a proposal from his 2024 campaign to abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replace federal revenue collection with tariffs alone. He argued that such a shift will relieve American taxpayers and eliminate the need for income-based taxation. According to data from accounting firm Dancing Numbers , the proposal could save US taxpayers between $134,809 and $325,561 over their lifetimes, depending on whether wage-based taxes at the state and local levels are also removed. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who assumed office in February, agreed with Trump’s stance, and endorsed the concept of an “External Revenue Service” funded by tariffs. Lutnick believes that tariff revenue will protect American workers and industries while reducing the financial burden on citizens, and argued that the current tax system demands too much from the public without delivering a balanced federal budget.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-03 06:14:23

A $50 million tranche of RLUSD was issued earlier this week on Tuesday, with another $50 million late Wednesday. That came as Ripple added the stablecoin to its official payments product, with payment providers BKK Forex and iSend already said to be using the stablecoin. Industry leaders expect RLUSD to further shift crypto market dynamics , where upstarts tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) could see competition from Ripple’s product. XRP Ledger-based decentralized financial (DeFi) applications could be a cohort to watch for as RLUSD gains traction on various platforms, boosting XRP token demand. RLUSD is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, offered on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain. It is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents. To maintain its peg, RLUSD relies on a 1:1 reserve system—each token matches an equivalent fiat value. Users can mint RLUSD by depositing dollars with authorized partners, who issue tokens, or burn RLUSD to redeem cash. Market arbitrage helps stabilize its price: if RLUSD trades below $1, traders buy it to redeem at par, raising demand; if above $1, they mint more, increasing supply. Security features make RLUSD appealing to institutional users. An XRP Ledger amendment in January saw a “clawback” feature go live on the network, allowing the issuer to reclaim or ""claw back"" certain tokens, such as RLUSD, from users' wallets under specific conditions. This feature is typically implemented for regulatory compliance, to recover assets in cases of fraud, illegal activities, or when tokens are sent to unintended addresses.",Markets,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|USDT|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-03 06:16:58
