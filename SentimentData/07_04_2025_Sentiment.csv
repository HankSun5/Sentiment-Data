More often than not, these locked tokens were reserved for team members, investors, and other strategic purposes. So what happens when these tokens are unlocked? They flood the market, available to trade for the price of a price. They also don’t just show up in chit chat—many times, they’re planned and announced in advance, with dates set, causing speculation about possible impacts on pricing. Next week, a number of important token unlocks are taking place, will bring millions of dollars’ worth of assets into circulation. Here’s a look at some of the big unlocks happening over the next seven days, and why they might matter to market participants. Upcoming Token Unlocks and Their Potential Impact Next week’s token unlock schedule includes some truly significant events that could make waves in the market. Not a few of the unlocks involve literally millions of dollars’ worth of tokens, and they’re likely to be a big driver of whatever volatility we see next week as traders and investors react to the newfound supply. 1. $ENA Unlock – 5 de abril de 2025 On April 5, 55.3 million USD worth of tokens was unlocked by $ENA. This unlock could create notable market movements, especially given the large amount being released. As with most significant unlocks, it’s likely that some of these tokens will be sold, leading to temporary price dips or shifts in trading volume. The release of such a large amount may also signal to traders that the project is entering a new phase, potentially offering an opportunity to re-evaluate its long-term value. 2. $SAGA Unlock – April 9, 2025 On April 9, tokens worth 35.7 million USD will be unlocked from the SAGA project, which could further impact the landscape of the crypto market. With such a nice amount being set free, traders might adjust their positions appropriately, especially as the crypto market anticipates how the SAGA project will handle the newly freed-up tokens. 3. Unlock $MOVE – Apr 9, 2025 Scheduled for April 9, the $MOVE unlock will see 19 million USD worth of tokens hit the marketplace. The release day is one of those times, however, when the behavior of these tokens might not have much to do with any inherent qualities of the project. This is a concrete economic moment that might be more about the $MOVE token’s drive mechanism than drive mechanism itself. After all, $MOVE is specifically designed to get the market-moving part of the equation done. The actual market movement seems to be more a product of the nature of the tokens being unlocked than of any positive or negative attributes of the project itself. 4. $TNSR Unlocked – April 8, 2025 Another token, $TNSR, is experiencing a substantial token unlock on April 8, with 16.3 million USD worth of tokens set to be released. As with other major unlocks, holders of $TNSR and potential investors will need to assess the immediate aftermath to gauge market sentiment. Given the size and the broader market conditions coinciding with this unlock, we expect it to be bullish day trading fodder. 5. KAS Unlock – April 7, 2025 On April 7, tokens worth 10 million USD will be unlocked from the $KAS vault. This release, while significantly smaller than some of the others, still represents a substantial amount of tokens entering into circulation. Given the $KAS demand situation and the overall market mood, this release could cause some short-term excitement. But because it is smaller, it could mean less in the way of market upswings or downswings. 6. Unlocking $NEON – April 7, 2025. The next token unlock is set for April 7, and this one will involve $NEON. There will be tokens worth 6.4 million USD made available. Again, while this may not be a sizable event (in the amount of tokens made available) for the market, it still bears watching for traders, as we don’t know what will happen—and even smaller unlocks can lead to price fluctuations if there is a large concentration of token-holders doing what token-holders typically do post-unlock (i.e., sell, if they intend to sell). 7. $IO Open – a demand for electric intelligence (March 18, 2025) In our 2024 futurist conference, we made three bold predictions. One of those was $IO Open, where electricity is used to unveil the secrets of intelligent systems. In layman’s terms, it means that $IO Open might just be the brain’s equivalent of plugging into the electric grid and harnessing its full potential. In conclusion, on April 11, $IO will undergo a token unlock, and 2 million worth of dollar tokens will be released. This is one of the smallest unlocks that have happened so far in 2023 concerning the amount that’s being unlocked; however, it could still make some waves. Why go ahead and watch it then? Well, even though it’s a tiny unlock in comparison to some that have happened this year in terms of dollar value, it’s also sending 2 million worth of tokens back into the marketplace and as we all know, those marketplace dynamics are unpredictable.

Certain factors influence how much and in what direction prices shift when tokens are unlocked. Those factors include: – supply and demand – market sentiment – investor behavior – project progress If you know a project you like is about to unlock a lot of tokens, it might be worth it to reconsider your position in that project. Similar to past instances, investors need to be ready for turbulence when big unlocking events occur and the dust starts to settle. It’s going to be all-the-more important to keep a close watch on the actual tokens that are involved and to see if any kind of selling pressure or price momentum is developing at the moment. These unlock events could have big implications for the market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These assets, which are designed to maintain a steady value through pegs to fiat currencies or other assets, have become a vital component of the crypto ecosystem. They offer an alternative to the nearly dollar-for-dollar volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The total stablecoin supply crossed an impressive $220 billion in Q1 2025, marking a new record high for the sector. Among the standout performers, Solana’s stablecoin market cap surged by 146%, positioning it as one of the key players in the stablecoin space. Alongside Solana, other networks like MorphLayer, Cronos, Stacks, and Bob also experienced sharp growth in their stablecoin markets. Notably, Solana’s growth has solidified its place as the fifth-largest network in terms of stablecoin market cap, hitting $12.5 billion. Solana stablecoin supply surged 146% in Q1 In Q1 2025, stablecoin market cap on @MorphLayer , @cronos_chain , @Stacks , and @build_on_bob experienced sharp growth. @solana followed closely, taking fifth place with its stablecoin market cap climbing to $12.5B. @Algorand , @zksync ,… pic.twitter.com/SmKw6FtZnR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 3, 2025 A Surge in Stablecoin Market Cap Across Multiple Platforms The first quarter of 2025 has seen a series of developments for stablecoins, as they have continued to increase their foothold in the crypto market. Most importantly, stablecoin supply reached new all-time highs, with the expansion of stablecoin markets across a variety of blockchain platforms playing a significant role in this growth. In the first quarter, the total supply of stablecoins witnessed a substantial rise and went beyond the $220 billion mark, clearly indicating the burgeoning demand for low-volatility, stable assets within the crypto space. Despite some prevailing market uncertainty, this was a clear indication that stablecoins are now an integral part of the portfolio of traders, institutional investors, and decentralized finance (DeFi) participants looking to minimize the effects of market volatility and efficiently move capital across different blockchain networks. Performance this quarter—Tether ($USDT). Dominant stablecoin. Market cap now over $140 billion, nearly double what it was in early 2022. In the stablecoin market, this is a solid lead. Remains a top choice for liquidity in the global crypto markets. One bright spot for crypto in Q1 was the growth of stablecoins, which hit new record highs. – Total #stablecoin supply crossed $220B, the highest ever – Tether ( $USDT ) leads with over $140B in market cap, nearly doubling since early 2022 – $USDC gained share, rising from 20%… pic.twitter.com/kYOxv7NhJq — Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) April 4, 2025 Concurrently, USD Coin ($USDC) has been garnering market share, now comprising 27% of the total stablecoin market—up from 20% a year ago. This coincides not just with Circle’s plans for an IPO but also with what seems destined to be a playout of that public offering. As one of the most popular stablecoins, USDC’s movement upward seems to be in concert with a broader trend of even more institutional interest in stable assets. Solana’s Explosive Growth in Stablecoins One of the increasingly energetic networks around stablecoins is Solana. From the beginning of 2025, it has expanded at a dizzying pace, securing an incredible 146 percent increase in its stablecoin supply when measured against its figures for the end of 2024. This puts the Solana in stablecoin territory that few other Layer 1 blockchains can touch. The technology of Solana, known for its rapidity and low transaction costs, has made it a viable option for developers and users wanting to use stablecoins on a scalable and efficient platform. Solana is an increasingly important player. It has a growing supply of stablecoins. More and more projects are choosing to launch stablecoins on its fast and affordable infrastructure. The stablecoin growth on Solana is also part of the much larger trend of DeFi projects trying to use stablecoins as their main medium for doing things like transacting, lending, and providing liquidity. Because of the Solana blockchain’s overall efficiency at handling high transaction volumes, it is now the ideal place for using stablecoins, which is why Solana’s ecosystem has been growing so much lately. Other Networks See Significant Stablecoin Growth The stablecoin boom in Q1 2025 was not just a boon for Solana. Other blockchain platforms also experienced substantial growth in their stablecoin markets. Networks such as Algorand, zkSync, and Hedera have seen demand for stable digital assets almost double, pointing to the idea that stablecoins are becoming a key part of the blockchain ecosystem that stretches beyond the confines of any one chain. This growth across multiple platforms suggests that stablecoins are gaining traction as a digital asset that can be used in a wide variety of applications across the blockchain space. The stablecoin activity has surged, which is also a direct consequence of the broader trends within the blockchain ecosystem. The stablecoins are demanded more now, as the developers and the businesses are looking to build on the blockchain networks that can offer them efficiency, can offer them low fees, and that can offer them scalability. The use of the stablecoins in these ecosystems is again highlighting a shift in the focus of the crypto world toward more stable assets. Conclusion: The Future of Stablecoins and Their Growing Importance We see Q1 2025 as a watershed moment for stablecoins. Their adoption is not just growing; it is burgeoning. Not just the construction of them but the actual real-world usage of stablecoins is becoming a commonplace thing in our society. Yet Solana, Tether, and USD Coin (USDC)—the three tokens we label as “the stablecoin trifecta”—are equally important for their real-world, global potential. While the relentless march of blockchain technology proceeds apace, it is indeed stablecoins that have become the most stable component of the crypto economy. By and large, the typical American trader has little interaction with seamless cross-border transactions. Even so, if you traded crypto with any regularity, the transactions would across a digital wall separating two different currencies—by and large, the transactions would use a stablecoin. Currently, Solana is the most reliable stablecoin network, with 99.98% uptime on reasonable assumptions about what a healthy price looks like. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007323,https://nulltx.com/?p=147775,1743978939,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval for Solana ETF: A Bold Move to Expand Crypto Access,https://nulltx.com/grayscale-seeks-sec-approval-for-solana-etf-a-bold-move-to-expand-crypto-access/,"Grayscale , one of the major firms in the digital asset management sphere, is making news in the crypto space once again, and it’s doing so with a very bold move. The venture has recently put in the paperwork to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to move its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on NYSE Arca. This filing coincides with Grayscale’s push to expand access to cryptocurrencies for traditional investors and might be a significant step toward pushing digital assets deeper into the mainstream. Grayscale’s move to seek an ETF for Solana comes on the heels of the successful launches of its Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Both have been well received by investors seeking crypto-market exposure through more traditional investment vehicles. With the cryptocurrency space continuing to push into the mainstream, the Solana ETF proposal embodies the ambition—held in by the crypto asset manager—to expand the range of regulated crypto offerings that are accessible to both institutional and retail investors. A Strategic Move Toward Broader Access to Solana The proposed Solana ETF would give investors the change to chance to gain exposure to Solana (SOL), one of the most high-profile cryptocurrencies in recent years. While the project has faced some headwinds, and some associated volatility, its strong performance and growing ecosystem seem now to cement it as one of the top contenders in the blockchain space. Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval For Solana ETF Grayscale has filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an ETF on NYSE Arca, continuing its efforts to expand crypto access for traditional investors. The proposed ETF, like previous Bitcoin and Ethereum products, excludes staking… pic.twitter.com/1gYfMs9JeO — The O Show (Wendyo.eth) (@The_O_Show_) April 4, 2025 Nevertheless, Solana is now a project in decline, with SOL trading near a 13-month low. Analysts, however, are still quite high on its long-term prospects, viewing it as one of the strong candidates for its scalability associated features and nigh use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be a front-runner in the blockchain space. The choice to pursue SEC approval is less than straightforward, coming as it does amid the cryptocurrency market’s sharp downturn and the SEC’s increasingly critical posture toward crypto firms and products. A Solana ETF might offer the types of normalized, federally regulated access that institutional investors have until now largely avoided. You can see the types of silly, straightforward advantages that an ETF would bestow on Solana as a potential leading digital asset: legitimacy; the type of well-understood federal regulatory framework that quite a few large investors have been waiting around for; and, oh, just generally putting Solana a lot closer to the top of the asset class ranking that is so damned important for any potential investor. Excluding Staking to Align with SEC Preferences In its filing, Grayscale has designed the proposed Solana ETF to exclude staking, aligning with the SEC’s past preferences regarding cryptocurrency ETFs. Still, staking is a practice that has not been entirely resolved in regard to the SEC’s vision of investor protection. Following previous preferences, Grayscale is trying to avoid putting a product in front of the SEC that would necessitate the agency reviewing how rewards are being distributed and what might happen if an investor loses funds staked in a supposedly secure network. Historically, the SEC has shown reluctance to approve products that include staking. Grayscale seeks to make the proposed Solana ETF align with the SEC’s guidelines in order to facilitate its approval. The company’s previous dating back to 2013 suggests a strong likelihood of approval if its current ETF proposals are synced with SEC investor protection regulations and the specific criteria the Commission has set for Bitcoin futures ETFs and Ether futures ETFs (that is, these entities must not stake). Grayscale ETF proposals are currently in sync with these signals. Why Solana Is a Strong Candidate for an ETF As one of the blockchain platform solutions showing the most promise, Solana represents the concept of high speed in terms of transaction throughput, low fees that make it accessible, and scalability that ensures it covers a broad base. In the traction department, it has already attracted a number of developers and projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment, looking for an alternative to Ethereum, which they seem to think is slower, costlier, and less accessible than Solana. In terms of enthusiasts and institutional support, Solana seems to have lots of both. One of the reasons analysts consider Solana a strong ETF candidate is the recent acknowledgment by the SEC of comparable filings. The ETF approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum have set a distinct precedent. With Solana’s solid standing in regulated markets now, offering a futures-based ETF makes a lot of sense in Grayscale’s overall strategy of providing varied, diversified investment options in the crypto space. Another thing bolstering Solana’s case for the ETF: its futures market is now increasingly viewed as one that’s regulated. A Solana ETF would raise access to Solana for traditional investors and could serve as an exemplar for other blockchain-based assets. If this ETF were to gain approval, it would be a huge moment for the crypto industry in terms of institutional adoption, providing a direct access point to a safe, regulated digital asset for investors. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Grayscale’s Solana ETF Proposal? While Grayscale’s push for an ETF based on the cryptocurrency Solana is new, the Solana ETF application is only the latest in a line of similar attempts by Grayscale to win approval from the SEC for offerings that use various cryptocurrencies as the underlying assets. If the SEC allows Grayscale to proceed with the Solana ETF the way it has allowed Grayscale to proceed with Solana in the past, that is, to purchase Solana, then those approvals would represent significant transitions of Solana and other cryptocurrencies from uses primarily in the largely unregulated sphere of digital assets to uses in the SEC-governed financial system. At this point, we see the proposed Solana ETF as another step toward a more accessible world of crypto. We see it as a vehicle, with Grayscale at the wheel, that takes us down the road of regulated investment opportunities in the digital asset space. Now, if you are Solana—or, for that matter, any blockchain project—you want what we just outlined to be your basic operating narrative. You want institutional interest in what you are doing, and you want that interest to be growing and leading in the direction of something that could be your next inevitable investment-grade vehicle: the Solana ETF. This proposal places Grayscale once again at the forefront of cryptocurrency investment. In the eyes of many, it signaled that crypto was truly becoming integrated into traditional financial markets, one step at a time. Even if a Bitcoin ETF never came to be, Grayscale was still the name to know and to trust. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007377,https://nulltx.com/?p=147776,1743979124,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,PumpFun Reopens Livestream Feature: A Strategic Move Amid Market Adjustment,https://nulltx.com/pumpfun-reopens-livestream-feature-a-strategic-move-amid-market-adjustment/,"More than five months after being suspended, the popular decentralized platform PumpFun has decided to reopen its Livestream feature. Following a period of intense scrutiny, community backlash, and several scandals, the platform had put the livestreaming tool on hold. Critics had charged that PumpFun was using the service to generate revenue for itself while allowing streamers to create dangerously “toxic” content. Those same critics, after all, had forced the tool to shut down in the first place. But now, with better governance and some community-controlled reins, PumpFun is ready to cautiously reintroduce its “sLiverstream” feature. Although this move has raised a few eyebrows, particularly in light of PumpFun’s recent difficulties, some market watchers believe that this is a movement being made in the opposite direction from the platform’s profile sagging. They point to the fact that the Livestream function was once “key” in attracting users and generating word-of-mouth about it. Now, under stricter management and with clearer content guidelines, it seems as if PumpFun is tentatively revisiting that idea of it drawing in an audience again for, hopefully, the same effect. The Return of Livestreaming with New Restrictions The Livestream function on PumpFun was turned off nearly half a year back because it was being harmed by a community exploiting it to deliver baseless, scandalous, and otherwise-unfriendly-to-the-public material. Reporters have since streamed content to PumpFun to deliver the sorts of heartwarming and good-for-the-public stories that K-pop fandoms usually deliver. At present, PumpFun has brought back the Livestream function; however, it has made some substantial changes to that reintroduction to ensure that the platform maintains its integrity going forward. One of the most striking alterations is the number of people who are allowed to watch each stream. The company has capped it now at 5% of the entire user base, ensuring that only a small, controlled audience gets to peek behind the curtain of the platform itself. This seems to be a clear move to limit the potential for harmful content while still allowing the Livestream feature to exist as a tool for user engagement. Along with the cap on viewers, the terms of management have been made stricter, with an intent to control user activities more tightly during livestreams. The reason for this is, of course, to keep the kind of content that might make the platform look bad from being seen (a.k.a. “toxic content”). But in my opinion, even these new measures won’t be enough to ensure that the platform is a good place for all users to spend time—in part, because they still leave open the question of what kind of content is justifiable. #Pumpfun bắt đầu mở lại tính năng Livestream – hành động dự phóng kéo thị trường trong tương lai? Với việc đóng cửa sau hơn 5 tháng với những bê bối chồng chất khi bị cộng đồng lợi dụng làm những content độc hại thì hiện tại, @pumpdotfun đã có động… pic.twitter.com/8Htc0OOXNx — alphawolf (@alphawolfl2) April 5, 2025 Is This a Strategic Attempt to Revitalize the Platform? This move is critical in terms of timing because PumpFun is facing a steep slide in trading volume and overall platform engagement. Bringing back the feature of livestreaming might just reverse that decline, though it could be many moons before we know anything for sure. In an increasingly interactive landscape, where livestreaming is becoming de rigeur, such a feature could act as an engagement funnelcoming ytub back and reinvigorating both trading and platform engagement as the weekend approaches. Re-launching in a market downturn suggests that the platform is using this time to play around and refine what it has to offer. With the market currently in a deep adjustment phase, the company has more room to try out the new Livestream function and fine-tune that operation without the same level of market demand it would face in a booming period. This tactic gives the platform more space to gather feedback and make the kinds of adjustments to the Livestream feature it will need to make before expanding it further or developing new functionalities tied to it in the future. Furthermore, it appears that the platform’s management is betting on community governance as a way to achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility. By exerting more influence over the content on the platform, PumpFun anticipates that the community will help it avoid the previous mistakes that led to toxic content being allowed to exist and thrive unfiltered. The community is not yet fully certain about the efficacy of the upcoming content-control rules, but it seems to be cautiously optimistic about the platform moving more in the direction of content governance. Community Concerns and Future Prospects Even with the alterations, PumpFun’s community is still split about whether reinstating the Livestream feature will be a hit or miss. These uncertain boundaries about what is and what isn’t “appropriate” content have some users wondering about the platform’s future. If the above concerns aren’t answered with content guidelines that are clear and transparent, the platform runs the risk of facing another user backlash, which could drive away even more users than it has already. PumpFun seems to be taking the requisite steps to ensure that previous problems do not arise again, and this makes us feel somewhat better about recommencing our use of the platform. The way in which it is reintroducing the livestreaming feature, with both a substantially limited viewer base and a dramatically enhanced layer of oversight, makes us think that the company is now much more serious about livestreaming as a core component of its service and is much more serious about the community concerns that pushed it to suspend the feature in the first place. The relaunch of livestreaming could act as a bridge to the more sophisticated features that are being planned and that are associated with real-time interaction and content. As the crypto space keeps growing, platforms like PumpFun are looking for new means to mix social with financial components. Livestreaming, they are betting, will be the first step toward the much more interactive platform that the space cries out for. Conclusion: A Bold Move for PumpFun’s Future The evolution of the platform takes another step forward with the relaunch of the Livestream feature at PumpFun, despite the Elementum controversy and a past riddled with revealed challenges. This test will tell us if the platform is ready to tackle the issue of fostering “safe, useful, and fun content” and maintaining a “safe and engaging environment” for its users. PumpFun does itself a service by using the current market uncertainty as an opportunity to refine its approach. If this relaunch turns out to be successful, it could lead to whatever it is that might come next (and if it leads to whatever’s next in the ecosystem, I’ll cover that issue next week). If this is handled well and if these new aspects are well integrated into the platform, this could quite literally represent the next frontier for both PumpFun and elemental content creation.

43007638,https://nulltx.com/?p=147777,1743979601,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Venture Capital in Crypto: A Shift Toward Real-World Integration in Q1 2025,https://nulltx.com/venture-capital-in-crypto-a-shift-toward-real-world-integration-in-q1-2025/,"The venture capital (VC) landscape in the crypto space had a notable shift in Q1 2025, following a strong showing on the market in the latter half of 2024. In particular, the performance of Bitcoin ($BTC) in Q3 and Q4 last year was a catalyst for increased funding in crypto startups in the first quarter of this year. But pricing and VC investment do not move in lockstep. Funding activity has a way of tailing the price trend by one or two quarters, and the soft pricing of recent weeks, if it is indeed the start of a downtrend, might mean less funding in the next few months. Even with this possible deceleration, emerging segments of the crypto ecosystem continue to attract investors. Most interesting are the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and real-world assets (RWA). Both crypto native and traditional venture capital firms have showcased these three critical areas. Overall, this reflects strong investor interest. Projects in the crypto space are looking increasingly towards the real world, the development of infrastructure, and user appeal that extends beyond the crypto native community. State of Venture Capital in Crypto, Q1 2025 Explore the latest state of the crypto venture capital market and learn why 2025 will be a game-changing year for crypto https://t.co/uU0jyjk2GH — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 4, 2025 Strong Investor Appetite for Real-World Integration and Infrastructure In Q1 2025, significant venture funding moved towards a different type of project than had attracted it just a quarter earlier. Instead of focusing on speculative projects or the next big coin, many investors turned their attention to sectors with “real-world, tangible applications.” This included not just a diversification into various (physical) sectors of the economy, but a pronounced pivot towards the layering of crypto and blockchain technology with AI, a space where we saw a ton of project funding happening in 2024. (Given that AI technologies are also funded heavily with VC dollar, this layering effect is a pretty clear signal of where investors see the future economy going.) The whole DePIN discussion reflects not just a diversification of the type of project communities are building, but also signals the next “big area” that the crypto blockchain technology development community is now trying to tackle. Venture capital poured into Real-World Assets (RWA), as these projects sought to bring physical assets into the crypto fold. RWA seemed to promise a bridge between the traditional world of finance and a new digital era — an entrance into which institutional investors might more easily walk because they found some comfort in RWAs’ use of blockchain to address ‘real problems’ in the ‘real world.’ If all that was true, and VC investors seemed to think it was, then RWA could really change the game for crypto. Increasing investor interest in new sectors means that more and more investment dollars are flowing into these areas. And this is a very good sign for the sectors themselves. Why? Because it suggests that the investment community is very much looking at these sectors as not only having the potential to offer high rates of return over the long run but also as being places where there’s sustainable, real, and long-term value. Infrastructure; use cases; something that just about everyone involved in the crypto world now talks about: real-world relevance. These are the prime growth factors that make these new sectors that much more investable. A Surge in Token Launches and Future Market Dynamics A significant event in Q1 2025 was the arrival of large, VC-backed tokens in the crypto markets. These token launches brought with them nearly $20 billion in value not yet available to investors. They launched, in lost value, a not-so-happy $20 billion wave of change for the crypto space—if, indeed, such under-the-surface value waves can be counted as happy (or, for that matter, as waves at all). A broad examination of the space yields two conclusions concerning the impact on market dynamics: 1) The wave of not-so-happy $20 billion changes has two major effects that traders might actually care about. 2) These effects, as far as I can tell, are either going to be good for traders or good for the markets, in the long run. The influx of new tokens may induce short-term volatility, but it also demonstrates the crypto market’s advancing maturity. When large-cap tokens enter the market, it’s a sign of increasing institutional interest and further diversification of the crypto asset space that now extends well beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The crypto asset market is now well over $1 trillion. “New market segments are emerging, and they are doing so with innovative solutions and unique value propositions that they are bringing to users,” says Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael. Yet, the timing of these token launches with the softness of the market right now has to make you wonder about the potential long-term impacts on venture capital. The reason I say this is because as more tokens enter the market and start unlocking value, the price of these tokens is so uncertain right now that the potential for big price fluctuations seems pretty high. And when the current crop of tokens starts to unfold its attribution of value, how will that fare in the context of price stability? Outlook for Crypto Venture Capital: A Cautious but Optimistic Future When considering the future, one may expect that venture capital investment in the crypto space will likely face a period of caution, at least in the short term. In a recent downturn, not only have crypto prices fallen but the number of new tokens flooding the market has also increased. Could these developments lead to a pullback in VC investment in the crypto space? While venture capitalists appear to be taking a more cautious approach to their crypto investments for now, assessing market stability and adjusting their strategies accordingly, the underlying trends in the crypto market seem healthy. Projects that provide concrete value and bolster infrastructure are the ones that investors will likely continue to dump money into, but don’t mistake the lack of funding for projects that are still in the experimental stage as a death knell for innovation. While value and real-world infrastructure enable blockchain’s buildout alongside other transformative technologies, there’s fertile ground for innovative ideas to push the crypto space forward. To sum up, even though the softness of the current crypto market may have short-term implications for venture capital flowing into this space, it is not because investors have lost faith in the long-term prospects for blockchain technology and its integration into the real world. Quite the opposite: We are witnessing a few disruptive years in the tech market, and crypto still seems to be a key player in that dance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007691,https://nulltx.com/?p=147778,1743979762,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Crypto Whale 0x373 Shifts from Meme Coin Hype to DeFi Potential with Major PENDLE Investment,https://nulltx.com/crypto-whale-0x373-shifts-from-meme-coin-hype-to-defi-potential-with-major-pendle-investment/,"One of the crypto world’s most influential whales, identified as 0x373, has shifted strategy. This whale , which has been under scrutiny for its huge holdings and trading activity, now appears to be withdrawing from the wild meme-coin market and parking its assets in the far-more-stable DeFi space. Recent trades indicate that 0x373 has stopped riding the meme coin hype wave and is now making a serious bet on DeFi assets, with purchases of $PENDLE. In an intriguing move, the whale unloaded a significant portion of its $PEPE holdings, which had been a staple in its portfolio. Specifically, the whale dumped 196.1 billion PEPE tokens, amounting to $1.3 million; it swapped these for 720.6 WETH (Wrapped Ether). This swap, priced at an average of $0.000006641 per PEPE, is the latest in a series of moves that show the whale growing more and more confident in the future potential of DeFi projects. A Shift Toward PENDLE: The Whale’s Bold Move Instead of keeping its freshly obtained ETH, the whale made yet another audacious move—using a hefty chunk of its WETH reserves to snap up 397,192 $PENDLE tokens. At $3.08 a pop, this buy totaled nearly $1.22 million. This shows the whale’s hand; it’s betting on the future of PENDLE, which as a decentralized finance token seems to be carving out an interesting niche. The token, it should be said, has been getting attention lately for its purported asset tokenization and yield optimization solutions. For three consecutive days, 0x373 has made significant trades that suggest he is becoming more and more convinced about PENDLE’s potential. The whale first traded PEPE, selling 261.2 billion of the assets for 1,060 WETH, which was worth approximately $1.94 million. Then, in a move that appears to directly counteract his first trade, the whale purchased 607,863 PENDLE tokens using 1,016 WETH. That amount was worth roughly $1.86 million, and he bought the tokens at an average price of $3.066 each. Even after these large trades, the whale’s investment in meme coins remains large. It holds a staggering 2.597 trillion PEPE tokens, worth about $18.05 million. On that investment, it’s made a profit of roughly $28.41 million, for a total return of around 5.25 times what it originally put into PEPE. A major crypto whale, 0x373, seems to be making a bold shift in strategy—trading meme coin hype for DeFi potential. Over the past 13 hours, the whale sold 196.1B $PEPE ($1.3M) and swapped it for 720.6 WETH, averaging $0.000006641 per PEPE. But it didn’t stop there. pic.twitter.com/iYoAuJahLg — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 4, 2025 So, why did this whale recently swap some PEPE for PENDLE? One potential reason is that it reflects a shift in what sorts of assets the whale is holding. Compared to PEPE and other meme coins, PENDLE is a much more serious investment. The Bigger Picture: A Changing Crypto Landscape Whale’s movement from meme coins to DeFi reflects broader crypto market shifts. Despite meme coins like $PEPE captivating the public and giving people a feel for the potential scale of growth in the crypto market, we at Decrypt have begun to see some signs, or signals, that investors are questioning the future sustainability of these kinds of coins. Their value almost seems to sink or swim with the current price of ether. Conversely, decentralized finance schemes such as $PENDLE are gaining momentum for their real-world applications and their possible long-term value creation. PENDLE, which aims to focus on the tokenization of yield-bearing assets, has caught the attention of investors hunting for innovative ways to unlock liquidity and optimize returns in DeFi. This is a space where you must truly look beneath the surface, as much of what is going on in DeFi outside of PENDLE may appear pond scummy. And yet, the pivot toward DeFi in this crypto winter is also a pivot toward looking for value beyond the narrative we were fed in 2021. Whale 0x373 moving to PENDLE could be a sign of something very different from what we’ve seen before in this address. For 0x373, the apparent move from CRV to PENDLE could be an effort to maximize yield and liquidity and a step toward future-proofing these assets. DeFi has become a key pillar of the crypto ecosystem, and projects like PENDLE are positioned well within this space. If the address is holding these assets for the long term, it could signal something very different in terms of strategy for this whale. Looking Ahead: More PEPE-to-PENDLE Swaps? Considering the recent maneuvers by the whale—and its ongoing shift in strategy—it seems pretty likely we’ll be seeing more PEPE-to-PENDLE swaps in the days ahead. The huge amount of $PEPE still held by the whale—along with some pretty decent profits on that asset—suggests that the whale is still using PEPE as a key part of its overall portfolio, rebalancing into PENDLE and other DeFi plays as part of a larger emerging strategy. For the broader crypto community, the recent actions of 0x373 serve as a reminder that the biggest and most influential players in crypto are always adjusting their strategies to meet the market. While many investors find allure in meme coins, the move towards DeFi reflects a broader trend within crypto towards assets that have much more long-term utility and growth potential. As DeFi projects like PENDLE continue to mature, the space could see much more interest from large investors looking for innovative ways to use crypto in the real world. In summary, 0x373’s shift in strategy from meme coins to DeFi assets like PENDLE demonstrates the crypto market’s shifting nature. As the industry has grown up, investors who put their money where their mouth is have started focusing more on the types of projects that have actual long-term potential and real-world applications. Those of us who are trading and investing in DeFi may be trailblazing the next big movement within the crypto ecosystem. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007848,https://nulltx.com/?p=147779,1743980043,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Regains Lead as DEX Volume Leader in March, Surpassing Solana",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-regains-lead-as-dex-volume-leader-in-march-surpassing-solana/,"In a remarkable turnaround, Ethereum has taken back its place as the dominant blockchain in trading volume for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). After Solana had spent several months in first place, Ethereum has now reclaimed the top position it last held in September 2024. Ethereum was not only resilient during the past few months, but it also surged dramatically in trading activity this March 2025—reaching trading volume levels it had not seen in approximately six months. That surge, on top of its already solid position in trading on DEXs, now makes Ethereum the leading blockchain for DeFi traders. Ethereum’s Strong Comeback: Dominating the DEX Market The most recent data shows that total DEX volume in March reached an impressive $245.8 billion. Ethereum accounted for 26.3% of this total, putting it ahead of Solana and atop the leaderboard among blockchains. Solana, which had seen a surge in DEX trading activity thanks to its high-speed, low-cost transactions, held 21.4% of the total market share in March, marking a noticeable decline in its fortunes as Ethereum surged on the volume front. This shift is the latest indication that confidence is returning to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, which continues to attract both retail and institutional traders despite competition from other blockchains. Ethereum returns as DEX volume leader in March @ethereum reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for DEX trading volume, surpassing @solana for the first time since September. The total DEX volume in March amounted to $245.8 billion, with @ethereum capturing 26.3% and… pic.twitter.com/bnxFEyZ88x — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 3, 2025 Several factors have brought Ethereum back to life. First, it is underpinned by continued active development that has, among other things, made Ethereum more scalable. Second, it has maintained a dominant position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It is where you go if you want to do anything on a dApp or a protocol in the DeFi space. It’s foundation seems to be unshakeable. In recent months, Ethereum has also profited from the blossoming popularity of layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum. These protocols, which operate on top of Ethereum, offer users faster and cheaper transactions while keeping the security promises that Ethereum itself makes. That assurance is crucial since layer-2s will inevitably process plenty of transactions for protocols that could be described as dubious. Still, they are using Ethereum’s base layer for assurance, and they had better not have a security incident. Solana’s Decline: What Does it Mean for the Future? Ethereum may still have the upper hand in terms of total value locked, but it and its layer-2 solutions still have plenty of room for improvement if they want to stay ahead of blockchain monoliths like Solana. While Solana is now back on an upswing, its trading volume in the DeFi space has dipped recently. This has happened in tandem with a spike in DEX trading on layer-2 solutions like Optimism, as well as on Ethereum itself. This decline could have several causes. One possible reason is the continued upheaval in the cryptocurrency market, which has prompted some investors to move their assets into more stable, established ecosystems like Ethereum. Solana had a tough 2023, marked by serious network outages and some security problems, which makes you wonder if those couldn’t have also contributed to a user confidence hit that Solana might have suffered as a result. Solana is picking itself back up in 2023, however. Its technological fortress is tighter and more robust than ever. Its user base should continue to grow, driven by an economic model that looks increasingly sound and equitable. Possibly on the rise is the increasing adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions. As Ethereum scales and becomes a solution more accessible to a wider audience, its traders and developers may find the speed advantage of Solana’s transactions not such an impressive selling point anymore. Part of the reason for this is that the downturn in DeFi seems to have had little impact on Ethereum, whose robust developer community and ecosystem give it a unique DeFi advantage. Ethereum’s Competitive Edge: What’s Next for DEX Volume? The regained command of Ethereum’s for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume clearly indicates that the decentralized finance (DeFi) market is maturing. Helmed by Ethereum, the DeFi market continues to confidently sail forward. The set of protocols and overall ecosystem have cemented Ethereum’s lead in this newly emerging asset class. Presently, these DeFi assets and the protocols underpinning them exist almost entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Even with the avalanche of alternatives that have surfaced over the past 15 months, the Ethereum network remains the primary venue for DeFi. The Development of Decentralized Assets The alternative decentralized finance (DeFi) asset class is in the midst of development. The development of decentralized applications (dApps) sits on top of smart contracts, the veiled promises of which are now being fulfilled. With a firm foundation in Ethereum smart contracts, the Elrond (EGLD) blockchain ecosystem and its native decentralized finance assets (in the form of financial contracts) signal the maturation of both the dApp and decentralized asset classes. Merging Ethereum with layer-2 solutions and other scalability improvements makes it even more appealing. With these updates, the Ethereum network can take on a lot more users without its transaction speeds or costs being affected. This improved scalability, along with the shift to proof of stake, means that, in the long run, Ethereum seems more likely to maintain its DeFi dominant position than it does to fall behind newer blockchains like Solana, which also seem to have robustDeFi ecosystems. Moreover, Ethereum has a robust developer community that lets it be a persistent best-in-class solution in the NFT space. This nearly unrivaled presence in another crypto sector serves to strengthen Ethereum’s network effects. These network effects extend well beyond just DEXs to a huge variety of crypto applications, including NFTs, gaming, and much more. This unparalleled wide-ranging appeal among developers and users permits Ethereum to maintain its leading position as the best blockchain for DeFi and other “crypto cases.” Conclusion: Ethereum’s Path Forward in a Competitive Market Ethereum’s dominance in the DEX space hasn’t just returned; it has renewed itself with strength and resiliency in the face of increasing competition from other blockchains like Solana. The return to dominance was marked by an almost unparalleled foundation in decentralized finance, something that has Ethereum scaling over the horizon as it maintains a leadership position in the DeFi ecosystem. Even while Solana and other blockchain platforms keep innovating and successfully drawing in users, the Ethereum blockchain’s extensive ecosystem, network effects, and burgeoning solutions in scalability give it the competitive edge needed to stay on top. As the Ethereum blockchain continues its evolution, the solidity of its position as the leading decentralized exchange trading platform seems more probable than not, and it appears to be the most likely choice for DeFi traders and developers for the next several years.

Meanwhile, Circle has initiated its second attempt at an IPO as the USDC issuer filed its prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The stablecoin issuer aims for a $5 billion valuation as it navigates a volatile market fraught with regulatory challenges. Meanwhile, Shibarium hit 1 billion transactions within two years of launch, and the Trump family is continuing to expand its footprint in the crypto ecosystem. Let’s recap some of the biggest stories from the week. Bitcoin Bitcoin proxies Strategy, Metaplanet, and Boyaa could be ready to break out and head significantly higher. Strategy recently made a $1.92 billion BTC purchase, giving it an assailable lead over other Bitcoin-oriented companies. Meanwhile, Boyaa has quietly established itself as the biggest holder of BTC in Asia and Metaplanet has received a lease of life after following in Strategy’s footsteps. DeFi The Graphite Network launched its Market Staking Program on March 31, 2025. The program is an innovative model that rewards active traders rather than passive holders, reflecting a significant change ongoing in the DeFi space where active staking has overtaken passive staking as the preferred approach for traders. Following “Smart Money” could be one of the biggest ways newbie crypto traders and investors can avoid the pitfalls that come with participating in a highly volatile market. The Smart Money Concept is based on the idea that some well-informed investors make more strategic decisions. Technology This week, the Shibarium blockchain completed a billion transactions. The Layer2 blockchain for the Shiba Inu ecosystem reached the milestone just 18 years after launch, highlighting its growing adoption and robust performance. It also highlights the SHIB ecosystem’s utility and supports the token’s burn mechanism, driving the token’s long-term value.

The crash followed a violent sell-off in U.S. equities tied directly to President Donald Trump’s new global tariffs, which kicked in just days ago. Investors are now watching a pileup of pain unfold in both crypto and traditional markets at the same time, as volatility takes over and financial systems crack under pressure. Bitcoin fell below the $78,000 mark on Sunday night, losing nearly 5% of its value in 24 hours and landing at $77,673, according to data from CoinGecko. The OG crypto had held above $80,000 almost all year—besides a few quick dips—but the new drop slams it 39% below its January all-time high. Liquidations wreck crypto after overnight collapse The fall in Bitcoin wasn’t isolated. Ethereum has dropped below $1,600 and Solana has plunged by 12% overnight, while XRP dropped by 8.6%, triggering panic across exchanges. The crash wiped out leveraged long positions and kicked off forced sell-offs. In just 24 hours, Bitcoin alone saw over $181 million in long liquidations, with CoinGlass data showing that Ether also got hit with $188 million in forced closures. Traders who were betting on upward moves got wiped when prices turned the other direction fast. While crypto burned, the pressure on U.S. stock futures increased too. On Sunday evening, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,531 points, a 4% decline, ahead of what looks like another brutal Monday session. S&P 500 futures were also down 4%, and the Nasdaq-100 mirrored the drop with its own 4% loss. All of this follows two days of absolute chaos on Wall Street as the White House confirmed the tariffs would stay in place, no matter the fallout. Stock heat map. Source: TradingView The collapse at the end of last week wasn’t a blip—it was historic. The Dow Jones saw back-to-back losses of over 1,500 points for the first time in U.S. history, including a 2,231-point plunge on Friday. The S&P 500 had its worst day since the COVID meltdown in March 2020, falling 6% in a single day. It lost 10% over two days, which dragged it more than 17% below its February peak and close to full bear market territory. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite did enter a bear market on Friday, dropping 22% from its high after losing nearly 6% on both Thursday and Friday. Investors hoping for good news over the weekend got none. There were no signs of a pullback or delay on the tariff rules, which are scheduled to take full effect by April 9. Instead, the administration doubled down on the aggressive trade policy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that position in an interview with CBS News on Sunday, saying, “The tariffs are coming… They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks.” He offered no flexibility and made no promise of relief, even after the historic collapse in financial markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on NBC News, where he revealed that more than 50 countries had already approached the U.S. government to discuss the new trade measures. But Bessent wasn’t optimistic. He warned, “They’ve been bad actors for a long time, and it’s not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” In other words, negotiations are happening, but nothing’s changing anytime soon. Right now, the markets are reacting exactly how you’d expect—like a building collapsing in slow motion. Every trader who was holding high hopes for a quick rebound just got hit with the reality that Washington isn’t backing down. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

How’d he get there?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/blackrocks-larry-fink-in-trumps-inner-circle/,"Larry Fink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock, is now locked in with Donald Trump, sitting inside the president’s tight inner circle after years of tension with the Republican party. On March 17, Larry met with Trump at the White House after delivering a massive win for the administration—BlackRock’s new deal to buy ports on both ends of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong company. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Trump brought in Elon Musk , Vice President JD Vance, and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz for the closed-door discussion that ran over an hour. The topics included the U.S. economy, financial markets, and the port deal that has already triggered backlash from Beijing. The canal deal is about power. China says the transaction would restrict trade and turn the Panama Canal into a U.S. political weapon. Trump sees it as a move to weaken Chinese control over global infrastructure. He’s told people he now wants Larry at Mar-a-Lago this month, hosting him alongside top investors. The White House put out a statement through Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, saying, “The President always appreciates efforts from American companies to advance our nation’s national security interests.” President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Laurence “Larry” Fink at the White House. Credits: Getty Images Larry got here by playing every side, every time Larry didn’t start in Trump’s corner. He backed Barack Obama in 2012. He donated to Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, he went to a fundraiser for Joe Biden, and his top lieutenants joined Biden’s White House. But that never stopped him from also throwing money at Republicans. During Trump’s first term, Larry advised the administration while BlackRock handled some of Trump’s personal investments. The relationship goes back to the early 2000s. “Larry has a rare combination of commercial, political and public-policy savvy,” said Hank Paulson, who was Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush. Still, that didn’t protect him when the GOP came for him. Around 2017, Larry started pushing ESG investing—environmental, social, and corporate governance. It was the same time the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements were entering boardrooms. Larry told CEOs in a 2020 letter that “climate risk is investment risk” and warned BlackRock might vote against companies that didn’t improve their climate disclosures. That pissed off Republicans. Lawsuits followed. Red states dragged BlackRock into court, accusing the firm of putting politics above profits. Congress opened investigations. The firm tripled spending on Larry’s personal security. By 2022, it was obvious the firm’s GOP connections weren’t strong enough. Larry toned down his public ESG talk. Privately, he met with Republican lawmakers and softened his stance. Patrick McHenry, a Republican who used to chair the House Financial Services Committee, said, “I look at Larry having an adeptness to pivot when he needs to. I think it’s benefited the company, and certainly benefited his standing among policymakers that are running Washington right now.” That pivot helped, but the real shift came when BlackRock started making giant moves in private markets. In 2023, the firm paid $12.5 billion for Global Infrastructure Partners, a company that controls airports, railroads, and data centers. Then it dropped $12 billion on HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit firm. These were BlackRock’s biggest deals in 15 years. They gave Larry the power to do exactly what Trump wanted: take control of the Panama Canal ports from CK Hutchison, a Chinese-linked company. “The ports deal is something they wouldn’t have been able to do prior to the acquisition,” said Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s former Treasury Secretary. Even though Trump just gave him a front-row seat, not everyone in the GOP is ready to forgive. Will Hild, executive director of the anti-BlackRock group Consumers’ Research, isn’t backing down. The group is backed by Leonard Leo, co-chair of the Federalist Society, and it’s gunning for BlackRock over ESG. “We are by no means at all done with BlackRock,” Hild said. Despite the critics, Larry keeps pulling strings. During the March 17 meeting, he and Musk talked about a deal between xAI and BlackRock’s new AI fund. That puts Larry right where he wants to be—next to Trump, at the intersection of money, tech, and national security.

Despite the turmoil in the traditional markets, the flagship cryptocurrency has held firm above $80,000, with the stability highlighting its potential as a safe haven asset. BTC is currently down almost 1%, trading at $82,836 and holding above $80,000 despite ETF outflows, growing trade tensions, and concerns about delayed rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Firm Despite Heightened Volatility Bitcoin (BTC) remained above $80,000 on Friday and Saturday despite broader market turmoil and selling pressure. However, demand has waned as fears of a full-blown trade war escalate, along with risks of a recession and a delayed rate cut decision by the Federal Reserve. Markets also witnessed BTC decoupling from the US equity markets and outperforming gold, signaling a significant shift in market dynamics. Market intelligence platform Santiment stated, “Social media has been buzzing with mentions of crypto’s ‘decoupling’ from stock markets, according to data from X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and BitcoinTalk. Following the S&P 500‘s -10.5% combined losses on Thursday and Friday alone, traders are optimistic that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are fairly insulated from the US & China tariffs that have rocked global economies.” It also said that crypto becoming less reliant on the stock market is a promising sign. “If the crypto markets are indeed becoming less and less reliant on stock markets, this would be an encouraging sign. Historically, most of the cryptocurrency’s biggest bull cycles have come when there is zero (neither a negative nor positive) correlation between the two sectors.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Outflows Despite Bitcoin’s relative stability, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered considerable outflows, signaling investor caution and indicating that the rally may lack strong investor backing. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also threw another curveball for the markets, suggesting a potential delay to Fed rate cuts. According to data from Farside Investors, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) registered net outflows of $44.6 million, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) registered net outflows of $35.5 million. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) registered net outflows of $24.1 million, and ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw net outflows of $22.2 million. However, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) registered net inflows. As a result, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market registered net total outflows of $165 million, ending a two-week inflow streak. Fed Issues Stagflation Warning Bitcoin and altcoins could come under renewed pressure after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned President Donald Trump’s tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slow growth. Powell said on Friday, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.” High inflation and high unemployment can lead to stagflation, which could become difficult to manage. This is because measures taken to fix one issue, like cutting interest rates to boost growth, could worsen the other issue and vice versa. Powell also said he was in no hurry to cut interest rates as inflation remained high, a stance supported by other officials like Raphael Bostic and Adriana Kugler. However, President Donald Trump urged Powell to cut interest rates. According to market experts, a more hawkish Fed could negatively impact Bitcoin, altcoin, and stock prices. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $80,000 as the weekend draws to a close. BTC’s relative stability comes despite the market turmoil and highlights its potential as a safe haven asset. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, known to be positively correlated to Bitcoin, dropped over 11% since President Trump’s announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating global trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, stated, “The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown impressive resilience. After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists.” However, analysts have not ruled out sharp downside volatility in the short term, especially as the “Treasury market basis trade” faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices. BTC traded in bearish territory over the previous weekend, dropping over 3% on Friday, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC fell below the 20-day SMA on Saturday and settled at $82,704. The price registered a marginal decline on Sunday, settling at $82,404. BTC faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $85,152. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, BTC lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3%, slipping below $85,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,525. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Thursday despite significant selling pressure, rising almost 1% and settling at $83,199. The price continued its upward trajectory on Friday, registering an increase of 0.76% and settling at $83,828. However, it lost momentum over the weekend and registered a marginal decline on Saturday, dropping to $83,423. The current session sees BTC down almost 1% as sellers look to drive it below $80,000. However, BTC has not ceded ground to the bears and has held firm above this level. If buyers regain control, BTC could move past $85,000 and push toward $90,000.

In a scathing critique that has renewed allegations about one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, ZachXBT says Coinbase’s culture is defined by a “lack of transparency.” On social media, ZachXBT expressed frustration : “You have locked me out of my account twice in the last month with no reason given (again today). You had customer data leaks you haven’t transparently announced (lead to thefts).” While he acknowledged that the platform offers a decent annual percentage return on stablecoins, he ultimately stated that he could not recommend Coinbase as an exchange to others. ZachXBT ignites fresh backlash over Coinbase’s troubled history with user trust and security ZachXBT comments have sparked controversy about Coinbase’s customer data handling, practices, and support. While the company largely promotes itself as the “future of money” and a paragon of regulatory compliance in the crypto space, incidents of this nature do little to enhance its reputation — especially among more experienced users. Coinbase portrays itself as a secure, transparent, and regulated entry point to crypto —a message that is easy to sell to institutional investors and new entrants. Its initial public offering in 2021 was a watershed moment for the crypto industry. But the company’s history tells a more complex tale for long-time users and crypto veterans. That same year, Coinbase was criticized after thousands of users reported being locked out of their accounts, some for months, without any resolution. The New York Times explained how so many of these customers could not connect with support when they were most vulnerable, with catastrophic loss as the prices swung violently. A similar bug in Coinbase’s SMS account recovery process later that same year allowed hackers to bypass two-factor authentication to drain user wallets. Coinbase ultimately reimbursed some victims, but critics pointed out that the company was slow to communicate and did not take the breach seriously enough. Coinbase faces increasing regulatory pressure while users express growing discontent Coinbase is not new to controversy. In 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the company for operating an unregistered securities exchange. Whereas Coinbase is battling the suit, positioning itself as a pioneer of regulatory compliance, users like ZachXBT wonder whether the company has also displayed the same diligence in protecting and communicating with its customers. Coinbase has pushed back legally — demanding the creation of new regulatory frameworks for the industry — but the lawsuit has increased pressure on the company to demonstrate its commitment to compliance, not only with regulators but with users. ZachXBT’s remarks also reflect a widespread mistrust of the status quo in the crypto world, many of whom gravitate toward decentralized platforms in search of greater control, transparency, and reliability. Condemnation like ZachXBT’s carries particular weight in the crypto world. Famed for carefully tracking a range of fraudulent schemes and aiding users in retrieving lost funds, he is a widely regarded guardian of crypto ethics — one whose critiques spur wider action or awareness.

The British carmaker said on Saturday that the pause is a short-term action as it works to address the new trading terms with its business partners. The automotive company added that the pause on shipments will become effective this month. “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.” ~ Jaguar Land Rover Automotive. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said that the US is an important market for its luxury cars and brands. According to fact sheets from the UK Department for Business and Trade, cars are the top exported goods from the UK to the US. Car exports in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2024 totaled a staggering £8.3 billion. Other carmakers might pause US exports too Analysts predict that other carmakers will follow the steps of JLR and pause US exports. The imposed tariffs have added more pressure on the automotive industry in Britain. The demand for British-made cars has decreased domestically and in Europe, while sales in China have been on the decline. Furthermore, British carmakers are lagging in the electric vehicles race as factories are required to overhaul existing machinery. University of Birmingham Professor David Bailey told The Guardian that “much of UK auto is already operating well below capacity, and the tariffs will be a further hit for a struggling industry.” He said that “production cuts and job losses are likely,” and he believes that the number of jobs at risk due to the US’s tariffs is underestimated. Bailey thinks that JLR will continue to struggle unless it creates a US-based automotive factory. According to Reuters, German car makers Audi, Mercedes, and BMW are considering expanding their operations in the United States. Tariffs are pressuring international carmakers to move operations to the US, bringing Trump’s vision to reality. British carmakers have taken measures to reduce the impact of US tariffs by increasing exports and building stockpiles in the States months prior to their implementation. According to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car exports to the US in December, January, and February surged by 38.5%, 12.4%, and 34.6%, respectively. On April 3rd, the United Stated implemented a 25% tariff on imported vehicles. This tariff is applicable to vehicles from all countries including those covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Dogecoin (DOGE) is sitting on a fragile $0.16 support after a 16% drop, and XRP is caught in a utility-versus-scarcity debate that could shape its long-term trajectory. But while questions linger around these assets, BlockDAG is answering with action. The launch of BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 is more than just a technical release—it’s a milestone that signals readiness and long-term potential. With real tools, real users, and real utility already in place, the project is turning heads in all the right ways. As momentum builds, many are beginning to see BlockDAG as one of the clearest answers to the question: Which crypto coin has true growth potential right now? BlockDAG Beta Testnet Turns Plans into Performance BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 is officially live, and it’s already drawing attention for how much it offers right out of the gate. This isn’t just a behind-the-scenes milestone for developers—it’s an open door to a functioning ecosystem. Users can now explore working decentralized apps, launch tokens or NFTs through a no-code builder, and navigate the updated explorer with ease. Built for wide accessibility, not just developers, this environment gives a real look at how BlockDAG aims to scale. What separates BlockDAG from other emerging platforms is its ability to shift from talk to action. The no-code creation tool allows anyone—even non-developers—to build new digital assets. Every token or NFT created will rely on BDAG to function, directly tying the platform’s growth to real-world usage. That’s the kind of utility that creates ongoing demand—not just temporary hype. The rollout also comes with serious user incentives. BlockDAG has allocated $60,000 in BDAG rewards for testnet participation, with the most active wallets eligible for $2,000 each. It’s a smart strategy that promotes hands-on interaction and encourages community building from day one. The numbers further support its rising momentum. BlockDAG has raised more than $212 million in presale funding and sold over 19.1 billion coins. Now in batch 27, BDAG trades at $0.0248—a jump of 2,380% from its initial batch price of $0.001. As other networks stall or debate direction, BlockDAG is clearly pushing ahead with measurable, meaningful progress. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Today Pressures $0.16 Support After 16% Weekly Drop Dogecoin is currently hovering at the $0.16 support level after falling 16% over the past week. This price point is being closely watched, as a bounce could trigger a short-term recovery toward $0.20 or even $0.25. But a dip below this level risks sparking broader selloffs that may drag DOGE closer to $0.10—or possibly $0.06 in a worst-case slide. Historically, similar support levels have attracted new buyers, helping DOGE rebound. While that’s still possible, broader market conditions remain mixed, and the lack of a fresh catalyst leaves DOGE in a vulnerable position. Traders are staying alert, as the next move could shape sentiment for weeks to come. XRP Price Outlook Faces New Utility vs. Velocity Debate The conversation around XRP is heating up again, this time focusing on how utility may or may not drive long-term value. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently suggested that a higher price could actually make XRP more efficient by reducing the amount needed for large transactions. That’s sparked renewed optimism about XRP’s role in major financial flows. However, there’s growing concern from within the XRP community about token velocity. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) driving fast, high-frequency transactions, some worry this activity could dilute long-term price growth by affecting scarcity. Ideas like automated market makers (AMMs) to control circulating supply are gaining traction, especially as institutions show greater interest. The XRP price outlook now depends on whether Ripple can balance speed and usefulness with scarcity and long-term value. It’s a nuanced path—but one that, if managed well, could open up broader adoption and price stability. Final Takeaway Dogecoin’s recent 16% dip puts it in a critical position, with $0.16 acting as a make-or-break level. XRP’s future is tied to how its utility evolves, with debates over speed and scarcity continuing to shape community expectations. But while both face pressing questions, BlockDAG is focused on solutions—and delivering them. With its Beta Testnet V1 now live, BlockDAG is proving it can build, launch, and grow—fast. Real dApps, a user-friendly no-code asset builder, and generous participation rewards show the team’s commitment to usability and scalability. Backed by $212 million in presale funding and a 2,380% price increase since batch 1, BlockDAG is turning momentum into progress. For those looking ahead and asking which crypto coin offers the clearest path to real-world growth—BlockDAG is stepping forward with results.

The Impact of CEX Listings on BlockDAG—Updates on Solaxy & SHIB’s 15M Burn,https://thecoinrise.com/will-bdag-reach-20-the-impact-of-cex-listings-on-blockdag-updates-on-solaxy-shibs-15m-burn/,"When a token lands on ten major exchanges consecutively, what’s the result? BlockDAG is set to find out, while developments in Solaxy and Shiba Inu’s market activities also draw attention. Solaxy has recently surpassed $29 million in funding, marking the launch of Solana’s first Layer-2 with active staking. In contrast, SHIB has eliminated over 819 million tokens, yet stagnant total value locked and a 3% price dip have stirred concerns. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under the spotlight, not merely for its growth but for its escalating presence. As it prepares to join 10 CEXs, each new addition contributes like a chain reaction: enhancing liquidity, attracting new participants, and supporting a higher baseline price for BDAG. This dynamic has led analysts to point to BDAG as a top crypto pick, with potential to hit $20. BlockDAG’s Exchange Listings May Significantly Drive Its Price BlockDAG continues its upward trajectory. With more than $212 million collected and 19.1 billion BDAG coins distributed in its ongoing presale, the momentum is tangible. From an initial price of $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, the presale has shown a 2,380% gain for early backers. The fast-paced presale, together with the live beta testnet featuring airdrops and weekly incentives, adds further excitement. The core of BlockDAG’s strategy lies in its plan to be listed on 10 centralized exchanges. Each listing boosts liquidity, attracts new participants, and reinforces the coin’s price stability. The initial CEX listing ignites the process. By the tenth, BDAG could transform significantly. As liquidity builds and recognition increases, analysts are beginning to forecast a long-term price of $20. Each listing brings additional benefits—increased wallets, more exposure, and higher volume. These aren’t mere events; they amplify BlockDAG’s value. They do more than maintain its position; they propel it forward. As visibility on each platform grows, this is why many recognize BlockDAG as a top crypto choice today. By the end of the final listing, the price baseline is expected to shift significantly. If BDAG continues to accumulate listings, its value could not only rise but accelerate. Watching from the sidelines might mean seeing the price from an elevated viewpoint. That’s why grabbing BDAG now, while it’s below $0.03, is advised. Solaxy Update: $29M Achieved and Upcoming Layer-2 Launch The recent developments in Solaxy show that it has successfully amassed over $29 million in its presale, establishing itself as the pioneering Layer-2 solution for Solana. This rollout aims to address congestion issues with a rollup-based structure, ensuring smooth operations during high-traffic periods such as meme coin transactions. Solaxy further enhances its offering by linking Ethereum’s liquidity to Solana’s speed via the multi-chain SOLX token, providing a hybrid advantage to users. Notably, staking is already operational in this presale phase, with SOLX holders potentially earning up to 140% APY. However, this rate may decrease as participation increases. With an imminent price increase in the presale, this update serves as a crucial alert for potential participants. Post-launch, SOLX will be available on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, with stakers eligible to claim their tokens a week after. Shiba Inu’s Market Analysis Post-819 Million Token Burn Despite the burning of 819 million tokens, Shiba Inu’s market price is under strain. The recent destruction of 15 million SHIB did not prevent a 60% reduction in the overall burn rate, accompanied by a 3% decline in SHIB’s price. This dip corresponds with a lack of movement in Shibarium’s total value locked, leading to doubts about the effectiveness of the burn strategy in boosting prices shortly. Market patterns have shown fluctuations with occurrences of both death and golden crosses, indicating uncertainty. SHIB currently trades at approximately $0.00001242, just under a significant resistance level. Opinions among analysts about SHIB’s future price are mixed, predicting potential volatility. The focal point now is whether increased demand will emerge as the token burning persists and Shibarium gains broader acceptance. Takeaway The latest updates from Solaxy indicate a robust presale and readiness to expand Solana through its Layer-2 solution. In contrast, Shiba Inu’s price forecast remains tentative, with ongoing token burns yet to significantly impact the market due to subdued activity on Shibarium. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is creating substantial momentum. With over $212 million gathered in crypto presale and plans for listings on 10 key exchanges, the cascading effect of these listings is beginning to unfold. Each new listing escalates BlockDAG’s visibility, trading activity, and price prospects. Analysts endorsing it as a prime crypto purchase today are not just swayed by enthusiasm but recognize the solid technology underlying BDAG’s growth. As the listing process completes, the $20 price target could soon be a reality, making it a prudent purchase while still in the early stages.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Matthew Sigel – the head of digital assets research at VanEck – says that President Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs will accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a tool for the settlement of energy trade. “China and Russia were recently revealed to be settling some energy transactions using Bitcoin and other digital assets – just as we anticipated. Bolivia also announced plans in March to import energy using crypto. And in Europe, French utility EDF (?Électricité de France) will explore using surplus electricity – currently exported to Germany – to mine Bitcoin. These developments highlight how digital assets are evolving from speculative instruments into tools for energy trade and monetary realignment. In that context, the latest tariffs aren’t just an economic story – they may be an accelerant for Bitcoin’s role in the emerging multi-polar order.” Sigel goes on to say that traders should keep an eye on the policies of the US Federal Reserve, China and the EU to better gauge the crypto markets. He also notes the relevance of the strength of the US dollar and BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. According to Sigel, if China and the EU were to retaliate to Trump’s tariffs and move away from the US dollar, it could boost use cases for digital assets. “Investors should watch the evolving path of Fed policy: dovish shifts in rate expectations and rising liquidity are historically positive for Bitcoin. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is another key gauge – any signs of dollar weakness may support the Bitcoin-as-hedge narrative. Bitcoin ETF flows and on-chain activity also matter: despite volatility, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs are still net positive by ~$600 million year-to-date, with renewed inflows seen in late March. And finally, any retaliatory steps from China or the EU – especially ones that bypass dollar-based systems – could accelerate the strategic case for crypto.” Last week, Trump signed an executive order that imposes sweeping or reciprocal tariffs on a long list of nations, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. The announcement rocked global markets, causing a sharp dip in digital asset and stock prices.

Meanwhile, Cardano sees significant sales, with 120 million ADA sold in just two days. Amid these market shifts, one platform is making strides by equipping creators with the tools they need, rather than just promises. BlockDAG’s recent beta testnet release introduces a no-code token and NFT creation tool. This tool, akin to a Shopify for crypto, enables users to design and launch Web3 projects effortlessly. The outcome? An increase in token and NFT launches, enhancing reasons to engage with BDAG. For those eyeing the crypto market, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers tangible utility and compelling reasons to pay attention. BlockDAG’s No-Code Tool Makes Web3 Accessible to All BlockDAG’s recent initiative goes beyond enhancing blockchain speed or security – it democratizes access. With the new no-code tool for creating tokens and NFTs now available on the beta testnet, anyone can engage in Web3 development without any coding expertise. This user-friendly approach transforms the platform into a hub for creators who might feel overwhelmed by the technical demands of networks like Ethereum or Solana. This ease of use is significant. Every new token or NFT made with BlockDAG’s tool runs on BDAG, creating more transactions and increasing demand for the coin – a virtuous cycle of utility. As the testnet progresses and the mainnet launch nears, BlockDAG stands out as a crypto worth watching, with its value clearly linked to its usage. The beta testnet, launched on March 28, also features improved blockchain explorers, faucet access, and a dashboard tailored for creators. Additionally, it offers a $60,000 reward pool, with $2,000 in BDAG allocated to the top 10 most active users. Already, over 110,000 participants are testing the network, helping refine its performance ahead of the mainnet launch. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale is in its 27th batch, with BDAG priced at $0.0248. To date, over 18.8 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $212 million. BlockDAG is rapidly gaining traction among both users and developers, making it a noteworthy crypto to consider. Shiba Inu Struggles Amid Network Growth Despite an active network, Shiba Inu’s price continues to fall. Currently, it is trading at $0.00001226, marking an 8.28% decrease this week and a 55% drop year-over-year. The Shibarium network has surpassed 1 billion transactions, yet 62% of SHIB holders are experiencing losses. The token burn rate has also decreased, with 37.6 million SHIB burned in the last day—a 60% reduction from the day before. Shibarium’s transition to real-world applications has not boosted SHIB’s value. Trading volumes have decreased by 40% in the last 24 hours, and with the majority of SHIB controlled by large holders, price fluctuations continue to be erratic. Without sustained demand or effective token burns, the downward trend in Shiba Inu’s price may persist, potentially leading to further losses for holders. Cardano Faces Volatility from Whale Transactions Cardano has experienced significant trading activity, with 120 million ADA sold over two days. This has reduced the total ADA held in large wallets from 5.84 billion to 5.71 billion. Cardano’s price briefly fell to $0.61, then recovered to $0.66, but it still shows a nearly 6% decline over the week. The proportion of ADA held by whales has decreased to 8.48%, with retail holders now owning 71.17% of the supply. This trend highlights a shift away from short-term traders, who have decreased by 16.36%. Despite market pressures, institutional interest remains strong, with Cardano-focused exchange-traded products (ETPs) receiving $0.6 million in new inflows last week, bringing the 2025 total to $70 million. Although whale activity has affected short-term prices, long-term institutional engagement appears robust. Overview of Market Dynamics The ongoing price declines of Shiba Inu and the active selling by Cardano whales are creating challenges for both communities. This situation is characterized by decreased trading, insufficient token burns, and ongoing sell-offs. As participants await market recovery, there is a growing interest in platforms that offer greater utility and simpler user interfaces. In this environment, BlockDAG introduces a significant tool: a no-code wizard for creating tokens and NFTs, making Web3 accessible to non-developers. Every operation on the platform engages BDAG, linking usage directly to the coin’s demand. For those exploring crypto options, BlockDAG provides practical tools that are already in use. With its crypto presale now exceeding $212 million, the platform continues to gain momentum.

We didn’t hit our minimum raise,” the developers of the Real (REAL) token, Real World Gaming said in an April 6 X post, adding that “All bids will be refunded in full.” “This is not the end,” RWG said. The team only managed to raise $392,315 in USDC ( USDC ) over a 28-hour presale on April 5 and 6 — less than half of the minimum required and approximately 11% of the $3.6 million target, which was conducted via a sealed-bid auction. The public sale of 60 million REAL tokens (3% of the total 2 billion REAL supply) initially targeted a fully diluted value of $120 million, with the sealed bid auction starting at $0.06 per token.

Memecoins have also been cooling off since the launch of the Official Trump memecoin on Jan. 18, 2025.

Pepe Coin (PEPE), a meme token experiencing volatile price movements, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralised lending platform now in the fourth phase of its presale, are getting eyes for their potential to bring exponential gains. PEPE price hovers around $0.000000746, testing a falling wedge formation that could prompt an explosive 130% move for price if resistance is overcome, according to analysts. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) claims that it has raised $6.30 million with 7,900 holders so far and with tokens for stage 4 at $0.025 (which will increase 20% once stage 5 begins). Early investors locking in MUTM now at a launch price of $0.06 can expect to see returns of 140%, but in-after projections show a meteoric rise beyond $3.50! Technical Indicators for Pepe Coin Prompt Speculation A falling wedge pattern dominates Pepe Coin’s charts, which is on the verge of a breakout. As the meme token tumbles down 15% a week, opinions are split recently after a whale snapped up 492 billion PEPE for $3.74 million on April 1, 2025, leading many to believe that bullish momentum could be right around the corner. Resistance around $0.000001 and $0.0000015 serve as key barriers — with a definitive break potentially sending prices to $0.000002, representing a 161% increase. While technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator suggest a potential recovery in momentum, PEPE’s dependance on prevailing market sentiment and meme-induced volatility leaves its future uncertain. Although the accumulation of whales indicates confidence, analysts warn that wider market stability and a resurgence in retail interest are necessary for a sustained upward journey. We Built It So You Can Come Home: Mutuum Finance Presale In the fourth phase of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) manages to keep pulling in capital and tokens are currently being offered at $0.025 with a planned increase of 20% taking place in phase 5, making tokens $0.03. The project’s tokenomics secures a 140% yield at its $0.06 exchange listing, although projections range higher still: one projections as far as $3.50 post-launch puts a no less than 13,900% upside on current buyers. MUTM stands in contrast to the speculatively-driven value of PEPE, as the former is directly correlated to its DeFi lending ecosystem, which allows users to borrow against overcollateralized assets, and earn by utilizing mtTokens—interest-accruing deposit certificates. A buy-and-distribute mechanism only exacerbates demand, directing platform revenue into MUTM buys distributed to stakers — leading to cyclical buy pressure. Strength in a Bumpy Market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses real world utility to hedge against the risk that PEPE’s potential is dependent on uncontrollable meme trends. With a presale structure that is now 36% complete, the price of the tokens is steadily ramped up across 11 phases, rewarding early participation. Its ongoing smart contract audit, led by CertiK, will further assure investors, with audit results anticipated before listing on exchanges. Over 7,900 holders have positioned themselves early ahead of MUTM’s shift from presale to mainstream trading—which in the past has connected to fast price appreciation. With the crypto market bouncing between hype and fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuses both. Phase 4’s opening price of $0.025 leaves a shrinking opportunity for investors looking to make pre-launch gains, whereas PEPE’s technical setup remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. With calculated growth over volatility, thus MUTM’s presale stages reflect a rare convergence of urgency and opportunity. Last Call Before Opening Tickets Phase 5 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves closer to next price incrementation as phase 4 sells out quicker than previous phases. Investors placing $1,000 today would receive 40,000 tokens, some analysts predict to hit $3.50 per token post-launch, resulting in $45,000. Pending completion of the CertiK audit adds additional credibility in line with MUTM’s commitment to security and transparency. Time is running out for them to get in on the 140% launch return—phase 5’s price of $0.03 comes into play as soon as current allocations are cleared. While PEPE’s whales take a huge bet on a very fickle market sentiment, MUTM’s entire ascent has been structured, creating a roadmap for buyers to achieve exponential gains — no meme necessary.

Using the UTXO Realized Price Distribution metric, the crypto analyst pinpoints $0.18 and $0.2 as the key resistance levels the Dogecoin price must break to surge higher. How Dogecoin’s Critical $0.18 And $0.2 Resistance Levels Could Spark A Major Dogecoin Price Rally According to renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s analysis of the URPD metric, approximately 8% of the total DOGE supply was last traded at $0.18, with another 7% purchased at around $0.21. These price points with more trading activity create significant resistance barriers as investors who bought at these levels may sell to break even, potentially limiting upward movement. However, the crypto analyst suggests that if the Dogecoin price successfully breaks through these resistance levels, there would be relatively few obstacles to slow its upward momentum, potentially triggering a substantial rally. Currently trading near $0.17, the meme coin is approaching the first crucial resistance level at $0.18. Historically, social media sentiment and celebrity endorsements, particularly from figures like Elon Musk, have influenced Dogecoin price movements. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Gains Momentum As Dogecoin Price Nears Potential Surge WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is generating unusual buzz in crypto circles. Its beta platform showcases a merger of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance, creating an ecosystem where advanced AI algorithms drive real-time market insights. One notable attention-puller is its AI-powered predictive analytics tool , which digs through historical and live market data, identifying potential breakout opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Investors don’t have to babysit the charts to capitalize on these opportunities as the platform’s custom alerts, tailored to each portfolio, instantly notify them of critical market shifts. Furthermore, its automated transaction capabilities execute trades at the best possible times based on pre-set rules, making sure no opportunities are missed due to market timing. As users accrue more profits, they remain protected by the decentralized wallet’s security features, including a real-time anomaly detection system designed to catch and neutralize potential security threats before they can cause harm. Furthermore, the platform’s multi-layered approach with robust security protocols like biometric verification, multi-factor authentication, and QR scanning prevents unauthorized access to users’ portfolios. Since its CoinMarketCap debut , WallitIQ’s native WLTQ token has quickly attracted interest. Its low $0.0420 presale price positions it as a smart investment, especially in light of bullish market projections. With expectations of the AI market reaching $244 billion by 2025 and potentially exceeding $1.01 trillion by 2031, industry analysts forecast impressive financial outcomes for high-utility AI-powered crypto projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). They project the platform to generate monthly revenues of up to $7 million while predicting the native WLTQ token could achieve a potential 300% price increase as adoption grows. Adding another layer of appeal, early WallitIQ (WLTQ) adopters are offered substantial incentives, such as exclusive staking rewards up to 180% APY, access to high-yield liquidity pools, and governance rights to influence the platform’s future. The platform has already launched its MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App, which offers real-time price tracking and intuitive trading tools for managing assets like ETH and USDT. Users can also use its trade simulation capability to refine their strategies before committing actual funds. Adding to investor confidence, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) successful smart contract audit by SolidProof further solidifies its reputation as a secure and credible project. Savvy Investors Are Acting Now, Join Them On WallitIQ (WLTQ) As the Dogecoin price approaches its critical resistance levels, savvy investors are not only watching DOGE charts but also securing their position in promising projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). With the presale price currently at just $0.0420 and analysts forecasting potential gains of up to 300% as adoption accelerates, early investors are racing to acquire WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens before mainstream recognition drives prices higher. With the platform’s robust security features and profit-maximizing tools at the intersection of AI and DeFi, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is perfectly positioned to capture significant market share in the billion-dollar crypto AI market. With presale tokens selling quickly, now is the time to act on this rare opportunity before it’s too late.

As capital cautiously re-enters the space, retail and institutional players alike are focusing less on price hype and more on substance. For the top crypto coins, momentum is no longer enough—real infrastructure and adoption metrics are driving decisions. That’s where today’s divide emerges. While SUI is up 25% from March lows, every SUI price prediction remains contingent on resistance levels breaking. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a nearly 40% volume surge, but its outlook remains capped by instability in funding and price structure. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already proving traction. In Keynote 3, CEO Antony Turner shared that the X1 Miner App alone now supports “more than 800,000+ users mining, earning, and engaging with us.” Meanwhile, the TG Tap Miner added another 400,000+ users. With $210.5 million raised, 19.1 billion BDAG sold, and mobile-first mining at scale, BlockDAG is no longer projecting adoption—it’s executing it. SUI Price Prediction Eyes $3—but Resistance Remains a Deciding Factor The SUI price prediction is trending more positive following a 25% rebound since March lows, with the coin currently trading at $2.49. Technical momentum is supported by the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern—a historically bullish structure—that targets the $2.85 to $3 zone. Adding fuel to the forecast, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the SUI network has risen by 19.4% over the last three weeks, now totaling $1.23 billion. That metric reflects growing on-chain activity and user confidence. Still, the final leg of this run depends heavily on broader market behavior, especially from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action: Volume Up, But Direction Still Unclear The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is currently hovering near $0.00001267, having recently dipped to $0.0000122. Although the price has bounced slightly, what stands out is the 39.78% spike in trading volume, bringing the 24-hour tally to $261 million. Technical indicators are stabilizing. The RSI has recovered to 50.45, up from levels that were dangerously close to oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD just made a bullish crossover, implying short-term strength. However, funding rates remain erratic, flipping between positive and negative since February—a sign that leveraged traders are divided on SHIB’s direction. BlockDAG’s Mass Adoption Didn’t Wait for Mainnet—It Showed Up Early Unlike most Layer 1 projects that quietly build toward a launch with little user traction, BlockDAG took a different route—one that prioritized early utility and rapid community involvement. By the time its Keynote 3 premiered, the BlockDAG ecosystem was already alive with measurable activity. Through a blend of mobile accessibility and gamified experiences, the network had already attracted over 1.2 million users—long before the mainnet even went live. The foundation of this success lies in its dual-platform strategy. “To date we have more than 800,000+ users mining, earning, and engaging with us,” noted CEO Antony Turner, referencing the X1 Miner App during the keynote. In parallel, the TG Tap Miner game carved out a second powerful entry point: “400,000+ signed-up users and upwards of 100,000 active players every day,” Turner added. This approach doesn’t just reflect growth—it reflects readiness. As of Batch 27, BDAG’s price has already surged 2,380%, jumping from $0.001 to $0.0248. The project has now raised over $210.5 million and sold more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins, all without relying on venture capital—just retail support and utility traction. Looking ahead, forecasts estimate BDAG could reach $20 by 2027, which frames the current entry point as a rare pricing window. With its Testnet live, real user activity underway, and community tools scaling fast, BlockDAG isn’t just preparing for mass adoption—it’s already executing on it. The remaining variable? How long the current opportunity stays open before demand begins to drive scarcity. Wrap-Up: Which Crypto Holds Real Promise—SUI, SHIB, or BDAG? The market is crowded with movement, but not all motion is meaningful. SUI’s 25% rally may continue, but its $3 goal is still at the mercy of macro forces. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has recovered slightly, but remains reactive—more speculation than strategy. BlockDAG, however, is showing structured growth: live users, rising presale value, and a clear product roadmap. Its Keynote 3 confirmed that 1.2 million+ users are actively mining BDAG coins using mobile-first tools. With the price already at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and a $20 target by 2027, early participation today could translate into one of the highest ROIs in the current crypto cycle. Among the top crypto coins being tracked right now, BlockDAG is transforming adoption into value. And that could make all the difference for forward-looking traders.

With so many projects launching and evolving, it’s easy to feel lost in the noise. Ondo and Theta have been making headlines with their latest moves, stirring up excitement in the market. Ondo’s token has been gaining traction in the world of tokenized real-world assets, while Theta is shaking things up in decentralized video streaming. But amidst these power players, a new contender is turning heads—Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike the traditional names, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s the first Web3 aggregator uniting multiple blockchains under one roof. But what really makes it stand out is its game-changing decentralized VPN (dVPN), offering a new level of online security and privacy. With its presale already surpassing $15.8 million, early buyers are rushing in before the next price hike. Those looking for the best cryptos to invest in this week might want to pay close attention to what Qubetics is bringing to the table. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: The Best Cryptos to Invest in This Week for Privacy As the internet becomes more centralized, online privacy has become a luxury rather than a right. Most VPN providers claim to keep users safe, but the truth is, they still rely on centralized servers that can be monitored, censored, or even shut down. This is where Qubetics changes the game. Instead of a traditional VPN, it offers a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer VPN service, ensuring that no single entity can control or restrict access to the internet. For individuals, this means absolute privacy. Whether someone is a journalist working in a high-surveillance country or just someone who values online security, Qubetics’ dVPN offers an untraceable browsing experience. Imagine being able to stream restricted content, conduct private transactions, or even communicate securely without fear of data leaks. Unlike standard VPNs that can log and sell user data, Qubetics’ blockchain-based network eliminates this risk entirely. Businesses also benefit massively. Companies handling sensitive customer data, such as fintech firms or healthcare providers, can now secure their operations with a VPN that no third party can manipulate. Even remote workers dealing with confidential files can operate without worrying about data interception. This is more than just privacy—it’s freedom. And with Web3 adoption on the rise, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN isn’t just an upgrade; it’s the future of secure internet access. That’s why it’s currently being seen as one of the best cryptos to invest in this week . Qubetics Presale ROI: Why Early Buyers Are Rushing In What if one decision today could completely change your crypto game this year? That’s exactly the kind of energy Qubetics is bringing right now. Sitting confidently in its 29th presale stage at $0.1573 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already locked in over $15.8 million in funds with 506 million tokens sold and more than 24,300 holders backing it up. This isn’t your average pump-and-dump—it’s structured, growing fast, and pulling serious attention. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to invest in this week, this one’s got all the right stats to make the shortlist. Let’s play out a quick investment scenario. If you throw in $1,000 at the current price, and $TICS hits $1, you’re already looking at a 535.65% ROI. But things really take off if it climbs to $5—that’s a 3,078.26% ROI. Push that further to $10, and you’re looking at 6,256.47% ROI. And if $TICS manages to reach $15 after launch? That’s a mind-blowing 9,434.71% ROI. With ROI like this and a strong presale backing it up, Qubetics isn’t just a maybe—it’s one of the best cryptos to invest in this week before the wave gets too crowded. Ondo: The Tokenized Real-World Asset Boom While Qubetics is redefining online privacy, Ondo is tackling something just as revolutionary—tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). The idea of bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology has been floating around for years, but Ondo is one of the first projects making it truly accessible. Ondo’s biggest breakthrough has been its tokenized U.S. Treasuries, allowing users to gain exposure to stable, low-risk assets on the blockchain. This move has positioned Ondo as a major player in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). With institutional interest growing, Ondo’s partnerships with major financial entities are paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption. Recent developments have shown an increase in Ondo’s on-chain trading volume, indicating rising demand from both retail and institutional participants. The ability to earn yield from real-world assets on a decentralized platform is something traditional banks can’t compete with. If Ondo continues on this trajectory, it could play a significant role in the future of blockchain-based asset management. Theta: The Future of Decentralized Video Streaming Content creation has always been dominated by centralized giants like YouTube and Netflix, but Theta is changing that narrative. As a decentralized video delivery network, Theta allows users to share bandwidth and computing resources, reducing costs for content providers while rewarding participants with its native token.

The Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5 , with some slapped at higher rates, including China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, and Japan at 24%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped over 6% in the last 24 hours and was trading around $77,883. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ) shed over 12% in the same time frame and was trading at $1,575, according to CoinGecko. The total crypto market cap dropped over 8% to $2.5 trillion. Prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 1.4% to $78,500. Meanwhile, Ether regained $1,594. Source: Autism Capital At the same time, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 23 in its latest April 7 update, which is considered extreme fear. In a statement, Charlie Sherry, head of finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the drop is unsurprising because global markets are generally more illiquid on Sundays. “As a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly,” he said. “There’s no mystery behind the trigger: President Trump’s recent tariff talk has rattled macro markets, with global trade relations suddenly looking uncertain.” Some traders, however, predict a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner . BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has also speculated that while the tariffs are rattling markets , they could result in a Bitcoin rally. The US Stock Futures market has also opened down. Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, according to Google Finance. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank by over 8%. Trading resource the Kobeissi Letter said in an April 6 post to X that the drop in US stock market futures puts S&P 500 futures in ”bear market territory,” adding that the US stock market has now erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days. Source: Kobeissi Letter Tom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm MV Global, said it could be the “worst three-day move for US stocks of all time” if “tonight’s futures hold.” Trump Administration doubles down on tariffs Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman speculates that US President Donald Trump could postpone the tariffs to allow countries to make counteroffers or deals. In an April 6 statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump doubled down on the tariffs, saying the US has massive financial deficits with China, the European Union and many others, which the levies will solve. Related: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices “The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,” he said. He also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn't intentionally trying to cause a market sell-off but added that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” At the same time, US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an April 6 interview with ABC's This Week program that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to negotiate fresh trade deals. “They’re doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff,” he said. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response.

The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is down 8%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is down over 8% during mid-morning trading, while Shanghai’s SSE Composite Index is down 7%, and the Taipei’s TAIEX is down 9%. Major tech stocks across the region were some of the hardest hit. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong were down 12% while Tencent was down 9%. In Taipei, TSMC stocks dipped 10% in the first few minutes of trading, triggering the exchange’s price variation limit mechanism which halts trading in either direction. TSMC’s correction comes as the White House says that semiconductors from Taiwan are exempt from tariffs, but the future of the CHIPS Act – which bankrolled the construction of semiconductor factories in the U.S. – is in question. TSMC’s major correction on market open is likely foreshadowing of Nvidia’s open in the U.S. Some analysts say NVDA has become more volatile than BTC or ETH. Elsewhere in crypto, Ethereum (ETH) is down 11% on-day, XRP is down 9%, and Solana’s SOL is down 10%. Lending protocols Maker (MKR) and Aave (AAVE) were some of the worst performers on the market, down around 14% each.

According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin bull cycle may be coming to an end. This assertion is grounded in the concept of Realized Cap, a metric that quantifies the actual capital entering the BTC market through on-chain activity. Insights From Ki Young Ju For context, the Realized Cap metric operates on a straightforward premise: when Bitcoin enters a wallet, it represents a purchase, and when it leaves, it signifies a sale. By calculating the average cost basis for each wallet and multiplying it by the amount of BTC held, Ju derives the total Realized Cap. This metric reflects the total capital that has genuinely entered the BTC ecosystem, contrasting sharply with market capitalization, which is determined by the last traded price on exchanges. Related Reading: Solana Faces Defining Level At $120 – Will History Repeat? A common misconception, according to Ju, is that a small purchase, such as $10 worth of Bitcoin, only increases market capitalization by that same amount. In reality, prices are influenced by the balance of buy and sell orders on the order book. Low sell pressure means that even modest buys can significantly elevate prices and, consequently, market cap. This phenomenon was notably exploited by MicroStrategy (MSTR), which issued convertible bonds to acquire Bitcoin, thereby inflating the paper value of its holdings far beyond the initial capital deployed. Key Price Levels For Bitcoin Currently, Bitcoin appears to be in a challenging position, dropping below the key $80,000 mark. When sell pressure is high, even substantial purchases fail to affect prices, as seen when Bitcoin traded near its all-time high of nearly $100,000. Despite massive trading volumes, the price remained stagnant. Ju points out that if Realized Cap is increasing but market cap is either flat or declining, it signals a bearish trend. This indicates that while capital is entering the market, it is not translating into price appreciation—a hallmark of a bear market. Conversely, if market capitalization is rising while Realized Cap remains stable, it suggests that even minimal new investment is driving prices up, indicative of a bull market. Presently, data suggests that Bitcoin is experiencing the former scenario: capital is flowing in, but prices are not responding positively. Historically, significant market reversals require at least six months to manifest, making a short-term rally seem unlikely. Related Reading: Ethereum Tanks Nearly 50% As Bitcoin Holds Stronger In Q1 Adding to the complexity, market expert Ali Martinez has identified key resistance levels that Bitcoin must overcome to regain upward momentum. Notably, there is a major resistance cluster at $87,000, where the 50-day moving average, 200-day moving average, and a descending trendline from the all-time high converge. For Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory, the expert asserts that BTC must break through critical resistance points at $85,470 and $92,950. Additionally, support at $80,450 remains vital; failure to hold this level could lead to further declines. As of now, the leading cryptocurrency trades at $78,379, recording a 6% decline on Sunday.

What’s surprising, however, is the quiet entry of several early Dogecoin investors into this emerging project—suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. As the crypto market continues evolving, seasoned players are often the first to spot innovations that the wider public hasn’t yet recognised. Lightchain AI’s upcoming technology launch could be one such inflection point, signalling a shift in where early gains might come from next. With an increasing number of eyes turning to its ecosystem, investors are beginning to wonder whether Lightchain AI might deliver exponential returns similar to DOGE’s historic breakout. The interest from early adopters is already speaking volumes. In this article, we will explore the potential of Lightchain AI as a groundbreaking technology and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. Why Is XRP Flashing Warning Signs Around the $2.00 Mark? It is notable that XRP closing in on 2 dollars is getting a bit worrying to investors who have been monitoring its overall price and where it would be in the near future. For instance, while the coin has come up with strong and vibrant market performances, its inability to overcome resistance or sustain higher lows still indicates its underlying weakness. Moreover, on-chain data suggests a decrease in the number of transactions and wallet activities, which is usually followed by price drops. The issue of regulatory uncertainty over Ripple is not favorable and traders are extremely careful due to the fact that there is no news about new bullish catalysts. Technical indicators like the RSI and the MACD have started to diverge, pointing to a potential slowdown in the trend. In the case of further changes in the general picture of the market or the worsening of external factors, the price could collapse below 2.00 dollars leading to a rush of margin calls. These are the reasons why part of the investors are seeking new projects with steady growth prospects and a real-world application. How Is Lightchain AI Positioning Itself Against Ripple in 2025? Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a next-generation solution that contrasts sharply with Ripple’s centralised focus on cross-border payments. By 2025, Lightchain AI aims to establish a decentralised, AI-powered ecosystem that supports intelligent task execution across global networks. Unlike Ripple, which caters to banking institutions, Lightchain AI targets developers, decentralised applications, and innovators seeking scalable AI infrastructure. Its modular architecture includes roles for validator, contributor, and storage nodes—ensuring decentralisation at every layer. The project’s governance model gives token holders direct influence over system upgrades and ecosystem development, further separating it from Ripple’s top-down structure. As the industry shifts toward intelligent automation and decentralised intelligence, Lightchain AI’s roadmap and infrastructure offer a modern alternative to older protocols. This long-term focus allows it to appeal to a broader Web3 community seeking innovation beyond payment processing. Can Lightchain AI Overtake XRP Amid Growing Investor Interest? Lightchain AI overtaking XRP may seem ambitious, but investor sentiment is clearly shifting toward ecosystems offering utility and innovation beyond transactional speed. Lightchain AI’s presale has already attracted $18.9 million, indicating confidence in its forward-facing architecture and roadmap. With the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) at its core, the platform provides decentralised AI execution—something XRP does not address. This unique functionality opens opportunities in sectors ranging from DeFi to governance, giving the project a more diverse application range. Furthermore, Lightchain AI’s community-driven evolution and transparent governance model appeal to investors disillusioned with centralised control in legacy projects. As the market matures and utility becomes the key investment criterion, platforms like Lightchain AI stand a strong chance of climbing higher in the rankings. With sustained development and adoption, surpassing XRP in relevance—and potentially value—is not out of reach. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-07 03:00:00

This is not the end. — Real World Gaming (@getrealtoken) April 6, 2025 McGregor and his team had pitched the project as a more honest alternative to other celebrity-backed tokens, which have faced criticism and scams. He promised that the REAL token would be different, offering transparency, DAO voting rights, and possible use in the gaming ecosystem. You might also like: Dogecoin price prediction: Memecoin rally or downward dog? The token’s structure demonstrated long-term planning, with the DAO treasury receiving 31.5%, the community receiving 16.5%, seed investors receiving 13.5%, and the team receiving 10%. The remaining portion was distributed among staking, sales, airdrops, and liquidity. However, concerns regarding the team’s 10% stake were already being voiced. Despite the efforts, the launch happened at a tough time for the market. The memecoin market is still reeling from high-profile scams like February’s LIBRA memecoin scandal . The REAL token’s failure shows that, in the current environment, celebrity endorsements are not enough to propel a project forward. Investors seem to be more cautious, even with major backers like Animoca Brands and KuCoin Labs, particularly as the hype wanes and the importance of fundamentals gains prominence. The project will go forward in some capacity, according to McGregor’s team, but the token’s launch has been postponed for the time being.

Posting on X on April 4, Cohen said the feature has returned with “industry standard moderation systems in place and transparent guidelines.” He said it had been rolled out to just 5% of users. Source: Alon Cohen Pump.fun’s website describes the purpose of its new live-streaming moderation policy as being “to cultivate a social environment on pump fun that preserves creativity and freedom of expression and encourages meaningful engagement amongst users, free of illegal, harmful, and negative interactions.” Breaches of the moderation policy could see creators having their livestreams and Pump.fun accounts terminated. The policy prohibits certain types of content, including violence, animal abuse, pornography and youth endangerment. However, it also creates ambiguity by claiming that “pump fun does not intend to universally define what content is ‘appropriate’ or ‘inappropriate.’” “There is an implicit assumption that some content — perhaps much content — generally defined as NSFW will in fact appear on pump fun,” Pump.fun’s moderation policy states. The platform added it reserves the right to “unilaterally determine the appropriateness of content where necessary and to moderate it accordingly.” Live-streaming return comes as memecoin market crumbles Pump.fun removed its live-streaming feature last November after it became awash with extreme content as memecoin creators turned to increasingly shocking tactics to promote their tokens. Some users were allegedly threatening violence or self-harm if a token didn’t reach a price goal. The platform said its unprecedented growth had put a strain on its moderators, and that it would pause the live-streaming functionality indefinitely to ensure the safety of its users “until the moderation infrastructure is ready to deal with the heightened levels of activity.” At the time, Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder of algorithmic trading firm Trading Strategy, said that if Pump.fun continued to allow live-streaming without appropriate moderation, it would quickly be shut down once a mainstream audience became aware of what was going on. “I advocate for freedom of speech, but these streams are causing practical issues where people are breaking the law in live broadcasts. This will trigger a shutdown when the mainstream media catches a wind on this,” Ohtamaa said. Pump.fun’s decision to reintroduce its live-streaming feature comes as interest in memecoins has been down significantly following a series of high-profile rug pulls such as Libra (LIBRA) and Melania Meme (MELANIA). That’s coupled with the poor price performance of tokens like Trump (TRUMP) — which, according to CoinGecko, is now down over 90% from its January highs. Related: Libra founder: Memecoin critics only ‘bitch’ when left out of insider deals Data from Dune Analytics showed in March that the graduation rate for tokens launched on Pump.fun — that is, the percentage of tokens that achieve a large enough market cap to become tradable on a regular decentralized exchange — had fallen to under 1%, down from highs of around 1.67%. Combined with a sharp drop in the number of tokens being launched on the platform, this has seen the total number of tokens graduating from highs of around 5,400 per week in January to under 1,500 in March. The number of tokens launched on the Solana network has also fallen dramatically overall. Only 31,651 launched on April 5, according to Solscan , less than one-third of the 95,578 created at the peak of the memecoin frenzy on Jan. 26.

While Ripple and Solana are showing capacity for growth, an upcoming altcoin known as Rexas Finance (RXS) seems to be lying under the radar, waiting to take over in 2025. Comparing Rexas Finance with Solana and Ripple, Rexas Finance shows potential for catastrophic growth soon. Alongside its innovative application in real-world decentralized finance (DeFi), it enables RXS to seize the attention of investors. This clearly marks Rexas Finance as a compelling investment opportunity. 270% increase expected from Solana’s cup-and-handle formation Over the past year, Solana (SOL) has positively surprised many of the cryptocurrencies available. Currently, Solana seems to be forming a “cup and handle” technical setup. This generally means strong upward movements follow after a period of turbulence. Bullish engulfing patterns serve as positive indicators on the weekly chart of SOL, which is valued at $128.91 and has a market cap of $65.73 billion. These indicators indicate a strong buying force. The Accumulation/Distribution indicator also suggests that many dip investors try to position themselves to make the most of the upward movement. Assuming Solana stays above $100, analysts forecast a significant breakout with a 270% rally that would drive SOL to $505. Although a Solana cup-and-handle pattern can develop over time, the projected outcomes appear promising—though investors will require patience to make these gains a reality. Ripple (XRP) advances but needs to overcome resistance levels As reported in the past weeks, Ripple (XRP) has been in the news thanks to its regulatory advancements and mounting institutional acceptance. It is safe to say that XRP has been facing considerable resistance for a while now but has managed to break through and is back above $2.30, marking XRP’s fourth recovery in a row. As expected, the recent rally was triggered by good news regarding Ripple’s licensing progress in Dubai and ongoing legal tussles with the SEC, which are proving to provide positive outcomes for the company. Substantial investment sentiment has done wonders in aiding the token, which is bordering crucial resistance levels. Currently, XRP is giving $2.57 considerable struggle, which is the most important one on the chart for now. Breaking beyond this point seems essential for the bulls to charge toward greater targets, allowing XRP to cross $3 in the coming weeks. A few market people tend to think that a $10 price target is set for the long term if we assume rational adoption and clarifying regulations. These crucial numbers seem appealing, but as with XRP, you can only rely on widespread adoption, legal outcomes, and international rulings. While seemingly appealing for a bear market, this seems muted when compared to newer explosive projects in the market, like Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance (RXS): the underestimated coin that could surge past Solana and Ripple As Solana and Ripple continue to rise, another altcoin is rising— Rexas Finance (RXS). Unlike most new tokens, which depend solely on excitement, RXS is supported by an innovative financial ecosystem offering actual value. Starting from a price of $0.20 in the presale stage, RXS has already surpassed the $47.375 million mark and is set to sell over 456 million tokens, reaching 91.37% completion in its presale. This comes with an exchange listing confirmed for June 19, 2025, after which many investors have started viewing this as the last chance to capitalize before an expected surge in momentum. Rexas Finance stands due to its broad DeFi ecosystem, which includes staking, yield farming, tokenized RWAs, and advanced asset management. These features further distinguish Rexas from merely a speculative investment; it’s a functional platform offering genuine utility and catering to the evolving financial environment. Reasons why RXS could outperform SOL and XRP in 2025 RXS is considered the underdog because it lacks the market cap of its peers. With ample room for improvement on the proposed presale, the low-cap altcoin rewards Rexas with a level of growth that would ultimately help its price surge just before its listing on exchanges. XRP and SOL already have a high market cap, while RXS is an undiscovered gem awaiting exposure. Practical Applications and Value Propositions: While Ripple and Solana concentrate on borderless payments and scalability, RXS is developing an entire decentralized finance (DeFi) system. This captures the attention of multiple investors because of the automated trading systems connected with tokenization and AI and its sophisticated features like staking. Hype Before the Listing and Sale: RXS seems already appealing to retail and institutional investors, given that it raised almost $50 million even before hitting big exchanges. It’s likely to have a bigger required demand after going live. Gains Expectation Compared to Solana and Ripple: It’s pretty clear how reliable SOL and XRP are, with their expected 2x to 3x profits over the next year, but expecting a 10x (or even more) spike in a shorter period stretches the limits of imagination. For RXS, this isn’t far from reality. Conclusion: strategic portfolios Solana and Ripple continue to appeal from an investment perspective, with clear bullish patterns strongly suggesting price increases. Rexas Finance offers an even better investment opportunity for the most profitable return. At RXS’s potential upside in 2025 compared to SOL or XRP, RXS’s expected exchange listing, growing demand, and an entry price of $0.20 make it an unparalleled investment. While Solana and Ripple would provide reasonable returns over a long period, Rexas Finance will be the right choice for those looking for steep growth. Those who spot this opportunity early will win big as the crypto market booms.

The altcoins have it worse, with even more painful declines. The total liquidations have skyrocketed to $900 million on a daily scale. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView It was just several days ago, on Wednesday, when BTC’s price shot up to over $88,000 for the first time in a week. However, things change fast in today’s financial landscape, and Trump’s Trade War, which he labeled as ‘Liberation Day,’ pushed all markets south hard. Bitcoin dropped to $81,200 on a couple of occasions in the following days but managed to recover some ground ahead of the weekend, and even decoupled from Wall Street on Friday. However, being a 24/7 tradable asset has its downturns, and investors have initiated another sell-off over the weekend in anticipation of another painful Monday trading session. BTC stood around $83,000-$84,000 during most of the weekend but nosedived on Sunday evening and during the Monday Asian trading session. Its bottom, at least for now, came at $77,000, which became a monthly low. The altcoins have plunged a lot harder. The largest of the bunch , for instance, dumped to just over $1,500 – the lowest price tag since October 2023. XRP has declined by 12% on a daily scale, and has slumped below the coveted $2 support line, which some analysts believe could lead to a drop to $1.2/3. Double-digit price drops are evident from most larger-cap alts, including LTC, SUI, TRUMP, DOGE, and many others. The total liquidations for the past 24 hours have skyrocketed to over $900 million, according to CoinGlass.

The surge was not random. It started with a special convergence of market catalysts: Donald Trump’s comeback to the presidency, a consistent Federal Reserve policy, and a large flow of institutional investors looking for safe havens in digital assets. Long battling legal obstacles and mistrust, this ideal storm sparked excitement surrounding XRP. The retirement of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a long-standing enemy of Ripple, may have marked the biggest turning point. With his leaving, an age of legal uncertainty long suppressing XRP’s expansion ended. From a meagre $500 million daily average to an eye-popping $5 billion between mid-November and December, XRP immediately saw a surge in trade volume. The market hummed with activity. XRP cools down after a heated run By Q2 2025, the thrills had calmed down. Fast-forward. Currently trading at $2.46, XRP has increased 3% over the last 24 hours and about 25% from its highs earlier this year. The decline has demoralized more recent investors. Many wonder if XRP’s bull run is just a pause or has ended. Not everyone is throwing in the towel, notwithstanding the declining price action. Edoardo Farina, head of Social Adoption at XRPHealthcare, feels the best is still to come. Citing a few critical events on the horizon that might propel another leg up, he recently claimed that XRP still has excellent upside left in 2025. Key XRP drivers in Q2 2025 The possible acceptance of XRP ETFs is a significant catalyst on the radar. The SEC reviews more than fifteen applications right now. Should any of them pass, XRP would become far more easily available to regular consumers and institutional investors. The same tendency was mostly responsible for driving Bitcoin to unprecedented highs in 2024. Furthermore, regulatory clarification on stablecoins is necessary. Although XRP is not a stablecoin, experts believe new rules can inadvertently help the token. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, will likely acquire popularity as the regulation environment develops. Since XRP is utilized for transaction fees inside the Ripple ecosystem, researcher SMQKE claims that rising acceptance of RLUSD will organically fuel demand for XRP. These fees are burned, lowering the total supply and aggravating the scarcity. Farina even wonders if RLUSD might become the favoured settlement standard for worldwide transactions. Should this scenario pass, XRP would be the hub of a large transactional ecosystem, driving price appreciation and adoption. US support and institutional momentum The present US government has adopted a quite pro-crypto policy. Declaring support for American-based cryptocurrency companies like Ripple, President Trump has indicated that the legal environment might keep becoming less hostile. Adoption over the long term and investor trust depends on this. Farina also anticipates “institutional FOMO” activating. Buying pressure could lead to a supply shortage as institutional investors rush to get access to XRP before possible ETF approval or another surge. This “supply shock” could be the catalyst XRP needs to reach $5 in Q2 2025. Rexas Finance: the 100x opportunity in real-world asset tokenization Although XRP’s road to new highs looks bright, some investors are diversifying into other initiatives, including Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas is tokenizing real estate, fine art, and commodities, integrating crypto with real-world asset (RWA) markets, unlike conventional blockchain systems. This enables investors to hold fractions of these highly valuable assets, releasing liquidity from inaccessible markets. Rexas Finance has already raised $47.63 million in its presale, with 458 million tokens sold and the twelfth stage nearing its end. Without any VC participation, the token price has gone from $0.03 to $0.20—a 567% growth. This calculated move aligns the project with long-term investor interests and helps to stop early-stage token dumping. RXS will debut on the main exchanges on June 19 at a projected listing price of $0.25. With a potential 100x ROI in 2025, analysts hope Rexas Finance will follow a breakthrough trajectory akin to early major crypto launches. Conclusion XRP could have calmed down since its explosive conclusion in 2024, but going into Q2 2025, the principles are still solid. Potential ETF approvals, institutional support, and regulatory clarification all help XRP still have a strong chance at breaking new highs. Rexas Finance offers an intriguing possibility for those looking for faster and more significant returns. With real-world relevance, a solid presale performance, and a strategic exchange debut, RXS might be the breakthrough token of 2025. Keeping an eye on these assets can be your best action this year, whether you missed the first XRP spike or are trying to diversify.

During an event hosted on Saturday by Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, Musk said : I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and Notrh America. In addition, he said that he hoped there would be more freedom for people to move between the two regions. That said, Musk’s views appear to be in stark contrast with US President Donald Trump’s approach. On April 2nd, he slammed a new batch of tariffs on literally every country in the world, including 20% levies on imports from the European Union (on certain goods). At the same time, Musk took a jab at Peter Navarro, a White House aide and one of the chief proponents of Trump’s tariff plans. “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing. Results in the ego/braings >>1 problem.” Navarro has a PhD in economics from Harvard University. Navarro also responded on Sunday, saying that Musk is “simply protecting his own interests,” among other things. Reuters reports that the EU is seeking to present a unified front in the coming days against said tariffs, aiming to approve a first set of “targeted countermeasures” on targeted imports from the United States worth some $28 billion. International stock markets are under serious tensions as major indices such as the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, and the DJI charted critical losses during last week’s trading session, which turned out to be the worst since the COVID crash. Bitcoin’s price is also down in the past 24 hours, trading at $78,000 at the time of this writing, decreasing by 6.4%.

Early investors are now crypto whales, with a large influence on the market. However, the crypto world is continually changing and constantly presents new opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one such opportunity with one of the most innovative approaches and real progress. RXS could be the altcoin to watch if you are looking for the next big thing in crypto. Here’s why: Rexas Finance’s remarkable growth surge Rexas Finance is witnessing exponential growth, becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins in the market. The project’s rapid success can be attributed to its unique approach to real-world assets (RWAs), which has attracted investors seeking stability and long-term value. By integrating RWAs into its ecosystem, Rexas Finance offers something more tangible than most cryptocurrencies, making it a solid contender in a volatile market. Investors see this as an opportunity to diversify and participate in a groundbreaking project that combines digital and traditional assets seamlessly. Impressive presale performance and fundraising Rexas Finance’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, currently in its final stage at a price of $0.20, up from the initial price of $0.03.

43016912,https://invezz.com/?p=2657433,1743997006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) sees small gains, but is more downside coming?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/07/shiba-inu-shib-sees-small-gains-but-is-more-downside-coming/,"After months of steep decline, Shiba Inu flipped green, with a 5.5% gain in the past week. This rising trend has pushed its price above the $0.000013 mark. However, uncertainty tempers the recent excitement. With weak support levels and upcoming sell pressure, the question is if SHIB can hold up or if there will be more falls. Shiba Inu price outlook: a rise to $0.000016 or a dip to $0.000011? Shiba Inu has been caught between optimism and risk. It is currently trading at $0.00001347, just above a fragile support level of $0.00001275. While this level has remained stable, its longevity heavily depends on Bitcoin. And here’s when things become risky. Shiba Inu Price Chart (24-Hour), March 25, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko With a correlation of 0.77, the altcoin rather faithfully reflects the movements of the market leader. Should Bitcoin slink toward $90,000, SHIB may ride that momentum. But should BTC falter, Shiba Inu runs as low as $0.00001141. The behavior of short-term holders is also cause for concern. The MVRV Long/Short Difference , a critical statistic for detecting profit-taking, is at a six-month low. This means many holders are currently profitable and may be inclined to sell, creating downside pressure. Shiba Inu lacks the cushion to absorb severe sell-offs without strong support from long-term investors . Because of this fragility in market structure, any price increase appears to be ephemeral unless something larger drives the entire market. Still, there is significant retail interest, and a break over $0.00001462 might swiftly change the outlook. If that level converts into support, SHIB might rise to $0.00001676, changing the conversation from “will it survive?” to “can it thrive?” While SHIB strives to regain its footing, another altcoin, Rexas Finance (RXS) , has quietly stolen the spotlight. The trending utility token in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization niche is set to be the crypto market’s next big mover. Here is why. Rexas Finance (RXS): the new face of smart crypto investment Rexas Finance is more than just another crypto riding the frenzy; it’s changing how blockchain interacts with real-world assets. Rexas Finance blurs the gap between traditional wealth and digital finance by allowing anyone to tokenize actual assets such as real estate, gold, and fine art. Here’s how it works: imagine owning a piece of a $5 million Manhattan building with fractional tokens generated by Rexas Finance’s no-code Token Builder rather than paperwork and agents. This transforms illiquid assets into quick, fluid, and marketable digital value. The project’s use cases extend beyond tokenization. The ecosystem also incorporates Rexas Treasury, a multichain yield optimizer that facilitates revenue generation for RXS holders, and a startup incubator, Rexas Launchpad, which allows innovators to raise funds for their ideas. The project has raised $47.6 million as its ongoing presale nears completion (91% done). RXS price has risen from $0.03 to $0.20, a 566% gain. Over 458 million tokens have been traded, and the community has reached over 50,000 active holders , indicating growing investors’ trust. The project’s success can be attributed in large part to its VC-free approach. By refusing venture capital funding, the project removes the potential for big early dumps, which has earned it credibility in a field plagued by early investor sell-offs. Moreover, early placements on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko strengthened RXS’s credibility and increased its visibility to global investors. The project also underwent a Certik audit , reinforcing trust in its strong security system. Strategic tokenomics also contribute to the buzz. RXS employs a deflationary model with automatic buyback and burn mechanics reducing circulating supply over time. This means that the longer you keep the token, the more scarce (potentially valuable) it gets. To sweeten the deal, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway , with the top 20 winners receiving $50,000 in RXS apiece. With over 1.7 million entries received so far, this event increases community interaction and adds gamified incentives to attract small and large investors. It’s more than just hype; it’s purposeful exposure. Regarding the next significant jump, RXS will debut on at least three tier-1 exchanges on June 19, 2025, with a $0.25 listing price. Strongly related liquidity and exchange-backed exposure will likely drive the price higher, with some estimating a 100,000% increase. Simply put, Rexas shows all the indications of being a breakout project. With strong fundamentals, a loaded roadmap, and real-world use cases, a 10x post-listing surge isn’t just possible; it’s looking like a certainty. This places RXS as one of the best ROI crypto assets to acquire right now, particularly for those seeking to go beyond shit coins. Conclusion: meme momentum vs. real utility Shiba Inu may have room to grow, especially if Bitcoin ignites another bull market. But it’s a risky wager, relying mainly on sentiment and short-term behavior. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance presents a different opportunity: tangible usefulness, clever tokenomics, and a thriving community — all before its official offering. With the RXS presale nearing completion, this may be the only opportunity to participate before Rexas Finance launches its next chapter on global exchanges. Don’t wait till the headlines catch up; now is the time to get involved .

Bitcoin’s hashrate crossed the milestone on April 5 at a peak of 1.025 ZH/s, according to mempool.space data, while BTC Frame data said it hit 1.02 ZH/s a day earlier. Data from Coinwarz says that Bitcoin hashrate soared to as high as 1.1 ZH/s on April 4 at block height 890,915 — however, the same data indicates that Bitcoin first crossed 1 ZH/s on March 24. Bitcoin’s hashrate has fallen back below 0.95 ZH/s on April 7 since reaching 1 ZH/s. Source: BTC Frame Discrepancy in Bitcoin hashrate trackers The differences result from the varying approaches used to calculate hashrate — such as when block times and difficulty adjustments are measured, which Bitcoin nodes and miner pools are used to pull data from and more. Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp also previously pointed out that estimating Bitcoin’s hashrate with one “trailing block” as opposed to five can result in a difference of over 0.04 ZH/s. “Viewing the raw Hashrate metric can be deceiving due to random variations in block times,” added Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew, who pointed out that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average hashrate is still around 0.845 ZH/s mark in a note to Cointelegraph. Notching 1 ZH/s is a massive network achievement Despite the discrepancies, the feat highlights the massive amount of computational power and increasing decentralization of the Bitcoin network, making it more secure than ever and significantly reducing the likelihood of a 51% attack. The Bitcoin network’s reported rise to 1 ZH/s — equivalent to 1,000 Exahashes per second — marks a 1,000x increase since late January 2016, when Bitcoin first hit 1 EH/s for the first time. The second-largest proof-of-work crypto network, Litecoin, currently boasts a hashrate of 2.49 Petahashes per second according to Coinwarz — making it around 40,000 times less computationally powerful than Bitcoin. Source: Pierre Rochard Askew noted that the huge rise in hashrate has coincided with more commercial Bitcoin mining firms competing to solve Bitcoin blocks in recent years. “Miners are doubling down: expanding sites and plugging in more efficient machines,” Askew said, adding that less efficient miners could soon be washed out unless Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price rallies again in the coming months. MARA Holdings is the largest Bitcoin miner with more than 50 EH/s of compute power, while the largest share of hashrate is channeled to Bitcoin mining pools Foundry USA Pool and AntPool, according to the Hashrate Index. Related: Bitcoin price drops below $80K as stocks face 1987 Black Monday rerun At least 24 publicly listed Bitcoin companies have machines set up to mine Bitcoin, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com. Among the other large miners contributing hashrate are Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, Hut 8 Mining and TeraWulf. Bitcoin’s hashrate soars as BTC plummets on recession fears The new all-time high in Bitcoin hashrate came in the middle of a sharp market downturn — with Bitcoin ( BTC ) falling nearly 10% over the last four days to $78,750, while US stocks saw an estimated $6.6 trillion loss on April 3 and 4 — the largest two-day loss ever. Much of the fall has been attributed to US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans , which many industry analysts say are sparking recession fears.

This comes as part of an effort to align with Executive Order 14192, which focuses on cutting red tape and making regulations more business-friendly. One of the first targets is the 2019 Framework for Investment Contract Analysis of Digital Assets. This document was based on a 2018 speech by former SEC official Bill Hinman, where he suggested that whether a crypto token is considered a security depends more on how centralized the project is, rather than how it was sold. That idea has been pretty controversial in the crypto world, and it looks like the SEC is ready to reconsider it. Statement from Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda: Pursuant to Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation, together with recommendations from DOGE, I have requested Securities and Exchange Commission staff promptly to review the following staff statements. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) April 5, 2025 Uyeda isn’t just looking at Bill Hinman’s 2018 crypto speech—he’s also reviewing key documents, including: A 2022 guide for crypto companies on market chaos and bankruptcies. A 2021 risk alert about crypto investor threats due to unclear rules. A 2020 memo questioning if banks can legally hold digital assets. A 2021 advisory on mutual funds investing in Bitcoin futures. A 2020 note on COVID-19’s impact on company disclosures. The review aims to roll back some of the stricter rules put in place during Gary Gensler’s time as SEC Chair. Gensler was known for his tough stance on crypto, which many felt was more about blocking innovation than protecting investors. His approach even got called “arbitrary and capricious” by courts more than once. Now, with Uyeda leading the charge and folks like Hester Peirce and Paul Atkins pushing for more transparency, it looks like the SEC is opening up. They’ve been holding crypto roundtables, meeting with industry leaders, and even had a sit-down with BlackRock recently to discuss crypto ETFs and related issues. It’s clear the SEC is starting to clean house, getting rid of outdated rules, and making room for a crypto-friendly future. Investors and crypto enthusiasts are definitely watching closely to see what changes come next.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 03:56:14

The first major resistance is near the $1,710 level. A clear move above the $1,710 resistance might send the price toward the $1,820 resistance. An upside break above the $1,820 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,880 resistance zone or even $1,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level. The first major support sits near the $1,535 zone. A clear move below the $1,535 support might push the price toward the $1,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,400 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,350.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have dropped 6–12% in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations exceeding $900 million. The steep correction has prompted analysts to question Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative and its reliability as a hedge amid growing volatility. Crypto Market Crash: Investors Brace for Bloody Monday On Monday morning in Asian trading hours, crypto market crashed as risk-ON assets faced heavy volatility. Top markets like China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, hit circuit breakers in the early trading hours on Monday, with their indexes crashing 10%, sending the global markets into a situation of absolute turmoil. Bitcoin price is down 6.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at the crucial support of $77,500, with daily trading volumes up by a staggering 220% to more than $44 billion. As per the Coinglass data , BTC’s 24-hour liquidations have surged to $322 million. Based on the Bitcoin technical chart, $77,500 is a crucial support level for BTC. If it fails to hold these levels, further correction could be deeper. Source: Trading View BTC As A Hedge Theory Fails? Although Bitcoin price showed resilience to the Dow Jones crash last week, it is down by 7% today. However, it is still performing better as Asian indices are down 9-10% today. On the other hand, precious metals are up, as gold prices shot up $80 earlier today, and silver has an upward trajectory as well. Following today’s crypto market crash, Peter Schiff took the opportunity to add: “After a delayed reaction on Friday, crypto is finally starting to crack. Ether has already fallen to its lowest level since Oct. 2023, down 65% from its peak, and Bitcoin just traded below 81K, taking out last week’s low. It could be a long day for those trapped in Bitcoin ETFs”. As Donald Trump’s tariff war increases odds of US recession , debates over Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status have picked up once again. Long-term players still continue to remain bullish about BTC despite this volatility. Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise Investments, noted: “As nations trust each other less. As corporations have more difficulty doing business. A global, digital, apolitical store of value — controlled by no nation — looks increasingly differentiated. Bitcoin’s place in the world has never been more valuable”. Altcoins Crash – ETH, SOL, DOGE Lose Crucial Support Levels The altcoins market correction has extended further with Ethereum (ETH) price crashing 13.5% at press time and plummeting to $1,550. As a result, the world’s largest acltoin has extended its 2025 losses to more than 53% while leaving investors in a complete state of shock. Investors believe that ETH price crash today leaves the gates open for the $1,100-$1,300 range. However, on-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that whales are buying the ETH price dips.

While investor enthusiasm for celebrity-backed tokens and meme assets appears to be cooling, data suggests that experienced traders are still selectively engaging with short-term opportunities, even as broader market sentiment becomes more risk-averse. Conor McGregor’s REAL Token Flops as Auction Falls Short: All Investors to Receive Full Refund In a dramatic reversal for what was billed as a “game-changing” crypto project backed by former UFC champion and current Irish political candidate Conor McGregor, the REAL (REAL) token has failed to meet its minimum fundraising goal — triggering a full refund for all investors who participated in the auction. The token sale, conducted by blockchain gaming firm Real World Gaming (RWG), raised just $392,315 in USDC over a 28-hour sealed-bid auction held on April 5 and 6 — falling well short of its $1 million minimum requirement and achieving only around 11% of its ambitious $3.6 million target. Only 668 participants joined the highly anticipated sale, despite the campaign's high-profile celebrity backing and aggressive promotional push. “We need to be real. We didn’t hit our minimum raise,” RWG admitted in a candid post on X on April 6. “All bids will be refunded in full.” Despite the setback, RWG remained optimistic about the future of the project: “This is not the end,” the team asserted in the same post. The REAL token was touted by McGregor as a departure from the wave of low-effort celebrity tokens that have plagued the crypto industry in recent years. McGregor promised that the token wasn’t “some celebrity-endorsed bullshit” and that it would bring meaningful improvements to the crypto ecosystem and the real world alike. Backed by McGregor’s persona and branding, the public sale offered 60 million REAL tokens — 3% of the total 2 billion token supply — at a starting bid of $0.06 each. At full subscription, the token was expected to command a fully diluted valuation of $120 million. But the numbers never added up. Despite the fanfare, the sale lacked traction. It’s unclear whether the failure was due to a lack of investor confidence, poor timing, or broader market forces — likely a combination of all three. The REAL token launched into a turbulent market backdrop. Bitcoin, the bellwether of the crypto sector, saw a steep drop amid a wider financial rout, falling alongside US equities, which collectively lost an estimated $6.6 trillion over April 3 and 4 — the worst two-day performance in US stock market history. Driving the downturn were mounting fears of a global recession as President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping new tariff proposals. The shockwaves rippled through all risk-on markets, including crypto, just as the REAL auction went live. Adding further headwinds was the fading hype around meme coins, which had surged through late 2024 and early 2025 following the explosive launch of the Official Trump token. But the trend has cooled considerably in recent weeks, especially after the LIBRA token scandal tied to Argentine President Javier Milei sent shockwaves through both political and financial spheres. A Cautionary Tale in a Year of Celebrity Crypto Chaos The failure of the REAL token raises fresh questions about the sustainability of celebrity-backed crypto projects — even those pitched with supposedly greater substance. While McGregor attempted to distance his offering from other celebrity token failures, the outcome mirrors a broader pattern seen throughout 2024 and into 2025. Projects like LIBRA and other influencer-endorsed tokens have often sparked brief hype before collapsing or becoming entangled in controversy, eroding trust in an already skeptical segment of the market. The sealed-bid format, while innovative, may have also discouraged participation among retail investors unfamiliar with auction-based sales, further dampening momentum. For now, RWG is promising a comeback. “This is not the end,” the team reiterated — but how, when, and in what form a revised version of the REAL project may emerge remains to be seen. As for McGregor, the outcome may complicate his ambitions to be seen as a serious force in the crypto space, even as he pursues political aspirations in Ireland. Whether the REAL token was just another failed experiment or a misfired launch with potential for redemption will depend on how the team — and the market — regroup in the months ahead. Smart Money Still Eyes Meme Coins Despite Signs of Fading Supercycle Meanwhile, despite mounting evidence that the explosive meme coin “supercycle” may be nearing its end, some of the cryptocurrency industry’s most successful traders continue to chase quick returns in the high-risk, high-reward world of meme coins. Even as market sentiment turns cautious, blockchain intelligence data from Nansen suggests that the allure of fast profits remains too strong for top-performing wallets — known as “smart money” — to resist. This ongoing interest comes amid a sharp cooldown in meme coin hype following a wave of disappointing token launches, including several tied to US President Trump. While trading volumes and prices have dipped significantly, opportunistic traders continue to deploy capital in speculative plays, albeit with increased risk management. Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, explained during a recent livestream on X that smart money wallets remain active in the meme coin sector, even if their behavior has become more nimble and reactive. He added that the recent frenzy around meme tokens was treated more like a short-term play while the broader crypto market takes time to find its footing. “The recent meme frenzy was just a fun play they worked on, while the broader market is sorting out the direction because meme coins aren’t necessarily affected by the same macroeconomy as Bitcoin and Ethereum,” he said. That detachment from macroeconomic narratives has long made meme coins a unique playground for speculative traders, but cracks in sentiment have begun to show. Even with fading enthusiasm, meme coins are still producing jaw-dropping returns — for now. One trader turned an initial $2,000 investment into a mind-bending $43 million using Pepe (PEPE), one of the most iconic meme coins in circulation. Although the trader didn’t manage to exit at the peak — with PEPE falling over 70% from its all-time high — they still secured a realized profit exceeding $10 million. The success illustrates how, even in a declining market, early entrants and savvy exits can yield massive gains. However, it also shows the volatility and unsustainability of such rallies, which often collapse before retail traders can capitalize. A major inflection point for the meme coin market appears to have been the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token on Jan. 18. The token — which saw an initial surge to $75.35 — has since plummeted over 87%, now trading closer to $9, with an 8% drop recorded in just the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. The Trump meme coin was intended to symbolize a new level of institutionalized meme speculation, coinciding with Trump’s political resurgence. But it may have had the opposite effect, triggering what some are calling the end of the meme coin “supercycle.” Pump.fun, the Solana-based launchpad that powered much of the recent meme coin boom, saw a peak in user activity around the week of Trump’s inauguration. According to Binance Research , the platform was responsible for over 70% of newly launched tokens during the height of the frenzy. But since that peak, active wallets have nearly halved — dropping from 2.85 million in the week of Jan. 20 to 1.44 million by the end of March. A Supercycle in Decline What was once a $100 billion market for meme coins has deflated dramatically. The sector has dropped below $44 billion in total market cap. The collapse has been fueled not only by disillusionment over Trump-linked tokens, but also by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. The US economy has been rocked by historic volatility, with a record-setting $5 trillion wiped from global equities in early April amid fears over Trump’s aggressive tariff plans. Such turbulence has driven investors to favor more conservative assets like stablecoins, with on-chain data showing a growing shift into USDC and other fiat-backed tokens. Still, the speculative appetite that fuels the meme coin world hasn’t disappeared entirely — it's merely become more agile, more selective, and more wary. While many analysts believe the meme coin supercycle has likely peaked, the nature of crypto markets makes it dangerous to write off the asset class completely. Historically, meme coins have shown a remarkable ability to return from the dead — often sparked by unexpected cultural moments, viral influencers, or new launch mechanisms. For now, the smartest players in the game are still participating — but with faster fingers on the exit button.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 05:00:00

The decline occurred days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced massive new import tariffs, which sparked concerns about a new trade war and a slowdown in the world economy. The crypto market initially showed some resilience last week, with traders speculating that Bitcoin might act as a “safe haven” as tech stocks slumped. But by Sunday night on Apr. 6, that narrative had flipped. As U.S. stock futures opened in early Asia hours, markets turned red. The Nasdaq 100 contracts fell 5% and both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones futures each dropped more than 4%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 sank 6%, Australia’s ASX 200 fell 5%, and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 4.4%, as per Yahoo Finance data . Bitcoin followed, crashing alongside the stock markets. According to Coinglass data , nearly $778 million in long crypto positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours, marking the largest wipeout in nearly six weeks. Other major crypto assets also suffered, with Solana ( SOL ) plunging to as low as $107 and Ethereun ( ETH ) falling to $1,538, its lowest since October 2023.

Financial markets have been alarmed by the aggressive move, and investors are preparing for prolonged economic instability. As the markets reeled, “Black Monday” began trending on X, with users referencing the infamous 1987 crash when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 22.6% in a single day, the largest one-day percentage drop in U.S. stock market history. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, in an Apr. 7 post on X, warned of an “economic nuclear winter” if Trump’s policies continue. “We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world,” he posted. The country is 100% behind the president on fixing a global system of tariffs that has disadvantaged the country. But, business is a confidence game and confidence depends on trust. President @realDonaldTrump has elevated the tariff issue to the most important geopolitical… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) April 6, 2025 Sentiment has also soured in crypto circles. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid 11 points to 23, reflecting “extreme fear.” Still, not everyone is bearish. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes suggested in an Apr. 4 post on X that the turmoil could eventually drive more investors to Bitcoin as a hedge against centralized policies. Whether that breakout comes soon or not, Bitcoin’s resilience will be tested in the days ahead.

The futures contract due to expire on the last Friday of April began trading at $79,590, down 5.6% from Friday's close of $84,250 and quickly descended to $76,800, CoinDesk data show. The losses came as Dow futures fell 900 points, Chinese stocks crashed, and the Japanese equity market slipped into lower circuit breakers as JPMorgan, S&P Global, and Goldman Sachs increased the probability of the U.S. falling into recession this year. On Sunday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he wanted to solve the trade deficit with China ""and unless we solve that problem, I'm not going to make a deal."" Trump added that world leaders are dying to make a deal. Last week, the President announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations, boosting the total levy on China to 54%. Since then, financial markets have wilted, which the President thinks is the necessary medicine to solve the problem. ""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said. Open interest slides on CME Open interest in the CME futures peaked in December at 281.57 BTC and has since declined to 140.5K, the lowest since August 2024, according to data source Coinglass . It's a sign of money leaving the digital assets space, perhaps in anticipation of a deeper price swoon. Meanwhile, global futures and perpetual futures open interest, excluding CME, has increased from roughly 400K BTC to 520 BTC in the past four weeks. An increase in open interest alongside a price drop is said to confirm the bearish trend, indicating that traders are building short positions in a falling market.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|CME,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 05:03:56

The $REAL token, developed by the Real World Gaming DAO (RWG), raised $392,315 in USDC over a 28-hour sealed-bid auction—less than 40% of its $1.008 million minimum raise and just over 10% of the $3.6 million fundraising goal. As per RWG’s announcement, 668 participants took part in the auction. We need to be real. We didn't hit our minimum raise. All bids will be refunded in full. This is not the end. — Real World Gaming (@getrealtoken) April 6, 2025 Developers Promise Full Refund The presale aimed to distribute 60 million $REAL tokens—3% of the total 2 billion supply—at a starting bid price of $0.06, valuing the project at a fully diluted $120 million. With the minimum threshold unmet, RWG confirmed all bids would be refunded. The token received notable backing from Conor McGregor , who promoted it to his combined following of nearly 57 million across X and Instagram. The project also claimed support from major Web3 firms including Animoca Brands and KuCoin Labs. Timing of Meme Coin Launch Coincides With Broader Market Meltdown Despite this backing, the launch occurred during a volatile market phase . The broader crypto sector faced sharp declines last week, with Bitcoin and U.S. equities both posting losses. Concurrently, meme coin activity continued to taper off after a series of high-profile controversies and fading investor interest. The $REAL project positioned itself as a utility token tied to RWG’s gaming and entertainment initiatives, with developers promising integration into McGregor’s personal brand ecosystem. However, skepticism from parts of the crypto community—especially online analysts—appeared to contribute to dampened enthusiasm. RWG said in a public statement that the effort is ongoing and that the failed presale does not mark the end of the project’s ambitions. Further plans or a revised strategy have not yet been announced.

According to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, customers affected by the latest development are those who failed to commence their know-your-customer (KYC) verification process by the deadline, which passed a month ago. FTX Expunges Customer Claims The bankruptcy estate said it is disallowing and expunging claims belonging to users who did not start their KYC by March 3. The KYC commencing deadline was initially fixed for March 1 but eventually extended to March 3. Although the value of the unverified claims was initially estimated to be around $1 billion, FTX creditor activist Sunil Kavuri has disclosed a higher worth. He said claims less than $50,000 amount to $655 million, while those above $50,000 are up to $1.9 billion. The total number of customers affected by the expungement is above 392,000, and FTX filed their details in a document spanning 2,377 pages. While claims for users who have failed to start their KYC procedures have been disallowed, more customers are bound to face the same fate if they do not complete their identity verification processes by June 1. The bankruptcy estate insists that customers must submit the necessary KYC documents before receiving their claims. “Claims listed on Schedule 1 to the Order but not included on Exhibit A attached hereto may still be subject to disallowance if the holder of any such claim does not submit all KYC information requested by the FTX Recovery Trust or its KYC vendors on or prior to June 1, 2025, at 4:00 p.m. (ET),” the estate stated in the filing. Bankruptcy Estate Insists on Account Verification FTX’s customer repayments have been ongoing since January 3, 2025, with the estate intending to distribute between $12.6 billion and about $16.5 billion to users. As approved by the court, FTX customers are receiving cash based on the value of their crypto holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022. The entity’s interim CEO, John Ray, insisted that customer accounts need to be verified during the repayment process because the company’s former leadership did not conduct due diligence on users and failed to collect information about the source of funds.

The wider Asia stock market recorded palpable losses as more investors fled the highly volatile global equity market towards bonds and gold markets. For instance, the Shanghai Composite index had dropped around 6.34 percent to trade about 3,130.17 on Monday during the early Asian trading session. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was heavily impacted by the ongoing stock market rout. At the time of this writing, the HSI had dropped around 10.70 percent to trade about 20,404. Expected Impact on Western Financial Markets After China retaliated against the U.S. tariff trade last week, the European Union is expected to announce its reciprocal tariffs this week. Although some nations have opted to negotiate with the United States, major economies are likely to follow in the footsteps of Beijing in the coming days. Consequently, the U.S. stock market is expected to take more hits later today, especially on major indexes led by the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq. “Big Wall Street trading desks will be manned in time for tonight’s futures open.

Over $800M Liquidated appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Markets crashed on Monday after President Trump announced major new tariffs. China hit back quickly, slapping 34% duties on all U.S. imports starting April 10. The rising tension has investors worried about a full-blown trade war. The sudden drop comes just a day after reports claimed Bitcoin was breaking away from the S&P 500 and acting more like a safe haven asset. Bitcoin has taken a sharp dive plunging over 10% to below $78,000 after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs. This comes despite his pro-crypto stance, including appointing supportive regulators and backing digital assets. But economic uncertainty is taking a toll on investor confidence, and many are now rethinking their positions as tariffs start to weigh heavily on the crypto market. In a massive market bloodbath, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have plunged 6–12% today. With over $900 million in liquidations, analysts are beginning to question Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” and a safe haven asset. Bitcoin Down Over 6% Bitcoin is down 6.9% in the past 24 hours, now hovering at a key support level of $77,500. Trading volume has skyrocketed 220%, topping $44 billion, while BTC’s 24 hour liquidations have hit $322 million, according to Coinglass . With $77,500 acting as a crucial support on the charts, analysts warn that if BTC breaks below this level, a deeper correction could be on the way. Altcoins Hit Hard, ETH Crashes 13%! Altcoins are taking a big hit. Ethereum (ETH) has crashed 13.5% to $1,550, now down over 53% this year. Investors fear it could drop to $1,100–$1,300, though whale activity shows some are buying the dip. XRP is down 14.5%, falling below $2, with a possible slide to $0.65. Solana has dropped 14% to $102, and Dogecoin is down 16% to $0.143, as the altcoin market faces heavy losses. Is The Bull Run Over? Recently, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shared in an X post that the bull run is likely over, based on on-chain data. He points to a rising Realized Cap and flat market cap as signs that bears are in control. Ju believes this downtrend could last up to six months, lowering hopes for a quick recovery Despite the price swings, many long-term investors are staying confident.

The sell-off is not localized to cryptocurrencies but also across the global stock markets, triggering cricuit breakers in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Russel Futures and even in Singapore. What’s next for Ethereum (ETH) price prediction? Should you buy the dip? Ethereum Price Suffers Amid Stock & Crypto Market Collapse In the early Asian session, Bitcoin price slipped below $80K, Ethereum price hit $1,520 as the stock and crypto markets plummeted in reaction to Trump’s tariffs. As a result of this steep sell-off, the authorities triggered circuit breakers, aka halting trading when markets fall rapidly. Cricuit breakers were triggered in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Singapore and in Russel Futures. S&P 500 circuit breakers are market-wide trading halts triggered at three levels – a 7% drop pauses trading for 15 minutes, a 13% drop halts for another 15 minutes, and a 20% drop stops trading for the day. But there are no circuit breakers in the cryptocurrency markets , which often leads to massive selloff especially if the leverage in the market is high. As seen, ETH’s value has crashed nearly 20% in the past 21 hours and currently trades at $1,520. Is this a good place to buy ETH? Let’s explore Ethereum price predictions and key levels to watch. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch The weekly chart for Ethereum price shows that ETH is close to a key support level at $1,504. This is the midpoint of the $1,073 to $1,934 range created between July 2022 & October 2023. The next critical support level is the orderblock at $1,278 formed in mid-December 2022. This demand zone was followed by a 77% rally in under four months. Hence, a revisit of this level could see a strong buying pressure that could absorb the selling pressure. If the above two key levels fail to support ETH price, then the range low at $1,073 will be the final line of defense. Ethereum price prediction remains bearish so long as any of these levels absorb selling pressure and allow ETH bulls to form a base. ETH/USDT 1-week chart If Trump’s tariffs do not stop, then a selling frenzy could make all of the aforementioned support levels meaningless. However, there is one hope for cryptocurrency as Bitcoin is as an uncorrelated asset . If demand flows into BTC amid times of uncertainty, it could fuel Ethereum price recovery rally as well.

Among the growing list of under-$1 tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a favorite among traders who are looking for more than just speculation. Backed by real use cases, a clear utility model, and innovative token mechanics, many now consider MUTM one of the most promising DeFi projects entering the market in 2025. So what exactly is setting Mutuum Finance apart—and why are investors positioning themselves early? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the heart of Mutuum’s protocol is a dual lending structure that includes both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Each one serves a different purpose but contributes to the protocol’s overall flexibility and reach. In the P2C structure, users contribute their assets to collective liquidity pools. These funds are then made available to borrowers who meet overcollateralization standards. Interest rates adjust based on the pool’s utilization, meaning earnings and borrowing costs are directly influenced by market demand. This system supports more established cryptocurrencies like ETH, USDC, or DAI and offers a lower-friction experience for those seeking predictable lending outcomes. But it’s in the P2P model where Mutuum really opens things up. Here, lenders and borrowers negotiate terms directly. It’s ideal for supplying or borrowing more speculative assets, such as SHIB or PEPE, which wouldn’t typically be supported in traditional pooled lending. This approach not only diversifies the available assets on the platform but also unlocks opportunities for memecoin holders to put their tokens to work—without relying on centralized exchanges. Another unique aspect of the Mutuum ecosystem is the development of its own overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar and built on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin will be minted when users lock up excess collateral within the lending protocol, giving them access to on-chain liquidity without liquidating their core holdings. Unlike many other stablecoin models that depend on external reserves or custodians, Mutuum’s version is entirely decentralized. The stablecoin supply adjusts automatically: it is minted during borrowing and burned upon repayment or liquidation. This mechanism keeps the peg stable while ensuring that all tokens in circulation are backed by assets already secured on-chain. Interest generated from stablecoin loans flows directly into the protocol’s treasury rather than individual lenders, supporting the overall financial strength of the platform and enabling future reinvestment strategies that benefit long-term holders. Why Traders Are Buying MUTM at $0.025 The token powering this entire system, MUTM, is still priced at just $0.025—making it an early-stage opportunity with high growth potential. The presale has already attracted thousands of participants, with over 7,800 holders and more than $6.1 million raised. As the price is set to increase in the next presale phase, those getting in now are securing the most favorable entry point before the protocol goes live. Beyond the price, the tokenomics are designed with sustainability in mind. A portion of protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to users who actively participate, such as mtToken stakers. This creates a self-sustaining cycle where usage drives value, and value incentivizes further usage. Unlike many tokens that struggle to define their purpose, MUTM is tied to a functioning, evolving platform that serves a growing demand: decentralized access to crypto credit and yield. Its P2C and P2P options offer users flexibility depending on their asset types and risk profiles, while the stablecoin provides a native way to tap liquidity without introducing new layers of complexity. This blend of usability, flexibility, and community-led growth is why traders are taking notice—and why MUTM is being viewed as one of the best investments under $1 right now. As DeFi adoption expands and the platform gears up for its beta launch, the momentum is clearly building in Mutuum’s favor. For those looking to get ahead of the next wave, this may be the time to pay close attention.

This came after the US announced sweeping tariffs last week, prompting retaliation from major economies and raising concerns about a potential global trade conflict that could hinder economic growth. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) retreated below 78,000, mirroring the broader market selloff that has shaken investor confidence. Gold dropped more than 1% to below $3000 in the early Monday session in Asia as investors offloaded bullion to offset losses from a broader market downturn triggered by escalating trade tensions and growing fears of a global recession. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 6.74% to below 30,000 on Monday, hitting its lowest levels since October 2023. The Japanese yen strengthened to around 145 per dollar on Monday before retreating toward 147, remaining volatile as the market turmoil triggered by an escalating global trade war intensified. Domestically, Japan saw accelerated nominal wage growth in February rose 3.1% year-on-year, offering a positive outlook for the economy, which is under pressure from global trade uncertainties. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to visit the U.S. soon to present a trade proposal and urge President Trump to reconsider a 24% tariff on Japanese imports. Japan’s foreign reserves increased by $19.23 billion to $1.27 trillion in March 2025, hitting the highest level since April last year. Japan's index of coincident economic indicators, which tracks factory output, employment, and retail sales, increased to 116.9 in February 2025 from a final 116.1 in the previous month, flash data showed. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 6.56%,to below 3,200 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 7.3% to 9,610 in post-holiday trade on Monday, with mainland stocks tracking the global selloff as the trade war intensified, and the offshore yuan depreciated around 7.32 per dollar, hitting its lowest level in two months. Markets are bracing for deeper trade disruptions, especially after China announced a 34% tariff on all US imports starting April 10, alongside export controls on rare earths. Additionally, Beijing added 16 American firms to its export control list and labeled 11 more as ""unreliable entities."" Trump quickly denounced the response, calling it the “wrong” move. Furthermore, China indicated it might lower borrowing costs and reserve requirements for lenders to mitigate the economic effects of U.S. tariffs, with potential cuts to key policy rates and fiscal expansion. China’s foreign exchange reserves rose by USD 13.4 billion to USD 3.241 trillion in March 2025, up from USD 3.227 trillion in February, marking the highest level since last November. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 10.91%, to 20,710 in early trading on Monday, marking a second session of steep losses and hitting their lowest in two months. The selloff reflected widespread panic across sectors, as investors fled riskier assets amid an escalating global trade war and growing fears of a recession. India ( SENSEX ) fell 4.05% to 72,535 in early deals on Monday, falling for the third straight session and weighed down by all sectors. Traders braced for the imposition of a 26% reciprocal tariff on India, set to take effect on April 9. India is unlikely to immediately retaliate against President Trump’s recent 26% tariff on US imports from India and is instead focusing on negotiating a bilateral trade deal to lower duties, Reuters said, quoting a government official. However, the RBI is expected to cut the interest rate by 25 bps to 6% at Wednesday's meeting. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 4.19% hitting the lowest level since December 2023, extending losses for the third session. The Australian dollar fell to around $0.60 on Monday, its lowest level since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red , markets were shaken by trade war fears, and U.S. stocks deepened their sell-off on Friday, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the economic impact could exceed expectations U.S. stock futures tumbled sharply on Monday, with the White House showing no signs of backing down, even after a two-day rout on Wall Street triggered by President Trump’s sweeping tariffs on major trading partners: Dow -2.88%; S&P 500 -3.58%; Nasdaq -4.51%.

The downturn sparked panic among investors, pushing the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index into “extreme fear” territory. Analysts are now watching closely, with mixed views on whether the market will see a deeper crash or begin to stabilize. The current sentiment reflects high uncertainty and caution amid growing macroeconomic concerns. April 7, 2025 06:10:07 UTC Global Markets Plunge as Trump’s Tariffs Trigger Chaos Global stock markets tumbled sharply following President Donald Trump’s new tariff measures. China’s stock market opened with a 10% drop, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 futures hit circuit breakers, halting trading. Trump defended the tariffs, claiming they generate revenue for the U.S. and help fix trade imbalances with China and the EU. Despite the market fallout, the President signaled he’s willing to accept short-term volatility to push his broader economic strategy forward. April 7, 2025 06:10:07 UTC Trump Tariff Announcement Triggers Market Panic Crypto analyst Lark Davis commented on the sudden market crash, calling Trump’s tariff board reveal a “Black Swan” event. Last week, markets briefly reacted positively, thinking tariffs would be limited to 10%. However, once Trump displayed much higher numbers, panic set in. Davis noted that this unexpected move shocked investors and led to a sharp selloff. He added that the focus now shifts to finding a new market bottom after this surprise trigger. April 7, 2025 06:03:21 UTC Crypto Liquidations Top $1B as Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $77K In the past 24 hours, the crypto market witnessed a brutal shakeout with over $1 billion in liquidations, including $865 million from long positions. Bitcoin led the crash, plunging sharply from above $83,000 to under $77,000. The sudden drop triggered mass liquidations, impacting over 323,000 traders. Rising global trade tensions and bearish technical setups have amplified market fears, signaling more downside ahead for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the coming days. April 7, 2025 05:54:59 UTC Why Ethereum is Going Down? An Ether whale lost 67,570 ETH (around $106M) after being liquidated on the DeFi platform Sky, formerly Maker, due to a 14% ETH price crash. The investor’s collateral ratio dropped below the required 150% to 144%, triggering liquidation. Another whale is close to liquidation after borrowing DAI against 56,995 WETH. ETH has fallen to $1,547, its lowest since October 2023. Over 320,000 traders were liquidated in 24 hours, totaling nearly $1B, mainly from ETH positions. April 7, 2025 05:44:49 UTC Nikkei 225 Crashes Over 2,000 Points, Hits 18-Month Low ​On April 7, 2025, Japan’s financial markets experienced significant turmoil. The Nikkei 225 index plummeted by over 2,000 points, dropping below the 32,000 mark—a decline of approximately 6.67%—reaching an 18-month low of 31,527.49. This sharp downturn triggered the Osaka Stock Exchange’s circuit breaker mechanism, resulting in a temporary suspension of Nikkei 225 and Topix futures trading due to excessive volatility. April 7, 2025 05:14:00 UTC Why is Crypto Crashing Today? ​On April 7, 2025, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn following the Trump administration’s announcement of new global tariffs, which heightened investor concerns about a potential global recession. Bitcoin dropped below $80,000, reaching approximately $79,000—a 5% decline over 24 hours—while Ethereum fell 11% to around $1,590. This sell-off led to over $745 million in bullish crypto positions being liquidated within a day. ​ April 7, 2025 05:14:00 UTC Bitcoin Price USD Dips After Trump’s Tariff Stance Shakes Crypto Market Bitcoin price USD dropped sharply in the last 24 hours as the crypto market reacted to US President Trump’s continued push for restrictive tariffs. Just weeks after a major rally driven by Trump’s new strategic reserve plan, the market reversed, wiping out over half a trillion dollars in value. This sharp decline triggered massive liquidations, with Bitcoin alone facing $250 million in long positions wiped out, according to CoinGlass data.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 05:24:39

The investment management giant bought over 83,157 shares of Coinbase, taking Coinbase’s closing price on Friday. According to the company’s latest disclosures, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) purchased 54,988 shares worth $8.8 million. Two other ETFs – the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) – have acquired 15,982 shares for $2.5 million and 12,187 shares for $2 million respectively. Here’s what moves Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made today 4/4 pic.twitter.com/HsS3Hlopbj — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) April 5, 2025 Ark Invest ‘Buy the Dip’ Investment Strategy The significant purchase comes at a time when crypto markets are witnessing a sharp plunge, as global markets reel from President Trump’s sweeping new tariff policies. Bitcoin is holding precariously above the $77,000 mark after experiencing a sharp 6% slump in 24 hours, per Coinmarketcap data. Further, Ark Invest also bought 54,120 shares of Amzon.com (AMZN) worth $9 million on Friday. Cathie Wood’s last two Amazon purchases were made in February when the company’s stock fell from an all-time high following a disappointing outlook. Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward. The Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech firms in fields including blockchain, tech and AI. Coinbase is “Second Largest Holdings” Within ARKF Fund Last month, Ark Invest scooped up $11.5 million in Coinbase shares at the time when COINn plunged more than 17%. The company seized the opportunity to buy the dip in COIN, acquiring 64,358 shares across two of its ETFs. Ark has been continuously accumulating Coinbase stock, with $8.7 million for its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) in February. Besides, Ark Invest restricts any single holding to no more than 10% of a fund’s portfolio. Further, within the ARKF fund, COIN is now the second-largest holding, comprising 9.4% of the fund. The fund’s top holding is Shopify, comprising 13% of the fund.

The markets recorded a consecutive 10% drop on the second day, reflecting a historic rarity that has occurred only four times in history: October 1987, October 2008, March 2020, and now in April 2025. It is important to note that all of the previous events led to significant stock market crashes, such as the ‘Black Friday’ in 1987, the 2008 housing bubble, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. These led to a major drop, which kept the markets consolidated for a long time. Now the question arises whether the 2025-Tariff war may have a similar impact on the global stock markets and the crypto markets. Crypto Market No More Decentralised Ever since the entry of the institutions, the crypto market has become more centralized, with a large chunk of BTC being held by major 4 to 5 companies. Microstatergy had begun to accumulate after the March 2020 crash in September 2020 that triggered the 2021 bull run. Since then, the company has been accumulating aggressively and now holds over 500,000 BTC, 2.25% of the total supply. Besides, a similar amount of BTC is being held by Blackrock’s (IBIT) shares, which could be a matter of concern. Previously, the crypto markets gained strength while the stock markets faced some turbulence. However, the growing correlation between the markets suggests that more dreadful days are on the horizon as the stock markets are predicted to face another 15% to 20% plunge in the coming days. What’s Next for Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Rally? After losing the pivotal support at $81,017, the Bitcoin price continued to drop, hinting at testing the support at $76,763. Meanwhile, the bulls triggered a rebound at $76,666, but the possibility of an extended bearish trend persists. The price has entered a ‘Do or Die’ range, which may confirm whether the ongoing pullback is a healthy correction or the beginning of a bear market. The historical chart of Bitcoin suggests the price is in real danger. The current global markets have left no room for a rebound, and hence, the lower targets have been activated. The weekly Ichimoku Cloud is heading for a bearish crossover, while the weekly RSI dropped below 45 for the first time since the rise in early 2023. Interestingly, the RSI plunged to the lower threshold only in times of a bear market, back in 2018, 2020 and 2022. If the levels fail to hold at 40, then the RSI is feared to reach 30, which may drag the BTC price below $70,000. Hence, the current market sentiments are extremely fearful and hence, holding can be the perfect strategy one can apply instead of panic selling. However, once the conditions improve, the Bitcoin (BTC) price will rebound and rise.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 05:31:27

Uyeda has instructed the agency’s staff to review a series of past statements regarding cryptocurrency risks and the application of securities laws to digital assets. The review is being conducted under Executive Order 14192, titled “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,” and follows recommendations from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The aim, Uyeda said, is to determine whether current guidance should be “modified or rescinded” to better align with the agency’s current regulatory priorities. Among the key documents under review is a 2019 staff framework outlining how the SEC applies the Howey test to determine whether a digital asset qualifies as a security. The Howey test, a decades-old legal standard, evaluates whether an investment involves an expectation of profit based primarily on the efforts of others. The SEC’s application of this test to digital assets has long been controversial, particularly amid recent revelations that memecoins are largely exempt from securities regulations. Related News: What Will Happen If Tether (USDT) Is Delisted in the US? CEO Announces Emergency Plan Another important document that is being reevaluated is a 2021 SEC staff memorandum warning investors about mutual funds with exposure to Bitcoin futures. The letter had previously raised doubts about the maturity of the Bitcoin futures market, citing risks such as market manipulation, liquidity concerns, and volatility. However, since then, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have launched and grown rapidly, with assets under management reaching tens of billions of dollars. Uyeda’s directive also takes aim at end-2022 guidance issued in the wake of several major crypto bankruptcies that advised companies to disclose risks associated with digital assets, particularly those related to custody, liquidity, reputational damage and increased regulatory scrutiny. *This is not investment advice.

This sudden downturn has triggered panic among investors, driven largely by renewed macroeconomic concerns. Fresh trade tensions following aggressive tariff announcements from President Donald Trump, coupled with unexpected geopolitical developments, have rattled both traditional and crypto markets alike. What’s Next For ETH Price? Currently, Ethereum is approaching a critical support zone that has previously held strong, particularly around the $1,520 to $1,540 range. This level was important in early and late 2023 and is now under pressure. If ETH fails to hold above this zone, the next major downside target would be around $1,400. The situation took a turn for the worse after ETH broke below the $1,870 to $1,880 range, a key Fibonacci level that previously provided support. This breach signaled a bearish trend, with analysts predicting a move toward the $1,520–$1,540 region, which is now playing out as expected. The RSI has now entered oversold territory, which, while indicating potential for a short-term bounce, doesn’t guarantee a market bottom. For instance, in March, despite the RSI being oversold, ETH experienced a brief recovery before facing further declines. Whales Offload ETH In line with the market’s downturn, an Ethereum whale faced a staggering $106 million liquidation on Maker over the weekend, involving 67,570 ETH.

The reports come a day after Trump said he won't make a trade deal with China unless the trade deficit is solved.

The Ether ( ETH ) whale lost 67,570 ETH worth around $106 million when the asset crashed by around 14% on April 6, liquidating his collateralized debt position on Sky, according to Maker Vaults explorer DeFi Explore, and as observed by Lookonchain. The Sky lending protocol, which rebranded from Maker in August, is used by DeFi participants to create collateralized debt positions by providing crypto, ETH in this case, to borrow the platform’s stablecoin, DAI ( DAI ). The system uses an overcollateralization ratio, typically 150% or higher, meaning that users need to deposit at least $150 worth of ETH to borrow 100 DAI. The protocol autonomously monitors the value of ETH collateral relative to the borrowed DAI, and if the ETH value falls and the collateral ratio drops below the minimum requirement, the position becomes eligible for liquidation. This whale’s liquidation occurred when the ratio fell to 144% as the price of ETH plummeted. ETH whale liquidations. Source: DeFi Explore Meanwhile, Spot On Chain reported that another whale that supplied 56,995 wrapped ETH, worth around $91 million, to borrow DAI was on the verge of liquidation. In a liquidation event, Sky seizes the ETH collateral, which is auctioned off to pay back the borrowed DAI plus fees. Any remaining collateral after the debt is paid is returned to the user. Ethereum price at bear market lows ETH prices have crashed a whopping 14.5% over the past 24 hours, falling to $1,547 at the time of writing as the wider crypto market melts down in reaction to US President Donald Trump’s tariff-induced market sell-off . The last time ETH traded this low was in October 2023, when crypto was still deep in bear market territory, almost a year after the collapse of the FTX exchange. ETH remains down 68% from its all-time high in 2021, and further losses are likely to see more DeFi users liquidated unless they can provide more collateral.

This move attracted a lot of criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who warned it weakens consumer protections. Meanwhile, controversy also surrounds the SEC’s new stablecoin guidelines, which exempt certain stablecoins from securities regulations. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw criticized the guidance as misleading, but many people in the crypto industry still welcomed it as a step toward clarity. Additionally, others in the industry increasingly consider stablecoins as a strategic asset to boost US dollar dominance globally. Trump Administration Sidelines CFPB The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is expected to play a reduced role in crypto regulation as federal and state-level agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) take on more responsibility. This is according to Ethan Ostroff, a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke law firm. Ostroff explained in an interview that under the current Trump administration, regulatory dynamics are shifting. This means that the CFPB will likely scale back its involvement in crypto oversight in favor of these other authorities. Although the CFPB may see diminished influence, it will not be completely dismantled due to statutory obligations that can only be altered by Congress. Ostroff also explained that while state regulators have the authority under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) to assume some roles typically held by the CFPB, certain responsibilities will remain with the bureau by law. This changing regulatory landscape reflects the administrative agenda under the Trump administration, which includes efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut government spending and reduce federal debt. As part of this initiative, newly appointed CFPB head Russell Vought quickly introduced major funding cuts and scaled back the agency’s operations upon taking office in February of 2025. The scaling down of the CFPB sparked a lot of political backlash. Most of this backlash came from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who co-founded the agency in 2007. Warren criticized Elon Musk, and accused him of enabling the dismantling of the bureau. In a recent interview with Mother Jones, Warren compared Musk to a ”bank robber” and warned that the administration's actions are made to weaken consumer protection measures and centralize control over the financial system. She also believes that despite these efforts, the executive branch does not actually have the authority to fully eliminate the CFPB without Congressional approval. SEC Divides Opinions with New Stablecoin Rules SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw also recently voiced strong opposition to the agency’s newly released guidelines on stablecoins, and even accused the regulator of downplaying systemic risks and misrepresenting the true nature of the USD-stablecoin market. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a real-world asset, usually a fiat currency like the US dollar. Stablecoins aim to combine the price stability of traditional money with the speed and flexibility of digital assets. This makes them very popular for trading, remittances, and storing value. In a statement that was issued on April 4, Crenshaw criticized the SEC’s conclusions as legally and factually flawed. She argued that the guidance paints an inaccurate and overly optimistic picture of stablecoin stability and redeemability. Part of Crenshaw’s statement (Source: SEC ) The new SEC guidelines state that stablecoins meeting specific criteria are now considered ”non-securities” and are exempt from certain transaction reporting requirements. While Crenshaw condemned this approach as misleading, many people in the crypto industry welcomed the development. Industry figures like Token Metrics founder Ian Ballina and Vemanti CEO Tan Tran described the move as a positive, albeit delayed, step toward regulatory clarity. Midnight Network’s Ian Kane said that it signaled progress for crypto businesses seeking to remain compliant. Crenshaw took particular issue with the SEC's characterization of stablecoin accessibility, and pointed out that most USD-stablecoins are not purchased directly from issuers but instead via intermediaries like crypto trading platforms. She explained that more than 90% of stablecoins in circulation are distributed this way, which makes the SEC’s claim that direct-to-consumer access is a norm highly inaccurate. She also criticized the SEC’s reassurance that stablecoin reserves matching or exceeding circulating supply guarantee stability. Crenshaw warned that claims like these ignore crucial financial indicators like issuer liabilities and risk exposure from proprietary activities. She held firm that stablecoins inherently carry risk, particularly during market turbulence, and suggested that the new guidance may give users a false sense of security. The controversy came just weeks after Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, reportedly began working with a Big Four accounting firm to audit its reserves. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that the audit process will likely be more streamlined under the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration. Stablecoins Seen as Key to US Dollar Dominance On the other hand, stablecoins are stepping up as a key strategic asset for maintaining the United States dollar’s dominance in global financial markets, according to Bryan Pellegrino, the CEO and founder of LayerZero Labs. In a recent interview , Pellegrino described stablecoins as the most powerful tool that is currently available to extend the reach of the US dollar, especially in countries plagued by inflation like Argentina and Venezuela. He referred to stablecoins as a “Trojan Horse” or “vampire attack” on weaker fiat currencies, and argued that their cross-border accessibility naturally drives global demand for the US dollar. LayerZero Labs, which developed the LayerZero interoperability protocol, was recently selected by the state of Wyoming to facilitate the distribution of its Wyoming stablecoin. Pellegrino said that he expects increasing support for stablecoins at both the federal and state levels, as they enhance the dollar’s position in foreign exchange markets and fortify its role as the world’s reserve currency. As an example of growing demand, Pellegrino pointed to Tether’s ascent as one of the largest buyers of US Treasury bills. It even surpassed countries like Canada, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. Tether became the seventh-largest holder of US Treasuries, which certainly proves the big role stablecoin issuers now play in financing US debt. The strategic value of stablecoins was also a major topic of conversation at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Here, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that leveraging stablecoins to preserve and expand US dollar hegemony will be a top priority for the Trump administration in 2025. (Source: Chainalysis ) Data from a 2023 Chainalysis report revealed that more than 50% of digital asset value transferred to Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, was denominated in stablecoins. Their low fees, relative stability, and fast settlement times make stablecoins especially attractive for remittances and savings in nations that are struggling with inflation and capital controls.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 05:44:19

Macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from a global tariff war — dubbed an “economic nuclear war"" by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman — is reeling markets from crypto to global equities, with bitcoin under $79,000 and major tokens down 14%. XRP Price Analysis XRP, which powers the XRP Ledger, slipped to $1.90 with a 14%. On the daily chart, XRP has breached its critical support at $2.00 — a level that previously held firm as psychological and technical bedrock. This breakdown completes a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, a signal of potential further downside. Technical indicators reinforce the bearish outlook. The 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) sits at $2.20, acting as a resistance after XRP failed to reclaim it in past weeks. The relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into negative territory, hovering near 30, suggesting selling pressure outweighs buying interest. ADA Price Analysis Cardano’s ADA token trades at 55 cents, down 12% in the past 24 hours, below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a critical support that had propped up the price since mid-March. This breach on the daily chart aligns with a broader descending triangle pattern, hinting at continued bearish control. The RSI for ADA sits at 38, teetering on the edge of oversold territory, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line dipping below the MACD line. The next support lies at nearly 35 cents, a level tested in late 2024, but a break below could drag ADA toward $0.40, a 30% drop from current levels. Bulls would need to reclaim 60 cents and flip it into support to negate the bearish thesis, though macroeconomic headwinds — fueled by tariff threats and a 20% crypto market cap loss this year — make that a tall order. DOGE Price Analysis Memecoin darling dogecoin (DOGE) has tumbled to $0.16, down nearly 15% in the last 24 hours. It sliced through support at 18 cents, a level that marked the base of a consolidation range since early March. On the 4-hour chart, a death cross has emerged, with the 50-period SMA crossing below the 200-period SMA, signaling a potential trend reversal to the downside. The RSI for DOGE is deep in oversold territory at 28, hinting at possible short-term relief, but the 20-day EMA at $0.21 looms as a stiff resistance. If bears maintain control, DOGE could sink to $0.14, aligning with its December 2024 lows.",Markets|XRP|ADA|DOGE,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 05:49:22

After previously warning that Bitcoin could “lose a zero,” McGlone is now turning heads with his latest insights. This time, he’s highlighting gold’s growing strength as it challenges the dominance of traditional stocks. His latest analysis comes as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, experiences a sharp decline, plunging 8.5% to $77,470 . With market conditions shifting rapidly, McGlone questions if investors are choosing the right assets or if they’re betting on the wrong assets at the wrong time. Gold Gaining Edge Over Risky Assets According to McGlone’s recent analysis, we may be witnessing a significant paradigm shift in asset valuations. He suggests that risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies might be due for a price correction after being overvalued for a long time. When paradigm shifts happen, probably best not to chance being on the wrong side of history, especially if it's simple mean reversion of silly expensive risk assets. #Cryptocurrencies are among the riskiest. Treasuries the opposite. Michael Saylor is all in #Bitcoin , Warren… pic.twitter.com/73do1sBtIk — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) April 6, 2025 Meanwhile, safer investment options like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds are becoming more attractive to cautious investors. McGlone’s attached chart shows how gold has performed compared to stocks (S&P 500) over the years. The gold-to-stocks ratio has historically seen major breakouts during periods of economic uncertainty, proving its status as a safe-haven asset. The data now hint that gold might be gearing up for another strong rise, possibly outperforming stocks soon. Bitcoin vs. Treasuries: A Better Pick! McGlone also compares the investment choices of two major financial figures, Michael Saylor and Warren Buffett. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has placed significant bets on the cryptocurrency, whereas Buffett remains steadfast in his commitment to U.S. Treasury bonds. McGlone aligns himself with the latter, viewing Treasury bonds as a more stable investment in uncertain times. Bitcoin Could Lose a Zero This isn’t the first time McGlone has warned about Bitcoin’s future. Earlier, he predicted it might “lose a zero, ” suggesting a major drop. As McGlone recalls, the Nasdaq hit 5,000 in 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst. Now, he compares Bitcoin’s rise to the Nasdaq’s peak before the dot-com crash. He points out that Bitcoin was born after the 2008 financial crisis, and now he believes the market may have peaked, as Bitcoin recently hit $100,000 before pulling back, hinting at a possible downturn.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 05:51:21

CEO Jack Dorsey has recently shared his thoughts on why Bitcoin would fail if pursued only as a store of value of “digital gold”. Although BTC is often seen as a hedge to the equity market, it has largely moved in tandem with it and is still considered a risk-ON asset considering volatility. Dorsey believes that it’s high time that BTC enters mainstream financial payments. Jack Dorsey on Why Bitcoin Could Fail Twitter co-founder and Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey has stirred fresh debate within the Bitcoin community. Speaking on the Presidio Bitcoin podcast last week with Haley Berkoe, Dorsey argued that Bitcoin must function as more than just a store of value if it is to succeed long term. Dorsey warned that limiting BTC use case to a digital equivalent of gold could lead to its “irrelevance.” According to him, Bitcoin’s true potential lies in its use for payments and everyday transactions. Jack Dorsey said: “I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the every day. Otherwise, it’s just something you kind of buy and forget and only use in emergency situations or when you want to get liquid again. So I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it just gets increasingly irrelevant. And that’s failure to me.” Well, it seems that the Twitter co-founder is clearly challenging the narrative of Bitcoin as a “digital gold” going for long in the global financial market. His remarks revive a long-standing discussion in core Bitcoin circles: is Bitcoin ultimately a medium of exchange, a store of value, or both? Get Back to Bitcoin Whitepaper Jack Dorsey also called for a return to Bitcoin’s original mission, as mentioned in the whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, noting that it needs to prioritize simple and accessible payment solutions that offer speed, privacy, and security. Addressing concerns over volatility and scalability, Dorsey argues that once BTC becomes more accessible, issues like wild Bitcoin price swings will alleviate. He suggested that Bitcoin has drifted from its core vision as a peer-to-peer payment system. Dorsey also urged developers and the broader community to refocus efforts on utility rather than just treating it as a store of value. “There’s tons of stuff we need to do to really get back to the white paper, which is, you know, a system for electronic peer-to-peer digital cash like we have not seen that yet,” he said. BTC Institutional Adoption on The Rise Over the years, BTC’s institutional adoption has also been on the rise, even with new investment products like Bitcoin ETF seeing strong demand in the first year of launch. Amid today’s crypto market crash , BTC price has tanked under $80K, testing its next crucial support levels. As of press time, BTC price is trading 7.5% down at $76,771 with a 260% surge in daily trading volume, shooting all the way to $50 billion. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports a notable uptick in large BTC holders, revealing that 76 new entities holding more than 1,000 BTC have joined the network over the past two months. This marks a 4.6% increase and suggests growing institutional demand for Bitcoin.

43020522,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146779,1744006219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Llama 4: Meta Unleashes Flagship Open Source AI Models,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/llama-4-meta-open-source-ai/,"In a surprising Saturday reveal, tech giant Meta has dropped a bombshell in the AI world: Llama 4 , a brand-new suite of flagship Meta AI models . This latest iteration in the Llama family isn’t just an upgrade; it’s a leap, featuring four distinct models – Scout, Maverick, and the behemoth of them all, Behemoth – each trained on a massive dataset of text, images, and video. What does this mean for the crypto and tech-savvy audience? It signals a powerful shift towards more accessible and capable Open Source AI , potentially impacting everything from decentralized applications to AI-driven crypto trading tools. Unpacking the Power of Llama 4: A New Era of Meta AI Models The buzz around Llama 4 isn’t just hype. Meta claims these models boast a “broad visual understanding” thanks to their diverse training data. Industry whispers suggest that the impressive performance of open models from Chinese AI lab DeepSeek – models rivalling and even surpassing Meta’s previous Llama iterations – lit a fire under Meta’s development team. Fueled by competition, Meta reportedly launched intensive efforts to understand how DeepSeek managed to optimize the cost and deployment of their models like R1 and V3. The result? A new generation of Meta AI models designed for both power and efficiency. Here’s a breakdown of what makes Llama 4 stand out: Open Access for Innovation: Scout and Maverick are readily available on Llama.com and through platforms like Hugging Face. This open access is crucial for developers in the crypto space and beyond, allowing for experimentation and integration into new and existing projects. Enhanced Meta AI Assistant: Meta’s AI assistant, Meta AI, already integrated across platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, has been upgraded to leverage the power of Llama 4 in 40 countries. While multimodal features are currently US-English exclusive, the global rollout indicates Meta’s commitment to widespread AI integration. Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture: Llama 4 marks Meta’s first foray into MoE architecture. This innovative approach divides complex tasks into sub-tasks, handled by smaller, specialized “expert” models. This leads to computational efficiency in both training and query processing, making these powerful models more accessible. Consider Maverick, for instance. It packs a staggering 400 billion total parameters, yet only utilizes 17 billion active parameters across 128 experts. Scout, while smaller, still boasts 17 billion active parameters and 109 billion total parameters. These numbers translate to significant processing power without exorbitant resource demands. Llama 4 vs. the Giants: How Meta’s Open Source AI Stacks Up Meta isn’t shy about pitting Llama 4 against industry titans. According to their internal tests, Maverick, designed for “general assistant and chat” applications, outperforms models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini 2.0 in specific areas like coding, reasoning, multilingual capabilities, long-context understanding, and image benchmarks. However, it’s important to note that it doesn’t quite reach the heights of Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or OpenAI’s GPT-4.5. Scout, on the other hand, carves out its niche with exceptional document summarization and large codebase reasoning abilities. Its standout feature? A massive 10 million token context window. To put that in perspective, Scout can ingest and process images and documents containing millions of words. This capability is game-changing for industries dealing with vast amounts of data, including financial analysis in the crypto market. Here’s a quick comparison table: Model Active Parameters Total Parameters Strengths Hardware Needs Scout 17 Billion 109 Billion Document Summarization, Code Reasoning, 10M Token Context Single Nvidia H100 GPU Maverick 17 Billion (out of 400B total) 400 Billion General Assistant, Chat, Coding, Reasoning Nvidia H100 DGX System Behemoth 288 Billion ~2 Trillion STEM Skills, Math Problem Solving Beefier Hardware (Unreleased) Generative AI and the Question of Bias: Llama 4’s Approach Generative AI models are increasingly scrutinized for biases, and Meta claims to have addressed this head-on with Llama 4 . Interestingly, Meta states they’ve tuned these models to be more willing to engage with “contentious” questions. According to a Meta spokesperson, Llama 4 is designed to provide “helpful, factual responses without judgment,” even on debated political and social topics. This move towards more balanced and less biased AI Chatbots is crucial, especially as concerns about AI censorship and political “wokeness” rise. This adjustment comes amidst accusations from some political figures that AI chatbots are overly biased. The challenge of bias in AI is indeed complex, as even Elon Musk’s xAI has faced difficulties in creating a chatbot free from political leanings. Meta’s efforts to create more responsive and balanced AI Chatbots are a significant step in navigating this intricate landscape. The EU Hurdle and Licensing: Navigating the Open Source AI Landscape However, the path to Open Source AI isn’t without its complexities. Developers in the EU face a significant hurdle: the Llama 4 license prohibits use or distribution for users and companies “domiciled” or with a “principal place of business” in the EU. This restriction likely stems from the EU’s stringent AI and data privacy regulations, which Meta has previously criticized as overly burdensome. Furthermore, similar to previous Llama releases, companies with over 700 million monthly active users need to request a special license from Meta, which Meta can approve or deny at its discretion. Conclusion: Llama 4 – A Bold Step in the Generative AI Revolution Llama 4 represents a significant stride in the evolution of Generative AI and Open Source AI . With its diverse models, MoE architecture, and focus on balanced responses, Meta is positioning itself as a key player in democratizing access to powerful AI. While licensing restrictions and the ongoing challenge of AI bias remain factors to consider, the release of Llama 4 undoubtedly marks “the beginning of a new era for the Llama ecosystem,” as Meta aptly stated. For the crypto world and beyond, this development opens exciting new possibilities for innovation and application. The race for AI dominance is heating up, and Meta’s Llama 4 is a powerful contender.

The unknown user staked $0.05 Solana ( SOL ) in 2023, and it will unlock in the year 5138, Arkham said in an April 5 post to X. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the move was likely a symbolic sign of showing conviction in Solana’s long-term ecosystem . Source: Arkham Intelligence “Legacy staking is more than locking assets it’s a mindset. The real edge in crypto isn’t in chasing short-term hype, but in holding long-term conviction assets through cycles,” he said. Adding that: “this kind of thinking builds not just portfolios, but long term legacies.” SOL is currently trading for $102, according to CoinMarketCap. A January report from asset manager Bitwise predicts the token could be worth between $2,300 and over $6,000 by 2030. It's impossible to know what the staked SOL will be worth by the time it’s unlocked in a few thousand years, but Liu says it would likely be a significant sum. “If SOL appreciates just 2–5% annually, the compounding over 3,000 years becomes exponential. In any market condition, long-term compounding remains one of the most powerful financial forces,” he said. Staking Solana for over 3 millennia To put it into perspective, 5 cents compounded annually at a 3% annual interest rate would already result in over $486 undecillion (486 followed by 36 zeros) after 3,115 years. However, the Solana sum would likely be much higher, given staking rewards are paid out every two to three days and compounded. Users on X are speculating that the stake could be an attempt at creating generational wealth, or a random stunt with no real long-term plan. Source: Arkham Intelligence Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at blockchain platform Komodo, told Cointelegraph he thinks the “3,000-year nickel play on SOL is a meme trade” that will one day be stamped on the SOL blockchain. Related: Solana TVL hits new high in SOL terms, DEX volumes show strength — Will SOL price react? “What will 3,000 years from now look like? Will humans still be around? Will the Solana blockchain? Such a long time horizon makes one ponder one’s place in the scheme of things,” Stadelmann said. He speculates people might even seek to outdo it by “making a 5,000-year play.” At the moment, depending on the platform and validator choice, Solana offers between 5% to 8% in staking rewards. Meanwhile, Cardano ( ADA ) starts at around 2%, and Ether ( ETH) staking rewards are between 2% and 7%. Four Solana whales recently profited over $200 million in a staking play that began in April 2021, when they staked 1.79 million Solana, worth $37.7 million at the time.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has had a rough start in April, falling to a three-week low of $77,077. In an Apr. 5 post on X, Ju pointed out how the current Bitcoin bear market condition is reflected in on-chain metrics like market cap and realized cap. Realized cap determines the actual amount of money entering Bitcoin based on wallet movements, while market cap is based on the most recent price on exchanges. A bear market is typically shown by stagnation or decline of market capitalization despite a rise in realized cap. This indicates that although capital is entering the market, prices are not reacting. #Bitcoin bull cycle is over — here’s why. There’s a concept in on-chain data called Realized Cap. It works like this: when BTC enters a blockchain wallet, it's considered a ""buy,"" and when it leaves, it's treated as a ""sell."" Using this idea, we can estimate an average cost… pic.twitter.com/xDHRin8N1K — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) April 5, 2025 Ju notes that a bull market happens when modest capital drives up prices. However, the current bearish trend is supported by the fact that even large capital purchases aren’t driving up the price of Bitcoin. He adds that historical data shows that a true reversal in the price of Bitcoin typically takes at least six months, making a short-term rally unlikely.

Losses in the first quarter have historically had a mixed effect on Bitcoin’s yearly performance. COVID fears caused a 9.4% drop in 2020, but Bitcoin ended the year up more than 300%. However, Q1 losses in 2014, 2018, and 2022 signaled the end of bull runs and preceded bear markets. The recent decline comes after President Trump imposed new tariffs that have triggered market volatility worldwide. Although Bitcoin saw increases following Trump’s election, its status as a U.S. economic hedge is now in question due to these new tariffs, which have raised fears about a recession. Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of economic uncertainty will be tested in the months ahead.

The SFC’s new rules highlight the benefits of staking, such as boosting blockchain security and helping investors earn yields in a regulated environment. This guidance lets licensed crypto platforms offer more services, supporting the SFC’s “ASPIRe” plan to grow Hong Kong’s virtual asset market. SFC Rules Aim to Make Crypto Staking Safer The SFC has laid out clear rules for licensed crypto platforms offering staking, aiming to boost investor protection. Platforms must safeguard staked assets, prevent service errors, and be fully transparent about the risks involved, marking a strong step toward safer staking in Hong Kong. Besides, the SFC has also revised its circular on SFC-authorised VA Funds, allowing them to stake assets—but only through licensed platforms or approved institutions. To reduce risk, a cap is set on how much they can stake, helping manage liquidity and protect investors. SFC CEO Julia Leung remarked that expanding the suite of regulated crypto services is key to growing Hong Kong’s virtual asset space. At the same time she also emphasized that the top priority should always be protecting investors’ assets through strong regulation and compliance. Hong Kong’s Efforts To Become a Global Crypto Leader Hong Kong is actively enhancing its cryptocurrency regulations to position itself as a leading digital asset hub. The SFC has introduced the ASPIRe framework, focusing on Access, Safeguards, Products, Infrastructure, and Relationships, aiming to streamline market access and bolster investor protections. ​ In February 2025, the SFC announced plans to establish new licensing regimes for over-the-counter virtual asset trading and custody services, seeking to improve market efficiency and investor safeguards.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 06:13:18

Speaking at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival , Chan said the forthcoming policy statement will expand on the government’s previous commitments, with a focus on using Web3 to enhance traditional financial services, support the real economy and strengthen the application of digital asset technologies. “Later this year, we will unveil a second policy statement on the development of virtual assets,” he said, adding that the goal is to foster a regulatory environment that supports innovation while safeguarding market integrity.

Since then, Hong Kong has rolled out a licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms , with 10 platforms licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission so far. Other efforts include authorising virtual asset spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with Hong Kong emerging as the largest VA ETF market in the Asia-Pacific region. The government also plans to introduce legislation to regulate stablecoins, with the licensing regime expected to take effect within the year. OTC and Custody Rules Under Review as City Deepens Web3 Supervision Authorities are currently conducting consultations on extending regulation to cover over-the-counter virtual asset trading and custodial services, further expanding the city’s oversight of the sector. Chan reiterated that the government’s approach is not solely regulatory. “We support a multi-stakeholder approach where governments, regulators and market players across different territories and regions come together to drive forward the sustainable development of Web3,” he said. One example is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Project Ensemble, a sandbox that allows financial institutions to experiment with tokenized real-world assets under regulatory supervision. Hong Kong has taken a more open stance towards Web3 than some neighbouring jurisdictions, positioning itself as a regional hub for blockchain-related activity while maintaining a focus on financial stability. “The lesson we have learnt,” he said, “is that we need to put it under a balanced regulatory framework so as to enable the sector to grow in a responsible and sustainable manner.” The post Hong Kong to Roll Out Updated Virtual Asset Policy Framework by End of 2025 appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|Crypto Regulations|Web3,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-07 06:17:05

This week is packed with economic events that could significantly influence market movements. For crypto investors, staying informed about these events is not just beneficial—it’s crucial. Buckle up, as we delve into the key economic releases and Federal Reserve (FOMC) speeches scheduled this week that could send ripples through the crypto sphere. Understanding these events is your first step to navigating the potentially choppy waters ahead. Decoding the Week’s Key Economic Events This week’s calendar is marked by significant announcements, primarily from the U.S., which traditionally has a strong global market impact , especially on digital assets. From Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) member speeches to critical inflation data releases, here’s a breakdown to keep you in the loop: Day, Date & Time (UTC) Region Event Importance Tuesday, April 8 – 18:00 U.S. FOMC Member Daly Speaks Medium Wednesday, April 9 – 16:30 U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks Medium Wednesday, April 9 – 18:00 U.S. FOMC Meeting Minutes High Thursday, April 10 – 12:30 U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) (March), Initial Jobless Claims Very High Thursday, April 10 – 13:30 U.S. Fed Logan Speaks Medium Thursday, April 10 – 16:00 U.S. Fed Goolsbee Speaks Medium Friday, April 11 – 12:30 U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) (March) High Friday, April 11 – 15:00 U.S. FOMC Member Williams Speaks Medium Why FOMC Speeches Matter for Crypto? FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) members’ speeches are closely watched by financial analysts and traders worldwide. Why? Because these speeches often provide hints about the future direction of monetary policy, particularly interest rates. For the crypto market, which is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, these pronouncements can be pivotal. Here’s why you should pay attention: Interest Rate Expectations: FOMC members’ views on inflation and economic growth can signal whether the Federal Reserve is likely to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates. Higher interest rates can sometimes lead investors to shift from riskier assets like crypto to bonds or cash, while lower rates can have the opposite effect. Market Sentiment: The tone and content of these speeches can heavily influence overall market sentiment. Hawkish comments (indicating a leaning towards tighter monetary policy) might trigger sell-offs in crypto, while dovish remarks (suggesting looser policy) could fuel rallies. Volatility Catalyst: Unexpected or strong signals from FOMC members can inject volatility into the crypto market, creating both opportunities and risks for traders. This week, we have several FOMC members scheduled to speak, including Daly, Barkin, Logan, Goolsbee, and Williams. Keep an ear out for any nuances in their language regarding inflation, economic outlook, and future policy actions. The FOMC Meeting Minutes released on Wednesday could also offer deeper insights into the committee’s recent discussions and policy stance. Understanding the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and its Crypto Connection The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a critical measure of inflation, reflecting the average change in prices consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. It’s released monthly and is a key indicator that the Federal Reserve considers when making decisions about monetary policy. Why should crypto investors care about CPI ? The CPI-Crypto Link Explained: Inflation Gauge: CPI data reveals the rate of inflation in the U.S. High inflation can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies, potentially making assets like Bitcoin, often touted as an inflation hedge, more attractive. Fed’s Reaction Function: The Fed closely monitors CPI. Higher-than-expected CPI readings can prompt the Fed to consider more aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, which can, in turn, negatively impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower CPI could suggest easing inflationary pressures, potentially leading to a more dovish stance from the Fed and positive reactions in crypto markets. Market Expectations vs. Reality: The market impact of CPI data often depends on whether the actual figures align with market expectations. Significant deviations can lead to sharp price movements. For instance, if CPI is unexpectedly high, we might see a knee-jerk reaction of crypto sell-offs followed by potential recovery if the market believes inflation is still under control in the longer term. Thursday’s CPI release for March will be a major focal point. Analysts will be scrutinizing the numbers to gauge the trajectory of inflation and anticipate the Fed’s next moves. Producer Price Index (PPI): Another Inflation Puzzle Piece While CPI measures inflation from the consumer’s perspective, the Producer Price Index (PPI) tracks inflation at the wholesale level. It measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Think of it as an early indicator of inflationary pressures that might eventually trickle down to consumers and be reflected in CPI . PPI and its Relevance to Crypto: Leading Indicator: Changes in PPI can sometimes precede changes in CPI . Rising producer prices can indicate future consumer price inflation, thus influencing expectations about monetary policy and market impact on crypto. Business Costs and Margins: PPI reflects the cost of goods at the producer level. Higher producer prices can squeeze business profit margins and potentially lead to businesses passing on these costs to consumers, further fueling inflation. This broader economic context affects all asset classes, including crypto. Complementary Data to CPI: Analyzing both PPI and CPI provides a more comprehensive picture of inflationary pressures in the economy. Friday’s PPI data will be crucial to confirm or challenge the inflation trends indicated by the CPI release the previous day. Keep an eye on Friday’s PPI figures to get a fuller understanding of the inflation landscape and its potential implications for the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors This Week Navigating a week loaded with significant economic events requires a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Monitor financial news outlets for real-time updates and analysis of the economic events listed above. Pay close attention to expert commentary on how these events might affect the crypto market. Manage Risk: Given the potential for increased volatility, consider adjusting your portfolio risk. This could involve reducing leverage, setting stop-loss orders, or diversifying your holdings. Analyze Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts immediately after each major announcement, particularly CPI and PPI releases and FOMC statements. These reactions can offer clues about prevailing market sentiment and potential future trends. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility might be unsettling, remember to maintain a long-term perspective. Economic data releases are just snapshots in time, and the fundamental drivers of the crypto market are still evolving. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Seas This week presents a series of crucial economic events that are poised to influence not just traditional markets but also the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. From FOMC member speeches offering insights into future monetary policy to the critical inflation data from CPI and PPI , staying informed and prepared is paramount. By understanding the potential market impact of these events and adopting a strategic approach, crypto investors can navigate the week ahead with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities.

Meanwhile, traders expect the market decline to continue through the Asian day ahead of the U.S. open. “Historically, crypto markets tend to front-run stock markets over the weekend, and this morning's Asia market declines seem to have reinforced this belief,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “We expect crypto markets to dip once US markets open.” “As to whether or not they’ll recover depends on which large countries are able to secure short-term tariff delays or deals this week. Thus far, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Taiwan have already pledged to lower their own tariffs and/or increase US investment in exchange for relief, but we would need a larger trading partner like Japan or China to do so to restore confidence and certainty in the markets,” Mei added. Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, said current price action was displaying bear market behaviour. “All the signs suggest that macro markets are now in 'bear market' mode, rallies are to be sold, and investors will be forced to accept this new reality against the long-term wagers being made,” Fan said in a Telegram message. “The market will likely continue to frustrate and shake investor confidence for quite a while longer.” “Over the longer term, charts might argue that BTC has broken out against global equities and is overdue to catch up with spot gold, but catalysts appear to be fleeting at this time and risk management (ie. lower prices) will likely dominate until global stops melting down,” Fan ended.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 07:23:58

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped by 19.32% in 24 hours to $1.69. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is down an eye-soaring 19.32% to $1.69. If the bullish momentum kick starts, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $1.942. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.55 Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 1.68987906 -19.15% Market cap $ 98,477,659,394.93 Circulating Supply 58,274,974,538.00 Trading Volume $ 9,609,566,055.9527 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

The crypto market is falling along with global stock markets following Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs. The crash was led by Bitcoin (BTC), which fell to nearly $75,000, triggering a cascade of forced liquidations across the board. The entire crypto market is down nearly 13% in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGlass , long-positioned futures traders bore the brunt of the market turmoil. Over $1.2 billion of long bets were wiped out, with Bitcoin longs accounting for more than $392 million in losses. Source: Coingecko ETH, SOL, and XRP Traders Suffer Nearly $730M in Liquidations Amid Market Crash Ether (ETH) traders lost close to $328 million, while altcoins—including Solana (SOL) and XRP—contributed nearly $400 million to the total, with each seeing about $60 million in liquidations. ETH plunged 20% to $1,449 while major altcoins like SOL, XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped by as much as 20% in the last 24 hours. BNB also dropped nearly 10%. Mid-cap and low-cap tokens were also swept up in the selloff, falling between 10% and 20%, per CoinGecko data. Nearly 86% of all futures traders had bet on a price rally, anticipating short-term relief in the market. However, the violent downturn forced exchanges to liquidate leveraged positions en masse, as traders failed to meet margin calls. Liquidations of this scale are often signs of extreme market stress. Forced selling during a downturn can accelerate price declines, while potentially setting the stage for a sharp rebound once the excess leverage is flushed out. Crypto Crash Mirrors U.S. Stock Futures Slump Crypto wasn’t alone in the selloff. U.S. stock futures also plunged Sunday night, heightening fears of a broader market crash. S&P 500 futures fell 5.98%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 6.2%, and Dow futures dropped 5.5%, all pointing to a chaotic start to the trading week. The sharp selloff follows growing macroeconomic uncertainty, intensifying trade tensions, and investor jitters over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff order. CNBC’s Jim Cramer referenced the 1987 crash in a post on Saturday, warning that a “Black Monday” could weigh heavily on the administration’s legacy. Surprised we can't get a short cover rally in case President Trump realizes that a Black Monday may not burnish a legacy — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) April 4, 2025 Markets in Asia mirrored the panic. Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 8.9% early Monday, while Taiwan’s Taiex index plunged nearly 10%, triggering circuit breakers on heavyweights like TSMC and Foxconn. Authorities responded by temporarily banning short-selling to curb further volatility. Meanwhile, retail investors pulled a record $1.5 billion from equities in just 2.5 hours on Friday, underscoring the depth of fear in the market. Institutional capital continued its exodus, making March 2025 one of the sharpest withdrawal periods in recent history. As reported, U.S. stock markets have experienced a staggering $11 trillion wipeout since February 19, with losses accelerating on April 4 following heightened concerns over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff measures. The single-day market loss amounted to $3.25 trillion—exceeding the total valuation of the global cryptocurrency market, which stood at $2.68 trillion at the time. Among major tech players, dubbed the “Magnificent 7,” Tesla led the plunge, falling 10.42%. Nvidia and Apple also saw steep losses, dropping 7.36% and 7.29% respectively.

With Ethereum (ETH) currently trading at $1,814, many investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising star in the DeFi lending market that is quickly gaining traction. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6.3 million has been accumulated and 7900 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $3 after launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 7900 investors put $6.3 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $3 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects.

Crypto Investors Watch Closely,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-stock-market-crypto-impact/,"In a whirlwind of financial speculation and political intrigue, the narrative around former President Donald Trump and the stock market has taken a dramatic turn. As crypto enthusiasts keenly observe traditional market movements for signals, a recent social media post by Trump himself ignited a firestorm: accusations that he is deliberately orchestrating a stock market crash . But is there any truth to these explosive claims? Let’s dive into the unfolding drama and what it could mean for the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Decoding the Stock Market Crash Controversy: What’s Really Happening? The controversy erupted when Trump shared a video on his Truth Social platform on April 4th, alleging that he was “purposely CRASHING the market.” This bold statement was interpreted by many as a calculated move to pressure the Federal Reserve (Fed) into lowering interest rates. The logic? Rate cuts could weaken the dollar and bring down mortgage rates – potentially beneficial outcomes in some economic scenarios. However, such actions, if intentional, raise serious questions about market manipulation and economic stability. Adding fuel to the fire, Kevin Hassett, a White House official and director of the National Economic Council, stepped in to quell the rumors. In an interview with ABC, Hassett firmly stated that President Trump is not intentionally crashing the stock market. According to CNBC, Hassett emphasized, “[The president is] trying to deliver for American workers.” This official denial attempts to counter the narrative sparked by Trump’s own social media activity, creating a confusing and uncertain landscape for investors – including those in the crypto space who often look to traditional market volatility for cues. Trump’s Stock Market Legacy: A Rollercoaster Ride? To understand the current situation, it’s essential to consider Trump’s historical relationship with the Trump stock market . During his presidency, the stock market experienced significant fluctuations, often reacting sharply to his policy announcements and tweets. While some periods saw robust growth, others were marked by volatility and downturns. This historical context makes the current allegations all the more pertinent. Investors, both in traditional equities and cryptocurrency, are acutely aware of the potential impact of presidential statements and actions on market sentiment and economic direction. Here’s a quick look at some key factors influencing the market under Trump’s previous administration: Tax Cuts: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was initially seen as a boost for corporate profits and the stock market. Trade Wars: Trump’s imposition of tariffs on goods from China and other countries led to trade tensions and market uncertainty. Deregulation: Efforts to reduce regulations were generally viewed favorably by businesses but raised concerns in other sectors. Federal Reserve Policy: Trump frequently criticized the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, often calling for lower interest rates. Now, as Trump is no longer in office, his influence on the market is arguably indirect, yet his voice still carries considerable weight, especially among his followers and within certain political and economic circles. This makes his social media pronouncements, even if seemingly contradictory to official White House statements, a factor that market participants cannot ignore. The Fed Rate Cuts Factor: A Desperate Measure or Economic Strategy? At the heart of Trump’s alleged market manipulation strategy lies the concept of Fed rate cuts . Lowering interest rates is a tool the Federal Reserve uses to stimulate economic growth. It makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging businesses to invest and consumers to spend. However, excessive or premature rate cuts can also lead to inflation and potentially destabilize the currency. Trump’s supposed motivation, as outlined in his Truth Social post, is to force the Fed into rate cuts. Why? Let’s break down the potential chain of events: Market Crash (Alleged Intentional): Trump supposedly wants to trigger a significant downturn in the stock market. Fed Reaction: A crashing market would likely pressure the Federal Reserve to intervene to prevent a deeper economic crisis. Rate Cuts: The Fed’s primary tool for intervention is often to lower interest rates. Dollar Weakening: Lower interest rates can make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors, potentially weakening its value. Mortgage Rate Reduction: Lower rates generally translate to lower mortgage rates, which can stimulate the housing market. While this is a simplified scenario, it reflects the core of the accusation. However, many economists argue that intentionally crashing the market is a dangerous and unpredictable strategy with potentially devastating consequences far outweighing any perceived benefits. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve operates independently of direct political influence, though political pressure can certainly exist. Crypto Market Impact: Navigating the Economic Uncertainty For those invested in cryptocurrencies, the unfolding situation presents a landscape of economic uncertainty . The crypto market, while increasingly mature, is still sensitive to macroeconomic trends and investor sentiment in traditional markets. A significant stock market crash could have ripple effects across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Here’s how the crypto market might be impacted: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Reaction Stock Market Crash: Initially, a broad sell-off across all markets, including crypto, as investors seek safety. However, in the longer term, some might see Bitcoin and other cryptos as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Fed Rate Cuts: Lower interest rates could make riskier assets like crypto more attractive compared to traditional fixed income investments. It could also contribute to inflationary pressures, potentially boosting the appeal of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Dollar Weakening: A weaker dollar can sometimes lead to increased interest in alternative currencies, including cryptocurrencies, as a store of value. Increased Volatility: Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the stock market and Fed policy is likely to increase volatility in all markets, including crypto. Traders should be prepared for potentially sharp price swings. It’s crucial for crypto investors to stay informed and exercise caution during periods of heightened economic uncertainty. Diversification, risk management, and a long-term perspective are always advisable, especially when traditional markets are exhibiting signs of stress. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do amidst this swirling vortex of claims, denials, and market speculation? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, Federal Reserve announcements, and statements from key political and economic figures. Reliable financial news sources are your best allies. Manage Risk: Consider reducing exposure to highly volatile assets if you are risk-averse, or at least diversify your crypto portfolio across different types of assets. Don’t Panic Sell: Market volatility can be unsettling, but avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear. Base your actions on careful analysis and your long-term investment strategy. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: In times of uncertainty, dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) can be a prudent strategy to mitigate risk. Seek Expert Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate these market conditions, consider consulting with a financial advisor who understands both traditional and crypto markets. Conclusion: Uncertainty Reigns, Vigilance is Key The debate over whether Trump is intentionally trying to crash the stock market injects a significant dose of uncertainty into already complex economic conditions. While White House officials deny these claims, the very fact that such accusations are being made and discussed widely highlights the sensitivity of the market and the potential impact of political rhetoric. For crypto investors, this situation underscores the interconnectedness of traditional and digital finance. Vigilance, informed decision-making, and a balanced approach to risk are paramount as we navigate these potentially turbulent times. The coming weeks and months will likely reveal more about the true direction of the market and the validity of these shocking claims.

In a time when most tokens struggle to prove real-world use, Remittix Tech stands out for its cross-border payments platform. Early adopters say a future price explosion seems inevitable as investor interest keeps growing. Below we go into the inner workings of this cutting-edge platform, talk about why excitement is growing, and examine how Remittix Tech can change everyday transactions in the blockchain world. Remittix Tech’s Growing Role in Crypto Payments Remittix Tech has stood out as an exemplary utility for merging blockchain efficiency with domestic banking networks. The company seeks to address the painstaking delays and undercover charges that frustrate remittance channels worldwide. Experts believe such a model could transform the $190 trillion cross-border payment segment, luring merchants, freelancers, and regular crypto consumers. Rather than indulging in hype, Remittix Tech delivers tangible benefits to businesses negotiating with overseas suppliers or families sending remittances abroad. By executing transactions within a few hours, it puts paid to the time-consuming wire transfers that enrage millions of people. All this real-world problem-solving makes Remittix Tech stand out from hype-fuelled altcoins. Among its most prominent aspects is an API that facilitates acceptance of cryptocurrency payments by small and large traders alike, immediately converted to local money. This ease of system translates to the interest Remittix Tech has found in an industry rife with untested businesses. Numerous now view it as a convenient option for something greater than gambley meme coins. Inside the Phenomenal Presale and Adoption Remittix Tech has well over doubled its presale in merely raising over $14.4 million, selling over 526 million tokens at a price of $0.0734 currently. This shows a market hungry for solutions that break inefficiencies. Early birds have been reportedly making healthy profits, and rumors are going around about even more price increases when the token lists on major exchanges. One of the attractions of Remittix Tech is its open ledger, which logs each transaction to limit fraud. For example, a web developer in South America charging a client in Europe can be paid in stablecoins near-instantly, while the client pays little in conversion fees. By incorporating an API for direct acceptance of cryptocurrency, Remittix Tech avoids the labyrinth of traditional banking channels. Experts credit the presale’s success to these applications in real life. With the platform enhancing, some project Remittix Tech can become an initial go-to for cross-border payments, outdoing the rest with no robust payment infrastructures. It’s not just retail consumers, either—merchants and businesses look at cost savings and faster settlements as a compelling incentive to onboard. Remittix Tech versus Legacy Systems While current wire transfers occur over days or even weeks, Remittix Tech brings the time down to hours. It also seeks lower fees, with the appeal being to anyone infuriated by the extortionate cost of global money flow. As the world sees online e-commerce booming, such an efficiency may be revolutionary. In contrast to buzz-only tokens, Remittix Tech addresses a headache every business and consumer day. With on-chain transparency, it builds confidence in a world where hidden fees can consume profits. That tangible utility means users don’t need to be crypto enthusiasts to realize the value—anyone interested in smooth transactions can enjoy the benefits. Critics sometimes wonder whether new startups can compete with established payment giants. However, Remittix Tech’s trapped liquidity, rigorous auditing, and ongoing partnerships show it’s heading towards long-term sustainability. Many early adopters believe the platform may one day be on par with the biggest altcoins that focus on real consumer value. Gaining Momentum Before the Price Spikes Press attention to Remittix Tech has increased, highlighting the notion that practical applications conquer fleeting manias. Analysts anticipate that when presale mania peaks, the token could surge considerably in value. Nevertheless, the period to purchase before prices rise runs out every passing day. Even conservative traders will see when a platform applies decentralized speed to conventional banking. Many are speculating whether Remittix Tech will replicate the success of previous crypto projects that solved specific pain points. The difference is that cross-border remittances touch a gigantic segment of the global population, potentially bringing mass adoption. For deeper insight into evolving crypto trends and how new coins like Remittix Tech shape global finance, watch the in-depth crypto guide. If things continue as they are, Remittix Tech would lead the charge into Pay-Fi, balancing decentralized tech with traditional money networks. Every completed transaction makes the argument of buying now—before the price spike—the more compelling one.

Bitcoin, a dominant force in the crypto market, fell to a three-week low of $76,693.20 on April 7, 2025, pulling altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Notcoin (NOT) down with it. Notcoin suffers as Trump’s tariffs disrupt the crypto market The catalyst for today’s downturn traces back to April 2, 2025, dubbed ‘Liberation Day,’ when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs aimed at nearly 200 US trading partners , igniting fears of a global trade war. The tariffs, a cornerstone of Trump’s economic agenda, impose a baseline 10% duty on most imports, with steeper rates for specific nations—34% on Chinese goods and 20% on European Union products. Designed to correct trade imbalances, these measures instead unleashed chaos across financial markets. US stock futures cratered , with Nasdaq 100 contracts tumbling 5%, while global indices followed suit. Asian markets plummeted as Japan’s Nikkei 225 shed 6%, and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 4.4%. This widespread sell-off in traditional markets has spilled over into cryptocurrencies, erasing Bitcoin’s brief post-tariff stability and dragging the broader crypto ecosystem into a tailspin. Notcoin, trading at $0.001748 as of April 6, 2025, has borne the brunt of this volatility. Its all-time high of $0.02836, hit on June 2, 2024, contrasts sharply with its recent low of $0.001688 on April 7, 2025—a 93.9% drop from its peak. Notcoin price chart by CoinGecko This steep fall highlights Notcoin’s vulnerability as a smaller-cap cryptocurrency, prone to exaggerated price swings when market sentiment sours. Is a crypto winter on the horizon? The economic fallout from the tariffs extends beyond immediate market reactions. Businesses face higher costs, which could fuel inflation, while consumers brace for pricier goods. Hedge fund titan Bill Ackman has warned of an “economic nuclear winter” if these policies persist, citing irreparable damage to US global credibility. In this climate of uncertainty, investors have fled riskier assets, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to 1 7, signaling “extreme fear.” On April 6, the crypto market saw $778 million in long positions liquidated in a single day, the largest such event in six weeks. Over the past 24 hours, 327,264 traders have been liquidated, bringing the total liquidations to $1.02 billion according to Coinglass data . Notably, Bitcoin’s decline has amplified the pressure on altcoins. Ethereum, today, hit a low of $1,538, its lowest since October 2023, while Solana dropped to $107. Notcoin, lacking Bitcoin’s robust institutional backing or market depth, has suffered disproportionately. Its 23.6% loss over the past week and 25.9% decline over the past month reflect a market in retreat, with traders favoring cash or safer havens over speculative tokens. Arthur Hayes believes the instability could bolster crypto BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes argues that prolonged economic instability could eventually bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized hedge against centralized policies. Freshly pardoned by Trump for past financial violations, Hayes envisions a scenario where investors seek refuge in Bitcoin (BTC), potentially lifting the broader crypto market.

The tariffs’ long-term implications loom large. If they spark sustained inflation or a global slowdown, the Federal Reserve may face pressure to adjust monetary policy, perhaps adopting a dovish stance that could buoy risk assets. Conversely, persistent trade tensions might deepen the downturn, keeping cryptocurrencies under strain. Notcoin, emblematic of altcoins’ struggles, stands at a crossroads, its fate tied to both Bitcoin’s trajectory and the unfolding economic narrative.

Notably, these ETFs experienced outflows on four of the five days between March 31 and April 4. Monday saw $71.07 million in outflows, followed by $157.64 million on Tuesday, $99.86 million on Thursday, and $64.88 million on Friday. The only positive day was Wednesday, with $220.76 million in inflows. The majority of outflows came from Grayscale GBTC, which lost $95.5 million over last week, followed by WisdomTree’s BTCW with $44.6 million per Faside data . Additionally, outflows came from IBIT, BITB, ARKB, and HODL funds that saw $35.5 million, $24.1 million, $22.2 million, and $4.9 million in net redemption, respectively.

Ethereum ETFs recorded $49.93 million in outflows last week, marking six straight weeks of withdrawals totaling over $795 million.

With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging into extreme fear territory and billions wiped from the market overnight, traders are bracing for what could come next. “An Economic Nuclear War” The crypto sell-off was triggered by rising fears of a global tariff war, which investor Bill Ackman called an “economic nuclear war.” The uncertainty is rattling markets, dragging Bitcoin down over 9% and pushing major altcoins down by up to 14%. XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have all dropped below key support levels as of Monday morning. Notably, the Fear and Greed Index dropped into “extreme fear” to 17 as per data from Coinmarketcap. Bitcoin tumbled to $75,000, dragging the total crypto market cap down nearly 10% to $2.4 trillion. Berachain led the plunge with a 21% crash to a record low of $4.6 — now down over 50% from its peak. Top tokens like AAVE, Litecoin, Lido DAO, Maker, Movement, and Ethena also fell sharply, losing more than 15%. Over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated as markets crashed, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for $638 million combined. More than 324,000 traders were hit, including one Bitfinex user who lost a staggering $23 million. The Fear & Greed Index tumbled to 17, signaling extreme fear across the market. Charlie Sherry from BTC Markets said the drop isn’t shocking because markets are usually illiquid on Sundays. That means a few big sales can cause prices to fall quickly. US Crypto Wallet Reveal To Spark Relief Rally? ​Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO of Mudrex, noted that investor sentiment is currently weak, with the Fear and Greed Index approaching “Extreme Fear.” However, he notes that there may be a silver lining as the U.S. federal agencies are expected to reveal their crypto holdings later today, and a strong disclosure could spark a much-needed relief rally. Federal agencies must disclose their Bitcoin and crypto holdings to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by Monday, a White House official confirmed to journalist Eleanor Terrett.

McGlone said that as long as the price of assets continues to rise, everyone identifies as a long-term investor. He said he doesn’t know how the price of Bitcoin went from $10,000 to $100,000 just a short time ago in 2020, but that trends came into play and made it happen. The analyst now argues that he sees a return to $10,000 in the BTC price. McGlone, who has been a pro-Bitcoin stance in the past, seems to have completely abandoned this behavior, as he also made fun of the technology behind BTC. He criticized Bitcoin, saying that its technology is “so great, that’s why the most traded cryptocurrency is Tether, which is a dollar token.” Related News: There Are Weekend Updates on Tariffs That Keep Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Under Pressure - These Should Be Known Ahead of Tomorrow's Market Open On the other hand, he argued that Tether's market value is on track to soon surpass that of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum.

Crypto news outlet db recently highlighted on X a headline quoting Trump saying, “Trump, Asked About Markets, Says Sometimes You Have to Take Medicine.” This seemingly simple phrase has sent ripples through financial circles, leaving many to wonder: what kind of ‘medicine’ is he talking about, and what could it mean for the volatile crypto market ? Decoding Trump’s ‘Medicine’ for the Markets: What Could It Mean for Crypto? Trump’s comment, while brief, is open to interpretation. In the context of market questions , ‘medicine’ is likely a metaphor for intervention or measures taken to address perceived issues within the economy or financial systems. But what kind of intervention could this be? And more importantly, how might it affect the burgeoning crypto market ? Possible Interpretations of ‘Medicine’ in the Market Context: Economic Stimulus: Could ‘medicine’ refer to injecting liquidity into the economy through stimulus packages? This could indirectly benefit the crypto market as investors might seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies in an inflationary environment. Regulatory Measures: Conversely, ‘medicine’ could imply stricter regulations aimed at curbing perceived excesses or risks in the markets . For the crypto space, this could mean increased scrutiny and potentially tighter rules around exchanges, digital assets, and DeFi. Interest Rate Adjustments: Traditional economic ‘medicine’ often involves manipulating interest rates to control inflation or stimulate growth. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact investment flows across all markets , including crypto. Currency Intervention: In some cases, ‘medicine’ could refer to government intervention in currency markets to stabilize exchange rates. While less directly linked to crypto, broader currency stability can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite in all asset classes. Why is Trump’s Statement Significant for the Crypto Market? Trump’s words carry weight, especially within financial markets . His past actions and statements have demonstrably influenced market behavior, and the crypto market is no exception. Here’s why this comment is generating so much attention: Market Sensitivity: The crypto market is known for its volatility and sensitivity to news and sentiment. Even vague statements from influential figures can trigger significant price swings. Policy Implications: Trump’s potential return to politics and his views on economic policy make his statements relevant. His stance on regulation and economic intervention could directly impact the future of the crypto market in the US and globally. Investor Uncertainty: Ambiguous comments like “sometimes you have to take medicine” create uncertainty. Investors in the crypto market dislike uncertainty, and this can lead to cautious trading or increased volatility as they try to decipher the potential implications. Analyzing the Potential ‘Medicine’: What Kind of Market Intervention Could We See? To understand the potential impact, let’s consider different types of ‘medicine’ and their possible effects on the markets , particularly crypto: Type of ‘Medicine’ Potential Impact on Crypto Market Examples Stimulus Packages Potentially positive in the short-term as increased liquidity could flow into crypto; however, long-term inflation concerns could emerge. Direct payments to citizens, infrastructure spending, tax cuts. Increased Regulation Potentially negative in the short-term due to uncertainty and compliance costs; could lead to greater long-term stability and mainstream adoption if regulations are clear and balanced. Crackdown on unregistered exchanges, stricter KYC/AML requirements, new rules for stablecoins and DeFi. Interest Rate Hikes Generally negative as higher rates make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to bonds or savings accounts. Federal Reserve raising benchmark interest rates. Currency Controls Unclear and depends on the specifics. Could be negative if it restricts capital flow into crypto; could be positive if it drives demand for decentralized alternatives. Restrictions on USD conversions, capital controls on outflows. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amid Market Questions Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s statement and its potential implications, what should crypto market participants do? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, policy announcements, and further statements from Trump and his associates. Reliable crypto news outlets and financial news sources are crucial. Manage Risk: In times of uncertainty, risk management is paramount. Consider diversifying your portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and avoiding over-leveraging. Prepare for Volatility: Expect continued volatility in the crypto market as interpretations of Trump’s comments evolve and market reactions unfold. Focus on Fundamentals: In the long run, the fundamentals of strong crypto projects and the broader adoption trends will likely outweigh short-term political noise. Continue to research and invest in projects with solid use cases and strong teams. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market’s ‘Medicine’ Moment Trump’s seemingly offhand remark about ‘medicine’ for the markets has injected a dose of uncertainty into the crypto market . While the exact nature of this ‘medicine’ remains unclear, it’s crucial for crypto investors and enthusiasts to pay attention. By staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, participants can navigate this period of speculation and position themselves for potential opportunities and challenges ahead. The market questions raised by Trump’s comment serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the crypto world with broader economic and political forces. Understanding these connections is key to thriving in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.

A liquidation process happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to the trader’s incapability to meet the margin requirements. According to reports, no fewer than 86% of futures bets were bullish. This implies that traders were expecting prices to rise. Data shows that Bitcoin traders and Ethereum traders have lost $322 million and $290 million, respectively, as part of the latest liquidation development. Other major altcoin traders, including XRP traders and SOL traders, have faced a combined loss of over $80 million.

The controversy is built around the First Digital Trust (FDT) , a Hong Kong-based custodian reportedly involved in unauthorized fund transfers. Sun isn’t pulling any punches—he says this is “significantly worse” than what FTX pulled off. FTX vs. FDT: What’s the Deal? According to Sun, while FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried masked his misuse of funds as collateralized loans backed by tokens and shares, FDT allegedly skipped the smoke and mirrors altogether. In an x post, Sun claims FDT directly took $456 million from TUSD (TrueUSD) custodial reserves without client knowledge or permission, funneling it into a shady Dubai-based company without collateral. He further alleges that this company laundered the money, and that FDT CEO Vincent Chok played a direct role. That’s a bold accusation, especially considering the implications for users who trusted FDT to safeguard their assets. FDUSD Depeg and a $50 Million Bounty The fallout has already started. The FDUSD stablecoin briefly lost its peg , raising red flags. In response, Justin Sun has put up a $50 million bounty to track and recover the missing funds. He’s calling for swift action, warning that the credibility of Hong Kong’s entire financial system is now at risk. Meanwhile, a Hong Kong lawmaker has taken note, promising enforcement action if these claims hold up. So, this isn’t just crypto drama anymore soon, it could become a major legal and political issue. FDT Fires Back FDT hasn’t taken the allegations lightly. The company denied everything, calling Sun’s claims a smear campaign meant to damage its reputation and that of FDUSD. They insist they’re solvent and plan to pursue legal action to defend themselves. Despite the controversy, FDUSD has mostly held its value, staying above $0.99. But in crypto, perception matters and damage to trust can be hard to repair. Why It Matters Sun argues that while the U.S. acted quickly in the FTX case to protect financial integrity, Hong Kong needs to do the same now. With crypto adoption growing and more governments setting rules, this could become a defining moment for Hong Kong’s crypto credibility. If Sun’s claims prove true, it might be the biggest crypto scandal since FTX and this time, the world is watching.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|FDUSD|TUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 07:44:29

However, they must abide by guidelines meant to protect users from associated risks. According to a notice published by the Securities and Futures Commission on April 7, crypto firms operating in the region that hold a virtual asset trading platforms license may offer staking services. Though, they must take necessary measures to protect customers and fully disclose the potential risks associated with staking virtual assets. Staking allows customers to generate yield through their crypto holdings. This is done through “locking up” the crypto asset for a certain period of time and accumulating interest from it. Platforms usually offer this feature through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that generates returns and distributes it to investors. Before firms can start offering staking services in their Hong Kong product suite, they must first receive formal approval from the SFC. The prior written approval will include specific requirements that crypto platforms have to follow before they can start providing staking services. The SFC claimed that it has adjusted its circular framework on virtual asset funds to facilitate staking. One of the requirements mandates companies to only partner with licensed VATPs and authorized institutes for staking crypto assets. You might also like: Fake ‘Hong Kong coin’ promoted by chief executive impersonator account Hong Kong regulators aim to prioritize crypto industry Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Julia Leung, stated that expanding their virtual asset guidelines to accommodate crypto staking products is an important part of encouraging growth within Hong Kong’s digital asset ecosystem. “But the broadening must be done in a regulated environment where the safety of client virtual assets continues to be front and center of the compliance framework for offering such service,” said Leung in her statement. Hong Kong regulators have been making regulatory moves to accelerate the growth of their crypto industry. By the end of 2024, the region was criticized for its slow-moving licensing process, falling behind other Asian countries like Singapore . Earlier today during the Hong Kong Web3 Festival 2025, the Hong Kong government announced that it would soon launch a stablecoin legislation alongside licenses for over-the-counter transactions and custody businesses. Moreover, it aims to also allow licensed spot ETFs to provide staking services.

The panicked investors trigger a massive sell-off while the big whales have begun to liquidate massive amounts of ETH. This has set the stage for a huge descending trend, reviving the possibility of the beginning of a bear market. More Than 270,000 ETH Holdings At Stake In times of uncertainty, the whale movements have a massive impact on the upcoming price action. Interestingly, these have been shedding out their holdings, creating more panic among the market participants. As per some reports, a whale got liquidated for 67,570 ETH, worth more than $106 million with ETH at $1,650. Source:x Yet another whale who had held more than $22 million worth of ETH converts all his holdings into stablecoins. In the past few hours, this whale deposited more than 14,000 ETH into Binance and withdrew 15.5 million stablecoins. The whale had held the second-largest token for over 10 years and is now turning all the holdings into stablecoins, flashing a massive bearish signal or prudent hedging. In the latest development , a whale with 220K ETH and over $340 million just repaid 3.52 million DAI and deposited 10,000 ETH, lowering the liquidation price to $1,119.3. If the price drops below the liquidation price, all 220,000 ETH will be liquidated, which raises huge alarms. Yet another whale is feared to liquidate more than 15,000 ETH if he fails to increase the collateral or repay the debt. On the other hand, the spot ETH ETF witnessed huge outflows of over 26,230 ETH worth over $50 million, substantiating the bearish claim. Will Ethereum’s (ETH) Price Drop Below $1000? The latest market dynamics have caused the ETH price to plunge below the support levels, which have been a strong base since 2020. Despite this, the bulls remain passive, suggesting a lack of confidence amid the growing uncertainty due to the global market conditions. After breaking the major support, the selling pressure does not appear to have settled; hence, it keeps the bearish possibilities alive. As seen in the above weekly chart of ETH, the price is hedging towards the crucial support close to $1400, the 2018 highs, which may push the levels heavily down if broken. The weekly RSI has dropped to the lower threshold. Last time this happened was in 2022, which has dragged the levels below $900 from the highs above $4800. If the levels plunge below 30, a drop below $1000 could be imminent for the Ethereum (ETH) price.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 07:47:48

The tech-heavy Nasdaq futures are currently in a freefall, sending ripples of concern across global markets. If you’re tracking your investments or keeping an eye on market trends, you’ve likely noticed the alarming red numbers flashing across your screens. According to the latest data from TradingView, the NASDAQ 100 E-mini Futures are currently sitting at $16,632.25, marking a significant 5.14% drop in just the last 24 hours. But what’s fueling this dramatic market crash , and more importantly, what should investors like you be doing amidst this volatility? Let’s dive into the details to understand the current situation and strategize a path forward. Why Are Nasdaq Futures Experiencing a Sharp Decline? The significant dip in Nasdaq futures isn’t happening in isolation. Several interconnected factors are contributing to this bearish trend, creating a perfect storm in the financial markets. Understanding these factors is crucial for grasping the current market sentiment and anticipating potential future movements. Inflationary Pressures Remain Persistent: Despite efforts to curb inflation, recent economic data suggests that price increases are proving to be more stubborn than initially anticipated. This persistent inflation erodes purchasing power and forces central banks to maintain or even increase hawkish monetary policies. Anticipation of Further Interest Rate Hikes: To combat inflation, central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the US, are expected to continue raising interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, which can slow down economic growth and negatively impact corporate earnings, especially for growth-oriented tech companies heavily represented in the Nasdaq. Geopolitical Uncertainties and Global Economic Slowdown: Ongoing geopolitical tensions and concerns about a global economic slowdown are adding to investor anxieties. These uncertainties create a risk-off environment, prompting investors to move away from riskier assets like tech stocks and futures contracts. Profit-Taking After a Period of Growth: The Nasdaq, particularly the tech sector, has experienced substantial growth over the past year. Some investors may be engaging in profit-taking, selling off their holdings to secure gains, which can exacerbate downward pressure on prices. In essence, the current stock market decline is a confluence of macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment. The fear of continued inflation, higher interest rates, and global economic instability is weighing heavily on the markets, leading to the sharp drop in Nasdaq futures. Impact of Market Volatility on Tech Stocks The Nasdaq 100 index is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, making it particularly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment related to economic growth and interest rates. Here’s how this market crash scenario specifically impacts tech stocks: Impact Area Description Reduced Growth Expectations Tech companies, often valued on future growth potential, become less attractive when economic growth is expected to slow down. Higher interest rates also make future earnings less valuable in present terms. Increased Borrowing Costs Many tech companies, especially startups and those in expansion phases, rely on borrowing to fund their operations and growth initiatives. Higher interest rates increase their borrowing costs, potentially impacting profitability. Investor Risk Aversion In times of economic uncertainty, investors tend to become more risk-averse. Tech stocks, often considered higher-risk investments compared to more stable sectors, are typically among the first to be sold off during market downturns. Valuation Corrections After periods of rapid growth, tech stock valuations can become stretched. Market corrections, like the current one, can lead to a reassessment of these valuations, bringing them more in line with current economic realities. Therefore, the current decline in Nasdaq futures is a strong indicator of potential continued volatility and downward pressure on tech stock prices. Investors holding significant tech stock portfolios should be prepared for further fluctuations and consider strategies to mitigate risk. Navigating the Stock Market Decline: Investment Strategies for Turbulent Times While a stock market decline can be unsettling, it also presents opportunities for savvy investors. The key is to adopt a strategic approach to navigate these turbulent times. Here are some investment strategy considerations: Review and Rebalance Your Portfolio: Assess your current portfolio allocation. Is it still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals? Consider rebalancing your portfolio by reducing exposure to higher-risk assets and potentially increasing allocations to more defensive sectors or asset classes. Focus on Long-Term Value Investing: Market downturns can create opportunities to buy quality stocks at discounted prices. Focus on companies with strong fundamentals, solid balance sheets, and sustainable business models that are likely to weather economic storms and thrive in the long run. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider employing dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market price. This strategy can help reduce risk and potentially lower your average purchase cost over time. Diversification is Key: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies. Diversification can help mitigate risk and reduce the impact of downturns in any single area of the market. Stay Informed and Seek Professional Advice: Keep abreast of market developments and economic news. Consult with a qualified financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and investment goals. Remember, market corrections are a normal part of the economic cycle. A well-thought-out investment strategy , coupled with patience and discipline, can help you not only weather the storm but also position yourself for long-term financial success. Trading Outlook for Nasdaq Futures: What to Expect Next? Predicting the exact bottom of a market decline is notoriously difficult, and the trading outlook for Nasdaq futures remains uncertain in the short term. However, considering the current market dynamics, here are a few potential scenarios and factors to watch: Continued Volatility: Expect continued volatility in the near term as markets react to ongoing economic data, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments. Potential for Further Downside: Given the prevailing bearish sentiment and macroeconomic headwinds, there is a possibility of further downside in Nasdaq futures and the broader stock market. Monitor Economic Data Closely: Pay close attention to upcoming inflation reports, GDP growth figures, and employment data. These indicators will provide clues about the future direction of interest rates and the overall economic health, significantly influencing market sentiment. Earnings Season and Corporate Guidance: The upcoming earnings season will be crucial. Focus on corporate earnings reports and management guidance for insights into company performance and future prospects. Strong earnings and positive outlooks could provide some support to the market.

Tether ( USDT ) CEO Paolo Ardoino says the company may consider launching a stablecoin specifically for the U.S. if new rules make the market more competitive. Speaking to the Financial Times , Ardoino said the company was involved in discussions about U.S. stablecoin rules and that the administration viewed them as “an important instrument for the United States,” though he didn’t elaborate on the details of those discussions. He also added that if the new rules make U.S. domestic stablecoins competitive, there could be an “interest from Tether to create a domestic stablecoin in the U.S.,” calling it “basically a settlement currency.” You might also like: Tether buys another $735M in BTC in Q1, bringing total holdings to $8.2B As of press time, Tether doesn’t serve U.S. customers, though it’s one of the most traded cryptocurrency worldwide, with around $144 billion worth of tokens in circulation. The company’s user base now exceeds 400 million, according to Ardoino, who recently said stablecoins are becoming part of a broader “stablecoin multiverse.” The U.S. is preparing new rules that may require foreign stablecoin issuers to follow local enforcement laws. Ardoino implied that “that is something that we [already] do… voluntarily,” adding that “we are the only ones that on-board the FBI, on-board the U.S. Secret Services.” Read more: Circle files IPO amid declining profits and stiffening competition — will this shake Tether’s stablecoin dominance?",News|Regulation|Stablecoin|Tether,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-07 07:51:33

The move, which imposes a 10% tariff on all countries —sent U.S. stock futures into freefall. As expected, the ripple effect didn’t spare crypto. Bitcoin slid more than 9.4% in just 24 hours, currently trading around $75,000. Ethereum bore a heavier blow, tumbling over 18.6% and clawing its way back to $1,466 at press time. The overall crypto market cap dropped over 11%, now sitting at around $2.37 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges market sentiment, dipped to 23—deep in “extreme fear” territory. Sundays are typically more illiquid in global markets, but the scale of this drop felt different. Charlie Sherry, head of finance at BTC Markets, explained that thin weekend liquidity can exaggerate volatility. “A few big sell-offs, and things snowball,” he said. “But there’s no mystery here—the tariff shock has spooked everyone.” Wall Street Futures Dive Alongside Crypto The tremors weren’t isolated to digital assets. Stock futures pointed to a rough week ahead. Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, the Nasdaq bled red, and the Dow Jones futures fell by over 8%. Analysts from The Kobeissi Letter called the situation dire, stating that the S&P 500 is now officially in “bear market territory.” In a post on X, they noted the U.S. stock market has erased $400 billion daily, on average, for the past 32 sessions. Tom Dunleavy of MV Global even speculated it could become the “worst three-day move for U.S. stocks of all time” if Monday’s markets open in the red again. Tariffs and Talk of Bitcoin Resilience Despite the chaos, some in the crypto world see opportunity. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes this tariff-fueled economic instability might actually benefit Bitcoin in the long term. “Chaos and uncertainty are breeding grounds for alternative assets,” he said in a Telegram note. Meanwhile, President Trump is standing firm. On Truth Social, he declared tariffs “a beautiful thing to behold,” insisting the U.S. must correct long-standing trade imbalances. Whether that correction causes a sustained crypto rally or deeper market turbulence remains to be seen.

Based on data from Tokenomist, Aptos (APT) is at the forefront with about $49.76 million in tokens due for release. That constitutes 2.47% of its overall supply. This token release is happening at a difficult moment for the cryptocurrency market as Bitcoin recently fell to $75,000, failing to hold above $80,000. Aptos leads large token cliff unlocks Aptos (APT) is positioned at the top of this week’s token unlock schedule with 11.31 million tokens worth $49.76 million set to be released. This makes it the largest single unlock by value among all cryptocurrencies during this period. Following Aptos, SAGA is scheduled for an even larger unlock in terms of percentage of supply. As per the data, 133.33 million tokens valued at $33.58 million are entering circulation. This release will add 222.22% to SAGA’s current supply. Source: Wu Blockchain Some other large cliff unlocks are Axie Infinity (AXS) with 9.09 million tokens ($22.73 million, 3.58% of supply), MOVE with 50 million tokens ($16.16 million, 2.08% of supply), and TNSR with 120 million tokens ($14.58 million, 35.86% of supply). The definition “cliff unlock” applies to a model of token distribution in which lots of tokens all come on-stream simultaneously, rather than spread over time. Solana unlocks $50 million worth SOL Solana (SOL) dominates the linear unlock category with 465,770 SOL tokens worth $50.05 million to be released progressively this week. Unlike cliff unlocks where all the tokens are dropped at once, linear unlocks provide tokens progressively over a predetermined duration. Although the dollar value is large, this SOL unlock constitutes merely 0.09% of the prevailing circulating supply. The relatively small percentage impact on Solana’s supply suggests the unlock may have minimal direct effect on SOL’s price. The unlock comes at a time when SOL has dropped below the $100 level. Following Solana, Worldcoin (WLD) has the second-largest linear unlock with 37.23 million tokens worth $24.04 million (3.02% of circulating supply). Celestia (TIA) follows with 6.96 million tokens valued at $16.91 million (1.20% of supply), while Dogecoin (DOGE) will see 96.52 million tokens worth $16.09 million released. However, this represents just 0.06% of its massive supply. Other notable linear unlocks include OM ($14.49 million), TAO ($9.61 million), Avalanche ($11.35 million), Sui ($7.18 million), Polkadot ($8.52 million), and Internet Protocol ($9.60 million). Each of these projects will see their tokens gradually enter circulation throughout the week. Less popular token unlocks According to CoinMarketCap data, beyond the major token unlocks, several smaller or less mainstream cryptocurrencies are also scheduled for substantial unlocks this week. Among the smaller market cap tokens undergoing unlocks, Self Chain (SLF) is currently showing a 45.38% unlock progress with 9.89 million SLF tokens (worth $1.82 million) scheduled as its next unlock. The token has already dropped 11.98% in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Masa (MASA) is another token facing substantial unlocks, with 42.03% of its unlock schedule completed and 23.86 million tokens worth approximately $320,305 set for release. MASA has seen a sharp 21.53% decline in the last 24 hours. This is among the steepest drops of all tokens with scheduled unlocks. Trossard (TROSS) is approaching its next unlock of 100.02 million tokens. The project is currently at 38.17% of its total unlock schedule. Port3 Network (PORT3) has completed 19.25% of its unlock schedule, with 28.16 million tokens worth approximately $343,679 scheduled for its next release. This represents 2.82% of the total locked supply. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

It will be decided by who leads in cryptography. Just as past industrial and technological revolutions in its private sector yielded the US an edge in global power, the ability to secure and verify information through cryptographic breakthroughs, especially in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, will determine the balance of power in the digital age. The US risks falling behind. While China and other nations invest aggressively in technological advancements , America lacks a national strategy to maintain leadership in this critical domain. It’s time to recognize cryptography as a foundational technological asset and a key to securing the country’s economic and national security future. From industrial might During the world wars of the previous century, the US maintained a dominant global position through industrial strength. The country supplied around 75% of the oil used by the Allies in WWI and around 85% of their oil in WWII. The US also manufactured approximately two-thirds of all military equipment used by the Allies in the latter, playing a pivotal role in the war’s outcome. Industrial strength was not merely an asset. It was a strategic advantage in global conflicts. American influence will continue to be tied to the private sector’s innovations, especially as we move into more technologically advanced forms of warfare. To software superiority Superiority in software has become the most efficient way to sustain US leadership worldwide. Stuxnet offers an example in recent history. In 2010, the software-based operation led by the US and Israeli governments was able to remotely crash Iran’s nuclear development program without deploying a single soldier. Recent: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices Today’s private companies have followed suit and developed new software technologies for national defense purposes that have become essential in maintaining the US’s competitive edge. Defense contractors have enhanced US global influence with their contributions to AI, surveillance and advanced analytics for national security purposes. The historical trend is set to continue as cryptography starts to play an increasingly important role in defense technology. Cryptography and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs The use cases for cryptography, specifically ZK-proofs, extend far beyond the protection of financial transactions. Consider a shift in focus from the AI race for a bit. In that case, ZK-proofs become critical for more immediately tangible purposes, such as securing the country’s digital infrastructure. The US Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Department of Defense have already acknowledged the strategic importance of ZK-proofs for defense and national security and developed the Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) program. NASA and the European Space Agency are exploring blockchain and ZK-proofs to ensure the authenticity of satellite communication commands and prevent cyberattacks . Private sector contributions are embedding secure cryptographic elements into drones to prevent hacking and ensure safe defense and critical infrastructure operations. At the same time, cybersecurity firms are leveraging blockchain to create secure digital identity ecosystems . The private sector is currently at the forefront of innovation in this field. In 2019, there was a boom in research papers focused on ZK-proof technology driven by private efforts to find better solutions in blockchain scalability via ZK-rollups. New and innovative approaches to ZK-proofs emerged, with most of the research being led and funded by crypto companies in the private sector. These are all production-ready, future-proof technologies that are finding their way into civilian applications but could be applied to military purposes just as quickly. Global leadership through innovation America’s dynamism in the digital age, particularly in cryptography and blockchain technologies, will define its future role as a global power. The US must make bold, strategic investments in private-sector and public-sector research and development for ZK-proofs to maintain its leadership in cryptographic technologies, which are now indispensable to national security, defense and economic stability. With a pro-crypto administration and a supportive Congress, the time has come to move beyond merely regulating crypto as an investment class. There must be active cultivation and support for innovation in cryptography and emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs. The centuries-old relationship between the private sector and the government must continue to defend national interests. This is America’s moment to build a new wave of industrial and technological dominance. It’s time to seize this opportunity and ensure the next century of global leadership is powered by American innovation. Opinion by: Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, co-founder and CEO of Lagrange.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors tracking AI’s impact on blockchain and decentralized technologies, understanding the true capabilities of these AI models is crucial. Recently, Meta, a tech giant increasingly involved in the AI space, unveiled its new flagship AI model, Maverick. Initial reports placed Maverick high in AI benchmark rankings, specifically on the LM Arena platform. But, is everything as it seems? Let’s dive into the revealing details and uncover potential discrepancies in Meta’s AI benchmarks for Maverick. Are Meta’s Maverick AI Model Benchmarks on LM Arena Genuinely Representative? When Meta launched Maverick, it quickly climbed to the second spot on the LM Arena leaderboard. This ranking, based on human evaluations comparing different AI model outputs, initially suggested Maverick was a top-tier performer. However, eagle-eyed AI researchers soon noticed something amiss. It appears the version of Maverick showcased on LM Arena, dubbed an “experimental chat version” by Meta itself, isn’t the same as the publicly accessible version for developers. This distinction raises serious questions about the validity of these AI benchmarks and their relevance for practical applications. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Customized for Benchmarks: Meta’s own Llama website states that the LM Arena testing utilized “Llama 4 Maverick optimized for conversationality.” This suggests a tailored version specifically designed to excel in LM Arena’s evaluation format. Benchmark Reliability Questioned: LM Arena, while popular, has faced scrutiny regarding its reliability as a definitive measure of AI model performance. Customizing a model specifically for this benchmark amplifies these concerns. Misleading Developers: The core issue is transparency. If the benchmarked version differs significantly from the standard Meta AI models available to developers, it becomes difficult to accurately predict real-world performance. This lack of clarity can hinder effective development and integration of the model. The Problem with Tailored Benchmarks: Why Does it Matter? Imagine purchasing a cryptocurrency mining rig based on advertised benchmark speeds, only to find the actual performance falls short in real-world mining scenarios. Similarly, in the AI world, misleading AI benchmarks can lead to wasted resources and misinformed decisions. Here’s why tailoring models for benchmarks is problematic: Distorted Performance Snapshot: Benchmarks should ideally provide an unbiased overview of a model’s strengths and weaknesses across various tasks. Customization defeats this purpose, offering an inflated or skewed representation. Unpredictable Real-World Behavior: Developers rely on benchmarks to gauge how a model will perform in specific contexts. A benchmark-optimized version doesn’t accurately reflect the behavior of the ‘vanilla’ model, making predictions unreliable. Erosion of Trust: Transparency is paramount in the tech world, especially with rapidly advancing technologies like AI. Discrepancies between benchmarked and publicly available Meta AI models can erode trust in both the model and the company providing it. Stark Differences Observed: Maverick on LM Arena vs. Publicly Downloadable Version Researchers on X (formerly Twitter) have already highlighted noticeable differences between the LM Arena Maverick and the downloadable version. These observations further fuel concerns about the representativeness of the LM Arena benchmarks. Examples of Discrepancies: Feature LM Arena Maverick Publicly Downloadable Maverick Emoji Usage Excessive Moderate/Normal Answer Length Long-winded, verbose More concise Overall Behavior Potentially ‘cooked’ or over-optimized for conversational tasks More balanced and general-purpose These seemingly superficial differences can indicate underlying adjustments made to the Maverick AI model specifically for the LM Arena evaluation. While conversational ability is important, optimizing solely for this aspect might come at the expense of other crucial performance metrics.

For developers, investors in AI-driven crypto projects, and the broader tech community, accurate and reliable benchmarks are essential for informed decision-making. Key Takeaways: Demand Transparency: AI companies should be transparent about any modifications or optimizations made to models used for benchmarking. Critical Benchmark Evaluation: Users should critically assess benchmark results and consider the methodology and potential biases of different evaluation platforms like LM Arena . Focus on Real-World Performance: Ultimately, the true measure of an AI model’s value lies in its performance in real-world applications, not just benchmark scores. As the AI landscape continues to evolve and intersect with cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, staying informed about the nuances of AI model evaluation is paramount. The Maverick case serves as a potent reminder to look beyond headline rankings and delve deeper into the details behind the AI benchmarks we encounter.

Yet crypto analyst Kevin, who posts under the handle @Kev_Capital_TA on X, has reiterated his stance that Dogecoin still holds a critical “bull market line” and builds momentum higher if broader market conditions improve. Dogecoin Must Hold Above This Price In a new update, Kevin writes: “Nothing much has changed on Dogecoin since my last post on 3/22. Higher time frame indicators are mostly reset and we are holding the bull market line in the sand of support. This may not be the popular X take at the moment but engaging on people’s fears is not what we do here. As long as BTC cooperates and economic data comes in favorable I say send it higher within the next few weeks.” He references an older post from March 22 in which he laid out a comprehensive technical perspective on Dogecoin’s position. In that post, he pointed to the $0.139 price level as the coin’s “Last line of bull market support,” warning that a durable weekly close below the multi-year downtrend line could signal a profound shift in sentiment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Moment Of Truth: Will It Hold The Line Or Freefall? “My #Dogecoin Community it is about that time where I must provide you the Alpha you all desire,” he wrote in March. “If we take a look at DOGE on the weekly time frame we can see that we received a weekly demand candle last week at the ‘Last line of bull market support’ [which is at $0.139] that I pointed out a couple of weeks ago. It will continue to be absolutely vital that Dogecoin hold this level while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3 Day MACD, Weekly Stoch RSI and 2W Stoch RSI all of which are getting very close to being fully reset.” According to Kevin’s assessment, those particular indicators—which are commonly used to gauge momentum and potential overbought or oversold conditions—are crucial for traders looking to pinpoint when Dogecoin might next see an upward price swing. He also mentioned a target for Bitcoin not to fall below $70,000 if Dogecoin’s bullish framework was to remain intact, emphasizing that broader crypto market conditions often set the pace for high-beta altcoins like DOGE. DOGE Vs. Global Liquidity In yesterday’s post, Kevin delved deeper into the macroeconomic context, overlaying the Global Liquidity Index onto Dogecoin’s price chart. In his words, “If we take a look at #Dogecoin with the Global Liquidity Index overlaid you can see we are at a very interesting point here. On the LOG chart DOGE is back testing the breakout point of what was the entire bear market range that lasted from May of 2021 to October of 2024.” This reference to a prolonged bear market range underscores the extent to which Dogecoin’s price has traveled between its 2021 peaks and subsequent declines. He further explains that this region coincides with the “macro .382” at $0.142 when measuring from the previous bull market highs to the bear market lows, which he regards as a major inflection point and a potential springboard for a renewed rally, provided the market cooperates. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.57 Or $0.06? Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level Kevin attributes a large share of crypto price direction to broader liquidity conditions, writing that “Global liquidity has shown to be throughout all of history a major driver of risk asset prices especially #Altcoins and we can see here that it has been trading perfectly in this downward channel since May of 2022 which lines up with central bank tightening of monetary policy across the globe as inflation was sky rocketing.” As global monetary authorities begin to wind down or at least slow the pace of interest rate hikes, liquidity levels may start to edge higher again. In his assessment, this easing, even if gradual, could supply the necessary fuel for a breakout in both market liquidity and Dogecoin’s price. “Based on history I believe it will likely start to breakout here. If the correlation remains true as it has through the years then this back test on Doge specially is providing one of the best risk reward ratios you can ask for in a long term hold entry or swing play,” he says, while making clear that a failure to hold $0.139 “durably below” would be his invalidation point. At press time, DOGE was just below Kevin’s last “bull line” and was trading at $0.13558.

Anticipating a retest, it is yet to find a solid ground level. Starting the year on a bearish note, LDO posted a significant loss after forming a double-top pattern at $2.5 in late January. This pattern halted bullish sentiments, and the crypto took a sharp downturn after reinitiating drops from $2 in mid-February. The price fell consistently for a month before locating support above the $0.8 level in the following month. This lured the bears into the market, and they took control from a short-term scale. A bounce occurred and the price retraced briefly above $1. It lost momentum and resumed selling in late March. That led to a bearish crossover as the selling volume continues to increase daily. Today marked another major dip in LDO’s price after two weeks of sell, and is now looking extremely bearish on the day. Closing this week on a strong bearish note, it may register more losses in the upcoming week. Otherwise, it may consolidate for a while before releasing pressure. A retracement move from the current trading level could bring a slight retest at the broken $0.8 level before resuming selling. Such a move is not realistic at the moment as selling exhaustion is yet to set in. LDO’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview While there’s currently no key support level on the way down, the price is reaching $0.7. Lower levels to consider for a test are $0.6 and $0.5. Towards the upside, LDO marks resistance at $0.815. If the market recovers above this price level, the $0.92 resistance is the next level to watch, followed by $1.05.

Kang criticized the asset’s $215 billion market cap, pointing out the disconnect between Ethereum’s valuation and its underlying fundamentals. He noted that it seemed “absurd” for Ethereum to maintain such a market cap while growth and earnings were negative, especially considering that the speculative boom in the cryptocurrency market has clearly abated. “The downtrend is still valid,” he added.

According to data from crypto.news, BTC ( BTC ) has fallen as low as $74,604 in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has seen its price plummet around 30% below its all-time high price at $108,786, which occurred just three months prior. At press time, Bitcoin has recovered only slightly to $73,793. It has not yet managed to return to levels above $75,000. Its market cap has also suffered from the decrease in price, falling by nearly 8% and losing nearly $67 billion in the process. Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $1.48 trillion. The sharp decline comes shortly after Asian, European and American markets reported alarming drops in major stocks in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Asian markets, in particular, are seeing the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. On April 7, Japan’s main index, Nikkei 225, closed 7.8% lower than the previous date, while the broader Topix exchange decreased by 7.7%.

Imagine diving into the retro world of Quake II, but with a twist – it’s powered by AI Gaming . Yes, you heard that right! Microsoft’s Copilot AI has conjured up a playable demo of the classic shooter, accessible right in your browser. This isn’t just about reliving the 90s; it’s a peek into the future of interactive entertainment, and it’s raising some serious questions about where Generative AI is headed, especially in the realm of gaming. But before you get too hyped, Microsoft is upfront about the ‘limitations.’ Let’s unpack what this all means and why it’s a big deal. What is Microsoft’s AI-Powered Quake II Demo? Microsoft’s foray into AI Gaming takes the form of a browser-based demo level of Quake II. Think of it as a tech showcase for the gaming muscles of Microsoft’s Copilot AI platform. Here’s the gist: Playable AI World: Using their Muse family of AI models, Microsoft researchers trained the AI on a Quake II level. The result? An environment you can actually play in, controlled by your keyboard. Instant Interaction: The AI responds in real-time to your actions. Move, shoot, jump – your inputs shape the game world instantly. Research Exploration: Microsoft emphasizes this is experimental. It’s about “playing the model” not “playing the game” in the traditional sense. Try it Yourself: You can jump in and experience this for a limited time. Navigate the level, shoot barrels, and see AI gaming in action firsthand. This demo is more than just a fun experiment; it’s a tangible example of how Generative AI can create interactive experiences. For those in the crypto and tech space, this mirrors the rapid advancements we’re seeing in AI across various sectors, pushing boundaries and challenging what’s possible. Delving into the ‘Limitations’ of AI-Generated Gaming Microsoft is transparent about the shortcomings, and it’s crucial to understand them to grasp the current state of AI Gaming . Here are the key limitations they acknowledge: Fuzzy Enemies: Don’t expect crystal-clear graphics. Enemies can appear blurry, a visual reminder this is AI-generated and not traditionally rendered. Inaccurate Counters: Health and damage indicators might not be perfectly reliable. Gameplay isn’t about precise mechanics, but exploring the AI’s creation. Object Permanence Issues: This is perhaps the most striking limitation. The AI struggles to remember objects out of view for even a short time (under a second!). This means enemies can vanish and reappear unexpectedly. However, Microsoft cleverly spins this limitation into a quirky feature. Imagine defeating enemies by just looking away and then back! Or teleporting by glancing at the sky. These ‘bugs’ become unexpected gameplay mechanics, adding a surreal, almost comical element to the experience. Is This the Future of Game Preservation or a Misunderstanding? The demo sparked debate, particularly around Game Preservation . Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously suggested AI could help preserve classic games by making them “portable to any platform.” But game designer Austin Walker isn’t convinced. He argues this approach misses the point of what makes games special. Walker’s Critique: Loss of Edge Cases: Walker points out that the beauty of games like Quake lies in their intricate inner workings – code, design, art – that produce specific, sometimes surprising, gameplay scenarios (“edge cases”). Rebuilding vs. Simulating: AI simulation, like this demo, doesn’t rebuild the game’s core logic. It creates an approximation. This means losing access to those unpredictable and often delightful edge cases that emerge from the original game’s design. Fundamental Misunderstanding: Walker suggests this approach reveals a “fundamental misunderstanding” of both AI tech and how games actually work. It’s not just about visual or mechanical replication, but about preserving the nuanced interplay of systems that define a game’s unique character. Walker’s perspective is vital. While Generative AI can create impressive simulations, it’s not a straightforward replacement for the original artistry and engineering of game development. For crypto enthusiasts familiar with the nuances of blockchain technology, this resonates. Just as a simplified blockchain might miss the crucial security or decentralization aspects of the real deal, an AI-generated game might lose the subtle magic of the original. Why Should Crypto and Tech Enthusiasts Care About AI Gaming Demos? You might be thinking, “Okay, AI Quake II… cool, but what’s in it for me?” Here’s why this demo is relevant beyond just gaming: Showcase of AI Capabilities: This is a highly visible, interactive demonstration of what Microsoft Copilot and similar AI platforms can achieve. It’s not just theoretical; it’s playable. Exploring Generative AI Limits: The acknowledged “limitations” are just as important as the successes. Understanding where AI falters helps guide future development and manage expectations across all AI applications, not just gaming. Implications for the Metaverse and Interactive Worlds: As we move towards more immersive digital experiences, the ability of AI to generate and dynamically manage these worlds becomes crucial. This demo offers a glimpse into that future. Debate on Authenticity and Preservation: The discussion around Game Preservation mirrors broader debates about authenticity in the digital age. What do we value? Perfect replication or functional approximation? These questions are relevant in art, history, and even the preservation of decentralized technologies. In essence, the Quake II Demo is a microcosm of the larger AI revolution. It’s fun, it’s flawed, and it’s incredibly insightful. It prompts us to think about the potential and pitfalls as AI becomes increasingly integrated into our digital lives. Final Thoughts: AI Gaming – Intriguing Potential, Real Limitations Microsoft’s AI-generated Quake II demo is undeniably intriguing. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the potential of Generative AI to create interactive experiences. While it’s not about to replace traditional game development anytime soon, it opens up exciting possibilities for rapid prototyping, dynamic content generation, and perhaps even novel forms of gameplay we haven’t yet imagined. The “limitations” are real, but they are also part of the learning process. As AI models evolve, these boundaries will undoubtedly shift, and demos like this are crucial steps in that evolution.

In a Sunday blog post , Lopp cautioned Bitcoin holders, stressing the recent surge in attacks, where attackers mimic wallet addresses. An 18‑month blockchain study recorded nearly 48,000 suspicious transactions he wrote, adding that some victims have lost significant funds. Lopp also emphasized that such attacks are “only economically feasible during low-fee environments.” This means that the low fees in Bitcoin’s blockchain fuel such scams . Attackers Use Victim’s Transaction History for “Poisoning” According to Lopp’s findings, Bitcoin poisoning attack is similar to social engineering, where the attacker generates a Bitcoin address akin to the victim’s recently used addresses. The attackers use brute force or trial and error in an attempt to guess or crack private keys. The perpetrator then deposits a small amount of crypto into that address. “Then they ‘poison’ the target’s transaction history by sending the funds from this similar-looking address to the victim’s address.” Victims may unknowingly copy a previously used address from their transaction history without realizing it’s the attacker’s spoofed address. In January, pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Mononaut flagged “address poisoning dust attack,” cautioning users not to copy addresses from your transaction history. address poisoning dust attack be careful out there! don't copy addresses from your transaction history https://t.co/upRE493CCG pic.twitter.com/W5CdWlvvyW — mononaut (@mononautical) January 27, 2025 According to Lopp, the first such transactions did not appear until July 7, 2023, which recorded 36 such transactions on block 797570. “Then, all was quiet until block 819455, December 12, 2023, after which we can find regular bursts of these transactions up until block 881172, January 28, 2025, then there was a 2-month break before they started up again.” Attack Has No Specific Pattern Further, Lopp highlighted that it is hard to see a specific pattern in the poisoning attack. “I suspect the attackers were only looking at addresses with recent activity in the past year or so.” However, surprisingly, more than 12,000 targeted addresses had never spent funds. Additionally, most targeted addresses had fewer than 10 deposits. It was clear that the attackers generally ignored addresses with balances under 1 BTC, he added. Lopp cautioned Bitcoin holders to avoid relying on memory or recent transactions. “Don’t trust addresses just because they appear in your transaction history – even from deposits,” he wrote. “Don’t reuse addresses, period!

Joining the broader trend of the global financial market, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dipped, capping off an “ugly” Monday. In tandem with the equities market downtrend, BTC took a sharp dive, hitting severe lows. This major market downturn could be attributed to US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. Let’s take a closer look at Bitcoin’s current trend and its future journey. What Happens to Bitcoin Price? In a shocking turn of events, the Bitcoin price has seen a significant downtrend, kicking off the week on a disastrous note. Analyst Michael van de Poppe addresses today as a “Black Monday” in response to the market’s steep fall. The analyst noted that it’s hard to judge how deep the market will go in times of panic. He added that several key developments are on the horizon that could determine the market’s future track. However, van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin price’s rollercoaster ride will continue for the next two weeks. He noted, “I think we’ll see a rollercoaster 1-2 weeks in which we’re having a test of the lows for Bitcoin.” Global Financial Market Tumbles: What’s Next? Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, the stock market saw a massive decline, marking its largest fall since 2020. Experts predicted that the Bitcoin price would remain resilient to the industry-wide slump despite its strong correlation with the stock market. Notably, the Chinese stock market fell on Monday with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 10% in morning trade, marking the largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis. Aligning with this major shift, the Bitcoin price dipped to massive lows, contrasting expert predictions. A Severe Downtrend Ahead- What Awaits Bitcoin Price? As highlighted by Michael van de Poppe, the Bitcoin price could dip to $70k if its downtrend continues. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $75,204, down 9.6% in a day. Over the past seven days, the crypto has seen a decline of 7% while marking a 13% plummet in a month. Analyst MMCrypto predicted that Bitcoin is heading towards more steep declines. Considering the unpredictability of the crypto market, it needs to be seen if the Bitcoin price would further slip or make a bullish reversal.

It appears to have resumed impulsive moves after undergoing a short retracement in March. The last 24 hours saw OP through its biggest daily loss in two weeks as it reached a new monthly low today. This came with a significant crack to where it is priced at $0.61, although it is yet to find support. While last month’s trading was a bit relieving as the bears suspended pressure, things will likely get uglier in the next few days following the recent drag down. A technical look at the daily chart suggested that the supply level is currently high. A further increase in the supply level could cause severe pain and panic as it might put the market in a more bearish condition on the daily chart. As of now, the bulls are off the market. If they manage to step back with an interception, the selling may temporarily stop before resuming. This could bring a small recovery, as we experienced in March. Failure to recover might lead to a steady decrease until it finds support. Starting the second quarter of the years with a major sell-off signals a bearish continuation pattern. OP may post heavy losses before climbing back. Closing this quarter under $0.1 will signal a long-term bear run. OP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview OP is currently approaching the $0.6 level. A drop below this key level could send us to a low of $0.5. The next level for support would be $0.4. In the face of the dip, the bulls are technically suffering losses. If the market recovers, we may see a retest at $0.677. Higher resistance levels are mounted at $0.786 and $0.93.

The company’s mNAV multiple — market cap divided by the value of the holdings — sits just under 2, indicating the stock still trades at a premium. According to CoinDesk research , MSTR faces no liquidation risk even if bitcoin falls below its cost basis. As of April 2, Metaplanet (3350) disclosed bitcoin holdings of 4,206 BTC purchased at an average price of 12,925,027 yen ($88,800) per coin. That puts the Japanese company about 15% underwater on its bitcoin strategy. The stock dropped 20% on Monday alone, reflecting mounting pressure from the downturn. Semler Scientific (SMLR) has also seen losses on its bitcoin holdings, with an average acquisition cost of $87,854 per BTC, according to the most recent filing in February. With bitcoin down 20% this year, Semler has lost 38%, Metaplanet 15% and Strategy 2%.",Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|MetaPlanet,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 08:15:24

SOL has posted an over 60% decline since mid-January, with traders now concerned about how much further Solana will drop and whether a sub-$90 dip is on the horizon. Solana Price In Freefall Amid Intense Selloff Solana price trades at $97 at press time as risk assets record a brutal selloff due to President Trump’s tariffs. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that trading volumes have soared by more than 230% in 24 hours to $5.39 billion. This suggests that SOL has recorded billions of dollars in sell-side volumes. This decline has led to SOL recording the second-highest number of liquidations among altcoins. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, more than $62M long positions on Solana were liquidated. Despite this turbulence, a Solana whale remains optimistic that the Solana price could rebound . On-chain data shows that this address has staked 71,318 SOL, valued at over $7.63M, despite sitting at a loss. Token Unlocks At the same time, Helius Labs CEO noted that despite the dip, SOL was the most obvious bet amid the ongoing crypto market crash . He said, “I’m not sure how much lower the general market goes… but it is the most obvious asymmetrical bet for anyone without a time horizon.” Despite the optimism, other analysts speculate that the downtrend is not over yet, with a Solana price drop below $90 now looming. Will Solana Crash Below $90 This Week? Top crypto market analyst Jason Pizzino has stated that Solana price will likely crash below $90 this week. In his analysis, Pizzino noted that SOL is on the verge of a major correction like all top altcoins. Given that Solana has already dropped below $100 for the first time in twelve months, the analyst observed that the next target was $80. Hitting this level could then spark a crash below $60. Such a dip will represent an over 80% decline. Solana Price Chart Besides the bearish Solana price prediction by analysts, SOL is also headed for massive unlocks this week. Per Tokenomist, Solana will record 465,000 SOL unlocks , valued at more than $50M this week, which will trigger additional selling pressure. Meanwhile, the crypto fear and greed index has plummeted to a monthly low of 23, indicating that most traders are in a state of extreme fear. This further supports the bearish outlook, as it might precede an unwillingness by traders to buy the current dip. This data indicates that Solana price can drop below $90 this week.

43024287,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=706575,1744013758,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43024287.jpeg,Ripple urges UK to act fast on crypto rules to unlock fintech potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-urges-uk-to-act-fast-on-crypto-rules/,"Blockchain firm Ripple believes the United Kingdom can become a leader in the crypto sector. The company executives shared this view at the recently organized UK Digital Assets Summit in partnership with Innovate Finance and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technology. According to Ripple Europe Policy Director Mathew Osborne, who wrote about the event, the UK already has the advantage of being one of the top financial services centers globally with expertise in various areas. Thus, the country only needs to enact the right regulations. Osborne noted that other jurisdictions, such as the European Union, Hong Kong, and Singapore, have already outdone the UK in regulating the crypto industry. However, he believes the UK has a second-mover advantage and can learn from these jurisdictions to create a better regulatory regime. He said: “The UK now has a ‘second mover advantage’, as it can learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and introduce a regulatory regime that supports the benefits of digital assets as well as mitigating the risks.” These comments echo panelists’ views at the summit, who believe that the UK needs to move fast with its crypto industry regulation, as clarity remains crucial for participants. They noted that such regulatory clarity could have several advantages for the UK, such as 24/7, faster and more efficient settlements for local and cross-border transactions, and more capital inflow into the country. At the root of it, they believe that if the UK should have clearer rules on digital assets, it could become a global crypto hub where consumers enjoy more protection as the standards of firms in the sector will improve. Panelists bemoan slow crypto regulation in the UK The call for rules enabling the crypto industry in the UK is not new. Although the Financial Conduct Authority already has some rules, industry participants believe more regulatory clarity is needed to encourage adoption. The report said: “Panelists reflected that progress so far has been fairly piecemeal, and a bold, ambitious and comprehensive approach is needed.” Some of those complaints also involve the FCA’s low approval rate for crypto licenses. Although the regulator has granted approval to Coinbase, PayPal BlackRock, and Galaxy, its approval rate of only 14% means several companies, including Ripple itself, remain without a license. Unsurprisingly, Ripple complained that banks in the country are unwilling to work with it because there is no regulatory framework. According to Cassie Craddock, the managing director for Ripple Europe and UK, large banks have yet to embrace Ripple due to regulatory uncertainty. Ripple calls for rules enabling stablecoins and tokenization Meanwhile, Osborne said panelists at the summit identified stablecoins and tokenization as the two main products crucial to the UK’s growth as a digital assets hub. He said the UK needs to have laws that enable these products and create an environment enabling stablecoin usage, including stablecoins not issued in the country. Stablecoin is currently a $230 billion sector with more potential for growth and lots of regulatory interest worldwide. Although the UK already has a roadmap for crypto regulation, with a consultation paper on stablecoins set for the first half of 2025, the Ripple executive wants the FCA to fast-track it. Additionally, he mentioned the potential of tokenization to transform the market and called on the UK government to move fast on enabling tokenization so the country can gain from it. He noted that all it would take is to remove all the barriers to it, which are mostly regulatory and legal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
