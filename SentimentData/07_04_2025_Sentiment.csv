More often than not, these locked tokens were reserved for team members, investors, and other strategic purposes. So what happens when these tokens are unlocked? They flood the market, available to trade for the price of a price. They also don’t just show up in chit chat—many times, they’re planned and announced in advance, with dates set, causing speculation about possible impacts on pricing. Next week, a number of important token unlocks are taking place, will bring millions of dollars’ worth of assets into circulation. Here’s a look at some of the big unlocks happening over the next seven days, and why they might matter to market participants. Upcoming Token Unlocks and Their Potential Impact Next week’s token unlock schedule includes some truly significant events that could make waves in the market. Not a few of the unlocks involve literally millions of dollars’ worth of tokens, and they’re likely to be a big driver of whatever volatility we see next week as traders and investors react to the newfound supply. 1. $ENA Unlock – 5 de abril de 2025 On April 5, 55.3 million USD worth of tokens was unlocked by $ENA. This unlock could create notable market movements, especially given the large amount being released. As with most significant unlocks, it’s likely that some of these tokens will be sold, leading to temporary price dips or shifts in trading volume. The release of such a large amount may also signal to traders that the project is entering a new phase, potentially offering an opportunity to re-evaluate its long-term value. 2. $SAGA Unlock – April 9, 2025 On April 9, tokens worth 35.7 million USD will be unlocked from the SAGA project, which could further impact the landscape of the crypto market. With such a nice amount being set free, traders might adjust their positions appropriately, especially as the crypto market anticipates how the SAGA project will handle the newly freed-up tokens. 3. Unlock $MOVE – Apr 9, 2025 Scheduled for April 9, the $MOVE unlock will see 19 million USD worth of tokens hit the marketplace. The release day is one of those times, however, when the behavior of these tokens might not have much to do with any inherent qualities of the project. This is a concrete economic moment that might be more about the $MOVE token’s drive mechanism than drive mechanism itself. After all, $MOVE is specifically designed to get the market-moving part of the equation done. The actual market movement seems to be more a product of the nature of the tokens being unlocked than of any positive or negative attributes of the project itself. 4. $TNSR Unlocked – April 8, 2025 Another token, $TNSR, is experiencing a substantial token unlock on April 8, with 16.3 million USD worth of tokens set to be released. As with other major unlocks, holders of $TNSR and potential investors will need to assess the immediate aftermath to gauge market sentiment. Given the size and the broader market conditions coinciding with this unlock, we expect it to be bullish day trading fodder. 5. KAS Unlock – April 7, 2025 On April 7, tokens worth 10 million USD will be unlocked from the $KAS vault. This release, while significantly smaller than some of the others, still represents a substantial amount of tokens entering into circulation. Given the $KAS demand situation and the overall market mood, this release could cause some short-term excitement. But because it is smaller, it could mean less in the way of market upswings or downswings. 6. Unlocking $NEON – April 7, 2025. The next token unlock is set for April 7, and this one will involve $NEON. There will be tokens worth 6.4 million USD made available. Again, while this may not be a sizable event (in the amount of tokens made available) for the market, it still bears watching for traders, as we don’t know what will happen—and even smaller unlocks can lead to price fluctuations if there is a large concentration of token-holders doing what token-holders typically do post-unlock (i.e., sell, if they intend to sell). 7. $IO Open – a demand for electric intelligence (March 18, 2025) In our 2024 futurist conference, we made three bold predictions. One of those was $IO Open, where electricity is used to unveil the secrets of intelligent systems. In layman’s terms, it means that $IO Open might just be the brain’s equivalent of plugging into the electric grid and harnessing its full potential. In conclusion, on April 11, $IO will undergo a token unlock, and 2 million worth of dollar tokens will be released. This is one of the smallest unlocks that have happened so far in 2023 concerning the amount that’s being unlocked; however, it could still make some waves. Why go ahead and watch it then? Well, even though it’s a tiny unlock in comparison to some that have happened this year in terms of dollar value, it’s also sending 2 million worth of tokens back into the marketplace and as we all know, those marketplace dynamics are unpredictable.

Certain factors influence how much and in what direction prices shift when tokens are unlocked. Those factors include: – supply and demand – market sentiment – investor behavior – project progress If you know a project you like is about to unlock a lot of tokens, it might be worth it to reconsider your position in that project. Similar to past instances, investors need to be ready for turbulence when big unlocking events occur and the dust starts to settle. It’s going to be all-the-more important to keep a close watch on the actual tokens that are involved and to see if any kind of selling pressure or price momentum is developing at the moment. These unlock events could have big implications for the market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These assets, which are designed to maintain a steady value through pegs to fiat currencies or other assets, have become a vital component of the crypto ecosystem. They offer an alternative to the nearly dollar-for-dollar volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The total stablecoin supply crossed an impressive $220 billion in Q1 2025, marking a new record high for the sector. Among the standout performers, Solana’s stablecoin market cap surged by 146%, positioning it as one of the key players in the stablecoin space. Alongside Solana, other networks like MorphLayer, Cronos, Stacks, and Bob also experienced sharp growth in their stablecoin markets. Notably, Solana’s growth has solidified its place as the fifth-largest network in terms of stablecoin market cap, hitting $12.5 billion. Solana stablecoin supply surged 146% in Q1 In Q1 2025, stablecoin market cap on @MorphLayer , @cronos_chain , @Stacks , and @build_on_bob experienced sharp growth. @solana followed closely, taking fifth place with its stablecoin market cap climbing to $12.5B. @Algorand , @zksync ,… pic.twitter.com/SmKw6FtZnR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 3, 2025 A Surge in Stablecoin Market Cap Across Multiple Platforms The first quarter of 2025 has seen a series of developments for stablecoins, as they have continued to increase their foothold in the crypto market. Most importantly, stablecoin supply reached new all-time highs, with the expansion of stablecoin markets across a variety of blockchain platforms playing a significant role in this growth. In the first quarter, the total supply of stablecoins witnessed a substantial rise and went beyond the $220 billion mark, clearly indicating the burgeoning demand for low-volatility, stable assets within the crypto space. Despite some prevailing market uncertainty, this was a clear indication that stablecoins are now an integral part of the portfolio of traders, institutional investors, and decentralized finance (DeFi) participants looking to minimize the effects of market volatility and efficiently move capital across different blockchain networks. Performance this quarter—Tether ($USDT). Dominant stablecoin. Market cap now over $140 billion, nearly double what it was in early 2022. In the stablecoin market, this is a solid lead. Remains a top choice for liquidity in the global crypto markets. One bright spot for crypto in Q1 was the growth of stablecoins, which hit new record highs. – Total #stablecoin supply crossed $220B, the highest ever – Tether ( $USDT ) leads with over $140B in market cap, nearly doubling since early 2022 – $USDC gained share, rising from 20%… pic.twitter.com/kYOxv7NhJq — Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) April 4, 2025 Concurrently, USD Coin ($USDC) has been garnering market share, now comprising 27% of the total stablecoin market—up from 20% a year ago. This coincides not just with Circle’s plans for an IPO but also with what seems destined to be a playout of that public offering. As one of the most popular stablecoins, USDC’s movement upward seems to be in concert with a broader trend of even more institutional interest in stable assets. Solana’s Explosive Growth in Stablecoins One of the increasingly energetic networks around stablecoins is Solana. From the beginning of 2025, it has expanded at a dizzying pace, securing an incredible 146 percent increase in its stablecoin supply when measured against its figures for the end of 2024. This puts the Solana in stablecoin territory that few other Layer 1 blockchains can touch. The technology of Solana, known for its rapidity and low transaction costs, has made it a viable option for developers and users wanting to use stablecoins on a scalable and efficient platform. Solana is an increasingly important player. It has a growing supply of stablecoins. More and more projects are choosing to launch stablecoins on its fast and affordable infrastructure. The stablecoin growth on Solana is also part of the much larger trend of DeFi projects trying to use stablecoins as their main medium for doing things like transacting, lending, and providing liquidity. Because of the Solana blockchain’s overall efficiency at handling high transaction volumes, it is now the ideal place for using stablecoins, which is why Solana’s ecosystem has been growing so much lately. Other Networks See Significant Stablecoin Growth The stablecoin boom in Q1 2025 was not just a boon for Solana. Other blockchain platforms also experienced substantial growth in their stablecoin markets. Networks such as Algorand, zkSync, and Hedera have seen demand for stable digital assets almost double, pointing to the idea that stablecoins are becoming a key part of the blockchain ecosystem that stretches beyond the confines of any one chain. This growth across multiple platforms suggests that stablecoins are gaining traction as a digital asset that can be used in a wide variety of applications across the blockchain space. The stablecoin activity has surged, which is also a direct consequence of the broader trends within the blockchain ecosystem. The stablecoins are demanded more now, as the developers and the businesses are looking to build on the blockchain networks that can offer them efficiency, can offer them low fees, and that can offer them scalability. The use of the stablecoins in these ecosystems is again highlighting a shift in the focus of the crypto world toward more stable assets. Conclusion: The Future of Stablecoins and Their Growing Importance We see Q1 2025 as a watershed moment for stablecoins. Their adoption is not just growing; it is burgeoning. Not just the construction of them but the actual real-world usage of stablecoins is becoming a commonplace thing in our society. Yet Solana, Tether, and USD Coin (USDC)—the three tokens we label as “the stablecoin trifecta”—are equally important for their real-world, global potential. While the relentless march of blockchain technology proceeds apace, it is indeed stablecoins that have become the most stable component of the crypto economy. By and large, the typical American trader has little interaction with seamless cross-border transactions. Even so, if you traded crypto with any regularity, the transactions would across a digital wall separating two different currencies—by and large, the transactions would use a stablecoin. Currently, Solana is the most reliable stablecoin network, with 99.98% uptime on reasonable assumptions about what a healthy price looks like. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007323,https://nulltx.com/?p=147775,1743978939,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval for Solana ETF: A Bold Move to Expand Crypto Access,https://nulltx.com/grayscale-seeks-sec-approval-for-solana-etf-a-bold-move-to-expand-crypto-access/,"Grayscale , one of the major firms in the digital asset management sphere, is making news in the crypto space once again, and it’s doing so with a very bold move. The venture has recently put in the paperwork to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to move its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on NYSE Arca. This filing coincides with Grayscale’s push to expand access to cryptocurrencies for traditional investors and might be a significant step toward pushing digital assets deeper into the mainstream. Grayscale’s move to seek an ETF for Solana comes on the heels of the successful launches of its Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Both have been well received by investors seeking crypto-market exposure through more traditional investment vehicles. With the cryptocurrency space continuing to push into the mainstream, the Solana ETF proposal embodies the ambition—held in by the crypto asset manager—to expand the range of regulated crypto offerings that are accessible to both institutional and retail investors. A Strategic Move Toward Broader Access to Solana The proposed Solana ETF would give investors the change to chance to gain exposure to Solana (SOL), one of the most high-profile cryptocurrencies in recent years. While the project has faced some headwinds, and some associated volatility, its strong performance and growing ecosystem seem now to cement it as one of the top contenders in the blockchain space. Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval For Solana ETF Grayscale has filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an ETF on NYSE Arca, continuing its efforts to expand crypto access for traditional investors. The proposed ETF, like previous Bitcoin and Ethereum products, excludes staking… pic.twitter.com/1gYfMs9JeO — The O Show (Wendyo.eth) (@The_O_Show_) April 4, 2025 Nevertheless, Solana is now a project in decline, with SOL trading near a 13-month low. Analysts, however, are still quite high on its long-term prospects, viewing it as one of the strong candidates for its scalability associated features and nigh use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be a front-runner in the blockchain space. The choice to pursue SEC approval is less than straightforward, coming as it does amid the cryptocurrency market’s sharp downturn and the SEC’s increasingly critical posture toward crypto firms and products. A Solana ETF might offer the types of normalized, federally regulated access that institutional investors have until now largely avoided. You can see the types of silly, straightforward advantages that an ETF would bestow on Solana as a potential leading digital asset: legitimacy; the type of well-understood federal regulatory framework that quite a few large investors have been waiting around for; and, oh, just generally putting Solana a lot closer to the top of the asset class ranking that is so damned important for any potential investor. Excluding Staking to Align with SEC Preferences In its filing, Grayscale has designed the proposed Solana ETF to exclude staking, aligning with the SEC’s past preferences regarding cryptocurrency ETFs. Still, staking is a practice that has not been entirely resolved in regard to the SEC’s vision of investor protection. Following previous preferences, Grayscale is trying to avoid putting a product in front of the SEC that would necessitate the agency reviewing how rewards are being distributed and what might happen if an investor loses funds staked in a supposedly secure network. Historically, the SEC has shown reluctance to approve products that include staking. Grayscale seeks to make the proposed Solana ETF align with the SEC’s guidelines in order to facilitate its approval. The company’s previous dating back to 2013 suggests a strong likelihood of approval if its current ETF proposals are synced with SEC investor protection regulations and the specific criteria the Commission has set for Bitcoin futures ETFs and Ether futures ETFs (that is, these entities must not stake). Grayscale ETF proposals are currently in sync with these signals. Why Solana Is a Strong Candidate for an ETF As one of the blockchain platform solutions showing the most promise, Solana represents the concept of high speed in terms of transaction throughput, low fees that make it accessible, and scalability that ensures it covers a broad base. In the traction department, it has already attracted a number of developers and projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment, looking for an alternative to Ethereum, which they seem to think is slower, costlier, and less accessible than Solana. In terms of enthusiasts and institutional support, Solana seems to have lots of both. One of the reasons analysts consider Solana a strong ETF candidate is the recent acknowledgment by the SEC of comparable filings. The ETF approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum have set a distinct precedent. With Solana’s solid standing in regulated markets now, offering a futures-based ETF makes a lot of sense in Grayscale’s overall strategy of providing varied, diversified investment options in the crypto space. Another thing bolstering Solana’s case for the ETF: its futures market is now increasingly viewed as one that’s regulated. A Solana ETF would raise access to Solana for traditional investors and could serve as an exemplar for other blockchain-based assets. If this ETF were to gain approval, it would be a huge moment for the crypto industry in terms of institutional adoption, providing a direct access point to a safe, regulated digital asset for investors. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Grayscale’s Solana ETF Proposal? While Grayscale’s push for an ETF based on the cryptocurrency Solana is new, the Solana ETF application is only the latest in a line of similar attempts by Grayscale to win approval from the SEC for offerings that use various cryptocurrencies as the underlying assets. If the SEC allows Grayscale to proceed with the Solana ETF the way it has allowed Grayscale to proceed with Solana in the past, that is, to purchase Solana, then those approvals would represent significant transitions of Solana and other cryptocurrencies from uses primarily in the largely unregulated sphere of digital assets to uses in the SEC-governed financial system. At this point, we see the proposed Solana ETF as another step toward a more accessible world of crypto. We see it as a vehicle, with Grayscale at the wheel, that takes us down the road of regulated investment opportunities in the digital asset space. Now, if you are Solana—or, for that matter, any blockchain project—you want what we just outlined to be your basic operating narrative. You want institutional interest in what you are doing, and you want that interest to be growing and leading in the direction of something that could be your next inevitable investment-grade vehicle: the Solana ETF. This proposal places Grayscale once again at the forefront of cryptocurrency investment. In the eyes of many, it signaled that crypto was truly becoming integrated into traditional financial markets, one step at a time. Even if a Bitcoin ETF never came to be, Grayscale was still the name to know and to trust. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007377,https://nulltx.com/?p=147776,1743979124,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,PumpFun Reopens Livestream Feature: A Strategic Move Amid Market Adjustment,https://nulltx.com/pumpfun-reopens-livestream-feature-a-strategic-move-amid-market-adjustment/,"More than five months after being suspended, the popular decentralized platform PumpFun has decided to reopen its Livestream feature. Following a period of intense scrutiny, community backlash, and several scandals, the platform had put the livestreaming tool on hold. Critics had charged that PumpFun was using the service to generate revenue for itself while allowing streamers to create dangerously “toxic” content. Those same critics, after all, had forced the tool to shut down in the first place. But now, with better governance and some community-controlled reins, PumpFun is ready to cautiously reintroduce its “sLiverstream” feature. Although this move has raised a few eyebrows, particularly in light of PumpFun’s recent difficulties, some market watchers believe that this is a movement being made in the opposite direction from the platform’s profile sagging. They point to the fact that the Livestream function was once “key” in attracting users and generating word-of-mouth about it. Now, under stricter management and with clearer content guidelines, it seems as if PumpFun is tentatively revisiting that idea of it drawing in an audience again for, hopefully, the same effect. The Return of Livestreaming with New Restrictions The Livestream function on PumpFun was turned off nearly half a year back because it was being harmed by a community exploiting it to deliver baseless, scandalous, and otherwise-unfriendly-to-the-public material. Reporters have since streamed content to PumpFun to deliver the sorts of heartwarming and good-for-the-public stories that K-pop fandoms usually deliver. At present, PumpFun has brought back the Livestream function; however, it has made some substantial changes to that reintroduction to ensure that the platform maintains its integrity going forward. One of the most striking alterations is the number of people who are allowed to watch each stream. The company has capped it now at 5% of the entire user base, ensuring that only a small, controlled audience gets to peek behind the curtain of the platform itself. This seems to be a clear move to limit the potential for harmful content while still allowing the Livestream feature to exist as a tool for user engagement. Along with the cap on viewers, the terms of management have been made stricter, with an intent to control user activities more tightly during livestreams. The reason for this is, of course, to keep the kind of content that might make the platform look bad from being seen (a.k.a. “toxic content”). But in my opinion, even these new measures won’t be enough to ensure that the platform is a good place for all users to spend time—in part, because they still leave open the question of what kind of content is justifiable. #Pumpfun bắt đầu mở lại tính năng Livestream – hành động dự phóng kéo thị trường trong tương lai? Với việc đóng cửa sau hơn 5 tháng với những bê bối chồng chất khi bị cộng đồng lợi dụng làm những content độc hại thì hiện tại, @pumpdotfun đã có động… pic.twitter.com/8Htc0OOXNx — alphawolf (@alphawolfl2) April 5, 2025 Is This a Strategic Attempt to Revitalize the Platform? This move is critical in terms of timing because PumpFun is facing a steep slide in trading volume and overall platform engagement. Bringing back the feature of livestreaming might just reverse that decline, though it could be many moons before we know anything for sure. In an increasingly interactive landscape, where livestreaming is becoming de rigeur, such a feature could act as an engagement funnelcoming ytub back and reinvigorating both trading and platform engagement as the weekend approaches. Re-launching in a market downturn suggests that the platform is using this time to play around and refine what it has to offer. With the market currently in a deep adjustment phase, the company has more room to try out the new Livestream function and fine-tune that operation without the same level of market demand it would face in a booming period. This tactic gives the platform more space to gather feedback and make the kinds of adjustments to the Livestream feature it will need to make before expanding it further or developing new functionalities tied to it in the future. Furthermore, it appears that the platform’s management is betting on community governance as a way to achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility. By exerting more influence over the content on the platform, PumpFun anticipates that the community will help it avoid the previous mistakes that led to toxic content being allowed to exist and thrive unfiltered. The community is not yet fully certain about the efficacy of the upcoming content-control rules, but it seems to be cautiously optimistic about the platform moving more in the direction of content governance. Community Concerns and Future Prospects Even with the alterations, PumpFun’s community is still split about whether reinstating the Livestream feature will be a hit or miss. These uncertain boundaries about what is and what isn’t “appropriate” content have some users wondering about the platform’s future. If the above concerns aren’t answered with content guidelines that are clear and transparent, the platform runs the risk of facing another user backlash, which could drive away even more users than it has already. PumpFun seems to be taking the requisite steps to ensure that previous problems do not arise again, and this makes us feel somewhat better about recommencing our use of the platform. The way in which it is reintroducing the livestreaming feature, with both a substantially limited viewer base and a dramatically enhanced layer of oversight, makes us think that the company is now much more serious about livestreaming as a core component of its service and is much more serious about the community concerns that pushed it to suspend the feature in the first place. The relaunch of livestreaming could act as a bridge to the more sophisticated features that are being planned and that are associated with real-time interaction and content. As the crypto space keeps growing, platforms like PumpFun are looking for new means to mix social with financial components. Livestreaming, they are betting, will be the first step toward the much more interactive platform that the space cries out for. Conclusion: A Bold Move for PumpFun’s Future The evolution of the platform takes another step forward with the relaunch of the Livestream feature at PumpFun, despite the Elementum controversy and a past riddled with revealed challenges. This test will tell us if the platform is ready to tackle the issue of fostering “safe, useful, and fun content” and maintaining a “safe and engaging environment” for its users. PumpFun does itself a service by using the current market uncertainty as an opportunity to refine its approach. If this relaunch turns out to be successful, it could lead to whatever it is that might come next (and if it leads to whatever’s next in the ecosystem, I’ll cover that issue next week). If this is handled well and if these new aspects are well integrated into the platform, this could quite literally represent the next frontier for both PumpFun and elemental content creation.

43007638,https://nulltx.com/?p=147777,1743979601,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Venture Capital in Crypto: A Shift Toward Real-World Integration in Q1 2025,https://nulltx.com/venture-capital-in-crypto-a-shift-toward-real-world-integration-in-q1-2025/,"The venture capital (VC) landscape in the crypto space had a notable shift in Q1 2025, following a strong showing on the market in the latter half of 2024. In particular, the performance of Bitcoin ($BTC) in Q3 and Q4 last year was a catalyst for increased funding in crypto startups in the first quarter of this year. But pricing and VC investment do not move in lockstep. Funding activity has a way of tailing the price trend by one or two quarters, and the soft pricing of recent weeks, if it is indeed the start of a downtrend, might mean less funding in the next few months. Even with this possible deceleration, emerging segments of the crypto ecosystem continue to attract investors. Most interesting are the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and real-world assets (RWA). Both crypto native and traditional venture capital firms have showcased these three critical areas. Overall, this reflects strong investor interest. Projects in the crypto space are looking increasingly towards the real world, the development of infrastructure, and user appeal that extends beyond the crypto native community. State of Venture Capital in Crypto, Q1 2025 Explore the latest state of the crypto venture capital market and learn why 2025 will be a game-changing year for crypto https://t.co/uU0jyjk2GH — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 4, 2025 Strong Investor Appetite for Real-World Integration and Infrastructure In Q1 2025, significant venture funding moved towards a different type of project than had attracted it just a quarter earlier. Instead of focusing on speculative projects or the next big coin, many investors turned their attention to sectors with “real-world, tangible applications.” This included not just a diversification into various (physical) sectors of the economy, but a pronounced pivot towards the layering of crypto and blockchain technology with AI, a space where we saw a ton of project funding happening in 2024. (Given that AI technologies are also funded heavily with VC dollar, this layering effect is a pretty clear signal of where investors see the future economy going.) The whole DePIN discussion reflects not just a diversification of the type of project communities are building, but also signals the next “big area” that the crypto blockchain technology development community is now trying to tackle. Venture capital poured into Real-World Assets (RWA), as these projects sought to bring physical assets into the crypto fold. RWA seemed to promise a bridge between the traditional world of finance and a new digital era — an entrance into which institutional investors might more easily walk because they found some comfort in RWAs’ use of blockchain to address ‘real problems’ in the ‘real world.’ If all that was true, and VC investors seemed to think it was, then RWA could really change the game for crypto. Increasing investor interest in new sectors means that more and more investment dollars are flowing into these areas. And this is a very good sign for the sectors themselves. Why? Because it suggests that the investment community is very much looking at these sectors as not only having the potential to offer high rates of return over the long run but also as being places where there’s sustainable, real, and long-term value. Infrastructure; use cases; something that just about everyone involved in the crypto world now talks about: real-world relevance. These are the prime growth factors that make these new sectors that much more investable. A Surge in Token Launches and Future Market Dynamics A significant event in Q1 2025 was the arrival of large, VC-backed tokens in the crypto markets. These token launches brought with them nearly $20 billion in value not yet available to investors. They launched, in lost value, a not-so-happy $20 billion wave of change for the crypto space—if, indeed, such under-the-surface value waves can be counted as happy (or, for that matter, as waves at all). A broad examination of the space yields two conclusions concerning the impact on market dynamics: 1) The wave of not-so-happy $20 billion changes has two major effects that traders might actually care about. 2) These effects, as far as I can tell, are either going to be good for traders or good for the markets, in the long run. The influx of new tokens may induce short-term volatility, but it also demonstrates the crypto market’s advancing maturity. When large-cap tokens enter the market, it’s a sign of increasing institutional interest and further diversification of the crypto asset space that now extends well beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The crypto asset market is now well over $1 trillion. “New market segments are emerging, and they are doing so with innovative solutions and unique value propositions that they are bringing to users,” says Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael. Yet, the timing of these token launches with the softness of the market right now has to make you wonder about the potential long-term impacts on venture capital. The reason I say this is because as more tokens enter the market and start unlocking value, the price of these tokens is so uncertain right now that the potential for big price fluctuations seems pretty high. And when the current crop of tokens starts to unfold its attribution of value, how will that fare in the context of price stability? Outlook for Crypto Venture Capital: A Cautious but Optimistic Future When considering the future, one may expect that venture capital investment in the crypto space will likely face a period of caution, at least in the short term. In a recent downturn, not only have crypto prices fallen but the number of new tokens flooding the market has also increased. Could these developments lead to a pullback in VC investment in the crypto space? While venture capitalists appear to be taking a more cautious approach to their crypto investments for now, assessing market stability and adjusting their strategies accordingly, the underlying trends in the crypto market seem healthy. Projects that provide concrete value and bolster infrastructure are the ones that investors will likely continue to dump money into, but don’t mistake the lack of funding for projects that are still in the experimental stage as a death knell for innovation. While value and real-world infrastructure enable blockchain’s buildout alongside other transformative technologies, there’s fertile ground for innovative ideas to push the crypto space forward. To sum up, even though the softness of the current crypto market may have short-term implications for venture capital flowing into this space, it is not because investors have lost faith in the long-term prospects for blockchain technology and its integration into the real world. Quite the opposite: We are witnessing a few disruptive years in the tech market, and crypto still seems to be a key player in that dance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007691,https://nulltx.com/?p=147778,1743979762,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Crypto Whale 0x373 Shifts from Meme Coin Hype to DeFi Potential with Major PENDLE Investment,https://nulltx.com/crypto-whale-0x373-shifts-from-meme-coin-hype-to-defi-potential-with-major-pendle-investment/,"One of the crypto world’s most influential whales, identified as 0x373, has shifted strategy. This whale , which has been under scrutiny for its huge holdings and trading activity, now appears to be withdrawing from the wild meme-coin market and parking its assets in the far-more-stable DeFi space. Recent trades indicate that 0x373 has stopped riding the meme coin hype wave and is now making a serious bet on DeFi assets, with purchases of $PENDLE. In an intriguing move, the whale unloaded a significant portion of its $PEPE holdings, which had been a staple in its portfolio. Specifically, the whale dumped 196.1 billion PEPE tokens, amounting to $1.3 million; it swapped these for 720.6 WETH (Wrapped Ether). This swap, priced at an average of $0.000006641 per PEPE, is the latest in a series of moves that show the whale growing more and more confident in the future potential of DeFi projects. A Shift Toward PENDLE: The Whale’s Bold Move Instead of keeping its freshly obtained ETH, the whale made yet another audacious move—using a hefty chunk of its WETH reserves to snap up 397,192 $PENDLE tokens. At $3.08 a pop, this buy totaled nearly $1.22 million. This shows the whale’s hand; it’s betting on the future of PENDLE, which as a decentralized finance token seems to be carving out an interesting niche. The token, it should be said, has been getting attention lately for its purported asset tokenization and yield optimization solutions. For three consecutive days, 0x373 has made significant trades that suggest he is becoming more and more convinced about PENDLE’s potential. The whale first traded PEPE, selling 261.2 billion of the assets for 1,060 WETH, which was worth approximately $1.94 million. Then, in a move that appears to directly counteract his first trade, the whale purchased 607,863 PENDLE tokens using 1,016 WETH. That amount was worth roughly $1.86 million, and he bought the tokens at an average price of $3.066 each. Even after these large trades, the whale’s investment in meme coins remains large. It holds a staggering 2.597 trillion PEPE tokens, worth about $18.05 million. On that investment, it’s made a profit of roughly $28.41 million, for a total return of around 5.25 times what it originally put into PEPE. A major crypto whale, 0x373, seems to be making a bold shift in strategy—trading meme coin hype for DeFi potential. Over the past 13 hours, the whale sold 196.1B $PEPE ($1.3M) and swapped it for 720.6 WETH, averaging $0.000006641 per PEPE. But it didn’t stop there. pic.twitter.com/iYoAuJahLg — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 4, 2025 So, why did this whale recently swap some PEPE for PENDLE? One potential reason is that it reflects a shift in what sorts of assets the whale is holding. Compared to PEPE and other meme coins, PENDLE is a much more serious investment. The Bigger Picture: A Changing Crypto Landscape Whale’s movement from meme coins to DeFi reflects broader crypto market shifts. Despite meme coins like $PEPE captivating the public and giving people a feel for the potential scale of growth in the crypto market, we at Decrypt have begun to see some signs, or signals, that investors are questioning the future sustainability of these kinds of coins. Their value almost seems to sink or swim with the current price of ether. Conversely, decentralized finance schemes such as $PENDLE are gaining momentum for their real-world applications and their possible long-term value creation. PENDLE, which aims to focus on the tokenization of yield-bearing assets, has caught the attention of investors hunting for innovative ways to unlock liquidity and optimize returns in DeFi. This is a space where you must truly look beneath the surface, as much of what is going on in DeFi outside of PENDLE may appear pond scummy. And yet, the pivot toward DeFi in this crypto winter is also a pivot toward looking for value beyond the narrative we were fed in 2021. Whale 0x373 moving to PENDLE could be a sign of something very different from what we’ve seen before in this address. For 0x373, the apparent move from CRV to PENDLE could be an effort to maximize yield and liquidity and a step toward future-proofing these assets. DeFi has become a key pillar of the crypto ecosystem, and projects like PENDLE are positioned well within this space. If the address is holding these assets for the long term, it could signal something very different in terms of strategy for this whale. Looking Ahead: More PEPE-to-PENDLE Swaps? Considering the recent maneuvers by the whale—and its ongoing shift in strategy—it seems pretty likely we’ll be seeing more PEPE-to-PENDLE swaps in the days ahead. The huge amount of $PEPE still held by the whale—along with some pretty decent profits on that asset—suggests that the whale is still using PEPE as a key part of its overall portfolio, rebalancing into PENDLE and other DeFi plays as part of a larger emerging strategy. For the broader crypto community, the recent actions of 0x373 serve as a reminder that the biggest and most influential players in crypto are always adjusting their strategies to meet the market. While many investors find allure in meme coins, the move towards DeFi reflects a broader trend within crypto towards assets that have much more long-term utility and growth potential. As DeFi projects like PENDLE continue to mature, the space could see much more interest from large investors looking for innovative ways to use crypto in the real world. In summary, 0x373’s shift in strategy from meme coins to DeFi assets like PENDLE demonstrates the crypto market’s shifting nature. As the industry has grown up, investors who put their money where their mouth is have started focusing more on the types of projects that have actual long-term potential and real-world applications. Those of us who are trading and investing in DeFi may be trailblazing the next big movement within the crypto ecosystem. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007848,https://nulltx.com/?p=147779,1743980043,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Regains Lead as DEX Volume Leader in March, Surpassing Solana",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-regains-lead-as-dex-volume-leader-in-march-surpassing-solana/,"In a remarkable turnaround, Ethereum has taken back its place as the dominant blockchain in trading volume for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). After Solana had spent several months in first place, Ethereum has now reclaimed the top position it last held in September 2024. Ethereum was not only resilient during the past few months, but it also surged dramatically in trading activity this March 2025—reaching trading volume levels it had not seen in approximately six months. That surge, on top of its already solid position in trading on DEXs, now makes Ethereum the leading blockchain for DeFi traders. Ethereum’s Strong Comeback: Dominating the DEX Market The most recent data shows that total DEX volume in March reached an impressive $245.8 billion. Ethereum accounted for 26.3% of this total, putting it ahead of Solana and atop the leaderboard among blockchains. Solana, which had seen a surge in DEX trading activity thanks to its high-speed, low-cost transactions, held 21.4% of the total market share in March, marking a noticeable decline in its fortunes as Ethereum surged on the volume front. This shift is the latest indication that confidence is returning to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, which continues to attract both retail and institutional traders despite competition from other blockchains. Ethereum returns as DEX volume leader in March @ethereum reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for DEX trading volume, surpassing @solana for the first time since September. The total DEX volume in March amounted to $245.8 billion, with @ethereum capturing 26.3% and… pic.twitter.com/bnxFEyZ88x — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 3, 2025 Several factors have brought Ethereum back to life. First, it is underpinned by continued active development that has, among other things, made Ethereum more scalable. Second, it has maintained a dominant position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It is where you go if you want to do anything on a dApp or a protocol in the DeFi space. It’s foundation seems to be unshakeable. In recent months, Ethereum has also profited from the blossoming popularity of layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum. These protocols, which operate on top of Ethereum, offer users faster and cheaper transactions while keeping the security promises that Ethereum itself makes. That assurance is crucial since layer-2s will inevitably process plenty of transactions for protocols that could be described as dubious. Still, they are using Ethereum’s base layer for assurance, and they had better not have a security incident. Solana’s Decline: What Does it Mean for the Future? Ethereum may still have the upper hand in terms of total value locked, but it and its layer-2 solutions still have plenty of room for improvement if they want to stay ahead of blockchain monoliths like Solana. While Solana is now back on an upswing, its trading volume in the DeFi space has dipped recently. This has happened in tandem with a spike in DEX trading on layer-2 solutions like Optimism, as well as on Ethereum itself. This decline could have several causes. One possible reason is the continued upheaval in the cryptocurrency market, which has prompted some investors to move their assets into more stable, established ecosystems like Ethereum. Solana had a tough 2023, marked by serious network outages and some security problems, which makes you wonder if those couldn’t have also contributed to a user confidence hit that Solana might have suffered as a result. Solana is picking itself back up in 2023, however. Its technological fortress is tighter and more robust than ever. Its user base should continue to grow, driven by an economic model that looks increasingly sound and equitable. Possibly on the rise is the increasing adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions. As Ethereum scales and becomes a solution more accessible to a wider audience, its traders and developers may find the speed advantage of Solana’s transactions not such an impressive selling point anymore. Part of the reason for this is that the downturn in DeFi seems to have had little impact on Ethereum, whose robust developer community and ecosystem give it a unique DeFi advantage. Ethereum’s Competitive Edge: What’s Next for DEX Volume? The regained command of Ethereum’s for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume clearly indicates that the decentralized finance (DeFi) market is maturing. Helmed by Ethereum, the DeFi market continues to confidently sail forward. The set of protocols and overall ecosystem have cemented Ethereum’s lead in this newly emerging asset class. Presently, these DeFi assets and the protocols underpinning them exist almost entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Even with the avalanche of alternatives that have surfaced over the past 15 months, the Ethereum network remains the primary venue for DeFi. The Development of Decentralized Assets The alternative decentralized finance (DeFi) asset class is in the midst of development. The development of decentralized applications (dApps) sits on top of smart contracts, the veiled promises of which are now being fulfilled. With a firm foundation in Ethereum smart contracts, the Elrond (EGLD) blockchain ecosystem and its native decentralized finance assets (in the form of financial contracts) signal the maturation of both the dApp and decentralized asset classes. Merging Ethereum with layer-2 solutions and other scalability improvements makes it even more appealing. With these updates, the Ethereum network can take on a lot more users without its transaction speeds or costs being affected. This improved scalability, along with the shift to proof of stake, means that, in the long run, Ethereum seems more likely to maintain its DeFi dominant position than it does to fall behind newer blockchains like Solana, which also seem to have robustDeFi ecosystems. Moreover, Ethereum has a robust developer community that lets it be a persistent best-in-class solution in the NFT space. This nearly unrivaled presence in another crypto sector serves to strengthen Ethereum’s network effects. These network effects extend well beyond just DEXs to a huge variety of crypto applications, including NFTs, gaming, and much more. This unparalleled wide-ranging appeal among developers and users permits Ethereum to maintain its leading position as the best blockchain for DeFi and other “crypto cases.” Conclusion: Ethereum’s Path Forward in a Competitive Market Ethereum’s dominance in the DEX space hasn’t just returned; it has renewed itself with strength and resiliency in the face of increasing competition from other blockchains like Solana. The return to dominance was marked by an almost unparalleled foundation in decentralized finance, something that has Ethereum scaling over the horizon as it maintains a leadership position in the DeFi ecosystem. Even while Solana and other blockchain platforms keep innovating and successfully drawing in users, the Ethereum blockchain’s extensive ecosystem, network effects, and burgeoning solutions in scalability give it the competitive edge needed to stay on top. As the Ethereum blockchain continues its evolution, the solidity of its position as the leading decentralized exchange trading platform seems more probable than not, and it appears to be the most likely choice for DeFi traders and developers for the next several years.

Meanwhile, Circle has initiated its second attempt at an IPO as the USDC issuer filed its prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The stablecoin issuer aims for a $5 billion valuation as it navigates a volatile market fraught with regulatory challenges. Meanwhile, Shibarium hit 1 billion transactions within two years of launch, and the Trump family is continuing to expand its footprint in the crypto ecosystem. Let’s recap some of the biggest stories from the week. Bitcoin Bitcoin proxies Strategy, Metaplanet, and Boyaa could be ready to break out and head significantly higher. Strategy recently made a $1.92 billion BTC purchase, giving it an assailable lead over other Bitcoin-oriented companies. Meanwhile, Boyaa has quietly established itself as the biggest holder of BTC in Asia and Metaplanet has received a lease of life after following in Strategy’s footsteps. DeFi The Graphite Network launched its Market Staking Program on March 31, 2025. The program is an innovative model that rewards active traders rather than passive holders, reflecting a significant change ongoing in the DeFi space where active staking has overtaken passive staking as the preferred approach for traders. Following “Smart Money” could be one of the biggest ways newbie crypto traders and investors can avoid the pitfalls that come with participating in a highly volatile market. The Smart Money Concept is based on the idea that some well-informed investors make more strategic decisions. Technology This week, the Shibarium blockchain completed a billion transactions. The Layer2 blockchain for the Shiba Inu ecosystem reached the milestone just 18 years after launch, highlighting its growing adoption and robust performance. It also highlights the SHIB ecosystem’s utility and supports the token’s burn mechanism, driving the token’s long-term value.

The crash followed a violent sell-off in U.S. equities tied directly to President Donald Trump’s new global tariffs, which kicked in just days ago. Investors are now watching a pileup of pain unfold in both crypto and traditional markets at the same time, as volatility takes over and financial systems crack under pressure. Bitcoin fell below the $78,000 mark on Sunday night, losing nearly 5% of its value in 24 hours and landing at $77,673, according to data from CoinGecko. The OG crypto had held above $80,000 almost all year—besides a few quick dips—but the new drop slams it 39% below its January all-time high. Liquidations wreck crypto after overnight collapse The fall in Bitcoin wasn’t isolated. Ethereum has dropped below $1,600 and Solana has plunged by 12% overnight, while XRP dropped by 8.6%, triggering panic across exchanges. The crash wiped out leveraged long positions and kicked off forced sell-offs. In just 24 hours, Bitcoin alone saw over $181 million in long liquidations, with CoinGlass data showing that Ether also got hit with $188 million in forced closures. Traders who were betting on upward moves got wiped when prices turned the other direction fast. While crypto burned, the pressure on U.S. stock futures increased too. On Sunday evening, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,531 points, a 4% decline, ahead of what looks like another brutal Monday session. S&P 500 futures were also down 4%, and the Nasdaq-100 mirrored the drop with its own 4% loss. All of this follows two days of absolute chaos on Wall Street as the White House confirmed the tariffs would stay in place, no matter the fallout. Stock heat map. Source: TradingView The collapse at the end of last week wasn’t a blip—it was historic. The Dow Jones saw back-to-back losses of over 1,500 points for the first time in U.S. history, including a 2,231-point plunge on Friday. The S&P 500 had its worst day since the COVID meltdown in March 2020, falling 6% in a single day. It lost 10% over two days, which dragged it more than 17% below its February peak and close to full bear market territory. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite did enter a bear market on Friday, dropping 22% from its high after losing nearly 6% on both Thursday and Friday. Investors hoping for good news over the weekend got none. There were no signs of a pullback or delay on the tariff rules, which are scheduled to take full effect by April 9. Instead, the administration doubled down on the aggressive trade policy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that position in an interview with CBS News on Sunday, saying, “The tariffs are coming… They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks.” He offered no flexibility and made no promise of relief, even after the historic collapse in financial markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on NBC News, where he revealed that more than 50 countries had already approached the U.S. government to discuss the new trade measures. But Bessent wasn’t optimistic. He warned, “They’ve been bad actors for a long time, and it’s not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” In other words, negotiations are happening, but nothing’s changing anytime soon. Right now, the markets are reacting exactly how you’d expect—like a building collapsing in slow motion. Every trader who was holding high hopes for a quick rebound just got hit with the reality that Washington isn’t backing down. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

How’d he get there?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/blackrocks-larry-fink-in-trumps-inner-circle/,"Larry Fink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock, is now locked in with Donald Trump, sitting inside the president’s tight inner circle after years of tension with the Republican party. On March 17, Larry met with Trump at the White House after delivering a massive win for the administration—BlackRock’s new deal to buy ports on both ends of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong company. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Trump brought in Elon Musk , Vice President JD Vance, and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz for the closed-door discussion that ran over an hour. The topics included the U.S. economy, financial markets, and the port deal that has already triggered backlash from Beijing. The canal deal is about power. China says the transaction would restrict trade and turn the Panama Canal into a U.S. political weapon. Trump sees it as a move to weaken Chinese control over global infrastructure. He’s told people he now wants Larry at Mar-a-Lago this month, hosting him alongside top investors. The White House put out a statement through Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, saying, “The President always appreciates efforts from American companies to advance our nation’s national security interests.” President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Laurence “Larry” Fink at the White House. Credits: Getty Images Larry got here by playing every side, every time Larry didn’t start in Trump’s corner. He backed Barack Obama in 2012. He donated to Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, he went to a fundraiser for Joe Biden, and his top lieutenants joined Biden’s White House. But that never stopped him from also throwing money at Republicans. During Trump’s first term, Larry advised the administration while BlackRock handled some of Trump’s personal investments. The relationship goes back to the early 2000s. “Larry has a rare combination of commercial, political and public-policy savvy,” said Hank Paulson, who was Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush. Still, that didn’t protect him when the GOP came for him. Around 2017, Larry started pushing ESG investing—environmental, social, and corporate governance. It was the same time the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements were entering boardrooms. Larry told CEOs in a 2020 letter that “climate risk is investment risk” and warned BlackRock might vote against companies that didn’t improve their climate disclosures. That pissed off Republicans. Lawsuits followed. Red states dragged BlackRock into court, accusing the firm of putting politics above profits. Congress opened investigations. The firm tripled spending on Larry’s personal security. By 2022, it was obvious the firm’s GOP connections weren’t strong enough. Larry toned down his public ESG talk. Privately, he met with Republican lawmakers and softened his stance. Patrick McHenry, a Republican who used to chair the House Financial Services Committee, said, “I look at Larry having an adeptness to pivot when he needs to. I think it’s benefited the company, and certainly benefited his standing among policymakers that are running Washington right now.” That pivot helped, but the real shift came when BlackRock started making giant moves in private markets. In 2023, the firm paid $12.5 billion for Global Infrastructure Partners, a company that controls airports, railroads, and data centers. Then it dropped $12 billion on HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit firm. These were BlackRock’s biggest deals in 15 years. They gave Larry the power to do exactly what Trump wanted: take control of the Panama Canal ports from CK Hutchison, a Chinese-linked company. “The ports deal is something they wouldn’t have been able to do prior to the acquisition,” said Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s former Treasury Secretary. Even though Trump just gave him a front-row seat, not everyone in the GOP is ready to forgive. Will Hild, executive director of the anti-BlackRock group Consumers’ Research, isn’t backing down. The group is backed by Leonard Leo, co-chair of the Federalist Society, and it’s gunning for BlackRock over ESG. “We are by no means at all done with BlackRock,” Hild said. Despite the critics, Larry keeps pulling strings. During the March 17 meeting, he and Musk talked about a deal between xAI and BlackRock’s new AI fund. That puts Larry right where he wants to be—next to Trump, at the intersection of money, tech, and national security.

Despite the turmoil in the traditional markets, the flagship cryptocurrency has held firm above $80,000, with the stability highlighting its potential as a safe haven asset. BTC is currently down almost 1%, trading at $82,836 and holding above $80,000 despite ETF outflows, growing trade tensions, and concerns about delayed rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Firm Despite Heightened Volatility Bitcoin (BTC) remained above $80,000 on Friday and Saturday despite broader market turmoil and selling pressure. However, demand has waned as fears of a full-blown trade war escalate, along with risks of a recession and a delayed rate cut decision by the Federal Reserve. Markets also witnessed BTC decoupling from the US equity markets and outperforming gold, signaling a significant shift in market dynamics. Market intelligence platform Santiment stated, “Social media has been buzzing with mentions of crypto’s ‘decoupling’ from stock markets, according to data from X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and BitcoinTalk. Following the S&P 500‘s -10.5% combined losses on Thursday and Friday alone, traders are optimistic that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are fairly insulated from the US & China tariffs that have rocked global economies.” It also said that crypto becoming less reliant on the stock market is a promising sign. “If the crypto markets are indeed becoming less and less reliant on stock markets, this would be an encouraging sign. Historically, most of the cryptocurrency’s biggest bull cycles have come when there is zero (neither a negative nor positive) correlation between the two sectors.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Outflows Despite Bitcoin’s relative stability, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered considerable outflows, signaling investor caution and indicating that the rally may lack strong investor backing. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also threw another curveball for the markets, suggesting a potential delay to Fed rate cuts. According to data from Farside Investors, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) registered net outflows of $44.6 million, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) registered net outflows of $35.5 million. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) registered net outflows of $24.1 million, and ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw net outflows of $22.2 million. However, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) registered net inflows. As a result, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market registered net total outflows of $165 million, ending a two-week inflow streak. Fed Issues Stagflation Warning Bitcoin and altcoins could come under renewed pressure after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned President Donald Trump’s tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slow growth. Powell said on Friday, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.” High inflation and high unemployment can lead to stagflation, which could become difficult to manage. This is because measures taken to fix one issue, like cutting interest rates to boost growth, could worsen the other issue and vice versa. Powell also said he was in no hurry to cut interest rates as inflation remained high, a stance supported by other officials like Raphael Bostic and Adriana Kugler. However, President Donald Trump urged Powell to cut interest rates. According to market experts, a more hawkish Fed could negatively impact Bitcoin, altcoin, and stock prices. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $80,000 as the weekend draws to a close. BTC’s relative stability comes despite the market turmoil and highlights its potential as a safe haven asset. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, known to be positively correlated to Bitcoin, dropped over 11% since President Trump’s announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating global trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, stated, “The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown impressive resilience. After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists.” However, analysts have not ruled out sharp downside volatility in the short term, especially as the “Treasury market basis trade” faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices. BTC traded in bearish territory over the previous weekend, dropping over 3% on Friday, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC fell below the 20-day SMA on Saturday and settled at $82,704. The price registered a marginal decline on Sunday, settling at $82,404. BTC faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $85,152. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, BTC lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3%, slipping below $85,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,525. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Thursday despite significant selling pressure, rising almost 1% and settling at $83,199. The price continued its upward trajectory on Friday, registering an increase of 0.76% and settling at $83,828. However, it lost momentum over the weekend and registered a marginal decline on Saturday, dropping to $83,423. The current session sees BTC down almost 1% as sellers look to drive it below $80,000. However, BTC has not ceded ground to the bears and has held firm above this level. If buyers regain control, BTC could move past $85,000 and push toward $90,000.

In a scathing critique that has renewed allegations about one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, ZachXBT says Coinbase’s culture is defined by a “lack of transparency.” On social media, ZachXBT expressed frustration : “You have locked me out of my account twice in the last month with no reason given (again today). You had customer data leaks you haven’t transparently announced (lead to thefts).” While he acknowledged that the platform offers a decent annual percentage return on stablecoins, he ultimately stated that he could not recommend Coinbase as an exchange to others. ZachXBT ignites fresh backlash over Coinbase’s troubled history with user trust and security ZachXBT comments have sparked controversy about Coinbase’s customer data handling, practices, and support. While the company largely promotes itself as the “future of money” and a paragon of regulatory compliance in the crypto space, incidents of this nature do little to enhance its reputation — especially among more experienced users. Coinbase portrays itself as a secure, transparent, and regulated entry point to crypto —a message that is easy to sell to institutional investors and new entrants. Its initial public offering in 2021 was a watershed moment for the crypto industry. But the company’s history tells a more complex tale for long-time users and crypto veterans. That same year, Coinbase was criticized after thousands of users reported being locked out of their accounts, some for months, without any resolution. The New York Times explained how so many of these customers could not connect with support when they were most vulnerable, with catastrophic loss as the prices swung violently. A similar bug in Coinbase’s SMS account recovery process later that same year allowed hackers to bypass two-factor authentication to drain user wallets. Coinbase ultimately reimbursed some victims, but critics pointed out that the company was slow to communicate and did not take the breach seriously enough. Coinbase faces increasing regulatory pressure while users express growing discontent Coinbase is not new to controversy. In 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the company for operating an unregistered securities exchange. Whereas Coinbase is battling the suit, positioning itself as a pioneer of regulatory compliance, users like ZachXBT wonder whether the company has also displayed the same diligence in protecting and communicating with its customers. Coinbase has pushed back legally — demanding the creation of new regulatory frameworks for the industry — but the lawsuit has increased pressure on the company to demonstrate its commitment to compliance, not only with regulators but with users. ZachXBT’s remarks also reflect a widespread mistrust of the status quo in the crypto world, many of whom gravitate toward decentralized platforms in search of greater control, transparency, and reliability. Condemnation like ZachXBT’s carries particular weight in the crypto world. Famed for carefully tracking a range of fraudulent schemes and aiding users in retrieving lost funds, he is a widely regarded guardian of crypto ethics — one whose critiques spur wider action or awareness.

The British carmaker said on Saturday that the pause is a short-term action as it works to address the new trading terms with its business partners. The automotive company added that the pause on shipments will become effective this month. “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.” ~ Jaguar Land Rover Automotive. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said that the US is an important market for its luxury cars and brands. According to fact sheets from the UK Department for Business and Trade, cars are the top exported goods from the UK to the US. Car exports in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2024 totaled a staggering £8.3 billion. Other carmakers might pause US exports too Analysts predict that other carmakers will follow the steps of JLR and pause US exports. The imposed tariffs have added more pressure on the automotive industry in Britain. The demand for British-made cars has decreased domestically and in Europe, while sales in China have been on the decline. Furthermore, British carmakers are lagging in the electric vehicles race as factories are required to overhaul existing machinery. University of Birmingham Professor David Bailey told The Guardian that “much of UK auto is already operating well below capacity, and the tariffs will be a further hit for a struggling industry.” He said that “production cuts and job losses are likely,” and he believes that the number of jobs at risk due to the US’s tariffs is underestimated. Bailey thinks that JLR will continue to struggle unless it creates a US-based automotive factory. According to Reuters, German car makers Audi, Mercedes, and BMW are considering expanding their operations in the United States. Tariffs are pressuring international carmakers to move operations to the US, bringing Trump’s vision to reality. British carmakers have taken measures to reduce the impact of US tariffs by increasing exports and building stockpiles in the States months prior to their implementation. According to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car exports to the US in December, January, and February surged by 38.5%, 12.4%, and 34.6%, respectively. On April 3rd, the United Stated implemented a 25% tariff on imported vehicles. This tariff is applicable to vehicles from all countries including those covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Dogecoin (DOGE) is sitting on a fragile $0.16 support after a 16% drop, and XRP is caught in a utility-versus-scarcity debate that could shape its long-term trajectory. But while questions linger around these assets, BlockDAG is answering with action. The launch of BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 is more than just a technical release—it’s a milestone that signals readiness and long-term potential. With real tools, real users, and real utility already in place, the project is turning heads in all the right ways. As momentum builds, many are beginning to see BlockDAG as one of the clearest answers to the question: Which crypto coin has true growth potential right now? BlockDAG Beta Testnet Turns Plans into Performance BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 is officially live, and it’s already drawing attention for how much it offers right out of the gate. This isn’t just a behind-the-scenes milestone for developers—it’s an open door to a functioning ecosystem. Users can now explore working decentralized apps, launch tokens or NFTs through a no-code builder, and navigate the updated explorer with ease. Built for wide accessibility, not just developers, this environment gives a real look at how BlockDAG aims to scale. What separates BlockDAG from other emerging platforms is its ability to shift from talk to action. The no-code creation tool allows anyone—even non-developers—to build new digital assets. Every token or NFT created will rely on BDAG to function, directly tying the platform’s growth to real-world usage. That’s the kind of utility that creates ongoing demand—not just temporary hype. The rollout also comes with serious user incentives. BlockDAG has allocated $60,000 in BDAG rewards for testnet participation, with the most active wallets eligible for $2,000 each. It’s a smart strategy that promotes hands-on interaction and encourages community building from day one. The numbers further support its rising momentum. BlockDAG has raised more than $212 million in presale funding and sold over 19.1 billion coins. Now in batch 27, BDAG trades at $0.0248—a jump of 2,380% from its initial batch price of $0.001. As other networks stall or debate direction, BlockDAG is clearly pushing ahead with measurable, meaningful progress. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Today Pressures $0.16 Support After 16% Weekly Drop Dogecoin is currently hovering at the $0.16 support level after falling 16% over the past week. This price point is being closely watched, as a bounce could trigger a short-term recovery toward $0.20 or even $0.25. But a dip below this level risks sparking broader selloffs that may drag DOGE closer to $0.10—or possibly $0.06 in a worst-case slide. Historically, similar support levels have attracted new buyers, helping DOGE rebound. While that’s still possible, broader market conditions remain mixed, and the lack of a fresh catalyst leaves DOGE in a vulnerable position. Traders are staying alert, as the next move could shape sentiment for weeks to come. XRP Price Outlook Faces New Utility vs. Velocity Debate The conversation around XRP is heating up again, this time focusing on how utility may or may not drive long-term value. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently suggested that a higher price could actually make XRP more efficient by reducing the amount needed for large transactions. That’s sparked renewed optimism about XRP’s role in major financial flows. However, there’s growing concern from within the XRP community about token velocity. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) driving fast, high-frequency transactions, some worry this activity could dilute long-term price growth by affecting scarcity. Ideas like automated market makers (AMMs) to control circulating supply are gaining traction, especially as institutions show greater interest. The XRP price outlook now depends on whether Ripple can balance speed and usefulness with scarcity and long-term value. It’s a nuanced path—but one that, if managed well, could open up broader adoption and price stability. Final Takeaway Dogecoin’s recent 16% dip puts it in a critical position, with $0.16 acting as a make-or-break level. XRP’s future is tied to how its utility evolves, with debates over speed and scarcity continuing to shape community expectations. But while both face pressing questions, BlockDAG is focused on solutions—and delivering them. With its Beta Testnet V1 now live, BlockDAG is proving it can build, launch, and grow—fast. Real dApps, a user-friendly no-code asset builder, and generous participation rewards show the team’s commitment to usability and scalability. Backed by $212 million in presale funding and a 2,380% price increase since batch 1, BlockDAG is turning momentum into progress. For those looking ahead and asking which crypto coin offers the clearest path to real-world growth—BlockDAG is stepping forward with results.

The Impact of CEX Listings on BlockDAG—Updates on Solaxy & SHIB’s 15M Burn,https://thecoinrise.com/will-bdag-reach-20-the-impact-of-cex-listings-on-blockdag-updates-on-solaxy-shibs-15m-burn/,"When a token lands on ten major exchanges consecutively, what’s the result? BlockDAG is set to find out, while developments in Solaxy and Shiba Inu’s market activities also draw attention. Solaxy has recently surpassed $29 million in funding, marking the launch of Solana’s first Layer-2 with active staking. In contrast, SHIB has eliminated over 819 million tokens, yet stagnant total value locked and a 3% price dip have stirred concerns. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under the spotlight, not merely for its growth but for its escalating presence. As it prepares to join 10 CEXs, each new addition contributes like a chain reaction: enhancing liquidity, attracting new participants, and supporting a higher baseline price for BDAG. This dynamic has led analysts to point to BDAG as a top crypto pick, with potential to hit $20. BlockDAG’s Exchange Listings May Significantly Drive Its Price BlockDAG continues its upward trajectory. With more than $212 million collected and 19.1 billion BDAG coins distributed in its ongoing presale, the momentum is tangible. From an initial price of $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, the presale has shown a 2,380% gain for early backers. The fast-paced presale, together with the live beta testnet featuring airdrops and weekly incentives, adds further excitement. The core of BlockDAG’s strategy lies in its plan to be listed on 10 centralized exchanges. Each listing boosts liquidity, attracts new participants, and reinforces the coin’s price stability. The initial CEX listing ignites the process. By the tenth, BDAG could transform significantly. As liquidity builds and recognition increases, analysts are beginning to forecast a long-term price of $20. Each listing brings additional benefits—increased wallets, more exposure, and higher volume. These aren’t mere events; they amplify BlockDAG’s value. They do more than maintain its position; they propel it forward. As visibility on each platform grows, this is why many recognize BlockDAG as a top crypto choice today. By the end of the final listing, the price baseline is expected to shift significantly. If BDAG continues to accumulate listings, its value could not only rise but accelerate. Watching from the sidelines might mean seeing the price from an elevated viewpoint. That’s why grabbing BDAG now, while it’s below $0.03, is advised. Solaxy Update: $29M Achieved and Upcoming Layer-2 Launch The recent developments in Solaxy show that it has successfully amassed over $29 million in its presale, establishing itself as the pioneering Layer-2 solution for Solana. This rollout aims to address congestion issues with a rollup-based structure, ensuring smooth operations during high-traffic periods such as meme coin transactions. Solaxy further enhances its offering by linking Ethereum’s liquidity to Solana’s speed via the multi-chain SOLX token, providing a hybrid advantage to users. Notably, staking is already operational in this presale phase, with SOLX holders potentially earning up to 140% APY. However, this rate may decrease as participation increases. With an imminent price increase in the presale, this update serves as a crucial alert for potential participants. Post-launch, SOLX will be available on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, with stakers eligible to claim their tokens a week after. Shiba Inu’s Market Analysis Post-819 Million Token Burn Despite the burning of 819 million tokens, Shiba Inu’s market price is under strain. The recent destruction of 15 million SHIB did not prevent a 60% reduction in the overall burn rate, accompanied by a 3% decline in SHIB’s price. This dip corresponds with a lack of movement in Shibarium’s total value locked, leading to doubts about the effectiveness of the burn strategy in boosting prices shortly. Market patterns have shown fluctuations with occurrences of both death and golden crosses, indicating uncertainty. SHIB currently trades at approximately $0.00001242, just under a significant resistance level. Opinions among analysts about SHIB’s future price are mixed, predicting potential volatility. The focal point now is whether increased demand will emerge as the token burning persists and Shibarium gains broader acceptance. Takeaway The latest updates from Solaxy indicate a robust presale and readiness to expand Solana through its Layer-2 solution. In contrast, Shiba Inu’s price forecast remains tentative, with ongoing token burns yet to significantly impact the market due to subdued activity on Shibarium. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is creating substantial momentum. With over $212 million gathered in crypto presale and plans for listings on 10 key exchanges, the cascading effect of these listings is beginning to unfold. Each new listing escalates BlockDAG’s visibility, trading activity, and price prospects. Analysts endorsing it as a prime crypto purchase today are not just swayed by enthusiasm but recognize the solid technology underlying BDAG’s growth. As the listing process completes, the $20 price target could soon be a reality, making it a prudent purchase while still in the early stages.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Matthew Sigel – the head of digital assets research at VanEck – says that President Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs will accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a tool for the settlement of energy trade. “China and Russia were recently revealed to be settling some energy transactions using Bitcoin and other digital assets – just as we anticipated. Bolivia also announced plans in March to import energy using crypto. And in Europe, French utility EDF (?Électricité de France) will explore using surplus electricity – currently exported to Germany – to mine Bitcoin. These developments highlight how digital assets are evolving from speculative instruments into tools for energy trade and monetary realignment. In that context, the latest tariffs aren’t just an economic story – they may be an accelerant for Bitcoin’s role in the emerging multi-polar order.” Sigel goes on to say that traders should keep an eye on the policies of the US Federal Reserve, China and the EU to better gauge the crypto markets. He also notes the relevance of the strength of the US dollar and BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. According to Sigel, if China and the EU were to retaliate to Trump’s tariffs and move away from the US dollar, it could boost use cases for digital assets. “Investors should watch the evolving path of Fed policy: dovish shifts in rate expectations and rising liquidity are historically positive for Bitcoin. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is another key gauge – any signs of dollar weakness may support the Bitcoin-as-hedge narrative. Bitcoin ETF flows and on-chain activity also matter: despite volatility, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs are still net positive by ~$600 million year-to-date, with renewed inflows seen in late March. And finally, any retaliatory steps from China or the EU – especially ones that bypass dollar-based systems – could accelerate the strategic case for crypto.” Last week, Trump signed an executive order that imposes sweeping or reciprocal tariffs on a long list of nations, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. The announcement rocked global markets, causing a sharp dip in digital asset and stock prices.

Meanwhile, Cardano sees significant sales, with 120 million ADA sold in just two days. Amid these market shifts, one platform is making strides by equipping creators with the tools they need, rather than just promises. BlockDAG’s recent beta testnet release introduces a no-code token and NFT creation tool. This tool, akin to a Shopify for crypto, enables users to design and launch Web3 projects effortlessly. The outcome? An increase in token and NFT launches, enhancing reasons to engage with BDAG. For those eyeing the crypto market, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers tangible utility and compelling reasons to pay attention. BlockDAG’s No-Code Tool Makes Web3 Accessible to All BlockDAG’s recent initiative goes beyond enhancing blockchain speed or security – it democratizes access. With the new no-code tool for creating tokens and NFTs now available on the beta testnet, anyone can engage in Web3 development without any coding expertise. This user-friendly approach transforms the platform into a hub for creators who might feel overwhelmed by the technical demands of networks like Ethereum or Solana. This ease of use is significant. Every new token or NFT made with BlockDAG’s tool runs on BDAG, creating more transactions and increasing demand for the coin – a virtuous cycle of utility. As the testnet progresses and the mainnet launch nears, BlockDAG stands out as a crypto worth watching, with its value clearly linked to its usage. The beta testnet, launched on March 28, also features improved blockchain explorers, faucet access, and a dashboard tailored for creators. Additionally, it offers a $60,000 reward pool, with $2,000 in BDAG allocated to the top 10 most active users. Already, over 110,000 participants are testing the network, helping refine its performance ahead of the mainnet launch. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale is in its 27th batch, with BDAG priced at $0.0248. To date, over 18.8 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $212 million. BlockDAG is rapidly gaining traction among both users and developers, making it a noteworthy crypto to consider. Shiba Inu Struggles Amid Network Growth Despite an active network, Shiba Inu’s price continues to fall. Currently, it is trading at $0.00001226, marking an 8.28% decrease this week and a 55% drop year-over-year. The Shibarium network has surpassed 1 billion transactions, yet 62% of SHIB holders are experiencing losses. The token burn rate has also decreased, with 37.6 million SHIB burned in the last day—a 60% reduction from the day before. Shibarium’s transition to real-world applications has not boosted SHIB’s value. Trading volumes have decreased by 40% in the last 24 hours, and with the majority of SHIB controlled by large holders, price fluctuations continue to be erratic. Without sustained demand or effective token burns, the downward trend in Shiba Inu’s price may persist, potentially leading to further losses for holders. Cardano Faces Volatility from Whale Transactions Cardano has experienced significant trading activity, with 120 million ADA sold over two days. This has reduced the total ADA held in large wallets from 5.84 billion to 5.71 billion. Cardano’s price briefly fell to $0.61, then recovered to $0.66, but it still shows a nearly 6% decline over the week. The proportion of ADA held by whales has decreased to 8.48%, with retail holders now owning 71.17% of the supply. This trend highlights a shift away from short-term traders, who have decreased by 16.36%. Despite market pressures, institutional interest remains strong, with Cardano-focused exchange-traded products (ETPs) receiving $0.6 million in new inflows last week, bringing the 2025 total to $70 million. Although whale activity has affected short-term prices, long-term institutional engagement appears robust. Overview of Market Dynamics The ongoing price declines of Shiba Inu and the active selling by Cardano whales are creating challenges for both communities. This situation is characterized by decreased trading, insufficient token burns, and ongoing sell-offs. As participants await market recovery, there is a growing interest in platforms that offer greater utility and simpler user interfaces. In this environment, BlockDAG introduces a significant tool: a no-code wizard for creating tokens and NFTs, making Web3 accessible to non-developers. Every operation on the platform engages BDAG, linking usage directly to the coin’s demand. For those exploring crypto options, BlockDAG provides practical tools that are already in use. With its crypto presale now exceeding $212 million, the platform continues to gain momentum.

We didn’t hit our minimum raise,” the developers of the Real (REAL) token, Real World Gaming said in an April 6 X post, adding that “All bids will be refunded in full.” “This is not the end,” RWG said. The team only managed to raise $392,315 in USDC ( USDC ) over a 28-hour presale on April 5 and 6 — less than half of the minimum required and approximately 11% of the $3.6 million target, which was conducted via a sealed-bid auction. The public sale of 60 million REAL tokens (3% of the total 2 billion REAL supply) initially targeted a fully diluted value of $120 million, with the sealed bid auction starting at $0.06 per token.

Memecoins have also been cooling off since the launch of the Official Trump memecoin on Jan. 18, 2025.

Pepe Coin (PEPE), a meme token experiencing volatile price movements, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralised lending platform now in the fourth phase of its presale, are getting eyes for their potential to bring exponential gains. PEPE price hovers around $0.000000746, testing a falling wedge formation that could prompt an explosive 130% move for price if resistance is overcome, according to analysts. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) claims that it has raised $6.30 million with 7,900 holders so far and with tokens for stage 4 at $0.025 (which will increase 20% once stage 5 begins). Early investors locking in MUTM now at a launch price of $0.06 can expect to see returns of 140%, but in-after projections show a meteoric rise beyond $3.50! Technical Indicators for Pepe Coin Prompt Speculation A falling wedge pattern dominates Pepe Coin’s charts, which is on the verge of a breakout. As the meme token tumbles down 15% a week, opinions are split recently after a whale snapped up 492 billion PEPE for $3.74 million on April 1, 2025, leading many to believe that bullish momentum could be right around the corner. Resistance around $0.000001 and $0.0000015 serve as key barriers — with a definitive break potentially sending prices to $0.000002, representing a 161% increase. While technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator suggest a potential recovery in momentum, PEPE’s dependance on prevailing market sentiment and meme-induced volatility leaves its future uncertain. Although the accumulation of whales indicates confidence, analysts warn that wider market stability and a resurgence in retail interest are necessary for a sustained upward journey. We Built It So You Can Come Home: Mutuum Finance Presale In the fourth phase of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) manages to keep pulling in capital and tokens are currently being offered at $0.025 with a planned increase of 20% taking place in phase 5, making tokens $0.03. The project’s tokenomics secures a 140% yield at its $0.06 exchange listing, although projections range higher still: one projections as far as $3.50 post-launch puts a no less than 13,900% upside on current buyers. MUTM stands in contrast to the speculatively-driven value of PEPE, as the former is directly correlated to its DeFi lending ecosystem, which allows users to borrow against overcollateralized assets, and earn by utilizing mtTokens—interest-accruing deposit certificates. A buy-and-distribute mechanism only exacerbates demand, directing platform revenue into MUTM buys distributed to stakers — leading to cyclical buy pressure. Strength in a Bumpy Market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses real world utility to hedge against the risk that PEPE’s potential is dependent on uncontrollable meme trends. With a presale structure that is now 36% complete, the price of the tokens is steadily ramped up across 11 phases, rewarding early participation. Its ongoing smart contract audit, led by CertiK, will further assure investors, with audit results anticipated before listing on exchanges. Over 7,900 holders have positioned themselves early ahead of MUTM’s shift from presale to mainstream trading—which in the past has connected to fast price appreciation. With the crypto market bouncing between hype and fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuses both. Phase 4’s opening price of $0.025 leaves a shrinking opportunity for investors looking to make pre-launch gains, whereas PEPE’s technical setup remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. With calculated growth over volatility, thus MUTM’s presale stages reflect a rare convergence of urgency and opportunity. Last Call Before Opening Tickets Phase 5 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves closer to next price incrementation as phase 4 sells out quicker than previous phases. Investors placing $1,000 today would receive 40,000 tokens, some analysts predict to hit $3.50 per token post-launch, resulting in $45,000. Pending completion of the CertiK audit adds additional credibility in line with MUTM’s commitment to security and transparency. Time is running out for them to get in on the 140% launch return—phase 5’s price of $0.03 comes into play as soon as current allocations are cleared. While PEPE’s whales take a huge bet on a very fickle market sentiment, MUTM’s entire ascent has been structured, creating a roadmap for buyers to achieve exponential gains — no meme necessary.

Using the UTXO Realized Price Distribution metric, the crypto analyst pinpoints $0.18 and $0.2 as the key resistance levels the Dogecoin price must break to surge higher. How Dogecoin’s Critical $0.18 And $0.2 Resistance Levels Could Spark A Major Dogecoin Price Rally According to renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s analysis of the URPD metric, approximately 8% of the total DOGE supply was last traded at $0.18, with another 7% purchased at around $0.21. These price points with more trading activity create significant resistance barriers as investors who bought at these levels may sell to break even, potentially limiting upward movement. However, the crypto analyst suggests that if the Dogecoin price successfully breaks through these resistance levels, there would be relatively few obstacles to slow its upward momentum, potentially triggering a substantial rally. Currently trading near $0.17, the meme coin is approaching the first crucial resistance level at $0.18. Historically, social media sentiment and celebrity endorsements, particularly from figures like Elon Musk, have influenced Dogecoin price movements. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Gains Momentum As Dogecoin Price Nears Potential Surge WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is generating unusual buzz in crypto circles. Its beta platform showcases a merger of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance, creating an ecosystem where advanced AI algorithms drive real-time market insights. One notable attention-puller is its AI-powered predictive analytics tool , which digs through historical and live market data, identifying potential breakout opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Investors don’t have to babysit the charts to capitalize on these opportunities as the platform’s custom alerts, tailored to each portfolio, instantly notify them of critical market shifts. Furthermore, its automated transaction capabilities execute trades at the best possible times based on pre-set rules, making sure no opportunities are missed due to market timing. As users accrue more profits, they remain protected by the decentralized wallet’s security features, including a real-time anomaly detection system designed to catch and neutralize potential security threats before they can cause harm. Furthermore, the platform’s multi-layered approach with robust security protocols like biometric verification, multi-factor authentication, and QR scanning prevents unauthorized access to users’ portfolios. Since its CoinMarketCap debut , WallitIQ’s native WLTQ token has quickly attracted interest. Its low $0.0420 presale price positions it as a smart investment, especially in light of bullish market projections. With expectations of the AI market reaching $244 billion by 2025 and potentially exceeding $1.01 trillion by 2031, industry analysts forecast impressive financial outcomes for high-utility AI-powered crypto projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). They project the platform to generate monthly revenues of up to $7 million while predicting the native WLTQ token could achieve a potential 300% price increase as adoption grows. Adding another layer of appeal, early WallitIQ (WLTQ) adopters are offered substantial incentives, such as exclusive staking rewards up to 180% APY, access to high-yield liquidity pools, and governance rights to influence the platform’s future. The platform has already launched its MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App, which offers real-time price tracking and intuitive trading tools for managing assets like ETH and USDT. Users can also use its trade simulation capability to refine their strategies before committing actual funds. Adding to investor confidence, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) successful smart contract audit by SolidProof further solidifies its reputation as a secure and credible project. Savvy Investors Are Acting Now, Join Them On WallitIQ (WLTQ) As the Dogecoin price approaches its critical resistance levels, savvy investors are not only watching DOGE charts but also securing their position in promising projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). With the presale price currently at just $0.0420 and analysts forecasting potential gains of up to 300% as adoption accelerates, early investors are racing to acquire WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens before mainstream recognition drives prices higher. With the platform’s robust security features and profit-maximizing tools at the intersection of AI and DeFi, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is perfectly positioned to capture significant market share in the billion-dollar crypto AI market. With presale tokens selling quickly, now is the time to act on this rare opportunity before it’s too late.

As capital cautiously re-enters the space, retail and institutional players alike are focusing less on price hype and more on substance. For the top crypto coins, momentum is no longer enough—real infrastructure and adoption metrics are driving decisions. That’s where today’s divide emerges. While SUI is up 25% from March lows, every SUI price prediction remains contingent on resistance levels breaking. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a nearly 40% volume surge, but its outlook remains capped by instability in funding and price structure. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already proving traction. In Keynote 3, CEO Antony Turner shared that the X1 Miner App alone now supports “more than 800,000+ users mining, earning, and engaging with us.” Meanwhile, the TG Tap Miner added another 400,000+ users. With $210.5 million raised, 19.1 billion BDAG sold, and mobile-first mining at scale, BlockDAG is no longer projecting adoption—it’s executing it. SUI Price Prediction Eyes $3—but Resistance Remains a Deciding Factor The SUI price prediction is trending more positive following a 25% rebound since March lows, with the coin currently trading at $2.49. Technical momentum is supported by the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern—a historically bullish structure—that targets the $2.85 to $3 zone. Adding fuel to the forecast, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the SUI network has risen by 19.4% over the last three weeks, now totaling $1.23 billion. That metric reflects growing on-chain activity and user confidence. Still, the final leg of this run depends heavily on broader market behavior, especially from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action: Volume Up, But Direction Still Unclear The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is currently hovering near $0.00001267, having recently dipped to $0.0000122. Although the price has bounced slightly, what stands out is the 39.78% spike in trading volume, bringing the 24-hour tally to $261 million. Technical indicators are stabilizing. The RSI has recovered to 50.45, up from levels that were dangerously close to oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD just made a bullish crossover, implying short-term strength. However, funding rates remain erratic, flipping between positive and negative since February—a sign that leveraged traders are divided on SHIB’s direction. BlockDAG’s Mass Adoption Didn’t Wait for Mainnet—It Showed Up Early Unlike most Layer 1 projects that quietly build toward a launch with little user traction, BlockDAG took a different route—one that prioritized early utility and rapid community involvement. By the time its Keynote 3 premiered, the BlockDAG ecosystem was already alive with measurable activity. Through a blend of mobile accessibility and gamified experiences, the network had already attracted over 1.2 million users—long before the mainnet even went live. The foundation of this success lies in its dual-platform strategy. “To date we have more than 800,000+ users mining, earning, and engaging with us,” noted CEO Antony Turner, referencing the X1 Miner App during the keynote. In parallel, the TG Tap Miner game carved out a second powerful entry point: “400,000+ signed-up users and upwards of 100,000 active players every day,” Turner added. This approach doesn’t just reflect growth—it reflects readiness. As of Batch 27, BDAG’s price has already surged 2,380%, jumping from $0.001 to $0.0248. The project has now raised over $210.5 million and sold more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins, all without relying on venture capital—just retail support and utility traction. Looking ahead, forecasts estimate BDAG could reach $20 by 2027, which frames the current entry point as a rare pricing window. With its Testnet live, real user activity underway, and community tools scaling fast, BlockDAG isn’t just preparing for mass adoption—it’s already executing on it. The remaining variable? How long the current opportunity stays open before demand begins to drive scarcity. Wrap-Up: Which Crypto Holds Real Promise—SUI, SHIB, or BDAG? The market is crowded with movement, but not all motion is meaningful. SUI’s 25% rally may continue, but its $3 goal is still at the mercy of macro forces. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has recovered slightly, but remains reactive—more speculation than strategy. BlockDAG, however, is showing structured growth: live users, rising presale value, and a clear product roadmap. Its Keynote 3 confirmed that 1.2 million+ users are actively mining BDAG coins using mobile-first tools. With the price already at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and a $20 target by 2027, early participation today could translate into one of the highest ROIs in the current crypto cycle. Among the top crypto coins being tracked right now, BlockDAG is transforming adoption into value. And that could make all the difference for forward-looking traders.

With so many projects launching and evolving, it’s easy to feel lost in the noise. Ondo and Theta have been making headlines with their latest moves, stirring up excitement in the market. Ondo’s token has been gaining traction in the world of tokenized real-world assets, while Theta is shaking things up in decentralized video streaming. But amidst these power players, a new contender is turning heads—Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike the traditional names, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s the first Web3 aggregator uniting multiple blockchains under one roof. But what really makes it stand out is its game-changing decentralized VPN (dVPN), offering a new level of online security and privacy. With its presale already surpassing $15.8 million, early buyers are rushing in before the next price hike. Those looking for the best cryptos to invest in this week might want to pay close attention to what Qubetics is bringing to the table. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: The Best Cryptos to Invest in This Week for Privacy As the internet becomes more centralized, online privacy has become a luxury rather than a right. Most VPN providers claim to keep users safe, but the truth is, they still rely on centralized servers that can be monitored, censored, or even shut down. This is where Qubetics changes the game. Instead of a traditional VPN, it offers a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer VPN service, ensuring that no single entity can control or restrict access to the internet. For individuals, this means absolute privacy. Whether someone is a journalist working in a high-surveillance country or just someone who values online security, Qubetics’ dVPN offers an untraceable browsing experience. Imagine being able to stream restricted content, conduct private transactions, or even communicate securely without fear of data leaks. Unlike standard VPNs that can log and sell user data, Qubetics’ blockchain-based network eliminates this risk entirely. Businesses also benefit massively. Companies handling sensitive customer data, such as fintech firms or healthcare providers, can now secure their operations with a VPN that no third party can manipulate. Even remote workers dealing with confidential files can operate without worrying about data interception. This is more than just privacy—it’s freedom. And with Web3 adoption on the rise, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN isn’t just an upgrade; it’s the future of secure internet access. That’s why it’s currently being seen as one of the best cryptos to invest in this week . Qubetics Presale ROI: Why Early Buyers Are Rushing In What if one decision today could completely change your crypto game this year? That’s exactly the kind of energy Qubetics is bringing right now. Sitting confidently in its 29th presale stage at $0.1573 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already locked in over $15.8 million in funds with 506 million tokens sold and more than 24,300 holders backing it up. This isn’t your average pump-and-dump—it’s structured, growing fast, and pulling serious attention. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to invest in this week, this one’s got all the right stats to make the shortlist. Let’s play out a quick investment scenario. If you throw in $1,000 at the current price, and $TICS hits $1, you’re already looking at a 535.65% ROI. But things really take off if it climbs to $5—that’s a 3,078.26% ROI. Push that further to $10, and you’re looking at 6,256.47% ROI. And if $TICS manages to reach $15 after launch? That’s a mind-blowing 9,434.71% ROI. With ROI like this and a strong presale backing it up, Qubetics isn’t just a maybe—it’s one of the best cryptos to invest in this week before the wave gets too crowded. Ondo: The Tokenized Real-World Asset Boom While Qubetics is redefining online privacy, Ondo is tackling something just as revolutionary—tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). The idea of bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology has been floating around for years, but Ondo is one of the first projects making it truly accessible. Ondo’s biggest breakthrough has been its tokenized U.S. Treasuries, allowing users to gain exposure to stable, low-risk assets on the blockchain. This move has positioned Ondo as a major player in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). With institutional interest growing, Ondo’s partnerships with major financial entities are paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption. Recent developments have shown an increase in Ondo’s on-chain trading volume, indicating rising demand from both retail and institutional participants. The ability to earn yield from real-world assets on a decentralized platform is something traditional banks can’t compete with. If Ondo continues on this trajectory, it could play a significant role in the future of blockchain-based asset management. Theta: The Future of Decentralized Video Streaming Content creation has always been dominated by centralized giants like YouTube and Netflix, but Theta is changing that narrative. As a decentralized video delivery network, Theta allows users to share bandwidth and computing resources, reducing costs for content providers while rewarding participants with its native token.

The Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5 , with some slapped at higher rates, including China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, and Japan at 24%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped over 6% in the last 24 hours and was trading around $77,883. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ) shed over 12% in the same time frame and was trading at $1,575, according to CoinGecko. The total crypto market cap dropped over 8% to $2.5 trillion. Prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 1.4% to $78,500. Meanwhile, Ether regained $1,594. Source: Autism Capital At the same time, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 23 in its latest April 7 update, which is considered extreme fear. In a statement, Charlie Sherry, head of finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the drop is unsurprising because global markets are generally more illiquid on Sundays. “As a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly,” he said. “There’s no mystery behind the trigger: President Trump’s recent tariff talk has rattled macro markets, with global trade relations suddenly looking uncertain.” Some traders, however, predict a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner . BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has also speculated that while the tariffs are rattling markets , they could result in a Bitcoin rally. The US Stock Futures market has also opened down. Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, according to Google Finance. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank by over 8%. Trading resource the Kobeissi Letter said in an April 6 post to X that the drop in US stock market futures puts S&P 500 futures in ”bear market territory,” adding that the US stock market has now erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days. Source: Kobeissi Letter Tom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm MV Global, said it could be the “worst three-day move for US stocks of all time” if “tonight’s futures hold.” Trump Administration doubles down on tariffs Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman speculates that US President Donald Trump could postpone the tariffs to allow countries to make counteroffers or deals. In an April 6 statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump doubled down on the tariffs, saying the US has massive financial deficits with China, the European Union and many others, which the levies will solve. Related: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices “The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,” he said. He also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn't intentionally trying to cause a market sell-off but added that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” At the same time, US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an April 6 interview with ABC's This Week program that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to negotiate fresh trade deals. “They’re doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff,” he said. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response.

The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is down 8%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is down over 8% during mid-morning trading, while Shanghai’s SSE Composite Index is down 7%, and the Taipei’s TAIEX is down 9%. Major tech stocks across the region were some of the hardest hit. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong were down 12% while Tencent was down 9%. In Taipei, TSMC stocks dipped 10% in the first few minutes of trading, triggering the exchange’s price variation limit which halts trading in either direction. TSMC’s correction comes as the White House says that semiconductors from Taiwan are exempt from tariffs, but the future of the CHIPS Act – which bankrolled the construction of semiconductor factories in the U.S. – is in question. TSMC’s major correction on market open is likely foreshadowing of Nvidia’s open in the U.S. Some analysts say NVDA has become more volatile than BTC or ETH. Elsewhere in crypto, Ethereum (ETH) is down 11% on-day, XRP is down 9%, and Solana’s SOL is down 10%. Lending protocols Maker (MKR) and Aave (AAVE) were some of the worst performers on the market, down around 14% each. Liquidation data from CoinGlass shows that in the last 12 hours around $675 million in long positions have been liquidated, compared to $123 million in shorts.

According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin bull cycle may be coming to an end. This assertion is grounded in the concept of Realized Cap, a metric that quantifies the actual capital entering the BTC market through on-chain activity. Insights From Ki Young Ju For context, the Realized Cap metric operates on a straightforward premise: when Bitcoin enters a wallet, it represents a purchase, and when it leaves, it signifies a sale. By calculating the average cost basis for each wallet and multiplying it by the amount of BTC held, Ju derives the total Realized Cap. This metric reflects the total capital that has genuinely entered the BTC ecosystem, contrasting sharply with market capitalization, which is determined by the last traded price on exchanges. Related Reading: Solana Faces Defining Level At $120 – Will History Repeat? A common misconception, according to Ju, is that a small purchase, such as $10 worth of Bitcoin, only increases market capitalization by that same amount. In reality, prices are influenced by the balance of buy and sell orders on the order book. Low sell pressure means that even modest buys can significantly elevate prices and, consequently, market cap. This phenomenon was notably exploited by MicroStrategy (MSTR), which issued convertible bonds to acquire Bitcoin, thereby inflating the paper value of its holdings far beyond the initial capital deployed. Key Price Levels For Bitcoin Currently, Bitcoin appears to be in a challenging position, dropping below the key $80,000 mark. When sell pressure is high, even substantial purchases fail to affect prices, as seen when Bitcoin traded near its all-time high of nearly $100,000. Despite massive trading volumes, the price remained stagnant. Ju points out that if Realized Cap is increasing but market cap is either flat or declining, it signals a bearish trend. This indicates that while capital is entering the market, it is not translating into price appreciation—a hallmark of a bear market. Conversely, if market capitalization is rising while Realized Cap remains stable, it suggests that even minimal new investment is driving prices up, indicative of a bull market. Presently, data suggests that Bitcoin is experiencing the former scenario: capital is flowing in, but prices are not responding positively. Historically, significant market reversals require at least six months to manifest, making a short-term rally seem unlikely. Related Reading: Ethereum Tanks Nearly 50% As Bitcoin Holds Stronger In Q1 Adding to the complexity, market expert Ali Martinez has identified key resistance levels that Bitcoin must overcome to regain upward momentum. Notably, there is a major resistance cluster at $87,000, where the 50-day moving average, 200-day moving average, and a descending trendline from the all-time high converge. For Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory, the expert asserts that BTC must break through critical resistance points at $85,470 and $92,950. Additionally, support at $80,450 remains vital; failure to hold this level could lead to further declines. As of now, the leading cryptocurrency trades at $78,379, recording a 6% decline on Sunday.
