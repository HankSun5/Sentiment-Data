More often than not, these locked tokens were reserved for team members, investors, and other strategic purposes. So what happens when these tokens are unlocked? They flood the market, available to trade for the price of a price. They also don’t just show up in chit chat—many times, they’re planned and announced in advance, with dates set, causing speculation about possible impacts on pricing. Next week, a number of important token unlocks are taking place, will bring millions of dollars’ worth of assets into circulation. Here’s a look at some of the big unlocks happening over the next seven days, and why they might matter to market participants. Upcoming Token Unlocks and Their Potential Impact Next week’s token unlock schedule includes some truly significant events that could make waves in the market. Not a few of the unlocks involve literally millions of dollars’ worth of tokens, and they’re likely to be a big driver of whatever volatility we see next week as traders and investors react to the newfound supply. 1. $ENA Unlock – 5 de abril de 2025 On April 5, 55.3 million USD worth of tokens was unlocked by $ENA. This unlock could create notable market movements, especially given the large amount being released. As with most significant unlocks, it’s likely that some of these tokens will be sold, leading to temporary price dips or shifts in trading volume. The release of such a large amount may also signal to traders that the project is entering a new phase, potentially offering an opportunity to re-evaluate its long-term value. 2. $SAGA Unlock – April 9, 2025 On April 9, tokens worth 35.7 million USD will be unlocked from the SAGA project, which could further impact the landscape of the crypto market. With such a nice amount being set free, traders might adjust their positions appropriately, especially as the crypto market anticipates how the SAGA project will handle the newly freed-up tokens. 3. Unlock $MOVE – Apr 9, 2025 Scheduled for April 9, the $MOVE unlock will see 19 million USD worth of tokens hit the marketplace. The release day is one of those times, however, when the behavior of these tokens might not have much to do with any inherent qualities of the project. This is a concrete economic moment that might be more about the $MOVE token’s drive mechanism than drive mechanism itself. After all, $MOVE is specifically designed to get the market-moving part of the equation done. The actual market movement seems to be more a product of the nature of the tokens being unlocked than of any positive or negative attributes of the project itself. 4. $TNSR Unlocked – April 8, 2025 Another token, $TNSR, is experiencing a substantial token unlock on April 8, with 16.3 million USD worth of tokens set to be released. As with other major unlocks, holders of $TNSR and potential investors will need to assess the immediate aftermath to gauge market sentiment. Given the size and the broader market conditions coinciding with this unlock, we expect it to be bullish day trading fodder. 5. KAS Unlock – April 7, 2025 On April 7, tokens worth 10 million USD will be unlocked from the $KAS vault. This release, while significantly smaller than some of the others, still represents a substantial amount of tokens entering into circulation. Given the $KAS demand situation and the overall market mood, this release could cause some short-term excitement. But because it is smaller, it could mean less in the way of market upswings or downswings. 6. Unlocking $NEON – April 7, 2025. The next token unlock is set for April 7, and this one will involve $NEON. There will be tokens worth 6.4 million USD made available. Again, while this may not be a sizable event (in the amount of tokens made available) for the market, it still bears watching for traders, as we don’t know what will happen—and even smaller unlocks can lead to price fluctuations if there is a large concentration of token-holders doing what token-holders typically do post-unlock (i.e., sell, if they intend to sell). 7. $IO Open – a demand for electric intelligence (March 18, 2025) In our 2024 futurist conference, we made three bold predictions. One of those was $IO Open, where electricity is used to unveil the secrets of intelligent systems. In layman’s terms, it means that $IO Open might just be the brain’s equivalent of plugging into the electric grid and harnessing its full potential. In conclusion, on April 11, $IO will undergo a token unlock, and 2 million worth of dollar tokens will be released. This is one of the smallest unlocks that have happened so far in 2023 concerning the amount that’s being unlocked; however, it could still make some waves. Why go ahead and watch it then? Well, even though it’s a tiny unlock in comparison to some that have happened this year in terms of dollar value, it’s also sending 2 million worth of tokens back into the marketplace and as we all know, those marketplace dynamics are unpredictable.

Certain factors influence how much and in what direction prices shift when tokens are unlocked. Those factors include: – supply and demand – market sentiment – investor behavior – project progress If you know a project you like is about to unlock a lot of tokens, it might be worth it to reconsider your position in that project. Similar to past instances, investors need to be ready for turbulence when big unlocking events occur and the dust starts to settle. It’s going to be all-the-more important to keep a close watch on the actual tokens that are involved and to see if any kind of selling pressure or price momentum is developing at the moment. These unlock events could have big implications for the market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These assets, which are designed to maintain a steady value through pegs to fiat currencies or other assets, have become a vital component of the crypto ecosystem. They offer an alternative to the nearly dollar-for-dollar volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The total stablecoin supply crossed an impressive $220 billion in Q1 2025, marking a new record high for the sector. Among the standout performers, Solana’s stablecoin market cap surged by 146%, positioning it as one of the key players in the stablecoin space. Alongside Solana, other networks like MorphLayer, Cronos, Stacks, and Bob also experienced sharp growth in their stablecoin markets. Notably, Solana’s growth has solidified its place as the fifth-largest network in terms of stablecoin market cap, hitting $12.5 billion. Solana stablecoin supply surged 146% in Q1 In Q1 2025, stablecoin market cap on @MorphLayer , @cronos_chain , @Stacks , and @build_on_bob experienced sharp growth. @solana followed closely, taking fifth place with its stablecoin market cap climbing to $12.5B. @Algorand , @zksync ,… pic.twitter.com/SmKw6FtZnR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 3, 2025 A Surge in Stablecoin Market Cap Across Multiple Platforms The first quarter of 2025 has seen a series of developments for stablecoins, as they have continued to increase their foothold in the crypto market. Most importantly, stablecoin supply reached new all-time highs, with the expansion of stablecoin markets across a variety of blockchain platforms playing a significant role in this growth. In the first quarter, the total supply of stablecoins witnessed a substantial rise and went beyond the $220 billion mark, clearly indicating the burgeoning demand for low-volatility, stable assets within the crypto space. Despite some prevailing market uncertainty, this was a clear indication that stablecoins are now an integral part of the portfolio of traders, institutional investors, and decentralized finance (DeFi) participants looking to minimize the effects of market volatility and efficiently move capital across different blockchain networks. Performance this quarter—Tether ($USDT). Dominant stablecoin. Market cap now over $140 billion, nearly double what it was in early 2022. In the stablecoin market, this is a solid lead. Remains a top choice for liquidity in the global crypto markets. One bright spot for crypto in Q1 was the growth of stablecoins, which hit new record highs. – Total #stablecoin supply crossed $220B, the highest ever – Tether ( $USDT ) leads with over $140B in market cap, nearly doubling since early 2022 – $USDC gained share, rising from 20%… pic.twitter.com/kYOxv7NhJq — Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) April 4, 2025 Concurrently, USD Coin ($USDC) has been garnering market share, now comprising 27% of the total stablecoin market—up from 20% a year ago. This coincides not just with Circle’s plans for an IPO but also with what seems destined to be a playout of that public offering. As one of the most popular stablecoins, USDC’s movement upward seems to be in concert with a broader trend of even more institutional interest in stable assets. Solana’s Explosive Growth in Stablecoins One of the increasingly energetic networks around stablecoins is Solana. From the beginning of 2025, it has expanded at a dizzying pace, securing an incredible 146 percent increase in its stablecoin supply when measured against its figures for the end of 2024. This puts the Solana in stablecoin territory that few other Layer 1 blockchains can touch. The technology of Solana, known for its rapidity and low transaction costs, has made it a viable option for developers and users wanting to use stablecoins on a scalable and efficient platform. Solana is an increasingly important player. It has a growing supply of stablecoins. More and more projects are choosing to launch stablecoins on its fast and affordable infrastructure. The stablecoin growth on Solana is also part of the much larger trend of DeFi projects trying to use stablecoins as their main medium for doing things like transacting, lending, and providing liquidity. Because of the Solana blockchain’s overall efficiency at handling high transaction volumes, it is now the ideal place for using stablecoins, which is why Solana’s ecosystem has been growing so much lately. Other Networks See Significant Stablecoin Growth The stablecoin boom in Q1 2025 was not just a boon for Solana. Other blockchain platforms also experienced substantial growth in their stablecoin markets. Networks such as Algorand, zkSync, and Hedera have seen demand for stable digital assets almost double, pointing to the idea that stablecoins are becoming a key part of the blockchain ecosystem that stretches beyond the confines of any one chain. This growth across multiple platforms suggests that stablecoins are gaining traction as a digital asset that can be used in a wide variety of applications across the blockchain space. The stablecoin activity has surged, which is also a direct consequence of the broader trends within the blockchain ecosystem. The stablecoins are demanded more now, as the developers and the businesses are looking to build on the blockchain networks that can offer them efficiency, can offer them low fees, and that can offer them scalability. The use of the stablecoins in these ecosystems is again highlighting a shift in the focus of the crypto world toward more stable assets. Conclusion: The Future of Stablecoins and Their Growing Importance We see Q1 2025 as a watershed moment for stablecoins. Their adoption is not just growing; it is burgeoning. Not just the construction of them but the actual real-world usage of stablecoins is becoming a commonplace thing in our society. Yet Solana, Tether, and USD Coin (USDC)—the three tokens we label as “the stablecoin trifecta”—are equally important for their real-world, global potential. While the relentless march of blockchain technology proceeds apace, it is indeed stablecoins that have become the most stable component of the crypto economy. By and large, the typical American trader has little interaction with seamless cross-border transactions. Even so, if you traded crypto with any regularity, the transactions would across a digital wall separating two different currencies—by and large, the transactions would use a stablecoin. Currently, Solana is the most reliable stablecoin network, with 99.98% uptime on reasonable assumptions about what a healthy price looks like. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007323,https://nulltx.com/?p=147775,1743978939,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval for Solana ETF: A Bold Move to Expand Crypto Access,https://nulltx.com/grayscale-seeks-sec-approval-for-solana-etf-a-bold-move-to-expand-crypto-access/,"Grayscale , one of the major firms in the digital asset management sphere, is making news in the crypto space once again, and it’s doing so with a very bold move. The venture has recently put in the paperwork to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to move its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on NYSE Arca. This filing coincides with Grayscale’s push to expand access to cryptocurrencies for traditional investors and might be a significant step toward pushing digital assets deeper into the mainstream. Grayscale’s move to seek an ETF for Solana comes on the heels of the successful launches of its Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Both have been well received by investors seeking crypto-market exposure through more traditional investment vehicles. With the cryptocurrency space continuing to push into the mainstream, the Solana ETF proposal embodies the ambition—held in by the crypto asset manager—to expand the range of regulated crypto offerings that are accessible to both institutional and retail investors. A Strategic Move Toward Broader Access to Solana The proposed Solana ETF would give investors the change to chance to gain exposure to Solana (SOL), one of the most high-profile cryptocurrencies in recent years. While the project has faced some headwinds, and some associated volatility, its strong performance and growing ecosystem seem now to cement it as one of the top contenders in the blockchain space. Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval For Solana ETF Grayscale has filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an ETF on NYSE Arca, continuing its efforts to expand crypto access for traditional investors. The proposed ETF, like previous Bitcoin and Ethereum products, excludes staking… pic.twitter.com/1gYfMs9JeO — The O Show (Wendyo.eth) (@The_O_Show_) April 4, 2025 Nevertheless, Solana is now a project in decline, with SOL trading near a 13-month low. Analysts, however, are still quite high on its long-term prospects, viewing it as one of the strong candidates for its scalability associated features and nigh use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be a front-runner in the blockchain space. The choice to pursue SEC approval is less than straightforward, coming as it does amid the cryptocurrency market’s sharp downturn and the SEC’s increasingly critical posture toward crypto firms and products. A Solana ETF might offer the types of normalized, federally regulated access that institutional investors have until now largely avoided. You can see the types of silly, straightforward advantages that an ETF would bestow on Solana as a potential leading digital asset: legitimacy; the type of well-understood federal regulatory framework that quite a few large investors have been waiting around for; and, oh, just generally putting Solana a lot closer to the top of the asset class ranking that is so damned important for any potential investor. Excluding Staking to Align with SEC Preferences In its filing, Grayscale has designed the proposed Solana ETF to exclude staking, aligning with the SEC’s past preferences regarding cryptocurrency ETFs. Still, staking is a practice that has not been entirely resolved in regard to the SEC’s vision of investor protection. Following previous preferences, Grayscale is trying to avoid putting a product in front of the SEC that would necessitate the agency reviewing how rewards are being distributed and what might happen if an investor loses funds staked in a supposedly secure network. Historically, the SEC has shown reluctance to approve products that include staking. Grayscale seeks to make the proposed Solana ETF align with the SEC’s guidelines in order to facilitate its approval. The company’s previous dating back to 2013 suggests a strong likelihood of approval if its current ETF proposals are synced with SEC investor protection regulations and the specific criteria the Commission has set for Bitcoin futures ETFs and Ether futures ETFs (that is, these entities must not stake). Grayscale ETF proposals are currently in sync with these signals. Why Solana Is a Strong Candidate for an ETF As one of the blockchain platform solutions showing the most promise, Solana represents the concept of high speed in terms of transaction throughput, low fees that make it accessible, and scalability that ensures it covers a broad base. In the traction department, it has already attracted a number of developers and projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment, looking for an alternative to Ethereum, which they seem to think is slower, costlier, and less accessible than Solana. In terms of enthusiasts and institutional support, Solana seems to have lots of both. One of the reasons analysts consider Solana a strong ETF candidate is the recent acknowledgment by the SEC of comparable filings. The ETF approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum have set a distinct precedent. With Solana’s solid standing in regulated markets now, offering a futures-based ETF makes a lot of sense in Grayscale’s overall strategy of providing varied, diversified investment options in the crypto space. Another thing bolstering Solana’s case for the ETF: its futures market is now increasingly viewed as one that’s regulated. A Solana ETF would raise access to Solana for traditional investors and could serve as an exemplar for other blockchain-based assets. If this ETF were to gain approval, it would be a huge moment for the crypto industry in terms of institutional adoption, providing a direct access point to a safe, regulated digital asset for investors. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Grayscale’s Solana ETF Proposal? While Grayscale’s push for an ETF based on the cryptocurrency Solana is new, the Solana ETF application is only the latest in a line of similar attempts by Grayscale to win approval from the SEC for offerings that use various cryptocurrencies as the underlying assets. If the SEC allows Grayscale to proceed with the Solana ETF the way it has allowed Grayscale to proceed with Solana in the past, that is, to purchase Solana, then those approvals would represent significant transitions of Solana and other cryptocurrencies from uses primarily in the largely unregulated sphere of digital assets to uses in the SEC-governed financial system. At this point, we see the proposed Solana ETF as another step toward a more accessible world of crypto. We see it as a vehicle, with Grayscale at the wheel, that takes us down the road of regulated investment opportunities in the digital asset space. Now, if you are Solana—or, for that matter, any blockchain project—you want what we just outlined to be your basic operating narrative. You want institutional interest in what you are doing, and you want that interest to be growing and leading in the direction of something that could be your next inevitable investment-grade vehicle: the Solana ETF. This proposal places Grayscale once again at the forefront of cryptocurrency investment. In the eyes of many, it signaled that crypto was truly becoming integrated into traditional financial markets, one step at a time. Even if a Bitcoin ETF never came to be, Grayscale was still the name to know and to trust. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007377,https://nulltx.com/?p=147776,1743979124,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,PumpFun Reopens Livestream Feature: A Strategic Move Amid Market Adjustment,https://nulltx.com/pumpfun-reopens-livestream-feature-a-strategic-move-amid-market-adjustment/,"More than five months after being suspended, the popular decentralized platform PumpFun has decided to reopen its Livestream feature. Following a period of intense scrutiny, community backlash, and several scandals, the platform had put the livestreaming tool on hold. Critics had charged that PumpFun was using the service to generate revenue for itself while allowing streamers to create dangerously “toxic” content. Those same critics, after all, had forced the tool to shut down in the first place. But now, with better governance and some community-controlled reins, PumpFun is ready to cautiously reintroduce its “sLiverstream” feature. Although this move has raised a few eyebrows, particularly in light of PumpFun’s recent difficulties, some market watchers believe that this is a movement being made in the opposite direction from the platform’s profile sagging. They point to the fact that the Livestream function was once “key” in attracting users and generating word-of-mouth about it. Now, under stricter management and with clearer content guidelines, it seems as if PumpFun is tentatively revisiting that idea of it drawing in an audience again for, hopefully, the same effect. The Return of Livestreaming with New Restrictions The Livestream function on PumpFun was turned off nearly half a year back because it was being harmed by a community exploiting it to deliver baseless, scandalous, and otherwise-unfriendly-to-the-public material. Reporters have since streamed content to PumpFun to deliver the sorts of heartwarming and good-for-the-public stories that K-pop fandoms usually deliver. At present, PumpFun has brought back the Livestream function; however, it has made some substantial changes to that reintroduction to ensure that the platform maintains its integrity going forward. One of the most striking alterations is the number of people who are allowed to watch each stream. The company has capped it now at 5% of the entire user base, ensuring that only a small, controlled audience gets to peek behind the curtain of the platform itself. This seems to be a clear move to limit the potential for harmful content while still allowing the Livestream feature to exist as a tool for user engagement. Along with the cap on viewers, the terms of management have been made stricter, with an intent to control user activities more tightly during livestreams. The reason for this is, of course, to keep the kind of content that might make the platform look bad from being seen (a.k.a. “toxic content”). But in my opinion, even these new measures won’t be enough to ensure that the platform is a good place for all users to spend time—in part, because they still leave open the question of what kind of content is justifiable. #Pumpfun bắt đầu mở lại tính năng Livestream – hành động dự phóng kéo thị trường trong tương lai? Với việc đóng cửa sau hơn 5 tháng với những bê bối chồng chất khi bị cộng đồng lợi dụng làm những content độc hại thì hiện tại, @pumpdotfun đã có động… pic.twitter.com/8Htc0OOXNx — alphawolf (@alphawolfl2) April 5, 2025 Is This a Strategic Attempt to Revitalize the Platform? This move is critical in terms of timing because PumpFun is facing a steep slide in trading volume and overall platform engagement. Bringing back the feature of livestreaming might just reverse that decline, though it could be many moons before we know anything for sure. In an increasingly interactive landscape, where livestreaming is becoming de rigeur, such a feature could act as an engagement funnelcoming ytub back and reinvigorating both trading and platform engagement as the weekend approaches. Re-launching in a market downturn suggests that the platform is using this time to play around and refine what it has to offer. With the market currently in a deep adjustment phase, the company has more room to try out the new Livestream function and fine-tune that operation without the same level of market demand it would face in a booming period. This tactic gives the platform more space to gather feedback and make the kinds of adjustments to the Livestream feature it will need to make before expanding it further or developing new functionalities tied to it in the future. Furthermore, it appears that the platform’s management is betting on community governance as a way to achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility. By exerting more influence over the content on the platform, PumpFun anticipates that the community will help it avoid the previous mistakes that led to toxic content being allowed to exist and thrive unfiltered. The community is not yet fully certain about the efficacy of the upcoming content-control rules, but it seems to be cautiously optimistic about the platform moving more in the direction of content governance. Community Concerns and Future Prospects Even with the alterations, PumpFun’s community is still split about whether reinstating the Livestream feature will be a hit or miss. These uncertain boundaries about what is and what isn’t “appropriate” content have some users wondering about the platform’s future. If the above concerns aren’t answered with content guidelines that are clear and transparent, the platform runs the risk of facing another user backlash, which could drive away even more users than it has already. PumpFun seems to be taking the requisite steps to ensure that previous problems do not arise again, and this makes us feel somewhat better about recommencing our use of the platform. The way in which it is reintroducing the livestreaming feature, with both a substantially limited viewer base and a dramatically enhanced layer of oversight, makes us think that the company is now much more serious about livestreaming as a core component of its service and is much more serious about the community concerns that pushed it to suspend the feature in the first place. The relaunch of livestreaming could act as a bridge to the more sophisticated features that are being planned and that are associated with real-time interaction and content. As the crypto space keeps growing, platforms like PumpFun are looking for new means to mix social with financial components. Livestreaming, they are betting, will be the first step toward the much more interactive platform that the space cries out for. Conclusion: A Bold Move for PumpFun’s Future The evolution of the platform takes another step forward with the relaunch of the Livestream feature at PumpFun, despite the Elementum controversy and a past riddled with revealed challenges. This test will tell us if the platform is ready to tackle the issue of fostering “safe, useful, and fun content” and maintaining a “safe and engaging environment” for its users. PumpFun does itself a service by using the current market uncertainty as an opportunity to refine its approach. If this relaunch turns out to be successful, it could lead to whatever it is that might come next (and if it leads to whatever’s next in the ecosystem, I’ll cover that issue next week). If this is handled well and if these new aspects are well integrated into the platform, this could quite literally represent the next frontier for both PumpFun and elemental content creation.

43007638,https://nulltx.com/?p=147777,1743979601,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Venture Capital in Crypto: A Shift Toward Real-World Integration in Q1 2025,https://nulltx.com/venture-capital-in-crypto-a-shift-toward-real-world-integration-in-q1-2025/,"The venture capital (VC) landscape in the crypto space had a notable shift in Q1 2025, following a strong showing on the market in the latter half of 2024. In particular, the performance of Bitcoin ($BTC) in Q3 and Q4 last year was a catalyst for increased funding in crypto startups in the first quarter of this year. But pricing and VC investment do not move in lockstep. Funding activity has a way of tailing the price trend by one or two quarters, and the soft pricing of recent weeks, if it is indeed the start of a downtrend, might mean less funding in the next few months. Even with this possible deceleration, emerging segments of the crypto ecosystem continue to attract investors. Most interesting are the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and real-world assets (RWA). Both crypto native and traditional venture capital firms have showcased these three critical areas. Overall, this reflects strong investor interest. Projects in the crypto space are looking increasingly towards the real world, the development of infrastructure, and user appeal that extends beyond the crypto native community. State of Venture Capital in Crypto, Q1 2025 Explore the latest state of the crypto venture capital market and learn why 2025 will be a game-changing year for crypto https://t.co/uU0jyjk2GH — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 4, 2025 Strong Investor Appetite for Real-World Integration and Infrastructure In Q1 2025, significant venture funding moved towards a different type of project than had attracted it just a quarter earlier. Instead of focusing on speculative projects or the next big coin, many investors turned their attention to sectors with “real-world, tangible applications.” This included not just a diversification into various (physical) sectors of the economy, but a pronounced pivot towards the layering of crypto and blockchain technology with AI, a space where we saw a ton of project funding happening in 2024. (Given that AI technologies are also funded heavily with VC dollar, this layering effect is a pretty clear signal of where investors see the future economy going.) The whole DePIN discussion reflects not just a diversification of the type of project communities are building, but also signals the next “big area” that the crypto blockchain technology development community is now trying to tackle. Venture capital poured into Real-World Assets (RWA), as these projects sought to bring physical assets into the crypto fold. RWA seemed to promise a bridge between the traditional world of finance and a new digital era — an entrance into which institutional investors might more easily walk because they found some comfort in RWAs’ use of blockchain to address ‘real problems’ in the ‘real world.’ If all that was true, and VC investors seemed to think it was, then RWA could really change the game for crypto. Increasing investor interest in new sectors means that more and more investment dollars are flowing into these areas. And this is a very good sign for the sectors themselves. Why? Because it suggests that the investment community is very much looking at these sectors as not only having the potential to offer high rates of return over the long run but also as being places where there’s sustainable, real, and long-term value. Infrastructure; use cases; something that just about everyone involved in the crypto world now talks about: real-world relevance. These are the prime growth factors that make these new sectors that much more investable. A Surge in Token Launches and Future Market Dynamics A significant event in Q1 2025 was the arrival of large, VC-backed tokens in the crypto markets. These token launches brought with them nearly $20 billion in value not yet available to investors. They launched, in lost value, a not-so-happy $20 billion wave of change for the crypto space—if, indeed, such under-the-surface value waves can be counted as happy (or, for that matter, as waves at all). A broad examination of the space yields two conclusions concerning the impact on market dynamics: 1) The wave of not-so-happy $20 billion changes has two major effects that traders might actually care about. 2) These effects, as far as I can tell, are either going to be good for traders or good for the markets, in the long run. The influx of new tokens may induce short-term volatility, but it also demonstrates the crypto market’s advancing maturity. When large-cap tokens enter the market, it’s a sign of increasing institutional interest and further diversification of the crypto asset space that now extends well beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The crypto asset market is now well over $1 trillion. “New market segments are emerging, and they are doing so with innovative solutions and unique value propositions that they are bringing to users,” says Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael. Yet, the timing of these token launches with the softness of the market right now has to make you wonder about the potential long-term impacts on venture capital. The reason I say this is because as more tokens enter the market and start unlocking value, the price of these tokens is so uncertain right now that the potential for big price fluctuations seems pretty high. And when the current crop of tokens starts to unfold its attribution of value, how will that fare in the context of price stability? Outlook for Crypto Venture Capital: A Cautious but Optimistic Future When considering the future, one may expect that venture capital investment in the crypto space will likely face a period of caution, at least in the short term. In a recent downturn, not only have crypto prices fallen but the number of new tokens flooding the market has also increased. Could these developments lead to a pullback in VC investment in the crypto space? While venture capitalists appear to be taking a more cautious approach to their crypto investments for now, assessing market stability and adjusting their strategies accordingly, the underlying trends in the crypto market seem healthy. Projects that provide concrete value and bolster infrastructure are the ones that investors will likely continue to dump money into, but don’t mistake the lack of funding for projects that are still in the experimental stage as a death knell for innovation. While value and real-world infrastructure enable blockchain’s buildout alongside other transformative technologies, there’s fertile ground for innovative ideas to push the crypto space forward. To sum up, even though the softness of the current crypto market may have short-term implications for venture capital flowing into this space, it is not because investors have lost faith in the long-term prospects for blockchain technology and its integration into the real world. Quite the opposite: We are witnessing a few disruptive years in the tech market, and crypto still seems to be a key player in that dance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007691,https://nulltx.com/?p=147778,1743979762,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Crypto Whale 0x373 Shifts from Meme Coin Hype to DeFi Potential with Major PENDLE Investment,https://nulltx.com/crypto-whale-0x373-shifts-from-meme-coin-hype-to-defi-potential-with-major-pendle-investment/,"One of the crypto world’s most influential whales, identified as 0x373, has shifted strategy. This whale , which has been under scrutiny for its huge holdings and trading activity, now appears to be withdrawing from the wild meme-coin market and parking its assets in the far-more-stable DeFi space. Recent trades indicate that 0x373 has stopped riding the meme coin hype wave and is now making a serious bet on DeFi assets, with purchases of $PENDLE. In an intriguing move, the whale unloaded a significant portion of its $PEPE holdings, which had been a staple in its portfolio. Specifically, the whale dumped 196.1 billion PEPE tokens, amounting to $1.3 million; it swapped these for 720.6 WETH (Wrapped Ether). This swap, priced at an average of $0.000006641 per PEPE, is the latest in a series of moves that show the whale growing more and more confident in the future potential of DeFi projects. A Shift Toward PENDLE: The Whale’s Bold Move Instead of keeping its freshly obtained ETH, the whale made yet another audacious move—using a hefty chunk of its WETH reserves to snap up 397,192 $PENDLE tokens. At $3.08 a pop, this buy totaled nearly $1.22 million. This shows the whale’s hand; it’s betting on the future of PENDLE, which as a decentralized finance token seems to be carving out an interesting niche. The token, it should be said, has been getting attention lately for its purported asset tokenization and yield optimization solutions. For three consecutive days, 0x373 has made significant trades that suggest he is becoming more and more convinced about PENDLE’s potential. The whale first traded PEPE, selling 261.2 billion of the assets for 1,060 WETH, which was worth approximately $1.94 million. Then, in a move that appears to directly counteract his first trade, the whale purchased 607,863 PENDLE tokens using 1,016 WETH. That amount was worth roughly $1.86 million, and he bought the tokens at an average price of $3.066 each. Even after these large trades, the whale’s investment in meme coins remains large. It holds a staggering 2.597 trillion PEPE tokens, worth about $18.05 million. On that investment, it’s made a profit of roughly $28.41 million, for a total return of around 5.25 times what it originally put into PEPE. A major crypto whale, 0x373, seems to be making a bold shift in strategy—trading meme coin hype for DeFi potential. Over the past 13 hours, the whale sold 196.1B $PEPE ($1.3M) and swapped it for 720.6 WETH, averaging $0.000006641 per PEPE. But it didn’t stop there. pic.twitter.com/iYoAuJahLg — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 4, 2025 So, why did this whale recently swap some PEPE for PENDLE? One potential reason is that it reflects a shift in what sorts of assets the whale is holding. Compared to PEPE and other meme coins, PENDLE is a much more serious investment. The Bigger Picture: A Changing Crypto Landscape Whale’s movement from meme coins to DeFi reflects broader crypto market shifts. Despite meme coins like $PEPE captivating the public and giving people a feel for the potential scale of growth in the crypto market, we at Decrypt have begun to see some signs, or signals, that investors are questioning the future sustainability of these kinds of coins. Their value almost seems to sink or swim with the current price of ether. Conversely, decentralized finance schemes such as $PENDLE are gaining momentum for their real-world applications and their possible long-term value creation. PENDLE, which aims to focus on the tokenization of yield-bearing assets, has caught the attention of investors hunting for innovative ways to unlock liquidity and optimize returns in DeFi. This is a space where you must truly look beneath the surface, as much of what is going on in DeFi outside of PENDLE may appear pond scummy. And yet, the pivot toward DeFi in this crypto winter is also a pivot toward looking for value beyond the narrative we were fed in 2021. Whale 0x373 moving to PENDLE could be a sign of something very different from what we’ve seen before in this address. For 0x373, the apparent move from CRV to PENDLE could be an effort to maximize yield and liquidity and a step toward future-proofing these assets. DeFi has become a key pillar of the crypto ecosystem, and projects like PENDLE are positioned well within this space. If the address is holding these assets for the long term, it could signal something very different in terms of strategy for this whale. Looking Ahead: More PEPE-to-PENDLE Swaps? Considering the recent maneuvers by the whale—and its ongoing shift in strategy—it seems pretty likely we’ll be seeing more PEPE-to-PENDLE swaps in the days ahead. The huge amount of $PEPE still held by the whale—along with some pretty decent profits on that asset—suggests that the whale is still using PEPE as a key part of its overall portfolio, rebalancing into PENDLE and other DeFi plays as part of a larger emerging strategy. For the broader crypto community, the recent actions of 0x373 serve as a reminder that the biggest and most influential players in crypto are always adjusting their strategies to meet the market. While many investors find allure in meme coins, the move towards DeFi reflects a broader trend within crypto towards assets that have much more long-term utility and growth potential. As DeFi projects like PENDLE continue to mature, the space could see much more interest from large investors looking for innovative ways to use crypto in the real world. In summary, 0x373’s shift in strategy from meme coins to DeFi assets like PENDLE demonstrates the crypto market’s shifting nature. As the industry has grown up, investors who put their money where their mouth is have started focusing more on the types of projects that have actual long-term potential and real-world applications. Those of us who are trading and investing in DeFi may be trailblazing the next big movement within the crypto ecosystem. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

43007848,https://nulltx.com/?p=147779,1743980043,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Regains Lead as DEX Volume Leader in March, Surpassing Solana",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-regains-lead-as-dex-volume-leader-in-march-surpassing-solana/,"In a remarkable turnaround, Ethereum has taken back its place as the dominant blockchain in trading volume for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). After Solana had spent several months in first place, Ethereum has now reclaimed the top position it last held in September 2024. Ethereum was not only resilient during the past few months, but it also surged dramatically in trading activity this March 2025—reaching trading volume levels it had not seen in approximately six months. That surge, on top of its already solid position in trading on DEXs, now makes Ethereum the leading blockchain for DeFi traders. Ethereum’s Strong Comeback: Dominating the DEX Market The most recent data shows that total DEX volume in March reached an impressive $245.8 billion. Ethereum accounted for 26.3% of this total, putting it ahead of Solana and atop the leaderboard among blockchains. Solana, which had seen a surge in DEX trading activity thanks to its high-speed, low-cost transactions, held 21.4% of the total market share in March, marking a noticeable decline in its fortunes as Ethereum surged on the volume front. This shift is the latest indication that confidence is returning to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, which continues to attract both retail and institutional traders despite competition from other blockchains. Ethereum returns as DEX volume leader in March @ethereum reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for DEX trading volume, surpassing @solana for the first time since September. The total DEX volume in March amounted to $245.8 billion, with @ethereum capturing 26.3% and… pic.twitter.com/bnxFEyZ88x — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 3, 2025 Several factors have brought Ethereum back to life. First, it is underpinned by continued active development that has, among other things, made Ethereum more scalable. Second, it has maintained a dominant position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It is where you go if you want to do anything on a dApp or a protocol in the DeFi space. It’s foundation seems to be unshakeable. In recent months, Ethereum has also profited from the blossoming popularity of layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum. These protocols, which operate on top of Ethereum, offer users faster and cheaper transactions while keeping the security promises that Ethereum itself makes. That assurance is crucial since layer-2s will inevitably process plenty of transactions for protocols that could be described as dubious. Still, they are using Ethereum’s base layer for assurance, and they had better not have a security incident. Solana’s Decline: What Does it Mean for the Future? Ethereum may still have the upper hand in terms of total value locked, but it and its layer-2 solutions still have plenty of room for improvement if they want to stay ahead of blockchain monoliths like Solana. While Solana is now back on an upswing, its trading volume in the DeFi space has dipped recently. This has happened in tandem with a spike in DEX trading on layer-2 solutions like Optimism, as well as on Ethereum itself. This decline could have several causes. One possible reason is the continued upheaval in the cryptocurrency market, which has prompted some investors to move their assets into more stable, established ecosystems like Ethereum. Solana had a tough 2023, marked by serious network outages and some security problems, which makes you wonder if those couldn’t have also contributed to a user confidence hit that Solana might have suffered as a result. Solana is picking itself back up in 2023, however. Its technological fortress is tighter and more robust than ever. Its user base should continue to grow, driven by an economic model that looks increasingly sound and equitable. Possibly on the rise is the increasing adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions. As Ethereum scales and becomes a solution more accessible to a wider audience, its traders and developers may find the speed advantage of Solana’s transactions not such an impressive selling point anymore. Part of the reason for this is that the downturn in DeFi seems to have had little impact on Ethereum, whose robust developer community and ecosystem give it a unique DeFi advantage. Ethereum’s Competitive Edge: What’s Next for DEX Volume? The regained command of Ethereum’s for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume clearly indicates that the decentralized finance (DeFi) market is maturing. Helmed by Ethereum, the DeFi market continues to confidently sail forward. The set of protocols and overall ecosystem have cemented Ethereum’s lead in this newly emerging asset class. Presently, these DeFi assets and the protocols underpinning them exist almost entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Even with the avalanche of alternatives that have surfaced over the past 15 months, the Ethereum network remains the primary venue for DeFi. The Development of Decentralized Assets The alternative decentralized finance (DeFi) asset class is in the midst of development. The development of decentralized applications (dApps) sits on top of smart contracts, the veiled promises of which are now being fulfilled. With a firm foundation in Ethereum smart contracts, the Elrond (EGLD) blockchain ecosystem and its native decentralized finance assets (in the form of financial contracts) signal the maturation of both the dApp and decentralized asset classes. Merging Ethereum with layer-2 solutions and other scalability improvements makes it even more appealing. With these updates, the Ethereum network can take on a lot more users without its transaction speeds or costs being affected. This improved scalability, along with the shift to proof of stake, means that, in the long run, Ethereum seems more likely to maintain its DeFi dominant position than it does to fall behind newer blockchains like Solana, which also seem to have robustDeFi ecosystems. Moreover, Ethereum has a robust developer community that lets it be a persistent best-in-class solution in the NFT space. This nearly unrivaled presence in another crypto sector serves to strengthen Ethereum’s network effects. These network effects extend well beyond just DEXs to a huge variety of crypto applications, including NFTs, gaming, and much more. This unparalleled wide-ranging appeal among developers and users permits Ethereum to maintain its leading position as the best blockchain for DeFi and other “crypto cases.” Conclusion: Ethereum’s Path Forward in a Competitive Market Ethereum’s dominance in the DEX space hasn’t just returned; it has renewed itself with strength and resiliency in the face of increasing competition from other blockchains like Solana. The return to dominance was marked by an almost unparalleled foundation in decentralized finance, something that has Ethereum scaling over the horizon as it maintains a leadership position in the DeFi ecosystem. Even while Solana and other blockchain platforms keep innovating and successfully drawing in users, the Ethereum blockchain’s extensive ecosystem, network effects, and burgeoning solutions in scalability give it the competitive edge needed to stay on top. As the Ethereum blockchain continues its evolution, the solidity of its position as the leading decentralized exchange trading platform seems more probable than not, and it appears to be the most likely choice for DeFi traders and developers for the next several years.

Meanwhile, Circle has initiated its second attempt at an IPO as the USDC issuer filed its prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The stablecoin issuer aims for a $5 billion valuation as it navigates a volatile market fraught with regulatory challenges. Meanwhile, Shibarium hit 1 billion transactions within two years of launch, and the Trump family is continuing to expand its footprint in the crypto ecosystem. Let’s recap some of the biggest stories from the week. Bitcoin Bitcoin proxies Strategy, Metaplanet, and Boyaa could be ready to break out and head significantly higher. Strategy recently made a $1.92 billion BTC purchase, giving it an assailable lead over other Bitcoin-oriented companies. Meanwhile, Boyaa has quietly established itself as the biggest holder of BTC in Asia and Metaplanet has received a lease of life after following in Strategy’s footsteps. DeFi The Graphite Network launched its Market Staking Program on March 31, 2025. The program is an innovative model that rewards active traders rather than passive holders, reflecting a significant change ongoing in the DeFi space where active staking has overtaken passive staking as the preferred approach for traders. Following “Smart Money” could be one of the biggest ways newbie crypto traders and investors can avoid the pitfalls that come with participating in a highly volatile market. The Smart Money Concept is based on the idea that some well-informed investors make more strategic decisions. Technology This week, the Shibarium blockchain completed a billion transactions. The Layer2 blockchain for the Shiba Inu ecosystem reached the milestone just 18 years after launch, highlighting its growing adoption and robust performance. It also highlights the SHIB ecosystem’s utility and supports the token’s burn mechanism, driving the token’s long-term value.

The crash followed a violent sell-off in U.S. equities tied directly to President Donald Trump’s new global tariffs, which kicked in just days ago. Investors are now watching a pileup of pain unfold in both crypto and traditional markets at the same time, as volatility takes over and financial systems crack under pressure. Bitcoin fell below the $78,000 mark on Sunday night, losing nearly 5% of its value in 24 hours and landing at $77,673, according to data from CoinGecko. The OG crypto had held above $80,000 almost all year—besides a few quick dips—but the new drop slams it 39% below its January all-time high. Liquidations wreck crypto after overnight collapse The fall in Bitcoin wasn’t isolated. Ethereum has dropped below $1,600 and Solana has plunged by 12% overnight, while XRP dropped by 8.6%, triggering panic across exchanges. The crash wiped out leveraged long positions and kicked off forced sell-offs. In just 24 hours, Bitcoin alone saw over $181 million in long liquidations, with CoinGlass data showing that Ether also got hit with $188 million in forced closures. Traders who were betting on upward moves got wiped when prices turned the other direction fast. While crypto burned, the pressure on U.S. stock futures increased too. On Sunday evening, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,531 points, a 4% decline, ahead of what looks like another brutal Monday session. S&P 500 futures were also down 4%, and the Nasdaq-100 mirrored the drop with its own 4% loss. All of this follows two days of absolute chaos on Wall Street as the White House confirmed the tariffs would stay in place, no matter the fallout. Stock heat map. Source: TradingView The collapse at the end of last week wasn’t a blip—it was historic. The Dow Jones saw back-to-back losses of over 1,500 points for the first time in U.S. history, including a 2,231-point plunge on Friday. The S&P 500 had its worst day since the COVID meltdown in March 2020, falling 6% in a single day. It lost 10% over two days, which dragged it more than 17% below its February peak and close to full bear market territory. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite did enter a bear market on Friday, dropping 22% from its high after losing nearly 6% on both Thursday and Friday. Investors hoping for good news over the weekend got none. There were no signs of a pullback or delay on the tariff rules, which are scheduled to take full effect by April 9. Instead, the administration doubled down on the aggressive trade policy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that position in an interview with CBS News on Sunday, saying, “The tariffs are coming… They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks.” He offered no flexibility and made no promise of relief, even after the historic collapse in financial markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on NBC News, where he revealed that more than 50 countries had already approached the U.S. government to discuss the new trade measures. But Bessent wasn’t optimistic. He warned, “They’ve been bad actors for a long time, and it’s not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” In other words, negotiations are happening, but nothing’s changing anytime soon. Right now, the markets are reacting exactly how you’d expect—like a building collapsing in slow motion. Every trader who was holding high hopes for a quick rebound just got hit with the reality that Washington isn’t backing down. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

How’d he get there?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/blackrocks-larry-fink-in-trumps-inner-circle/,"Larry Fink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock, is now locked in with Donald Trump, sitting inside the president’s tight inner circle after years of tension with the Republican party. On March 17, Larry met with Trump at the White House after delivering a massive win for the administration—BlackRock’s new deal to buy ports on both ends of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong company. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Trump brought in Elon Musk , Vice President JD Vance, and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz for the closed-door discussion that ran over an hour. The topics included the U.S. economy, financial markets, and the port deal that has already triggered backlash from Beijing. The canal deal is about power. China says the transaction would restrict trade and turn the Panama Canal into a U.S. political weapon. Trump sees it as a move to weaken Chinese control over global infrastructure. He’s told people he now wants Larry at Mar-a-Lago this month, hosting him alongside top investors. The White House put out a statement through Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, saying, “The President always appreciates efforts from American companies to advance our nation’s national security interests.” President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Laurence “Larry” Fink at the White House. Credits: Getty Images Larry got here by playing every side, every time Larry didn’t start in Trump’s corner. He backed Barack Obama in 2012. He donated to Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, he went to a fundraiser for Joe Biden, and his top lieutenants joined Biden’s White House. But that never stopped him from also throwing money at Republicans. During Trump’s first term, Larry advised the administration while BlackRock handled some of Trump’s personal investments. The relationship goes back to the early 2000s. “Larry has a rare combination of commercial, political and public-policy savvy,” said Hank Paulson, who was Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush. Still, that didn’t protect him when the GOP came for him. Around 2017, Larry started pushing ESG investing—environmental, social, and corporate governance. It was the same time the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements were entering boardrooms. Larry told CEOs in a 2020 letter that “climate risk is investment risk” and warned BlackRock might vote against companies that didn’t improve their climate disclosures. That pissed off Republicans. Lawsuits followed. Red states dragged BlackRock into court, accusing the firm of putting politics above profits. Congress opened investigations. The firm tripled spending on Larry’s personal security. By 2022, it was obvious the firm’s GOP connections weren’t strong enough. Larry toned down his public ESG talk. Privately, he met with Republican lawmakers and softened his stance. Patrick McHenry, a Republican who used to chair the House Financial Services Committee, said, “I look at Larry having an adeptness to pivot when he needs to. I think it’s benefited the company, and certainly benefited his standing among policymakers that are running Washington right now.” That pivot helped, but the real shift came when BlackRock started making giant moves in private markets. In 2023, the firm paid $12.5 billion for Global Infrastructure Partners, a company that controls airports, railroads, and data centers. Then it dropped $12 billion on HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit firm. These were BlackRock’s biggest deals in 15 years. They gave Larry the power to do exactly what Trump wanted: take control of the Panama Canal ports from CK Hutchison, a Chinese-linked company. “The ports deal is something they wouldn’t have been able to do prior to the acquisition,” said Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s former Treasury Secretary. Even though Trump just gave him a front-row seat, not everyone in the GOP is ready to forgive. Will Hild, executive director of the anti-BlackRock group Consumers’ Research, isn’t backing down. The group is backed by Leonard Leo, co-chair of the Federalist Society, and it’s gunning for BlackRock over ESG. “We are by no means at all done with BlackRock,” Hild said. Despite the critics, Larry keeps pulling strings. During the March 17 meeting, he and Musk talked about a deal between xAI and BlackRock’s new AI fund. That puts Larry right where he wants to be—next to Trump, at the intersection of money, tech, and national security.

Despite the turmoil in the traditional markets, the flagship cryptocurrency has held firm above $80,000, with the stability highlighting its potential as a safe haven asset. BTC is currently down almost 1%, trading at $82,836 and holding above $80,000 despite ETF outflows, growing trade tensions, and concerns about delayed rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Firm Despite Heightened Volatility Bitcoin (BTC) remained above $80,000 on Friday and Saturday despite broader market turmoil and selling pressure. However, demand has waned as fears of a full-blown trade war escalate, along with risks of a recession and a delayed rate cut decision by the Federal Reserve. Markets also witnessed BTC decoupling from the US equity markets and outperforming gold, signaling a significant shift in market dynamics. Market intelligence platform Santiment stated, “Social media has been buzzing with mentions of crypto’s ‘decoupling’ from stock markets, according to data from X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and BitcoinTalk. Following the S&P 500‘s -10.5% combined losses on Thursday and Friday alone, traders are optimistic that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are fairly insulated from the US & China tariffs that have rocked global economies.” It also said that crypto becoming less reliant on the stock market is a promising sign. “If the crypto markets are indeed becoming less and less reliant on stock markets, this would be an encouraging sign. Historically, most of the cryptocurrency’s biggest bull cycles have come when there is zero (neither a negative nor positive) correlation between the two sectors.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Outflows Despite Bitcoin’s relative stability, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered considerable outflows, signaling investor caution and indicating that the rally may lack strong investor backing. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also threw another curveball for the markets, suggesting a potential delay to Fed rate cuts. According to data from Farside Investors, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) registered net outflows of $44.6 million, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) registered net outflows of $35.5 million. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) registered net outflows of $24.1 million, and ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw net outflows of $22.2 million. However, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) registered net inflows. As a result, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market registered net total outflows of $165 million, ending a two-week inflow streak. Fed Issues Stagflation Warning Bitcoin and altcoins could come under renewed pressure after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned President Donald Trump’s tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slow growth. Powell said on Friday, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.” High inflation and high unemployment can lead to stagflation, which could become difficult to manage. This is because measures taken to fix one issue, like cutting interest rates to boost growth, could worsen the other issue and vice versa. Powell also said he was in no hurry to cut interest rates as inflation remained high, a stance supported by other officials like Raphael Bostic and Adriana Kugler. However, President Donald Trump urged Powell to cut interest rates. According to market experts, a more hawkish Fed could negatively impact Bitcoin, altcoin, and stock prices. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $80,000 as the weekend draws to a close. BTC’s relative stability comes despite the market turmoil and highlights its potential as a safe haven asset. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, known to be positively correlated to Bitcoin, dropped over 11% since President Trump’s announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating global trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, stated, “The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown impressive resilience. After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists.” However, analysts have not ruled out sharp downside volatility in the short term, especially as the “Treasury market basis trade” faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices. BTC traded in bearish territory over the previous weekend, dropping over 3% on Friday, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC fell below the 20-day SMA on Saturday and settled at $82,704. The price registered a marginal decline on Sunday, settling at $82,404. BTC faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $85,152. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, BTC lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3%, slipping below $85,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,525. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Thursday despite significant selling pressure, rising almost 1% and settling at $83,199. The price continued its upward trajectory on Friday, registering an increase of 0.76% and settling at $83,828. However, it lost momentum over the weekend and registered a marginal decline on Saturday, dropping to $83,423. The current session sees BTC down almost 1% as sellers look to drive it below $80,000. However, BTC has not ceded ground to the bears and has held firm above this level. If buyers regain control, BTC could move past $85,000 and push toward $90,000.

In a scathing critique that has renewed allegations about one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, ZachXBT says Coinbase’s culture is defined by a “lack of transparency.” On social media, ZachXBT expressed frustration : “You have locked me out of my account twice in the last month with no reason given (again today). You had customer data leaks you haven’t transparently announced (lead to thefts).” While he acknowledged that the platform offers a decent annual percentage return on stablecoins, he ultimately stated that he could not recommend Coinbase as an exchange to others. ZachXBT ignites fresh backlash over Coinbase’s troubled history with user trust and security ZachXBT comments have sparked controversy about Coinbase’s customer data handling, practices, and support. While the company largely promotes itself as the “future of money” and a paragon of regulatory compliance in the crypto space, incidents of this nature do little to enhance its reputation — especially among more experienced users. Coinbase portrays itself as a secure, transparent, and regulated entry point to crypto —a message that is easy to sell to institutional investors and new entrants. Its initial public offering in 2021 was a watershed moment for the crypto industry. But the company’s history tells a more complex tale for long-time users and crypto veterans. That same year, Coinbase was criticized after thousands of users reported being locked out of their accounts, some for months, without any resolution. The New York Times explained how so many of these customers could not connect with support when they were most vulnerable, with catastrophic loss as the prices swung violently. A similar bug in Coinbase’s SMS account recovery process later that same year allowed hackers to bypass two-factor authentication to drain user wallets. Coinbase ultimately reimbursed some victims, but critics pointed out that the company was slow to communicate and did not take the breach seriously enough. Coinbase faces increasing regulatory pressure while users express growing discontent Coinbase is not new to controversy. In 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the company for operating an unregistered securities exchange. Whereas Coinbase is battling the suit, positioning itself as a pioneer of regulatory compliance, users like ZachXBT wonder whether the company has also displayed the same diligence in protecting and communicating with its customers. Coinbase has pushed back legally — demanding the creation of new regulatory frameworks for the industry — but the lawsuit has increased pressure on the company to demonstrate its commitment to compliance, not only with regulators but with users. ZachXBT’s remarks also reflect a widespread mistrust of the status quo in the crypto world, many of whom gravitate toward decentralized platforms in search of greater control, transparency, and reliability. Condemnation like ZachXBT’s carries particular weight in the crypto world. Famed for carefully tracking a range of fraudulent schemes and aiding users in retrieving lost funds, he is a widely regarded guardian of crypto ethics — one whose critiques spur wider action or awareness.

The British carmaker said on Saturday that the pause is a short-term action as it works to address the new trading terms with its business partners. The automotive company added that the pause on shipments will become effective this month. “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.” ~ Jaguar Land Rover Automotive. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said that the US is an important market for its luxury cars and brands. According to fact sheets from the UK Department for Business and Trade, cars are the top exported goods from the UK to the US. Car exports in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2024 totaled a staggering £8.3 billion. Other carmakers might pause US exports too Analysts predict that other carmakers will follow the steps of JLR and pause US exports. The imposed tariffs have added more pressure on the automotive industry in Britain. The demand for British-made cars has decreased domestically and in Europe, while sales in China have been on the decline. Furthermore, British carmakers are lagging in the electric vehicles race as factories are required to overhaul existing machinery. University of Birmingham Professor David Bailey told The Guardian that “much of UK auto is already operating well below capacity, and the tariffs will be a further hit for a struggling industry.” He said that “production cuts and job losses are likely,” and he believes that the number of jobs at risk due to the US’s tariffs is underestimated. Bailey thinks that JLR will continue to struggle unless it creates a US-based automotive factory. According to Reuters, German car makers Audi, Mercedes, and BMW are considering expanding their operations in the United States. Tariffs are pressuring international carmakers to move operations to the US, bringing Trump’s vision to reality. British carmakers have taken measures to reduce the impact of US tariffs by increasing exports and building stockpiles in the States months prior to their implementation. According to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car exports to the US in December, January, and February surged by 38.5%, 12.4%, and 34.6%, respectively. On April 3rd, the United Stated implemented a 25% tariff on imported vehicles. This tariff is applicable to vehicles from all countries including those covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Dogecoin (DOGE) is sitting on a fragile $0.16 support after a 16% drop, and XRP is caught in a utility-versus-scarcity debate that could shape its long-term trajectory. But while questions linger around these assets, BlockDAG is answering with action. The launch of BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 is more than just a technical release—it’s a milestone that signals readiness and long-term potential. With real tools, real users, and real utility already in place, the project is turning heads in all the right ways. As momentum builds, many are beginning to see BlockDAG as one of the clearest answers to the question: Which crypto coin has true growth potential right now? BlockDAG Beta Testnet Turns Plans into Performance BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 is officially live, and it’s already drawing attention for how much it offers right out of the gate. This isn’t just a behind-the-scenes milestone for developers—it’s an open door to a functioning ecosystem. Users can now explore working decentralized apps, launch tokens or NFTs through a no-code builder, and navigate the updated explorer with ease. Built for wide accessibility, not just developers, this environment gives a real look at how BlockDAG aims to scale. What separates BlockDAG from other emerging platforms is its ability to shift from talk to action. The no-code creation tool allows anyone—even non-developers—to build new digital assets. Every token or NFT created will rely on BDAG to function, directly tying the platform’s growth to real-world usage. That’s the kind of utility that creates ongoing demand—not just temporary hype. The rollout also comes with serious user incentives. BlockDAG has allocated $60,000 in BDAG rewards for testnet participation, with the most active wallets eligible for $2,000 each. It’s a smart strategy that promotes hands-on interaction and encourages community building from day one. The numbers further support its rising momentum. BlockDAG has raised more than $212 million in presale funding and sold over 19.1 billion coins. Now in batch 27, BDAG trades at $0.0248—a jump of 2,380% from its initial batch price of $0.001. As other networks stall or debate direction, BlockDAG is clearly pushing ahead with measurable, meaningful progress. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Today Pressures $0.16 Support After 16% Weekly Drop Dogecoin is currently hovering at the $0.16 support level after falling 16% over the past week. This price point is being closely watched, as a bounce could trigger a short-term recovery toward $0.20 or even $0.25. But a dip below this level risks sparking broader selloffs that may drag DOGE closer to $0.10—or possibly $0.06 in a worst-case slide. Historically, similar support levels have attracted new buyers, helping DOGE rebound. While that’s still possible, broader market conditions remain mixed, and the lack of a fresh catalyst leaves DOGE in a vulnerable position. Traders are staying alert, as the next move could shape sentiment for weeks to come. XRP Price Outlook Faces New Utility vs. Velocity Debate The conversation around XRP is heating up again, this time focusing on how utility may or may not drive long-term value. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently suggested that a higher price could actually make XRP more efficient by reducing the amount needed for large transactions. That’s sparked renewed optimism about XRP’s role in major financial flows. However, there’s growing concern from within the XRP community about token velocity. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) driving fast, high-frequency transactions, some worry this activity could dilute long-term price growth by affecting scarcity. Ideas like automated market makers (AMMs) to control circulating supply are gaining traction, especially as institutions show greater interest. The XRP price outlook now depends on whether Ripple can balance speed and usefulness with scarcity and long-term value. It’s a nuanced path—but one that, if managed well, could open up broader adoption and price stability. Final Takeaway Dogecoin’s recent 16% dip puts it in a critical position, with $0.16 acting as a make-or-break level. XRP’s future is tied to how its utility evolves, with debates over speed and scarcity continuing to shape community expectations. But while both face pressing questions, BlockDAG is focused on solutions—and delivering them. With its Beta Testnet V1 now live, BlockDAG is proving it can build, launch, and grow—fast. Real dApps, a user-friendly no-code asset builder, and generous participation rewards show the team’s commitment to usability and scalability. Backed by $212 million in presale funding and a 2,380% price increase since batch 1, BlockDAG is turning momentum into progress. For those looking ahead and asking which crypto coin offers the clearest path to real-world growth—BlockDAG is stepping forward with results.

The Impact of CEX Listings on BlockDAG—Updates on Solaxy & SHIB’s 15M Burn,https://thecoinrise.com/will-bdag-reach-20-the-impact-of-cex-listings-on-blockdag-updates-on-solaxy-shibs-15m-burn/,"When a token lands on ten major exchanges consecutively, what’s the result? BlockDAG is set to find out, while developments in Solaxy and Shiba Inu’s market activities also draw attention. Solaxy has recently surpassed $29 million in funding, marking the launch of Solana’s first Layer-2 with active staking. In contrast, SHIB has eliminated over 819 million tokens, yet stagnant total value locked and a 3% price dip have stirred concerns. Currently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under the spotlight, not merely for its growth but for its escalating presence. As it prepares to join 10 CEXs, each new addition contributes like a chain reaction: enhancing liquidity, attracting new participants, and supporting a higher baseline price for BDAG. This dynamic has led analysts to point to BDAG as a top crypto pick, with potential to hit $20. BlockDAG’s Exchange Listings May Significantly Drive Its Price BlockDAG continues its upward trajectory. With more than $212 million collected and 19.1 billion BDAG coins distributed in its ongoing presale, the momentum is tangible. From an initial price of $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, the presale has shown a 2,380% gain for early backers. The fast-paced presale, together with the live beta testnet featuring airdrops and weekly incentives, adds further excitement. The core of BlockDAG’s strategy lies in its plan to be listed on 10 centralized exchanges. Each listing boosts liquidity, attracts new participants, and reinforces the coin’s price stability. The initial CEX listing ignites the process. By the tenth, BDAG could transform significantly. As liquidity builds and recognition increases, analysts are beginning to forecast a long-term price of $20. Each listing brings additional benefits—increased wallets, more exposure, and higher volume. These aren’t mere events; they amplify BlockDAG’s value. They do more than maintain its position; they propel it forward. As visibility on each platform grows, this is why many recognize BlockDAG as a top crypto choice today. By the end of the final listing, the price baseline is expected to shift significantly. If BDAG continues to accumulate listings, its value could not only rise but accelerate. Watching from the sidelines might mean seeing the price from an elevated viewpoint. That’s why grabbing BDAG now, while it’s below $0.03, is advised. Solaxy Update: $29M Achieved and Upcoming Layer-2 Launch The recent developments in Solaxy show that it has successfully amassed over $29 million in its presale, establishing itself as the pioneering Layer-2 solution for Solana. This rollout aims to address congestion issues with a rollup-based structure, ensuring smooth operations during high-traffic periods such as meme coin transactions. Solaxy further enhances its offering by linking Ethereum’s liquidity to Solana’s speed via the multi-chain SOLX token, providing a hybrid advantage to users. Notably, staking is already operational in this presale phase, with SOLX holders potentially earning up to 140% APY. However, this rate may decrease as participation increases. With an imminent price increase in the presale, this update serves as a crucial alert for potential participants. Post-launch, SOLX will be available on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, with stakers eligible to claim their tokens a week after. Shiba Inu’s Market Analysis Post-819 Million Token Burn Despite the burning of 819 million tokens, Shiba Inu’s market price is under strain. The recent destruction of 15 million SHIB did not prevent a 60% reduction in the overall burn rate, accompanied by a 3% decline in SHIB’s price. This dip corresponds with a lack of movement in Shibarium’s total value locked, leading to doubts about the effectiveness of the burn strategy in boosting prices shortly. Market patterns have shown fluctuations with occurrences of both death and golden crosses, indicating uncertainty. SHIB currently trades at approximately $0.00001242, just under a significant resistance level. Opinions among analysts about SHIB’s future price are mixed, predicting potential volatility. The focal point now is whether increased demand will emerge as the token burning persists and Shibarium gains broader acceptance. Takeaway The latest updates from Solaxy indicate a robust presale and readiness to expand Solana through its Layer-2 solution. In contrast, Shiba Inu’s price forecast remains tentative, with ongoing token burns yet to significantly impact the market due to subdued activity on Shibarium. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is creating substantial momentum. With over $212 million gathered in crypto presale and plans for listings on 10 key exchanges, the cascading effect of these listings is beginning to unfold. Each new listing escalates BlockDAG’s visibility, trading activity, and price prospects. Analysts endorsing it as a prime crypto purchase today are not just swayed by enthusiasm but recognize the solid technology underlying BDAG’s growth. As the listing process completes, the $20 price target could soon be a reality, making it a prudent purchase while still in the early stages.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Matthew Sigel – the head of digital assets research at VanEck – says that President Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs will accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a tool for the settlement of energy trade. “China and Russia were recently revealed to be settling some energy transactions using Bitcoin and other digital assets – just as we anticipated. Bolivia also announced plans in March to import energy using crypto. And in Europe, French utility EDF (?Électricité de France) will explore using surplus electricity – currently exported to Germany – to mine Bitcoin. These developments highlight how digital assets are evolving from speculative instruments into tools for energy trade and monetary realignment. In that context, the latest tariffs aren’t just an economic story – they may be an accelerant for Bitcoin’s role in the emerging multi-polar order.” Sigel goes on to say that traders should keep an eye on the policies of the US Federal Reserve, China and the EU to better gauge the crypto markets. He also notes the relevance of the strength of the US dollar and BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. According to Sigel, if China and the EU were to retaliate to Trump’s tariffs and move away from the US dollar, it could boost use cases for digital assets. “Investors should watch the evolving path of Fed policy: dovish shifts in rate expectations and rising liquidity are historically positive for Bitcoin. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is another key gauge – any signs of dollar weakness may support the Bitcoin-as-hedge narrative. Bitcoin ETF flows and on-chain activity also matter: despite volatility, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs are still net positive by ~$600 million year-to-date, with renewed inflows seen in late March. And finally, any retaliatory steps from China or the EU – especially ones that bypass dollar-based systems – could accelerate the strategic case for crypto.” Last week, Trump signed an executive order that imposes sweeping or reciprocal tariffs on a long list of nations, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. The announcement rocked global markets, causing a sharp dip in digital asset and stock prices.

Meanwhile, Cardano sees significant sales, with 120 million ADA sold in just two days. Amid these market shifts, one platform is making strides by equipping creators with the tools they need, rather than just promises. BlockDAG’s recent beta testnet release introduces a no-code token and NFT creation tool. This tool, akin to a Shopify for crypto, enables users to design and launch Web3 projects effortlessly. The outcome? An increase in token and NFT launches, enhancing reasons to engage with BDAG. For those eyeing the crypto market, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers tangible utility and compelling reasons to pay attention. BlockDAG’s No-Code Tool Makes Web3 Accessible to All BlockDAG’s recent initiative goes beyond enhancing blockchain speed or security – it democratizes access. With the new no-code tool for creating tokens and NFTs now available on the beta testnet, anyone can engage in Web3 development without any coding expertise. This user-friendly approach transforms the platform into a hub for creators who might feel overwhelmed by the technical demands of networks like Ethereum or Solana. This ease of use is significant. Every new token or NFT made with BlockDAG’s tool runs on BDAG, creating more transactions and increasing demand for the coin – a virtuous cycle of utility. As the testnet progresses and the mainnet launch nears, BlockDAG stands out as a crypto worth watching, with its value clearly linked to its usage. The beta testnet, launched on March 28, also features improved blockchain explorers, faucet access, and a dashboard tailored for creators. Additionally, it offers a $60,000 reward pool, with $2,000 in BDAG allocated to the top 10 most active users. Already, over 110,000 participants are testing the network, helping refine its performance ahead of the mainnet launch. BlockDAG’s ongoing presale is in its 27th batch, with BDAG priced at $0.0248. To date, over 18.8 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $212 million. BlockDAG is rapidly gaining traction among both users and developers, making it a noteworthy crypto to consider. Shiba Inu Struggles Amid Network Growth Despite an active network, Shiba Inu’s price continues to fall. Currently, it is trading at $0.00001226, marking an 8.28% decrease this week and a 55% drop year-over-year. The Shibarium network has surpassed 1 billion transactions, yet 62% of SHIB holders are experiencing losses. The token burn rate has also decreased, with 37.6 million SHIB burned in the last day—a 60% reduction from the day before. Shibarium’s transition to real-world applications has not boosted SHIB’s value. Trading volumes have decreased by 40% in the last 24 hours, and with the majority of SHIB controlled by large holders, price fluctuations continue to be erratic. Without sustained demand or effective token burns, the downward trend in Shiba Inu’s price may persist, potentially leading to further losses for holders. Cardano Faces Volatility from Whale Transactions Cardano has experienced significant trading activity, with 120 million ADA sold over two days. This has reduced the total ADA held in large wallets from 5.84 billion to 5.71 billion. Cardano’s price briefly fell to $0.61, then recovered to $0.66, but it still shows a nearly 6% decline over the week. The proportion of ADA held by whales has decreased to 8.48%, with retail holders now owning 71.17% of the supply. This trend highlights a shift away from short-term traders, who have decreased by 16.36%. Despite market pressures, institutional interest remains strong, with Cardano-focused exchange-traded products (ETPs) receiving $0.6 million in new inflows last week, bringing the 2025 total to $70 million. Although whale activity has affected short-term prices, long-term institutional engagement appears robust. Overview of Market Dynamics The ongoing price declines of Shiba Inu and the active selling by Cardano whales are creating challenges for both communities. This situation is characterized by decreased trading, insufficient token burns, and ongoing sell-offs. As participants await market recovery, there is a growing interest in platforms that offer greater utility and simpler user interfaces. In this environment, BlockDAG introduces a significant tool: a no-code wizard for creating tokens and NFTs, making Web3 accessible to non-developers. Every operation on the platform engages BDAG, linking usage directly to the coin’s demand. For those exploring crypto options, BlockDAG provides practical tools that are already in use. With its crypto presale now exceeding $212 million, the platform continues to gain momentum.

We didn’t hit our minimum raise,” the developers of the Real (REAL) token, Real World Gaming said in an April 6 X post, adding that “All bids will be refunded in full.” “This is not the end,” RWG said. The team only managed to raise $392,315 in USDC ( USDC ) over a 28-hour presale on April 5 and 6 — less than half of the minimum required and approximately 11% of the $3.6 million target, which was conducted via a sealed-bid auction. The public sale of 60 million REAL tokens (3% of the total 2 billion REAL supply) initially targeted a fully diluted value of $120 million, with the sealed bid auction starting at $0.06 per token.

Memecoins have also been cooling off since the launch of the Official Trump memecoin on Jan. 18, 2025.

Pepe Coin (PEPE), a meme token experiencing volatile price movements, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralised lending platform now in the fourth phase of its presale, are getting eyes for their potential to bring exponential gains. PEPE price hovers around $0.000000746, testing a falling wedge formation that could prompt an explosive 130% move for price if resistance is overcome, according to analysts. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) claims that it has raised $6.30 million with 7,900 holders so far and with tokens for stage 4 at $0.025 (which will increase 20% once stage 5 begins). Early investors locking in MUTM now at a launch price of $0.06 can expect to see returns of 140%, but in-after projections show a meteoric rise beyond $3.50! Technical Indicators for Pepe Coin Prompt Speculation A falling wedge pattern dominates Pepe Coin’s charts, which is on the verge of a breakout. As the meme token tumbles down 15% a week, opinions are split recently after a whale snapped up 492 billion PEPE for $3.74 million on April 1, 2025, leading many to believe that bullish momentum could be right around the corner. Resistance around $0.000001 and $0.0000015 serve as key barriers — with a definitive break potentially sending prices to $0.000002, representing a 161% increase. While technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator suggest a potential recovery in momentum, PEPE’s dependance on prevailing market sentiment and meme-induced volatility leaves its future uncertain. Although the accumulation of whales indicates confidence, analysts warn that wider market stability and a resurgence in retail interest are necessary for a sustained upward journey. We Built It So You Can Come Home: Mutuum Finance Presale In the fourth phase of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) manages to keep pulling in capital and tokens are currently being offered at $0.025 with a planned increase of 20% taking place in phase 5, making tokens $0.03. The project’s tokenomics secures a 140% yield at its $0.06 exchange listing, although projections range higher still: one projections as far as $3.50 post-launch puts a no less than 13,900% upside on current buyers. MUTM stands in contrast to the speculatively-driven value of PEPE, as the former is directly correlated to its DeFi lending ecosystem, which allows users to borrow against overcollateralized assets, and earn by utilizing mtTokens—interest-accruing deposit certificates. A buy-and-distribute mechanism only exacerbates demand, directing platform revenue into MUTM buys distributed to stakers — leading to cyclical buy pressure. Strength in a Bumpy Market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses real world utility to hedge against the risk that PEPE’s potential is dependent on uncontrollable meme trends. With a presale structure that is now 36% complete, the price of the tokens is steadily ramped up across 11 phases, rewarding early participation. Its ongoing smart contract audit, led by CertiK, will further assure investors, with audit results anticipated before listing on exchanges. Over 7,900 holders have positioned themselves early ahead of MUTM’s shift from presale to mainstream trading—which in the past has connected to fast price appreciation. With the crypto market bouncing between hype and fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuses both. Phase 4’s opening price of $0.025 leaves a shrinking opportunity for investors looking to make pre-launch gains, whereas PEPE’s technical setup remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. With calculated growth over volatility, thus MUTM’s presale stages reflect a rare convergence of urgency and opportunity. Last Call Before Opening Tickets Phase 5 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves closer to next price incrementation as phase 4 sells out quicker than previous phases. Investors placing $1,000 today would receive 40,000 tokens, some analysts predict to hit $3.50 per token post-launch, resulting in $45,000. Pending completion of the CertiK audit adds additional credibility in line with MUTM’s commitment to security and transparency. Time is running out for them to get in on the 140% launch return—phase 5’s price of $0.03 comes into play as soon as current allocations are cleared. While PEPE’s whales take a huge bet on a very fickle market sentiment, MUTM’s entire ascent has been structured, creating a roadmap for buyers to achieve exponential gains — no meme necessary.

Using the UTXO Realized Price Distribution metric, the crypto analyst pinpoints $0.18 and $0.2 as the key resistance levels the Dogecoin price must break to surge higher. How Dogecoin’s Critical $0.18 And $0.2 Resistance Levels Could Spark A Major Dogecoin Price Rally According to renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s analysis of the URPD metric, approximately 8% of the total DOGE supply was last traded at $0.18, with another 7% purchased at around $0.21. These price points with more trading activity create significant resistance barriers as investors who bought at these levels may sell to break even, potentially limiting upward movement. However, the crypto analyst suggests that if the Dogecoin price successfully breaks through these resistance levels, there would be relatively few obstacles to slow its upward momentum, potentially triggering a substantial rally. Currently trading near $0.17, the meme coin is approaching the first crucial resistance level at $0.18. Historically, social media sentiment and celebrity endorsements, particularly from figures like Elon Musk, have influenced Dogecoin price movements. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Gains Momentum As Dogecoin Price Nears Potential Surge WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is generating unusual buzz in crypto circles. Its beta platform showcases a merger of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance, creating an ecosystem where advanced AI algorithms drive real-time market insights. One notable attention-puller is its AI-powered predictive analytics tool , which digs through historical and live market data, identifying potential breakout opportunities before they hit the mainstream. Investors don’t have to babysit the charts to capitalize on these opportunities as the platform’s custom alerts, tailored to each portfolio, instantly notify them of critical market shifts. Furthermore, its automated transaction capabilities execute trades at the best possible times based on pre-set rules, making sure no opportunities are missed due to market timing. As users accrue more profits, they remain protected by the decentralized wallet’s security features, including a real-time anomaly detection system designed to catch and neutralize potential security threats before they can cause harm. Furthermore, the platform’s multi-layered approach with robust security protocols like biometric verification, multi-factor authentication, and QR scanning prevents unauthorized access to users’ portfolios. Since its CoinMarketCap debut , WallitIQ’s native WLTQ token has quickly attracted interest. Its low $0.0420 presale price positions it as a smart investment, especially in light of bullish market projections. With expectations of the AI market reaching $244 billion by 2025 and potentially exceeding $1.01 trillion by 2031, industry analysts forecast impressive financial outcomes for high-utility AI-powered crypto projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). They project the platform to generate monthly revenues of up to $7 million while predicting the native WLTQ token could achieve a potential 300% price increase as adoption grows. Adding another layer of appeal, early WallitIQ (WLTQ) adopters are offered substantial incentives, such as exclusive staking rewards up to 180% APY, access to high-yield liquidity pools, and governance rights to influence the platform’s future. The platform has already launched its MVP Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App, which offers real-time price tracking and intuitive trading tools for managing assets like ETH and USDT. Users can also use its trade simulation capability to refine their strategies before committing actual funds. Adding to investor confidence, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) successful smart contract audit by SolidProof further solidifies its reputation as a secure and credible project. Savvy Investors Are Acting Now, Join Them On WallitIQ (WLTQ) As the Dogecoin price approaches its critical resistance levels, savvy investors are not only watching DOGE charts but also securing their position in promising projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ). With the presale price currently at just $0.0420 and analysts forecasting potential gains of up to 300% as adoption accelerates, early investors are racing to acquire WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens before mainstream recognition drives prices higher. With the platform’s robust security features and profit-maximizing tools at the intersection of AI and DeFi, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is perfectly positioned to capture significant market share in the billion-dollar crypto AI market. With presale tokens selling quickly, now is the time to act on this rare opportunity before it’s too late.

As capital cautiously re-enters the space, retail and institutional players alike are focusing less on price hype and more on substance. For the top crypto coins, momentum is no longer enough—real infrastructure and adoption metrics are driving decisions. That’s where today’s divide emerges. While SUI is up 25% from March lows, every SUI price prediction remains contingent on resistance levels breaking. At the same time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a nearly 40% volume surge, but its outlook remains capped by instability in funding and price structure. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already proving traction. In Keynote 3, CEO Antony Turner shared that the X1 Miner App alone now supports “more than 800,000+ users mining, earning, and engaging with us.” Meanwhile, the TG Tap Miner added another 400,000+ users. With $210.5 million raised, 19.1 billion BDAG sold, and mobile-first mining at scale, BlockDAG is no longer projecting adoption—it’s executing it. SUI Price Prediction Eyes $3—but Resistance Remains a Deciding Factor The SUI price prediction is trending more positive following a 25% rebound since March lows, with the coin currently trading at $2.49. Technical momentum is supported by the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern—a historically bullish structure—that targets the $2.85 to $3 zone. Adding fuel to the forecast, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the SUI network has risen by 19.4% over the last three weeks, now totaling $1.23 billion. That metric reflects growing on-chain activity and user confidence. Still, the final leg of this run depends heavily on broader market behavior, especially from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action: Volume Up, But Direction Still Unclear The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is currently hovering near $0.00001267, having recently dipped to $0.0000122. Although the price has bounced slightly, what stands out is the 39.78% spike in trading volume, bringing the 24-hour tally to $261 million. Technical indicators are stabilizing. The RSI has recovered to 50.45, up from levels that were dangerously close to oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD just made a bullish crossover, implying short-term strength. However, funding rates remain erratic, flipping between positive and negative since February—a sign that leveraged traders are divided on SHIB’s direction. BlockDAG’s Mass Adoption Didn’t Wait for Mainnet—It Showed Up Early Unlike most Layer 1 projects that quietly build toward a launch with little user traction, BlockDAG took a different route—one that prioritized early utility and rapid community involvement. By the time its Keynote 3 premiered, the BlockDAG ecosystem was already alive with measurable activity. Through a blend of mobile accessibility and gamified experiences, the network had already attracted over 1.2 million users—long before the mainnet even went live. The foundation of this success lies in its dual-platform strategy. “To date we have more than 800,000+ users mining, earning, and engaging with us,” noted CEO Antony Turner, referencing the X1 Miner App during the keynote. In parallel, the TG Tap Miner game carved out a second powerful entry point: “400,000+ signed-up users and upwards of 100,000 active players every day,” Turner added. This approach doesn’t just reflect growth—it reflects readiness. As of Batch 27, BDAG’s price has already surged 2,380%, jumping from $0.001 to $0.0248. The project has now raised over $210.5 million and sold more than 19.1 billion BDAG coins, all without relying on venture capital—just retail support and utility traction. Looking ahead, forecasts estimate BDAG could reach $20 by 2027, which frames the current entry point as a rare pricing window. With its Testnet live, real user activity underway, and community tools scaling fast, BlockDAG isn’t just preparing for mass adoption—it’s already executing on it. The remaining variable? How long the current opportunity stays open before demand begins to drive scarcity. Wrap-Up: Which Crypto Holds Real Promise—SUI, SHIB, or BDAG? The market is crowded with movement, but not all motion is meaningful. SUI’s 25% rally may continue, but its $3 goal is still at the mercy of macro forces. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has recovered slightly, but remains reactive—more speculation than strategy. BlockDAG, however, is showing structured growth: live users, rising presale value, and a clear product roadmap. Its Keynote 3 confirmed that 1.2 million+ users are actively mining BDAG coins using mobile-first tools. With the price already at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and a $20 target by 2027, early participation today could translate into one of the highest ROIs in the current crypto cycle. Among the top crypto coins being tracked right now, BlockDAG is transforming adoption into value. And that could make all the difference for forward-looking traders.

With so many projects launching and evolving, it’s easy to feel lost in the noise. Ondo and Theta have been making headlines with their latest moves, stirring up excitement in the market. Ondo’s token has been gaining traction in the world of tokenized real-world assets, while Theta is shaking things up in decentralized video streaming. But amidst these power players, a new contender is turning heads—Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike the traditional names, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s the first Web3 aggregator uniting multiple blockchains under one roof. But what really makes it stand out is its game-changing decentralized VPN (dVPN), offering a new level of online security and privacy. With its presale already surpassing $15.8 million, early buyers are rushing in before the next price hike. Those looking for the best cryptos to invest in this week might want to pay close attention to what Qubetics is bringing to the table. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN: The Best Cryptos to Invest in This Week for Privacy As the internet becomes more centralized, online privacy has become a luxury rather than a right. Most VPN providers claim to keep users safe, but the truth is, they still rely on centralized servers that can be monitored, censored, or even shut down. This is where Qubetics changes the game. Instead of a traditional VPN, it offers a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer VPN service, ensuring that no single entity can control or restrict access to the internet. For individuals, this means absolute privacy. Whether someone is a journalist working in a high-surveillance country or just someone who values online security, Qubetics’ dVPN offers an untraceable browsing experience. Imagine being able to stream restricted content, conduct private transactions, or even communicate securely without fear of data leaks. Unlike standard VPNs that can log and sell user data, Qubetics’ blockchain-based network eliminates this risk entirely. Businesses also benefit massively. Companies handling sensitive customer data, such as fintech firms or healthcare providers, can now secure their operations with a VPN that no third party can manipulate. Even remote workers dealing with confidential files can operate without worrying about data interception. This is more than just privacy—it’s freedom. And with Web3 adoption on the rise, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN isn’t just an upgrade; it’s the future of secure internet access. That’s why it’s currently being seen as one of the best cryptos to invest in this week . Qubetics Presale ROI: Why Early Buyers Are Rushing In What if one decision today could completely change your crypto game this year? That’s exactly the kind of energy Qubetics is bringing right now. Sitting confidently in its 29th presale stage at $0.1573 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already locked in over $15.8 million in funds with 506 million tokens sold and more than 24,300 holders backing it up. This isn’t your average pump-and-dump—it’s structured, growing fast, and pulling serious attention. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to invest in this week, this one’s got all the right stats to make the shortlist. Let’s play out a quick investment scenario. If you throw in $1,000 at the current price, and $TICS hits $1, you’re already looking at a 535.65% ROI. But things really take off if it climbs to $5—that’s a 3,078.26% ROI. Push that further to $10, and you’re looking at 6,256.47% ROI. And if $TICS manages to reach $15 after launch? That’s a mind-blowing 9,434.71% ROI. With ROI like this and a strong presale backing it up, Qubetics isn’t just a maybe—it’s one of the best cryptos to invest in this week before the wave gets too crowded. Ondo: The Tokenized Real-World Asset Boom While Qubetics is redefining online privacy, Ondo is tackling something just as revolutionary—tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). The idea of bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology has been floating around for years, but Ondo is one of the first projects making it truly accessible. Ondo’s biggest breakthrough has been its tokenized U.S. Treasuries, allowing users to gain exposure to stable, low-risk assets on the blockchain. This move has positioned Ondo as a major player in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). With institutional interest growing, Ondo’s partnerships with major financial entities are paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption. Recent developments have shown an increase in Ondo’s on-chain trading volume, indicating rising demand from both retail and institutional participants. The ability to earn yield from real-world assets on a decentralized platform is something traditional banks can’t compete with. If Ondo continues on this trajectory, it could play a significant role in the future of blockchain-based asset management. Theta: The Future of Decentralized Video Streaming Content creation has always been dominated by centralized giants like YouTube and Netflix, but Theta is changing that narrative. As a decentralized video delivery network, Theta allows users to share bandwidth and computing resources, reducing costs for content providers while rewarding participants with its native token.

The Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5 , with some slapped at higher rates, including China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, and Japan at 24%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped over 6% in the last 24 hours and was trading around $77,883. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ) shed over 12% in the same time frame and was trading at $1,575, according to CoinGecko. The total crypto market cap dropped over 8% to $2.5 trillion. Prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 1.4% to $78,500. Meanwhile, Ether regained $1,594. Source: Autism Capital At the same time, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 23 in its latest April 7 update, which is considered extreme fear. In a statement, Charlie Sherry, head of finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the drop is unsurprising because global markets are generally more illiquid on Sundays. “As a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly,” he said. “There’s no mystery behind the trigger: President Trump’s recent tariff talk has rattled macro markets, with global trade relations suddenly looking uncertain.” Some traders, however, predict a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner . BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has also speculated that while the tariffs are rattling markets , they could result in a Bitcoin rally. The US Stock Futures market has also opened down. Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, according to Google Finance. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank by over 8%. Trading resource the Kobeissi Letter said in an April 6 post to X that the drop in US stock market futures puts S&P 500 futures in ”bear market territory,” adding that the US stock market has now erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days. Source: Kobeissi Letter Tom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm MV Global, said it could be the “worst three-day move for US stocks of all time” if “tonight’s futures hold.” Trump Administration doubles down on tariffs Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman speculates that US President Donald Trump could postpone the tariffs to allow countries to make counteroffers or deals. In an April 6 statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump doubled down on the tariffs, saying the US has massive financial deficits with China, the European Union and many others, which the levies will solve. Related: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices “The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,” he said. He also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn't intentionally trying to cause a market sell-off but added that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” At the same time, US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an April 6 interview with ABC's This Week program that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to negotiate fresh trade deals. “They’re doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff,” he said. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response.

The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is down 8%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is down over 8% during mid-morning trading, while Shanghai’s SSE Composite Index is down 7%, and the Taipei’s TAIEX is down 9%. Major tech stocks across the region were some of the hardest hit. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong were down 12% while Tencent was down 9%. In Taipei, TSMC stocks dipped 10% in the first few minutes of trading, triggering the exchange’s price variation limit mechanism which halts trading in either direction. TSMC’s correction comes as the White House says that semiconductors from Taiwan are exempt from tariffs, but the future of the CHIPS Act – which bankrolled the construction of semiconductor factories in the U.S. – is in question. TSMC’s major correction on market open is likely foreshadowing of Nvidia’s open in the U.S. Some analysts say NVDA has become more volatile than BTC or ETH. Elsewhere in crypto, Ethereum (ETH) is down 11% on-day, XRP is down 9%, and Solana’s SOL is down 10%. Lending protocols Maker (MKR) and Aave (AAVE) were some of the worst performers on the market, down around 14% each.

According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin bull cycle may be coming to an end. This assertion is grounded in the concept of Realized Cap, a metric that quantifies the actual capital entering the BTC market through on-chain activity. Insights From Ki Young Ju For context, the Realized Cap metric operates on a straightforward premise: when Bitcoin enters a wallet, it represents a purchase, and when it leaves, it signifies a sale. By calculating the average cost basis for each wallet and multiplying it by the amount of BTC held, Ju derives the total Realized Cap. This metric reflects the total capital that has genuinely entered the BTC ecosystem, contrasting sharply with market capitalization, which is determined by the last traded price on exchanges. Related Reading: Solana Faces Defining Level At $120 – Will History Repeat? A common misconception, according to Ju, is that a small purchase, such as $10 worth of Bitcoin, only increases market capitalization by that same amount. In reality, prices are influenced by the balance of buy and sell orders on the order book. Low sell pressure means that even modest buys can significantly elevate prices and, consequently, market cap. This phenomenon was notably exploited by MicroStrategy (MSTR), which issued convertible bonds to acquire Bitcoin, thereby inflating the paper value of its holdings far beyond the initial capital deployed. Key Price Levels For Bitcoin Currently, Bitcoin appears to be in a challenging position, dropping below the key $80,000 mark. When sell pressure is high, even substantial purchases fail to affect prices, as seen when Bitcoin traded near its all-time high of nearly $100,000. Despite massive trading volumes, the price remained stagnant. Ju points out that if Realized Cap is increasing but market cap is either flat or declining, it signals a bearish trend. This indicates that while capital is entering the market, it is not translating into price appreciation—a hallmark of a bear market. Conversely, if market capitalization is rising while Realized Cap remains stable, it suggests that even minimal new investment is driving prices up, indicative of a bull market. Presently, data suggests that Bitcoin is experiencing the former scenario: capital is flowing in, but prices are not responding positively. Historically, significant market reversals require at least six months to manifest, making a short-term rally seem unlikely. Related Reading: Ethereum Tanks Nearly 50% As Bitcoin Holds Stronger In Q1 Adding to the complexity, market expert Ali Martinez has identified key resistance levels that Bitcoin must overcome to regain upward momentum. Notably, there is a major resistance cluster at $87,000, where the 50-day moving average, 200-day moving average, and a descending trendline from the all-time high converge. For Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory, the expert asserts that BTC must break through critical resistance points at $85,470 and $92,950. Additionally, support at $80,450 remains vital; failure to hold this level could lead to further declines. As of now, the leading cryptocurrency trades at $78,379, recording a 6% decline on Sunday.

What’s surprising, however, is the quiet entry of several early Dogecoin investors into this emerging project—suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. As the crypto market continues evolving, seasoned players are often the first to spot innovations that the wider public hasn’t yet recognised. Lightchain AI’s upcoming technology launch could be one such inflection point, signalling a shift in where early gains might come from next. With an increasing number of eyes turning to its ecosystem, investors are beginning to wonder whether Lightchain AI might deliver exponential returns similar to DOGE’s historic breakout. The interest from early adopters is already speaking volumes. In this article, we will explore the potential of Lightchain AI as a groundbreaking technology and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. Why Is XRP Flashing Warning Signs Around the $2.00 Mark? It is notable that XRP closing in on 2 dollars is getting a bit worrying to investors who have been monitoring its overall price and where it would be in the near future. For instance, while the coin has come up with strong and vibrant market performances, its inability to overcome resistance or sustain higher lows still indicates its underlying weakness. Moreover, on-chain data suggests a decrease in the number of transactions and wallet activities, which is usually followed by price drops. The issue of regulatory uncertainty over Ripple is not favorable and traders are extremely careful due to the fact that there is no news about new bullish catalysts. Technical indicators like the RSI and the MACD have started to diverge, pointing to a potential slowdown in the trend. In the case of further changes in the general picture of the market or the worsening of external factors, the price could collapse below 2.00 dollars leading to a rush of margin calls. These are the reasons why part of the investors are seeking new projects with steady growth prospects and a real-world application. How Is Lightchain AI Positioning Itself Against Ripple in 2025? Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a next-generation solution that contrasts sharply with Ripple’s centralised focus on cross-border payments. By 2025, Lightchain AI aims to establish a decentralised, AI-powered ecosystem that supports intelligent task execution across global networks. Unlike Ripple, which caters to banking institutions, Lightchain AI targets developers, decentralised applications, and innovators seeking scalable AI infrastructure. Its modular architecture includes roles for validator, contributor, and storage nodes—ensuring decentralisation at every layer. The project’s governance model gives token holders direct influence over system upgrades and ecosystem development, further separating it from Ripple’s top-down structure. As the industry shifts toward intelligent automation and decentralised intelligence, Lightchain AI’s roadmap and infrastructure offer a modern alternative to older protocols. This long-term focus allows it to appeal to a broader Web3 community seeking innovation beyond payment processing. Can Lightchain AI Overtake XRP Amid Growing Investor Interest? Lightchain AI overtaking XRP may seem ambitious, but investor sentiment is clearly shifting toward ecosystems offering utility and innovation beyond transactional speed. Lightchain AI’s presale has already attracted $18.9 million, indicating confidence in its forward-facing architecture and roadmap. With the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) at its core, the platform provides decentralised AI execution—something XRP does not address. This unique functionality opens opportunities in sectors ranging from DeFi to governance, giving the project a more diverse application range. Furthermore, Lightchain AI’s community-driven evolution and transparent governance model appeal to investors disillusioned with centralised control in legacy projects. As the market matures and utility becomes the key investment criterion, platforms like Lightchain AI stand a strong chance of climbing higher in the rankings. With sustained development and adoption, surpassing XRP in relevance—and potentially value—is not out of reach. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-07 03:00:00

The overly hyped memecoin raised just $392,000 in a 28-hour presale, falling 61% short of its $1 million minimum target.

This is not the end. — Real World Gaming (@getrealtoken) April 6, 2025 McGregor and his team had pitched the project as a more honest alternative to other celebrity-backed tokens, which have faced criticism and scams. He promised that the REAL token would be different, offering transparency, DAO voting rights, and possible use in the gaming ecosystem. You might also like: Dogecoin price prediction: Memecoin rally or downward dog? The token’s structure demonstrated long-term planning, with the DAO treasury receiving 31.5%, the community receiving 16.5%, seed investors receiving 13.5%, and the team receiving 10%. The remaining portion was distributed among staking, sales, airdrops, and liquidity. However, concerns regarding the team’s 10% stake were already being voiced. Despite the efforts, the launch happened at a tough time for the market. The memecoin market is still reeling from high-profile scams like February’s LIBRA memecoin scandal . The REAL token’s failure shows that, in the current environment, celebrity endorsements are not enough to propel a project forward. Investors seem to be more cautious, even with major backers like Animoca Brands and KuCoin Labs, particularly as the hype wanes and the importance of fundamentals gains prominence. The project will go forward in some capacity, according to McGregor’s team, but the token’s launch has been postponed for the time being.

Posting on X on April 4, Cohen said the feature has returned with “industry standard moderation systems in place and transparent guidelines.” He said it had been rolled out to just 5% of users. Source: Alon Cohen Pump.fun’s website describes the purpose of its new live-streaming moderation policy as being “to cultivate a social environment on pump fun that preserves creativity and freedom of expression and encourages meaningful engagement amongst users, free of illegal, harmful, and negative interactions.” Breaches of the moderation policy could see creators having their livestreams and Pump.fun accounts terminated. The policy prohibits certain types of content, including violence, animal abuse, pornography and youth endangerment. However, it also creates ambiguity by claiming that “pump fun does not intend to universally define what content is ‘appropriate’ or ‘inappropriate.’” “There is an implicit assumption that some content — perhaps much content — generally defined as NSFW will in fact appear on pump fun,” Pump.fun’s moderation policy states. The platform added it reserves the right to “unilaterally determine the appropriateness of content where necessary and to moderate it accordingly.” Live-streaming return comes as memecoin market crumbles Pump.fun removed its live-streaming feature last November after it became awash with extreme content as memecoin creators turned to increasingly shocking tactics to promote their tokens. Some users were allegedly threatening violence or self-harm if a token didn’t reach a price goal. The platform said its unprecedented growth had put a strain on its moderators, and that it would pause the live-streaming functionality indefinitely to ensure the safety of its users “until the moderation infrastructure is ready to deal with the heightened levels of activity.” At the time, Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder of algorithmic trading firm Trading Strategy, said that if Pump.fun continued to allow live-streaming without appropriate moderation, it would quickly be shut down once a mainstream audience became aware of what was going on. “I advocate for freedom of speech, but these streams are causing practical issues where people are breaking the law in live broadcasts. This will trigger a shutdown when the mainstream media catches a wind on this,” Ohtamaa said. Pump.fun’s decision to reintroduce its live-streaming feature comes as interest in memecoins has been down significantly following a series of high-profile rug pulls such as Libra (LIBRA) and Melania Meme (MELANIA). That’s coupled with the poor price performance of tokens like Trump (TRUMP) — which, according to CoinGecko, is now down over 90% from its January highs. Related: Libra founder: Memecoin critics only ‘bitch’ when left out of insider deals Data from Dune Analytics showed in March that the graduation rate for tokens launched on Pump.fun — that is, the percentage of tokens that achieve a large enough market cap to become tradable on a regular decentralized exchange — had fallen to under 1%, down from highs of around 1.67%. Combined with a sharp drop in the number of tokens being launched on the platform, this has seen the total number of tokens graduating from highs of around 5,400 per week in January to under 1,500 in March. The number of tokens launched on the Solana network has also fallen dramatically overall. Only 31,651 launched on April 5, according to Solscan , less than one-third of the 95,578 created at the peak of the memecoin frenzy on Jan. 26.

While Ripple and Solana are showing capacity for growth, an upcoming altcoin known as Rexas Finance (RXS) seems to be lying under the radar, waiting to take over in 2025. Comparing Rexas Finance with Solana and Ripple, Rexas Finance shows potential for catastrophic growth soon. Alongside its innovative application in real-world decentralized finance (DeFi), it enables RXS to seize the attention of investors. This clearly marks Rexas Finance as a compelling investment opportunity. 270% increase expected from Solana’s cup-and-handle formation Over the past year, Solana (SOL) has positively surprised many of the cryptocurrencies available. Currently, Solana seems to be forming a “cup and handle” technical setup. This generally means strong upward movements follow after a period of turbulence. Bullish engulfing patterns serve as positive indicators on the weekly chart of SOL, which is valued at $128.91 and has a market cap of $65.73 billion. These indicators indicate a strong buying force. The Accumulation/Distribution indicator also suggests that many dip investors try to position themselves to make the most of the upward movement. Assuming Solana stays above $100, analysts forecast a significant breakout with a 270% rally that would drive SOL to $505. Although a Solana cup-and-handle pattern can develop over time, the projected outcomes appear promising—though investors will require patience to make these gains a reality. Ripple (XRP) advances but needs to overcome resistance levels As reported in the past weeks, Ripple (XRP) has been in the news thanks to its regulatory advancements and mounting institutional acceptance. It is safe to say that XRP has been facing considerable resistance for a while now but has managed to break through and is back above $2.30, marking XRP’s fourth recovery in a row. As expected, the recent rally was triggered by good news regarding Ripple’s licensing progress in Dubai and ongoing legal tussles with the SEC, which are proving to provide positive outcomes for the company. Substantial investment sentiment has done wonders in aiding the token, which is bordering crucial resistance levels. Currently, XRP is giving $2.57 considerable struggle, which is the most important one on the chart for now. Breaking beyond this point seems essential for the bulls to charge toward greater targets, allowing XRP to cross $3 in the coming weeks. A few market people tend to think that a $10 price target is set for the long term if we assume rational adoption and clarifying regulations. These crucial numbers seem appealing, but as with XRP, you can only rely on widespread adoption, legal outcomes, and international rulings. While seemingly appealing for a bear market, this seems muted when compared to newer explosive projects in the market, like Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance (RXS): the underestimated coin that could surge past Solana and Ripple As Solana and Ripple continue to rise, another altcoin is rising— Rexas Finance (RXS). Unlike most new tokens, which depend solely on excitement, RXS is supported by an innovative financial ecosystem offering actual value. Starting from a price of $0.20 in the presale stage, RXS has already surpassed the $47.375 million mark and is set to sell over 456 million tokens, reaching 91.37% completion in its presale. This comes with an exchange listing confirmed for June 19, 2025, after which many investors have started viewing this as the last chance to capitalize before an expected surge in momentum. Rexas Finance stands due to its broad DeFi ecosystem, which includes staking, yield farming, tokenized RWAs, and advanced asset management. These features further distinguish Rexas from merely a speculative investment; it’s a functional platform offering genuine utility and catering to the evolving financial environment. Reasons why RXS could outperform SOL and XRP in 2025 RXS is considered the underdog because it lacks the market cap of its peers. With ample room for improvement on the proposed presale, the low-cap altcoin rewards Rexas with a level of growth that would ultimately help its price surge just before its listing on exchanges. XRP and SOL already have a high market cap, while RXS is an undiscovered gem awaiting exposure. Practical Applications and Value Propositions: While Ripple and Solana concentrate on borderless payments and scalability, RXS is developing an entire decentralized finance (DeFi) system. This captures the attention of multiple investors because of the automated trading systems connected with tokenization and AI and its sophisticated features like staking. Hype Before the Listing and Sale: RXS seems already appealing to retail and institutional investors, given that it raised almost $50 million even before hitting big exchanges. It’s likely to have a bigger required demand after going live. Gains Expectation Compared to Solana and Ripple: It’s pretty clear how reliable SOL and XRP are, with their expected 2x to 3x profits over the next year, but expecting a 10x (or even more) spike in a shorter period stretches the limits of imagination. For RXS, this isn’t far from reality. Conclusion: strategic portfolios Solana and Ripple continue to appeal from an investment perspective, with clear bullish patterns strongly suggesting price increases. Rexas Finance offers an even better investment opportunity for the most profitable return. At RXS’s potential upside in 2025 compared to SOL or XRP, RXS’s expected exchange listing, growing demand, and an entry price of $0.20 make it an unparalleled investment. While Solana and Ripple would provide reasonable returns over a long period, Rexas Finance will be the right choice for those looking for steep growth. Those who spot this opportunity early will win big as the crypto market booms.

The altcoins have it worse, with even more painful declines. The total liquidations have skyrocketed to $900 million on a daily scale. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView It was just several days ago, on Wednesday, when BTC’s price shot up to over $88,000 for the first time in a week. However, things change fast in today’s financial landscape, and Trump’s Trade War, which he labeled as ‘Liberation Day,’ pushed all markets south hard. Bitcoin dropped to $81,200 on a couple of occasions in the following days but managed to recover some ground ahead of the weekend, and even decoupled from Wall Street on Friday. However, being a 24/7 tradable asset has its downturns, and investors have initiated another sell-off over the weekend in anticipation of another painful Monday trading session. BTC stood around $83,000-$84,000 during most of the weekend but nosedived on Sunday evening and during the Monday Asian trading session. Its bottom, at least for now, came at $77,000, which became a monthly low. The altcoins have plunged a lot harder. The largest of the bunch , for instance, dumped to just over $1,500 – the lowest price tag since October 2023. XRP has declined by 12% on a daily scale, and has slumped below the coveted $2 support line, which some analysts believe could lead to a drop to $1.2/3. Double-digit price drops are evident from most larger-cap alts, including LTC, SUI, TRUMP, DOGE, and many others. The total liquidations for the past 24 hours have skyrocketed to over $900 million, according to CoinGlass.

The surge was not random. It started with a special convergence of market catalysts: Donald Trump’s comeback to the presidency, a consistent Federal Reserve policy, and a large flow of institutional investors looking for safe havens in digital assets. Long battling legal obstacles and mistrust, this ideal storm sparked excitement surrounding XRP. The retirement of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a long-standing enemy of Ripple, may have marked the biggest turning point. With his leaving, an age of legal uncertainty long suppressing XRP’s expansion ended. From a meagre $500 million daily average to an eye-popping $5 billion between mid-November and December, XRP immediately saw a surge in trade volume. The market hummed with activity. XRP cools down after a heated run By Q2 2025, the thrills had calmed down. Fast-forward. Currently trading at $2.46, XRP has increased 3% over the last 24 hours and about 25% from its highs earlier this year. The decline has demoralized more recent investors. Many wonder if XRP’s bull run is just a pause or has ended. Not everyone is throwing in the towel, notwithstanding the declining price action. Edoardo Farina, head of Social Adoption at XRPHealthcare, feels the best is still to come. Citing a few critical events on the horizon that might propel another leg up, he recently claimed that XRP still has excellent upside left in 2025. Key XRP drivers in Q2 2025 The possible acceptance of XRP ETFs is a significant catalyst on the radar. The SEC reviews more than fifteen applications right now. Should any of them pass, XRP would become far more easily available to regular consumers and institutional investors. The same tendency was mostly responsible for driving Bitcoin to unprecedented highs in 2024. Furthermore, regulatory clarification on stablecoins is necessary. Although XRP is not a stablecoin, experts believe new rules can inadvertently help the token. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, will likely acquire popularity as the regulation environment develops. Since XRP is utilized for transaction fees inside the Ripple ecosystem, researcher SMQKE claims that rising acceptance of RLUSD will organically fuel demand for XRP. These fees are burned, lowering the total supply and aggravating the scarcity. Farina even wonders if RLUSD might become the favoured settlement standard for worldwide transactions. Should this scenario pass, XRP would be the hub of a large transactional ecosystem, driving price appreciation and adoption. US support and institutional momentum The present US government has adopted a quite pro-crypto policy. Declaring support for American-based cryptocurrency companies like Ripple, President Trump has indicated that the legal environment might keep becoming less hostile. Adoption over the long term and investor trust depends on this. Farina also anticipates “institutional FOMO” activating. Buying pressure could lead to a supply shortage as institutional investors rush to get access to XRP before possible ETF approval or another surge. This “supply shock” could be the catalyst XRP needs to reach $5 in Q2 2025. Rexas Finance: the 100x opportunity in real-world asset tokenization Although XRP’s road to new highs looks bright, some investors are diversifying into other initiatives, including Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas is tokenizing real estate, fine art, and commodities, integrating crypto with real-world asset (RWA) markets, unlike conventional blockchain systems. This enables investors to hold fractions of these highly valuable assets, releasing liquidity from inaccessible markets. Rexas Finance has already raised $47.63 million in its presale, with 458 million tokens sold and the twelfth stage nearing its end. Without any VC participation, the token price has gone from $0.03 to $0.20—a 567% growth. This calculated move aligns the project with long-term investor interests and helps to stop early-stage token dumping. RXS will debut on the main exchanges on June 19 at a projected listing price of $0.25. With a potential 100x ROI in 2025, analysts hope Rexas Finance will follow a breakthrough trajectory akin to early major crypto launches. Conclusion XRP could have calmed down since its explosive conclusion in 2024, but going into Q2 2025, the principles are still solid. Potential ETF approvals, institutional support, and regulatory clarification all help XRP still have a strong chance at breaking new highs. Rexas Finance offers an intriguing possibility for those looking for faster and more significant returns. With real-world relevance, a solid presale performance, and a strategic exchange debut, RXS might be the breakthrough token of 2025. Keeping an eye on these assets can be your best action this year, whether you missed the first XRP spike or are trying to diversify.

During an event hosted on Saturday by Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, Musk said : I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and Notrh America. In addition, he said that he hoped there would be more freedom for people to move between the two regions. That said, Musk’s views appear to be in stark contrast with US President Donald Trump’s approach. On April 2nd, he slammed a new batch of tariffs on literally every country in the world, including 20% levies on imports from the European Union (on certain goods). At the same time, Musk took a jab at Peter Navarro, a White House aide and one of the chief proponents of Trump’s tariff plans. “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing. Results in the ego/braings >>1 problem.” Navarro has a PhD in economics from Harvard University. Navarro also responded on Sunday, saying that Musk is “simply protecting his own interests,” among other things. Reuters reports that the EU is seeking to present a unified front in the coming days against said tariffs, aiming to approve a first set of “targeted countermeasures” on targeted imports from the United States worth some $28 billion. International stock markets are under serious tensions as major indices such as the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, and the DJI charted critical losses during last week’s trading session, which turned out to be the worst since the COVID crash. Bitcoin’s price is also down in the past 24 hours, trading at $78,000 at the time of this writing, decreasing by 6.4%.

Early investors are now crypto whales, with a large influence on the market. However, the crypto world is continually changing and constantly presents new opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one such opportunity with one of the most innovative approaches and real progress. RXS could be the altcoin to watch if you are looking for the next big thing in crypto. Here’s why: Rexas Finance’s remarkable growth surge Rexas Finance is witnessing exponential growth, becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins in the market. The project’s rapid success can be attributed to its unique approach to real-world assets (RWAs), which has attracted investors seeking stability and long-term value. By integrating RWAs into its ecosystem, Rexas Finance offers something more tangible than most cryptocurrencies, making it a solid contender in a volatile market. Investors see this as an opportunity to diversify and participate in a groundbreaking project that combines digital and traditional assets seamlessly. Impressive presale performance and fundraising Rexas Finance’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, currently in its final stage at a price of $0.20, up from the initial price of $0.03.

43016912,https://invezz.com/?p=2657433,1743997006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) sees small gains, but is more downside coming?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/07/shiba-inu-shib-sees-small-gains-but-is-more-downside-coming/,"After months of steep decline, Shiba Inu flipped green, with a 5.5% gain in the past week. This rising trend has pushed its price above the $0.000013 mark. However, uncertainty tempers the recent excitement. With weak support levels and upcoming sell pressure, the question is if SHIB can hold up or if there will be more falls. Shiba Inu price outlook: a rise to $0.000016 or a dip to $0.000011? Shiba Inu has been caught between optimism and risk. It is currently trading at $0.00001347, just above a fragile support level of $0.00001275. While this level has remained stable, its longevity heavily depends on Bitcoin. And here’s when things become risky. Shiba Inu Price Chart (24-Hour), March 25, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko With a correlation of 0.77, the altcoin rather faithfully reflects the movements of the market leader. Should Bitcoin slink toward $90,000, SHIB may ride that momentum. But should BTC falter, Shiba Inu runs as low as $0.00001141. The behavior of short-term holders is also cause for concern. The MVRV Long/Short Difference , a critical statistic for detecting profit-taking, is at a six-month low. This means many holders are currently profitable and may be inclined to sell, creating downside pressure. Shiba Inu lacks the cushion to absorb severe sell-offs without strong support from long-term investors . Because of this fragility in market structure, any price increase appears to be ephemeral unless something larger drives the entire market. Still, there is significant retail interest, and a break over $0.00001462 might swiftly change the outlook. If that level converts into support, SHIB might rise to $0.00001676, changing the conversation from “will it survive?” to “can it thrive?” While SHIB strives to regain its footing, another altcoin, Rexas Finance (RXS) , has quietly stolen the spotlight. The trending utility token in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization niche is set to be the crypto market’s next big mover. Here is why. Rexas Finance (RXS): the new face of smart crypto investment Rexas Finance is more than just another crypto riding the frenzy; it’s changing how blockchain interacts with real-world assets. Rexas Finance blurs the gap between traditional wealth and digital finance by allowing anyone to tokenize actual assets such as real estate, gold, and fine art. Here’s how it works: imagine owning a piece of a $5 million Manhattan building with fractional tokens generated by Rexas Finance’s no-code Token Builder rather than paperwork and agents. This transforms illiquid assets into quick, fluid, and marketable digital value. The project’s use cases extend beyond tokenization. The ecosystem also incorporates Rexas Treasury, a multichain yield optimizer that facilitates revenue generation for RXS holders, and a startup incubator, Rexas Launchpad, which allows innovators to raise funds for their ideas. The project has raised $47.6 million as its ongoing presale nears completion (91% done). RXS price has risen from $0.03 to $0.20, a 566% gain. Over 458 million tokens have been traded, and the community has reached over 50,000 active holders , indicating growing investors’ trust. The project’s success can be attributed in large part to its VC-free approach. By refusing venture capital funding, the project removes the potential for big early dumps, which has earned it credibility in a field plagued by early investor sell-offs. Moreover, early placements on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko strengthened RXS’s credibility and increased its visibility to global investors. The project also underwent a Certik audit , reinforcing trust in its strong security system. Strategic tokenomics also contribute to the buzz. RXS employs a deflationary model with automatic buyback and burn mechanics reducing circulating supply over time. This means that the longer you keep the token, the more scarce (potentially valuable) it gets. To sweeten the deal, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway , with the top 20 winners receiving $50,000 in RXS apiece. With over 1.7 million entries received so far, this event increases community interaction and adds gamified incentives to attract small and large investors. It’s more than just hype; it’s purposeful exposure. Regarding the next significant jump, RXS will debut on at least three tier-1 exchanges on June 19, 2025, with a $0.25 listing price. Strongly related liquidity and exchange-backed exposure will likely drive the price higher, with some estimating a 100,000% increase. Simply put, Rexas shows all the indications of being a breakout project. With strong fundamentals, a loaded roadmap, and real-world use cases, a 10x post-listing surge isn’t just possible; it’s looking like a certainty. This places RXS as one of the best ROI crypto assets to acquire right now, particularly for those seeking to go beyond shit coins. Conclusion: meme momentum vs. real utility Shiba Inu may have room to grow, especially if Bitcoin ignites another bull market. But it’s a risky wager, relying mainly on sentiment and short-term behavior. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance presents a different opportunity: tangible usefulness, clever tokenomics, and a thriving community — all before its official offering. With the RXS presale nearing completion, this may be the only opportunity to participate before Rexas Finance launches its next chapter on global exchanges. Don’t wait till the headlines catch up; now is the time to get involved .

Bitcoin’s hashrate crossed the milestone on April 5 at a peak of 1.025 ZH/s, according to mempool.space data, while BTC Frame data said it hit 1.02 ZH/s a day earlier. Data from Coinwarz says that Bitcoin hashrate soared to as high as 1.1 ZH/s on April 4 at block height 890,915 — however, the same data indicates that Bitcoin first crossed 1 ZH/s on March 24. Bitcoin’s hashrate has fallen back below 0.95 ZH/s on April 7 since reaching 1 ZH/s. Source: BTC Frame Discrepancy in Bitcoin hashrate trackers The differences result from the varying approaches used to calculate hashrate — such as when block times and difficulty adjustments are measured, which Bitcoin nodes and miner pools are used to pull data from and more. Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp also previously pointed out that estimating Bitcoin’s hashrate with one “trailing block” as opposed to five can result in a difference of over 0.04 ZH/s. “Viewing the raw Hashrate metric can be deceiving due to random variations in block times,” added Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew, who pointed out that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average hashrate is still around 0.845 ZH/s mark in a note to Cointelegraph. Notching 1 ZH/s is a massive network achievement Despite the discrepancies, the feat highlights the massive amount of computational power and increasing decentralization of the Bitcoin network, making it more secure than ever and significantly reducing the likelihood of a 51% attack. The Bitcoin network’s reported rise to 1 ZH/s — equivalent to 1,000 Exahashes per second — marks a 1,000x increase since late January 2016, when Bitcoin first hit 1 EH/s for the first time. The second-largest proof-of-work crypto network, Litecoin, currently boasts a hashrate of 2.49 Petahashes per second according to Coinwarz — making it around 40,000 times less computationally powerful than Bitcoin. Source: Pierre Rochard Askew noted that the huge rise in hashrate has coincided with more commercial Bitcoin mining firms competing to solve Bitcoin blocks in recent years. “Miners are doubling down: expanding sites and plugging in more efficient machines,” Askew said, adding that less efficient miners could soon be washed out unless Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price rallies again in the coming months. MARA Holdings is the largest Bitcoin miner with more than 50 EH/s of compute power, while the largest share of hashrate is channeled to Bitcoin mining pools Foundry USA Pool and AntPool, according to the Hashrate Index. Related: Bitcoin price drops below $80K as stocks face 1987 Black Monday rerun At least 24 publicly listed Bitcoin companies have machines set up to mine Bitcoin, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com. Among the other large miners contributing hashrate are Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, Hut 8 Mining and TeraWulf. Bitcoin’s hashrate soars as BTC plummets on recession fears The new all-time high in Bitcoin hashrate came in the middle of a sharp market downturn — with Bitcoin ( BTC ) falling nearly 10% over the last four days to $78,750, while US stocks saw an estimated $6.6 trillion loss on April 3 and 4 — the largest two-day loss ever. Much of the fall has been attributed to US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans , which many industry analysts say are sparking recession fears.

This comes as part of an effort to align with Executive Order 14192, which focuses on cutting red tape and making regulations more business-friendly. One of the first targets is the 2019 Framework for Investment Contract Analysis of Digital Assets. This document was based on a 2018 speech by former SEC official Bill Hinman, where he suggested that whether a crypto token is considered a security depends more on how centralized the project is, rather than how it was sold. That idea has been pretty controversial in the crypto world, and it looks like the SEC is ready to reconsider it. Statement from Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda: Pursuant to Executive Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation, together with recommendations from DOGE, I have requested Securities and Exchange Commission staff promptly to review the following staff statements. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) April 5, 2025 Uyeda isn’t just looking at Bill Hinman’s 2018 crypto speech—he’s also reviewing key documents, including: A 2022 guide for crypto companies on market chaos and bankruptcies. A 2021 risk alert about crypto investor threats due to unclear rules. A 2020 memo questioning if banks can legally hold digital assets. A 2021 advisory on mutual funds investing in Bitcoin futures. A 2020 note on COVID-19’s impact on company disclosures. The review aims to roll back some of the stricter rules put in place during Gary Gensler’s time as SEC Chair. Gensler was known for his tough stance on crypto, which many felt was more about blocking innovation than protecting investors. His approach even got called “arbitrary and capricious” by courts more than once. Now, with Uyeda leading the charge and folks like Hester Peirce and Paul Atkins pushing for more transparency, it looks like the SEC is opening up. They’ve been holding crypto roundtables, meeting with industry leaders, and even had a sit-down with BlackRock recently to discuss crypto ETFs and related issues. It’s clear the SEC is starting to clean house, getting rid of outdated rules, and making room for a crypto-friendly future. Investors and crypto enthusiasts are definitely watching closely to see what changes come next.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 03:56:14

The first major resistance is near the $1,710 level. A clear move above the $1,710 resistance might send the price toward the $1,820 resistance. An upside break above the $1,820 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,880 resistance zone or even $1,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,550 level. The first major support sits near the $1,535 zone. A clear move below the $1,535 support might push the price toward the $1,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,400 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,350.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have dropped 6–12% in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations exceeding $900 million. The steep correction has prompted analysts to question Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative and its reliability as a hedge amid growing volatility. Crypto Market Crash: Investors Brace for Bloody Monday On Monday morning in Asian trading hours, crypto market crashed as risk-ON assets faced heavy volatility. Top markets like China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, hit circuit breakers in the early trading hours on Monday, with their indexes crashing 10%, sending the global markets into a situation of absolute turmoil. Bitcoin price is down 6.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at the crucial support of $77,500, with daily trading volumes up by a staggering 220% to more than $44 billion. As per the Coinglass data , BTC’s 24-hour liquidations have surged to $322 million. Based on the Bitcoin technical chart, $77,500 is a crucial support level for BTC. If it fails to hold these levels, further correction could be deeper. Source: Trading View BTC As A Hedge Theory Fails? Although Bitcoin price showed resilience to the Dow Jones crash last week, it is down by 7% today. However, it is still performing better as Asian indices are down 9-10% today. On the other hand, precious metals are up, as gold prices shot up $80 earlier today, and silver has an upward trajectory as well. Following today’s crypto market crash, Peter Schiff took the opportunity to add: “After a delayed reaction on Friday, crypto is finally starting to crack. Ether has already fallen to its lowest level since Oct. 2023, down 65% from its peak, and Bitcoin just traded below 81K, taking out last week’s low. It could be a long day for those trapped in Bitcoin ETFs”. As Donald Trump’s tariff war increases odds of US recession , debates over Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status have picked up once again. Long-term players still continue to remain bullish about BTC despite this volatility. Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise Investments, noted: “As nations trust each other less. As corporations have more difficulty doing business. A global, digital, apolitical store of value — controlled by no nation — looks increasingly differentiated. Bitcoin’s place in the world has never been more valuable”. Altcoins Crash – ETH, SOL, DOGE Lose Crucial Support Levels The altcoins market correction has extended further with Ethereum (ETH) price crashing 13.5% at press time and plummeting to $1,550. As a result, the world’s largest acltoin has extended its 2025 losses to more than 53% while leaving investors in a complete state of shock. Investors believe that ETH price crash today leaves the gates open for the $1,100-$1,300 range. However, on-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that whales are buying the ETH price dips.

While investor enthusiasm for celebrity-backed tokens and meme assets appears to be cooling, data suggests that experienced traders are still selectively engaging with short-term opportunities, even as broader market sentiment becomes more risk-averse. Conor McGregor’s REAL Token Flops as Auction Falls Short: All Investors to Receive Full Refund In a dramatic reversal for what was billed as a “game-changing” crypto project backed by former UFC champion and current Irish political candidate Conor McGregor, the REAL (REAL) token has failed to meet its minimum fundraising goal — triggering a full refund for all investors who participated in the auction. The token sale, conducted by blockchain gaming firm Real World Gaming (RWG), raised just $392,315 in USDC over a 28-hour sealed-bid auction held on April 5 and 6 — falling well short of its $1 million minimum requirement and achieving only around 11% of its ambitious $3.6 million target. Only 668 participants joined the highly anticipated sale, despite the campaign's high-profile celebrity backing and aggressive promotional push. “We need to be real. We didn’t hit our minimum raise,” RWG admitted in a candid post on X on April 6. “All bids will be refunded in full.” Despite the setback, RWG remained optimistic about the future of the project: “This is not the end,” the team asserted in the same post. The REAL token was touted by McGregor as a departure from the wave of low-effort celebrity tokens that have plagued the crypto industry in recent years. McGregor promised that the token wasn’t “some celebrity-endorsed bullshit” and that it would bring meaningful improvements to the crypto ecosystem and the real world alike. Backed by McGregor’s persona and branding, the public sale offered 60 million REAL tokens — 3% of the total 2 billion token supply — at a starting bid of $0.06 each. At full subscription, the token was expected to command a fully diluted valuation of $120 million. But the numbers never added up. Despite the fanfare, the sale lacked traction. It’s unclear whether the failure was due to a lack of investor confidence, poor timing, or broader market forces — likely a combination of all three. The REAL token launched into a turbulent market backdrop. Bitcoin, the bellwether of the crypto sector, saw a steep drop amid a wider financial rout, falling alongside US equities, which collectively lost an estimated $6.6 trillion over April 3 and 4 — the worst two-day performance in US stock market history. Driving the downturn were mounting fears of a global recession as President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping new tariff proposals. The shockwaves rippled through all risk-on markets, including crypto, just as the REAL auction went live. Adding further headwinds was the fading hype around meme coins, which had surged through late 2024 and early 2025 following the explosive launch of the Official Trump token. But the trend has cooled considerably in recent weeks, especially after the LIBRA token scandal tied to Argentine President Javier Milei sent shockwaves through both political and financial spheres. A Cautionary Tale in a Year of Celebrity Crypto Chaos The failure of the REAL token raises fresh questions about the sustainability of celebrity-backed crypto projects — even those pitched with supposedly greater substance. While McGregor attempted to distance his offering from other celebrity token failures, the outcome mirrors a broader pattern seen throughout 2024 and into 2025. Projects like LIBRA and other influencer-endorsed tokens have often sparked brief hype before collapsing or becoming entangled in controversy, eroding trust in an already skeptical segment of the market. The sealed-bid format, while innovative, may have also discouraged participation among retail investors unfamiliar with auction-based sales, further dampening momentum. For now, RWG is promising a comeback. “This is not the end,” the team reiterated — but how, when, and in what form a revised version of the REAL project may emerge remains to be seen. As for McGregor, the outcome may complicate his ambitions to be seen as a serious force in the crypto space, even as he pursues political aspirations in Ireland. Whether the REAL token was just another failed experiment or a misfired launch with potential for redemption will depend on how the team — and the market — regroup in the months ahead. Smart Money Still Eyes Meme Coins Despite Signs of Fading Supercycle Meanwhile, despite mounting evidence that the explosive meme coin “supercycle” may be nearing its end, some of the cryptocurrency industry’s most successful traders continue to chase quick returns in the high-risk, high-reward world of meme coins. Even as market sentiment turns cautious, blockchain intelligence data from Nansen suggests that the allure of fast profits remains too strong for top-performing wallets — known as “smart money” — to resist. This ongoing interest comes amid a sharp cooldown in meme coin hype following a wave of disappointing token launches, including several tied to US President Trump. While trading volumes and prices have dipped significantly, opportunistic traders continue to deploy capital in speculative plays, albeit with increased risk management. Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, explained during a recent livestream on X that smart money wallets remain active in the meme coin sector, even if their behavior has become more nimble and reactive. He added that the recent frenzy around meme tokens was treated more like a short-term play while the broader crypto market takes time to find its footing. “The recent meme frenzy was just a fun play they worked on, while the broader market is sorting out the direction because meme coins aren’t necessarily affected by the same macroeconomy as Bitcoin and Ethereum,” he said. That detachment from macroeconomic narratives has long made meme coins a unique playground for speculative traders, but cracks in sentiment have begun to show. Even with fading enthusiasm, meme coins are still producing jaw-dropping returns — for now. One trader turned an initial $2,000 investment into a mind-bending $43 million using Pepe (PEPE), one of the most iconic meme coins in circulation. Although the trader didn’t manage to exit at the peak — with PEPE falling over 70% from its all-time high — they still secured a realized profit exceeding $10 million. The success illustrates how, even in a declining market, early entrants and savvy exits can yield massive gains. However, it also shows the volatility and unsustainability of such rallies, which often collapse before retail traders can capitalize. A major inflection point for the meme coin market appears to have been the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token on Jan. 18. The token — which saw an initial surge to $75.35 — has since plummeted over 87%, now trading closer to $9, with an 8% drop recorded in just the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. The Trump meme coin was intended to symbolize a new level of institutionalized meme speculation, coinciding with Trump’s political resurgence. But it may have had the opposite effect, triggering what some are calling the end of the meme coin “supercycle.” Pump.fun, the Solana-based launchpad that powered much of the recent meme coin boom, saw a peak in user activity around the week of Trump’s inauguration. According to Binance Research , the platform was responsible for over 70% of newly launched tokens during the height of the frenzy. But since that peak, active wallets have nearly halved — dropping from 2.85 million in the week of Jan. 20 to 1.44 million by the end of March. A Supercycle in Decline What was once a $100 billion market for meme coins has deflated dramatically. The sector has dropped below $44 billion in total market cap. The collapse has been fueled not only by disillusionment over Trump-linked tokens, but also by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. The US economy has been rocked by historic volatility, with a record-setting $5 trillion wiped from global equities in early April amid fears over Trump’s aggressive tariff plans. Such turbulence has driven investors to favor more conservative assets like stablecoins, with on-chain data showing a growing shift into USDC and other fiat-backed tokens. Still, the speculative appetite that fuels the meme coin world hasn’t disappeared entirely — it's merely become more agile, more selective, and more wary. While many analysts believe the meme coin supercycle has likely peaked, the nature of crypto markets makes it dangerous to write off the asset class completely. Historically, meme coins have shown a remarkable ability to return from the dead — often sparked by unexpected cultural moments, viral influencers, or new launch mechanisms. For now, the smartest players in the game are still participating — but with faster fingers on the exit button.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 05:00:00

The decline occurred days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced massive new import tariffs, which sparked concerns about a new trade war and a slowdown in the world economy. The crypto market initially showed some resilience last week, with traders speculating that Bitcoin might act as a “safe haven” as tech stocks slumped. But by Sunday night on Apr. 6, that narrative had flipped. As U.S. stock futures opened in early Asia hours, markets turned red. The Nasdaq 100 contracts fell 5% and both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones futures each dropped more than 4%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 sank 6%, Australia’s ASX 200 fell 5%, and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 4.4%, as per Yahoo Finance data . Bitcoin followed, crashing alongside the stock markets. According to Coinglass data , nearly $778 million in long crypto positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours, marking the largest wipeout in nearly six weeks. Other major crypto assets also suffered, with Solana ( SOL ) plunging to as low as $107 and Ethereun ( ETH ) falling to $1,538, its lowest since October 2023.

Financial markets have been alarmed by the aggressive move, and investors are preparing for prolonged economic instability. As the markets reeled, “Black Monday” began trending on X, with users referencing the infamous 1987 crash when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 22.6% in a single day, the largest one-day percentage drop in U.S. stock market history. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, in an Apr. 7 post on X, warned of an “economic nuclear winter” if Trump’s policies continue. “We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world,” he posted. The country is 100% behind the president on fixing a global system of tariffs that has disadvantaged the country. But, business is a confidence game and confidence depends on trust. President @realDonaldTrump has elevated the tariff issue to the most important geopolitical… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) April 6, 2025 Sentiment has also soured in crypto circles. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid 11 points to 23, reflecting “extreme fear.” Still, not everyone is bearish. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes suggested in an Apr. 4 post on X that the turmoil could eventually drive more investors to Bitcoin as a hedge against centralized policies. Whether that breakout comes soon or not, Bitcoin’s resilience will be tested in the days ahead.

The futures contract due to expire on the last Friday of April began trading at $79,590, down 5.6% from Friday's close of $84,250 and quickly descended to $76,800, CoinDesk data show. The losses came as Dow futures fell 900 points, Chinese stocks crashed, and the Japanese equity market slipped into lower circuit breakers as JPMorgan, S&P Global, and Goldman Sachs increased the probability of the U.S. falling into recession this year. On Sunday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he wanted to solve the trade deficit with China ""and unless we solve that problem, I'm not going to make a deal."" Trump added that world leaders are dying to make a deal. Last week, the President announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations, boosting the total levy on China to 54%. Since then, financial markets have wilted, which the President thinks is the necessary medicine to solve the problem. ""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said. Open interest slides on CME Open interest in the CME futures peaked in December at 281.57 BTC and has since declined to 140.5K, the lowest since August 2024, according to data source Coinglass . It's a sign of money leaving the digital assets space, perhaps in anticipation of a deeper price swoon. Meanwhile, global futures and perpetual futures open interest, excluding CME, has increased from roughly 400K BTC to 520 BTC in the past four weeks. An increase in open interest alongside a price drop is said to confirm the bearish trend, indicating that traders are building short positions in a falling market.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|CME,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 05:03:56

The $REAL token, developed by the Real World Gaming DAO (RWG), raised $392,315 in USDC over a 28-hour sealed-bid auction—less than 40% of its $1.008 million minimum raise and just over 10% of the $3.6 million fundraising goal. As per RWG’s announcement, 668 participants took part in the auction. We need to be real. We didn't hit our minimum raise. All bids will be refunded in full. This is not the end. — Real World Gaming (@getrealtoken) April 6, 2025 Developers Promise Full Refund The presale aimed to distribute 60 million $REAL tokens—3% of the total 2 billion supply—at a starting bid price of $0.06, valuing the project at a fully diluted $120 million. With the minimum threshold unmet, RWG confirmed all bids would be refunded. The token received notable backing from Conor McGregor , who promoted it to his combined following of nearly 57 million across X and Instagram. The project also claimed support from major Web3 firms including Animoca Brands and KuCoin Labs. Timing of Meme Coin Launch Coincides With Broader Market Meltdown Despite this backing, the launch occurred during a volatile market phase . The broader crypto sector faced sharp declines last week, with Bitcoin and U.S. equities both posting losses. Concurrently, meme coin activity continued to taper off after a series of high-profile controversies and fading investor interest. The $REAL project positioned itself as a utility token tied to RWG’s gaming and entertainment initiatives, with developers promising integration into McGregor’s personal brand ecosystem. However, skepticism from parts of the crypto community—especially online analysts—appeared to contribute to dampened enthusiasm. RWG said in a public statement that the effort is ongoing and that the failed presale does not mark the end of the project’s ambitions. Further plans or a revised strategy have not yet been announced.

According to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, customers affected by the latest development are those who failed to commence their know-your-customer (KYC) verification process by the deadline, which passed a month ago. FTX Expunges Customer Claims The bankruptcy estate said it is disallowing and expunging claims belonging to users who did not start their KYC by March 3. The KYC commencing deadline was initially fixed for March 1 but eventually extended to March 3. Although the value of the unverified claims was initially estimated to be around $1 billion, FTX creditor activist Sunil Kavuri has disclosed a higher worth. He said claims less than $50,000 amount to $655 million, while those above $50,000 are up to $1.9 billion. The total number of customers affected by the expungement is above 392,000, and FTX filed their details in a document spanning 2,377 pages. While claims for users who have failed to start their KYC procedures have been disallowed, more customers are bound to face the same fate if they do not complete their identity verification processes by June 1. The bankruptcy estate insists that customers must submit the necessary KYC documents before receiving their claims. “Claims listed on Schedule 1 to the Order but not included on Exhibit A attached hereto may still be subject to disallowance if the holder of any such claim does not submit all KYC information requested by the FTX Recovery Trust or its KYC vendors on or prior to June 1, 2025, at 4:00 p.m. (ET),” the estate stated in the filing. Bankruptcy Estate Insists on Account Verification FTX’s customer repayments have been ongoing since January 3, 2025, with the estate intending to distribute between $12.6 billion and about $16.5 billion to users. As approved by the court, FTX customers are receiving cash based on the value of their crypto holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022. The entity’s interim CEO, John Ray, insisted that customer accounts need to be verified during the repayment process because the company’s former leadership did not conduct due diligence on users and failed to collect information about the source of funds.

The wider Asia stock market recorded palpable losses as more investors fled the highly volatile global equity market towards bonds and gold markets. For instance, the Shanghai Composite index had dropped around 6.34 percent to trade about 3,130.17 on Monday during the early Asian trading session. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was heavily impacted by the ongoing stock market rout. At the time of this writing, the HSI had dropped around 10.70 percent to trade about 20,404. Expected Impact on Western Financial Markets After China retaliated against the U.S. tariff trade last week, the European Union is expected to announce its reciprocal tariffs this week. Although some nations have opted to negotiate with the United States, major economies are likely to follow in the footsteps of Beijing in the coming days. Consequently, the U.S. stock market is expected to take more hits later today, especially on major indexes led by the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq. “Big Wall Street trading desks will be manned in time for tonight’s futures open.

Over $800M Liquidated appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Markets crashed on Monday after President Trump announced major new tariffs. China hit back quickly, slapping 34% duties on all U.S. imports starting April 10. The rising tension has investors worried about a full-blown trade war. The sudden drop comes just a day after reports claimed Bitcoin was breaking away from the S&P 500 and acting more like a safe haven asset. Bitcoin has taken a sharp dive plunging over 10% to below $78,000 after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs. This comes despite his pro-crypto stance, including appointing supportive regulators and backing digital assets. But economic uncertainty is taking a toll on investor confidence, and many are now rethinking their positions as tariffs start to weigh heavily on the crypto market. In a massive market bloodbath, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have plunged 6–12% today. With over $900 million in liquidations, analysts are beginning to question Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” and a safe haven asset. Bitcoin Down Over 6% Bitcoin is down 6.9% in the past 24 hours, now hovering at a key support level of $77,500. Trading volume has skyrocketed 220%, topping $44 billion, while BTC’s 24 hour liquidations have hit $322 million, according to Coinglass . With $77,500 acting as a crucial support on the charts, analysts warn that if BTC breaks below this level, a deeper correction could be on the way. Altcoins Hit Hard, ETH Crashes 13%! Altcoins are taking a big hit. Ethereum (ETH) has crashed 13.5% to $1,550, now down over 53% this year. Investors fear it could drop to $1,100–$1,300, though whale activity shows some are buying the dip. XRP is down 14.5%, falling below $2, with a possible slide to $0.65. Solana has dropped 14% to $102, and Dogecoin is down 16% to $0.143, as the altcoin market faces heavy losses. Is The Bull Run Over? Recently, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shared in an X post that the bull run is likely over, based on on-chain data. He points to a rising Realized Cap and flat market cap as signs that bears are in control. Ju believes this downtrend could last up to six months, lowering hopes for a quick recovery Despite the price swings, many long-term investors are staying confident.

The sell-off is not localized to cryptocurrencies but also across the global stock markets, triggering cricuit breakers in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Russel Futures and even in Singapore. What’s next for Ethereum (ETH) price prediction? Should you buy the dip? Ethereum Price Suffers Amid Stock & Crypto Market Collapse In the early Asian session, Bitcoin price slipped below $80K, Ethereum price hit $1,520 as the stock and crypto markets plummeted in reaction to Trump’s tariffs. As a result of this steep sell-off, the authorities triggered circuit breakers, aka halting trading when markets fall rapidly. Cricuit breakers were triggered in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Singapore and in Russel Futures. S&P 500 circuit breakers are market-wide trading halts triggered at three levels – a 7% drop pauses trading for 15 minutes, a 13% drop halts for another 15 minutes, and a 20% drop stops trading for the day. But there are no circuit breakers in the cryptocurrency markets , which often leads to massive selloff especially if the leverage in the market is high. As seen, ETH’s value has crashed nearly 20% in the past 21 hours and currently trades at $1,520. Is this a good place to buy ETH? Let’s explore Ethereum price predictions and key levels to watch. Ethereum Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch The weekly chart for Ethereum price shows that ETH is close to a key support level at $1,504. This is the midpoint of the $1,073 to $1,934 range created between July 2022 & October 2023. The next critical support level is the orderblock at $1,278 formed in mid-December 2022. This demand zone was followed by a 77% rally in under four months. Hence, a revisit of this level could see a strong buying pressure that could absorb the selling pressure. If the above two key levels fail to support ETH price, then the range low at $1,073 will be the final line of defense. Ethereum price prediction remains bearish so long as any of these levels absorb selling pressure and allow ETH bulls to form a base. ETH/USDT 1-week chart If Trump’s tariffs do not stop, then a selling frenzy could make all of the aforementioned support levels meaningless. However, there is one hope for cryptocurrency as Bitcoin is as an uncorrelated asset . If demand flows into BTC amid times of uncertainty, it could fuel Ethereum price recovery rally as well.

Among the growing list of under-$1 tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a favorite among traders who are looking for more than just speculation. Backed by real use cases, a clear utility model, and innovative token mechanics, many now consider MUTM one of the most promising DeFi projects entering the market in 2025. So what exactly is setting Mutuum Finance apart—and why are investors positioning themselves early? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the heart of Mutuum’s protocol is a dual lending structure that includes both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Each one serves a different purpose but contributes to the protocol’s overall flexibility and reach. In the P2C structure, users contribute their assets to collective liquidity pools. These funds are then made available to borrowers who meet overcollateralization standards. Interest rates adjust based on the pool’s utilization, meaning earnings and borrowing costs are directly influenced by market demand. This system supports more established cryptocurrencies like ETH, USDC, or DAI and offers a lower-friction experience for those seeking predictable lending outcomes. But it’s in the P2P model where Mutuum really opens things up. Here, lenders and borrowers negotiate terms directly. It’s ideal for supplying or borrowing more speculative assets, such as SHIB or PEPE, which wouldn’t typically be supported in traditional pooled lending. This approach not only diversifies the available assets on the platform but also unlocks opportunities for memecoin holders to put their tokens to work—without relying on centralized exchanges. Another unique aspect of the Mutuum ecosystem is the development of its own overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar and built on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin will be minted when users lock up excess collateral within the lending protocol, giving them access to on-chain liquidity without liquidating their core holdings. Unlike many other stablecoin models that depend on external reserves or custodians, Mutuum’s version is entirely decentralized. The stablecoin supply adjusts automatically: it is minted during borrowing and burned upon repayment or liquidation. This mechanism keeps the peg stable while ensuring that all tokens in circulation are backed by assets already secured on-chain. Interest generated from stablecoin loans flows directly into the protocol’s treasury rather than individual lenders, supporting the overall financial strength of the platform and enabling future reinvestment strategies that benefit long-term holders. Why Traders Are Buying MUTM at $0.025 The token powering this entire system, MUTM, is still priced at just $0.025—making it an early-stage opportunity with high growth potential. The presale has already attracted thousands of participants, with over 7,800 holders and more than $6.1 million raised. As the price is set to increase in the next presale phase, those getting in now are securing the most favorable entry point before the protocol goes live. Beyond the price, the tokenomics are designed with sustainability in mind. A portion of protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to users who actively participate, such as mtToken stakers. This creates a self-sustaining cycle where usage drives value, and value incentivizes further usage. Unlike many tokens that struggle to define their purpose, MUTM is tied to a functioning, evolving platform that serves a growing demand: decentralized access to crypto credit and yield. Its P2C and P2P options offer users flexibility depending on their asset types and risk profiles, while the stablecoin provides a native way to tap liquidity without introducing new layers of complexity. This blend of usability, flexibility, and community-led growth is why traders are taking notice—and why MUTM is being viewed as one of the best investments under $1 right now. As DeFi adoption expands and the platform gears up for its beta launch, the momentum is clearly building in Mutuum’s favor. For those looking to get ahead of the next wave, this may be the time to pay close attention.

This came after the US announced sweeping tariffs last week, prompting retaliation from major economies and raising concerns about a potential global trade conflict that could hinder economic growth. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) retreated below 78,000, mirroring the broader market selloff that has shaken investor confidence. Gold dropped more than 1% to below $3000 in the early Monday session in Asia as investors offloaded bullion to offset losses from a broader market downturn triggered by escalating trade tensions and growing fears of a global recession. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 6.74% to below 30,000 on Monday, hitting its lowest levels since October 2023. The Japanese yen strengthened to around 145 per dollar on Monday before retreating toward 147, remaining volatile as the market turmoil triggered by an escalating global trade war intensified. Domestically, Japan saw accelerated nominal wage growth in February rose 3.1% year-on-year, offering a positive outlook for the economy, which is under pressure from global trade uncertainties. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to visit the U.S. soon to present a trade proposal and urge President Trump to reconsider a 24% tariff on Japanese imports. Japan’s foreign reserves increased by $19.23 billion to $1.27 trillion in March 2025, hitting the highest level since April last year. Japan's index of coincident economic indicators, which tracks factory output, employment, and retail sales, increased to 116.9 in February 2025 from a final 116.1 in the previous month, flash data showed. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 6.56%,to below 3,200 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 7.3% to 9,610 in post-holiday trade on Monday, with mainland stocks tracking the global selloff as the trade war intensified, and the offshore yuan depreciated around 7.32 per dollar, hitting its lowest level in two months. Markets are bracing for deeper trade disruptions, especially after China announced a 34% tariff on all US imports starting April 10, alongside export controls on rare earths. Additionally, Beijing added 16 American firms to its export control list and labeled 11 more as ""unreliable entities."" Trump quickly denounced the response, calling it the “wrong” move. Furthermore, China indicated it might lower borrowing costs and reserve requirements for lenders to mitigate the economic effects of U.S. tariffs, with potential cuts to key policy rates and fiscal expansion. China’s foreign exchange reserves rose by USD 13.4 billion to USD 3.241 trillion in March 2025, up from USD 3.227 trillion in February, marking the highest level since last November. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 10.91%, to 20,710 in early trading on Monday, marking a second session of steep losses and hitting their lowest in two months. The selloff reflected widespread panic across sectors, as investors fled riskier assets amid an escalating global trade war and growing fears of a recession. India ( SENSEX ) fell 4.05% to 72,535 in early deals on Monday, falling for the third straight session and weighed down by all sectors. Traders braced for the imposition of a 26% reciprocal tariff on India, set to take effect on April 9. India is unlikely to immediately retaliate against President Trump’s recent 26% tariff on US imports from India and is instead focusing on negotiating a bilateral trade deal to lower duties, Reuters said, quoting a government official. However, the RBI is expected to cut the interest rate by 25 bps to 6% at Wednesday's meeting. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 4.19% hitting the lowest level since December 2023, extending losses for the third session. The Australian dollar fell to around $0.60 on Monday, its lowest level since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red , markets were shaken by trade war fears, and U.S. stocks deepened their sell-off on Friday, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the economic impact could exceed expectations U.S. stock futures tumbled sharply on Monday, with the White House showing no signs of backing down, even after a two-day rout on Wall Street triggered by President Trump’s sweeping tariffs on major trading partners: Dow -2.88%; S&P 500 -3.58%; Nasdaq -4.51%.

The downturn sparked panic among investors, pushing the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index into “extreme fear” territory. Analysts are now watching closely, with mixed views on whether the market will see a deeper crash or begin to stabilize. The current sentiment reflects high uncertainty and caution amid growing macroeconomic concerns. April 7, 2025 06:10:07 UTC Global Markets Plunge as Trump’s Tariffs Trigger Chaos Global stock markets tumbled sharply following President Donald Trump’s new tariff measures. China’s stock market opened with a 10% drop, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 futures hit circuit breakers, halting trading. Trump defended the tariffs, claiming they generate revenue for the U.S. and help fix trade imbalances with China and the EU. Despite the market fallout, the President signaled he’s willing to accept short-term volatility to push his broader economic strategy forward. April 7, 2025 06:10:07 UTC Trump Tariff Announcement Triggers Market Panic Crypto analyst Lark Davis commented on the sudden market crash, calling Trump’s tariff board reveal a “Black Swan” event. Last week, markets briefly reacted positively, thinking tariffs would be limited to 10%. However, once Trump displayed much higher numbers, panic set in. Davis noted that this unexpected move shocked investors and led to a sharp selloff. He added that the focus now shifts to finding a new market bottom after this surprise trigger. April 7, 2025 06:03:21 UTC Crypto Liquidations Top $1B as Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $77K In the past 24 hours, the crypto market witnessed a brutal shakeout with over $1 billion in liquidations, including $865 million from long positions. Bitcoin led the crash, plunging sharply from above $83,000 to under $77,000. The sudden drop triggered mass liquidations, impacting over 323,000 traders. Rising global trade tensions and bearish technical setups have amplified market fears, signaling more downside ahead for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the coming days. April 7, 2025 05:54:59 UTC Why Ethereum is Going Down? An Ether whale lost 67,570 ETH (around $106M) after being liquidated on the DeFi platform Sky, formerly Maker, due to a 14% ETH price crash. The investor’s collateral ratio dropped below the required 150% to 144%, triggering liquidation. Another whale is close to liquidation after borrowing DAI against 56,995 WETH. ETH has fallen to $1,547, its lowest since October 2023. Over 320,000 traders were liquidated in 24 hours, totaling nearly $1B, mainly from ETH positions. April 7, 2025 05:44:49 UTC Nikkei 225 Crashes Over 2,000 Points, Hits 18-Month Low ​On April 7, 2025, Japan’s financial markets experienced significant turmoil. The Nikkei 225 index plummeted by over 2,000 points, dropping below the 32,000 mark—a decline of approximately 6.67%—reaching an 18-month low of 31,527.49. This sharp downturn triggered the Osaka Stock Exchange’s circuit breaker mechanism, resulting in a temporary suspension of Nikkei 225 and Topix futures trading due to excessive volatility. April 7, 2025 05:14:00 UTC Why is Crypto Crashing Today? ​On April 7, 2025, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn following the Trump administration’s announcement of new global tariffs, which heightened investor concerns about a potential global recession. Bitcoin dropped below $80,000, reaching approximately $79,000—a 5% decline over 24 hours—while Ethereum fell 11% to around $1,590. This sell-off led to over $745 million in bullish crypto positions being liquidated within a day. ​ April 7, 2025 05:14:00 UTC Bitcoin Price USD Dips After Trump’s Tariff Stance Shakes Crypto Market Bitcoin price USD dropped sharply in the last 24 hours as the crypto market reacted to US President Trump’s continued push for restrictive tariffs. Just weeks after a major rally driven by Trump’s new strategic reserve plan, the market reversed, wiping out over half a trillion dollars in value. This sharp decline triggered massive liquidations, with Bitcoin alone facing $250 million in long positions wiped out, according to CoinGlass data.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 05:24:39

The investment management giant bought over 83,157 shares of Coinbase, taking Coinbase’s closing price on Friday. According to the company’s latest disclosures, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) purchased 54,988 shares worth $8.8 million. Two other ETFs – the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) – have acquired 15,982 shares for $2.5 million and 12,187 shares for $2 million respectively. Here’s what moves Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made today 4/4 pic.twitter.com/HsS3Hlopbj — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) April 5, 2025 Ark Invest ‘Buy the Dip’ Investment Strategy The significant purchase comes at a time when crypto markets are witnessing a sharp plunge, as global markets reel from President Trump’s sweeping new tariff policies. Bitcoin is holding precariously above the $77,000 mark after experiencing a sharp 6% slump in 24 hours, per Coinmarketcap data. Further, Ark Invest also bought 54,120 shares of Amzon.com (AMZN) worth $9 million on Friday. Cathie Wood’s last two Amazon purchases were made in February when the company’s stock fell from an all-time high following a disappointing outlook. Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward. The Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech firms in fields including blockchain, tech and AI. Coinbase is “Second Largest Holdings” Within ARKF Fund Last month, Ark Invest scooped up $11.5 million in Coinbase shares at the time when COINn plunged more than 17%. The company seized the opportunity to buy the dip in COIN, acquiring 64,358 shares across two of its ETFs. Ark has been continuously accumulating Coinbase stock, with $8.7 million for its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) in February. Besides, Ark Invest restricts any single holding to no more than 10% of a fund’s portfolio. Further, within the ARKF fund, COIN is now the second-largest holding, comprising 9.4% of the fund. The fund’s top holding is Shopify, comprising 13% of the fund.

The markets recorded a consecutive 10% drop on the second day, reflecting a historic rarity that has occurred only four times in history: October 1987, October 2008, March 2020, and now in April 2025. It is important to note that all of the previous events led to significant stock market crashes, such as the ‘Black Friday’ in 1987, the 2008 housing bubble, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. These led to a major drop, which kept the markets consolidated for a long time. Now the question arises whether the 2025-Tariff war may have a similar impact on the global stock markets and the crypto markets. Crypto Market No More Decentralised Ever since the entry of the institutions, the crypto market has become more centralized, with a large chunk of BTC being held by major 4 to 5 companies. Microstatergy had begun to accumulate after the March 2020 crash in September 2020 that triggered the 2021 bull run. Since then, the company has been accumulating aggressively and now holds over 500,000 BTC, 2.25% of the total supply. Besides, a similar amount of BTC is being held by Blackrock’s (IBIT) shares, which could be a matter of concern. Previously, the crypto markets gained strength while the stock markets faced some turbulence. However, the growing correlation between the markets suggests that more dreadful days are on the horizon as the stock markets are predicted to face another 15% to 20% plunge in the coming days. What’s Next for Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Rally? After losing the pivotal support at $81,017, the Bitcoin price continued to drop, hinting at testing the support at $76,763. Meanwhile, the bulls triggered a rebound at $76,666, but the possibility of an extended bearish trend persists. The price has entered a ‘Do or Die’ range, which may confirm whether the ongoing pullback is a healthy correction or the beginning of a bear market. The historical chart of Bitcoin suggests the price is in real danger. The current global markets have left no room for a rebound, and hence, the lower targets have been activated. The weekly Ichimoku Cloud is heading for a bearish crossover, while the weekly RSI dropped below 45 for the first time since the rise in early 2023. Interestingly, the RSI plunged to the lower threshold only in times of a bear market, back in 2018, 2020 and 2022. If the levels fail to hold at 40, then the RSI is feared to reach 30, which may drag the BTC price below $70,000. Hence, the current market sentiments are extremely fearful and hence, holding can be the perfect strategy one can apply instead of panic selling. However, once the conditions improve, the Bitcoin (BTC) price will rebound and rise.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 05:31:27

Uyeda has instructed the agency’s staff to review a series of past statements regarding cryptocurrency risks and the application of securities laws to digital assets. The review is being conducted under Executive Order 14192, titled “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,” and follows recommendations from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The aim, Uyeda said, is to determine whether current guidance should be “modified or rescinded” to better align with the agency’s current regulatory priorities. Among the key documents under review is a 2019 staff framework outlining how the SEC applies the Howey test to determine whether a digital asset qualifies as a security. The Howey test, a decades-old legal standard, evaluates whether an investment involves an expectation of profit based primarily on the efforts of others. The SEC’s application of this test to digital assets has long been controversial, particularly amid recent revelations that memecoins are largely exempt from securities regulations. Related News: What Will Happen If Tether (USDT) Is Delisted in the US? CEO Announces Emergency Plan Another important document that is being reevaluated is a 2021 SEC staff memorandum warning investors about mutual funds with exposure to Bitcoin futures. The letter had previously raised doubts about the maturity of the Bitcoin futures market, citing risks such as market manipulation, liquidity concerns, and volatility. However, since then, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have launched and grown rapidly, with assets under management reaching tens of billions of dollars. Uyeda’s directive also takes aim at end-2022 guidance issued in the wake of several major crypto bankruptcies that advised companies to disclose risks associated with digital assets, particularly those related to custody, liquidity, reputational damage and increased regulatory scrutiny. *This is not investment advice.

This sudden downturn has triggered panic among investors, driven largely by renewed macroeconomic concerns. Fresh trade tensions following aggressive tariff announcements from President Donald Trump, coupled with unexpected geopolitical developments, have rattled both traditional and crypto markets alike. What’s Next For ETH Price? Currently, Ethereum is approaching a critical support zone that has previously held strong, particularly around the $1,520 to $1,540 range. This level was important in early and late 2023 and is now under pressure. If ETH fails to hold above this zone, the next major downside target would be around $1,400. The situation took a turn for the worse after ETH broke below the $1,870 to $1,880 range, a key Fibonacci level that previously provided support. This breach signaled a bearish trend, with analysts predicting a move toward the $1,520–$1,540 region, which is now playing out as expected. The RSI has now entered oversold territory, which, while indicating potential for a short-term bounce, doesn’t guarantee a market bottom. For instance, in March, despite the RSI being oversold, ETH experienced a brief recovery before facing further declines. Whales Offload ETH In line with the market’s downturn, an Ethereum whale faced a staggering $106 million liquidation on Maker over the weekend, involving 67,570 ETH.

The reports come a day after Trump said he won't make a trade deal with China unless the trade deficit is solved.

The Ether ( ETH ) whale lost 67,570 ETH worth around $106 million when the asset crashed by around 14% on April 6, liquidating his collateralized debt position on Sky, according to Maker Vaults explorer DeFi Explore, and as observed by Lookonchain. The Sky lending protocol, which rebranded from Maker in August, is used by DeFi participants to create collateralized debt positions by providing crypto, ETH in this case, to borrow the platform’s stablecoin, DAI ( DAI ). The system uses an overcollateralization ratio, typically 150% or higher, meaning that users need to deposit at least $150 worth of ETH to borrow 100 DAI. The protocol autonomously monitors the value of ETH collateral relative to the borrowed DAI, and if the ETH value falls and the collateral ratio drops below the minimum requirement, the position becomes eligible for liquidation. This whale’s liquidation occurred when the ratio fell to 144% as the price of ETH plummeted. ETH whale liquidations. Source: DeFi Explore Meanwhile, Spot On Chain reported that another whale that supplied 56,995 wrapped ETH, worth around $91 million, to borrow DAI was on the verge of liquidation. In a liquidation event, Sky seizes the ETH collateral, which is auctioned off to pay back the borrowed DAI plus fees. Any remaining collateral after the debt is paid is returned to the user. Ethereum price at bear market lows ETH prices have crashed a whopping 14.5% over the past 24 hours, falling to $1,547 at the time of writing as the wider crypto market melts down in reaction to US President Donald Trump’s tariff-induced market sell-off . The last time ETH traded this low was in October 2023, when crypto was still deep in bear market territory, almost a year after the collapse of the FTX exchange. ETH remains down 68% from its all-time high in 2021, and further losses are likely to see more DeFi users liquidated unless they can provide more collateral.

This move attracted a lot of criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who warned it weakens consumer protections. Meanwhile, controversy also surrounds the SEC’s new stablecoin guidelines, which exempt certain stablecoins from securities regulations. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw criticized the guidance as misleading, but many people in the crypto industry still welcomed it as a step toward clarity. Additionally, others in the industry increasingly consider stablecoins as a strategic asset to boost US dollar dominance globally. Trump Administration Sidelines CFPB The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is expected to play a reduced role in crypto regulation as federal and state-level agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) take on more responsibility. This is according to Ethan Ostroff, a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke law firm. Ostroff explained in an interview that under the current Trump administration, regulatory dynamics are shifting. This means that the CFPB will likely scale back its involvement in crypto oversight in favor of these other authorities. Although the CFPB may see diminished influence, it will not be completely dismantled due to statutory obligations that can only be altered by Congress. Ostroff also explained that while state regulators have the authority under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) to assume some roles typically held by the CFPB, certain responsibilities will remain with the bureau by law. This changing regulatory landscape reflects the administrative agenda under the Trump administration, which includes efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut government spending and reduce federal debt. As part of this initiative, newly appointed CFPB head Russell Vought quickly introduced major funding cuts and scaled back the agency’s operations upon taking office in February of 2025. The scaling down of the CFPB sparked a lot of political backlash. Most of this backlash came from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who co-founded the agency in 2007. Warren criticized Elon Musk, and accused him of enabling the dismantling of the bureau. In a recent interview with Mother Jones, Warren compared Musk to a ”bank robber” and warned that the administration's actions are made to weaken consumer protection measures and centralize control over the financial system. She also believes that despite these efforts, the executive branch does not actually have the authority to fully eliminate the CFPB without Congressional approval. SEC Divides Opinions with New Stablecoin Rules SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw also recently voiced strong opposition to the agency’s newly released guidelines on stablecoins, and even accused the regulator of downplaying systemic risks and misrepresenting the true nature of the USD-stablecoin market. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a real-world asset, usually a fiat currency like the US dollar. Stablecoins aim to combine the price stability of traditional money with the speed and flexibility of digital assets. This makes them very popular for trading, remittances, and storing value. In a statement that was issued on April 4, Crenshaw criticized the SEC’s conclusions as legally and factually flawed. She argued that the guidance paints an inaccurate and overly optimistic picture of stablecoin stability and redeemability. Part of Crenshaw’s statement (Source: SEC ) The new SEC guidelines state that stablecoins meeting specific criteria are now considered ”non-securities” and are exempt from certain transaction reporting requirements. While Crenshaw condemned this approach as misleading, many people in the crypto industry welcomed the development. Industry figures like Token Metrics founder Ian Ballina and Vemanti CEO Tan Tran described the move as a positive, albeit delayed, step toward regulatory clarity. Midnight Network’s Ian Kane said that it signaled progress for crypto businesses seeking to remain compliant. Crenshaw took particular issue with the SEC's characterization of stablecoin accessibility, and pointed out that most USD-stablecoins are not purchased directly from issuers but instead via intermediaries like crypto trading platforms. She explained that more than 90% of stablecoins in circulation are distributed this way, which makes the SEC’s claim that direct-to-consumer access is a norm highly inaccurate. She also criticized the SEC’s reassurance that stablecoin reserves matching or exceeding circulating supply guarantee stability. Crenshaw warned that claims like these ignore crucial financial indicators like issuer liabilities and risk exposure from proprietary activities. She held firm that stablecoins inherently carry risk, particularly during market turbulence, and suggested that the new guidance may give users a false sense of security. The controversy came just weeks after Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, reportedly began working with a Big Four accounting firm to audit its reserves. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that the audit process will likely be more streamlined under the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration. Stablecoins Seen as Key to US Dollar Dominance On the other hand, stablecoins are stepping up as a key strategic asset for maintaining the United States dollar’s dominance in global financial markets, according to Bryan Pellegrino, the CEO and founder of LayerZero Labs. In a recent interview , Pellegrino described stablecoins as the most powerful tool that is currently available to extend the reach of the US dollar, especially in countries plagued by inflation like Argentina and Venezuela. He referred to stablecoins as a “Trojan Horse” or “vampire attack” on weaker fiat currencies, and argued that their cross-border accessibility naturally drives global demand for the US dollar. LayerZero Labs, which developed the LayerZero interoperability protocol, was recently selected by the state of Wyoming to facilitate the distribution of its Wyoming stablecoin. Pellegrino said that he expects increasing support for stablecoins at both the federal and state levels, as they enhance the dollar’s position in foreign exchange markets and fortify its role as the world’s reserve currency. As an example of growing demand, Pellegrino pointed to Tether’s ascent as one of the largest buyers of US Treasury bills. It even surpassed countries like Canada, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. Tether became the seventh-largest holder of US Treasuries, which certainly proves the big role stablecoin issuers now play in financing US debt. The strategic value of stablecoins was also a major topic of conversation at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Here, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that leveraging stablecoins to preserve and expand US dollar hegemony will be a top priority for the Trump administration in 2025. (Source: Chainalysis ) Data from a 2023 Chainalysis report revealed that more than 50% of digital asset value transferred to Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, was denominated in stablecoins. Their low fees, relative stability, and fast settlement times make stablecoins especially attractive for remittances and savings in nations that are struggling with inflation and capital controls.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 05:44:19

Macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from a global tariff war — dubbed an “economic nuclear war"" by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman — is reeling markets from crypto to global equities, with bitcoin under $79,000 and major tokens down 14%. XRP Price Analysis XRP, which powers the XRP Ledger, slipped to $1.90 with a 14%. On the daily chart, XRP has breached its critical support at $2.00 — a level that previously held firm as psychological and technical bedrock. This breakdown completes a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, a signal of potential further downside. Technical indicators reinforce the bearish outlook. The 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) sits at $2.20, acting as a resistance after XRP failed to reclaim it in past weeks. The relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into negative territory, hovering near 30, suggesting selling pressure outweighs buying interest. ADA Price Analysis Cardano’s ADA token trades at 55 cents, down 12% in the past 24 hours, below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a critical support that had propped up the price since mid-March. This breach on the daily chart aligns with a broader descending triangle pattern, hinting at continued bearish control. The RSI for ADA sits at 38, teetering on the edge of oversold territory, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line dipping below the MACD line. The next support lies at nearly 35 cents, a level tested in late 2024, but a break below could drag ADA toward $0.40, a 30% drop from current levels. Bulls would need to reclaim 60 cents and flip it into support to negate the bearish thesis, though macroeconomic headwinds — fueled by tariff threats and a 20% crypto market cap loss this year — make that a tall order. DOGE Price Analysis Memecoin darling dogecoin (DOGE) has tumbled to $0.16, down nearly 15% in the last 24 hours. It sliced through support at 18 cents, a level that marked the base of a consolidation range since early March. On the 4-hour chart, a death cross has emerged, with the 50-period SMA crossing below the 200-period SMA, signaling a potential trend reversal to the downside. The RSI for DOGE is deep in oversold territory at 28, hinting at possible short-term relief, but the 20-day EMA at $0.21 looms as a stiff resistance. If bears maintain control, DOGE could sink to $0.14, aligning with its December 2024 lows.",Markets|XRP|ADA|DOGE,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 05:49:22

After previously warning that Bitcoin could “lose a zero,” McGlone is now turning heads with his latest insights. This time, he’s highlighting gold’s growing strength as it challenges the dominance of traditional stocks. His latest analysis comes as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, experiences a sharp decline, plunging 8.5% to $77,470 . With market conditions shifting rapidly, McGlone questions if investors are choosing the right assets or if they’re betting on the wrong assets at the wrong time. Gold Gaining Edge Over Risky Assets According to McGlone’s recent analysis, we may be witnessing a significant paradigm shift in asset valuations. He suggests that risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies might be due for a price correction after being overvalued for a long time. When paradigm shifts happen, probably best not to chance being on the wrong side of history, especially if it's simple mean reversion of silly expensive risk assets. #Cryptocurrencies are among the riskiest. Treasuries the opposite. Michael Saylor is all in #Bitcoin , Warren… pic.twitter.com/73do1sBtIk — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) April 6, 2025 Meanwhile, safer investment options like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds are becoming more attractive to cautious investors. McGlone’s attached chart shows how gold has performed compared to stocks (S&P 500) over the years. The gold-to-stocks ratio has historically seen major breakouts during periods of economic uncertainty, proving its status as a safe-haven asset. The data now hint that gold might be gearing up for another strong rise, possibly outperforming stocks soon. Bitcoin vs. Treasuries: A Better Pick! McGlone also compares the investment choices of two major financial figures, Michael Saylor and Warren Buffett. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has placed significant bets on the cryptocurrency, whereas Buffett remains steadfast in his commitment to U.S. Treasury bonds. McGlone aligns himself with the latter, viewing Treasury bonds as a more stable investment in uncertain times. Bitcoin Could Lose a Zero This isn’t the first time McGlone has warned about Bitcoin’s future. Earlier, he predicted it might “lose a zero, ” suggesting a major drop. As McGlone recalls, the Nasdaq hit 5,000 in 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst. Now, he compares Bitcoin’s rise to the Nasdaq’s peak before the dot-com crash. He points out that Bitcoin was born after the 2008 financial crisis, and now he believes the market may have peaked, as Bitcoin recently hit $100,000 before pulling back, hinting at a possible downturn.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 05:51:21

CEO Jack Dorsey has recently shared his thoughts on why Bitcoin would fail if pursued only as a store of value of “digital gold”. Although BTC is often seen as a hedge to the equity market, it has largely moved in tandem with it and is still considered a risk-ON asset considering volatility. Dorsey believes that it’s high time that BTC enters mainstream financial payments. Jack Dorsey on Why Bitcoin Could Fail Twitter co-founder and Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey has stirred fresh debate within the Bitcoin community. Speaking on the Presidio Bitcoin podcast last week with Haley Berkoe, Dorsey argued that Bitcoin must function as more than just a store of value if it is to succeed long term. Dorsey warned that limiting BTC use case to a digital equivalent of gold could lead to its “irrelevance.” According to him, Bitcoin’s true potential lies in its use for payments and everyday transactions. Jack Dorsey said: “I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the every day. Otherwise, it’s just something you kind of buy and forget and only use in emergency situations or when you want to get liquid again. So I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it just gets increasingly irrelevant. And that’s failure to me.” Well, it seems that the Twitter co-founder is clearly challenging the narrative of Bitcoin as a “digital gold” going for long in the global financial market. His remarks revive a long-standing discussion in core Bitcoin circles: is Bitcoin ultimately a medium of exchange, a store of value, or both? Get Back to Bitcoin Whitepaper Jack Dorsey also called for a return to Bitcoin’s original mission, as mentioned in the whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, noting that it needs to prioritize simple and accessible payment solutions that offer speed, privacy, and security. Addressing concerns over volatility and scalability, Dorsey argues that once BTC becomes more accessible, issues like wild Bitcoin price swings will alleviate. He suggested that Bitcoin has drifted from its core vision as a peer-to-peer payment system. Dorsey also urged developers and the broader community to refocus efforts on utility rather than just treating it as a store of value. “There’s tons of stuff we need to do to really get back to the white paper, which is, you know, a system for electronic peer-to-peer digital cash like we have not seen that yet,” he said. BTC Institutional Adoption on The Rise Over the years, BTC’s institutional adoption has also been on the rise, even with new investment products like Bitcoin ETF seeing strong demand in the first year of launch. Amid today’s crypto market crash , BTC price has tanked under $80K, testing its next crucial support levels. As of press time, BTC price is trading 7.5% down at $76,771 with a 260% surge in daily trading volume, shooting all the way to $50 billion. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports a notable uptick in large BTC holders, revealing that 76 new entities holding more than 1,000 BTC have joined the network over the past two months. This marks a 4.6% increase and suggests growing institutional demand for Bitcoin.

43020522,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146779,1744006219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Llama 4: Meta Unleashes Flagship Open Source AI Models,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/llama-4-meta-open-source-ai/,"In a surprising Saturday reveal, tech giant Meta has dropped a bombshell in the AI world: Llama 4 , a brand-new suite of flagship Meta AI models . This latest iteration in the Llama family isn’t just an upgrade; it’s a leap, featuring four distinct models – Scout, Maverick, and the behemoth of them all, Behemoth – each trained on a massive dataset of text, images, and video. What does this mean for the crypto and tech-savvy audience? It signals a powerful shift towards more accessible and capable Open Source AI , potentially impacting everything from decentralized applications to AI-driven crypto trading tools. Unpacking the Power of Llama 4: A New Era of Meta AI Models The buzz around Llama 4 isn’t just hype. Meta claims these models boast a “broad visual understanding” thanks to their diverse training data. Industry whispers suggest that the impressive performance of open models from Chinese AI lab DeepSeek – models rivalling and even surpassing Meta’s previous Llama iterations – lit a fire under Meta’s development team. Fueled by competition, Meta reportedly launched intensive efforts to understand how DeepSeek managed to optimize the cost and deployment of their models like R1 and V3. The result? A new generation of Meta AI models designed for both power and efficiency. Here’s a breakdown of what makes Llama 4 stand out: Open Access for Innovation: Scout and Maverick are readily available on Llama.com and through platforms like Hugging Face. This open access is crucial for developers in the crypto space and beyond, allowing for experimentation and integration into new and existing projects. Enhanced Meta AI Assistant: Meta’s AI assistant, Meta AI, already integrated across platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, has been upgraded to leverage the power of Llama 4 in 40 countries. While multimodal features are currently US-English exclusive, the global rollout indicates Meta’s commitment to widespread AI integration. Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture: Llama 4 marks Meta’s first foray into MoE architecture. This innovative approach divides complex tasks into sub-tasks, handled by smaller, specialized “expert” models. This leads to computational efficiency in both training and query processing, making these powerful models more accessible. Consider Maverick, for instance. It packs a staggering 400 billion total parameters, yet only utilizes 17 billion active parameters across 128 experts. Scout, while smaller, still boasts 17 billion active parameters and 109 billion total parameters. These numbers translate to significant processing power without exorbitant resource demands. Llama 4 vs. the Giants: How Meta’s Open Source AI Stacks Up Meta isn’t shy about pitting Llama 4 against industry titans. According to their internal tests, Maverick, designed for “general assistant and chat” applications, outperforms models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini 2.0 in specific areas like coding, reasoning, multilingual capabilities, long-context understanding, and image benchmarks. However, it’s important to note that it doesn’t quite reach the heights of Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or OpenAI’s GPT-4.5. Scout, on the other hand, carves out its niche with exceptional document summarization and large codebase reasoning abilities. Its standout feature? A massive 10 million token context window. To put that in perspective, Scout can ingest and process images and documents containing millions of words. This capability is game-changing for industries dealing with vast amounts of data, including financial analysis in the crypto market. Here’s a quick comparison table: Model Active Parameters Total Parameters Strengths Hardware Needs Scout 17 Billion 109 Billion Document Summarization, Code Reasoning, 10M Token Context Single Nvidia H100 GPU Maverick 17 Billion (out of 400B total) 400 Billion General Assistant, Chat, Coding, Reasoning Nvidia H100 DGX System Behemoth 288 Billion ~2 Trillion STEM Skills, Math Problem Solving Beefier Hardware (Unreleased) Generative AI and the Question of Bias: Llama 4’s Approach Generative AI models are increasingly scrutinized for biases, and Meta claims to have addressed this head-on with Llama 4 . Interestingly, Meta states they’ve tuned these models to be more willing to engage with “contentious” questions. According to a Meta spokesperson, Llama 4 is designed to provide “helpful, factual responses without judgment,” even on debated political and social topics. This move towards more balanced and less biased AI Chatbots is crucial, especially as concerns about AI censorship and political “wokeness” rise. This adjustment comes amidst accusations from some political figures that AI chatbots are overly biased. The challenge of bias in AI is indeed complex, as even Elon Musk’s xAI has faced difficulties in creating a chatbot free from political leanings. Meta’s efforts to create more responsive and balanced AI Chatbots are a significant step in navigating this intricate landscape. The EU Hurdle and Licensing: Navigating the Open Source AI Landscape However, the path to Open Source AI isn’t without its complexities. Developers in the EU face a significant hurdle: the Llama 4 license prohibits use or distribution for users and companies “domiciled” or with a “principal place of business” in the EU. This restriction likely stems from the EU’s stringent AI and data privacy regulations, which Meta has previously criticized as overly burdensome. Furthermore, similar to previous Llama releases, companies with over 700 million monthly active users need to request a special license from Meta, which Meta can approve or deny at its discretion. Conclusion: Llama 4 – A Bold Step in the Generative AI Revolution Llama 4 represents a significant stride in the evolution of Generative AI and Open Source AI . With its diverse models, MoE architecture, and focus on balanced responses, Meta is positioning itself as a key player in democratizing access to powerful AI. While licensing restrictions and the ongoing challenge of AI bias remain factors to consider, the release of Llama 4 undoubtedly marks “the beginning of a new era for the Llama ecosystem,” as Meta aptly stated. For the crypto world and beyond, this development opens exciting new possibilities for innovation and application. The race for AI dominance is heating up, and Meta’s Llama 4 is a powerful contender.

The unknown user staked $0.05 Solana ( SOL ) in 2023, and it will unlock in the year 5138, Arkham said in an April 5 post to X. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the move was likely a symbolic sign of showing conviction in Solana’s long-term ecosystem . Source: Arkham Intelligence “Legacy staking is more than locking assets it’s a mindset. The real edge in crypto isn’t in chasing short-term hype, but in holding long-term conviction assets through cycles,” he said. Adding that: “this kind of thinking builds not just portfolios, but long term legacies.” SOL is currently trading for $102, according to CoinMarketCap. A January report from asset manager Bitwise predicts the token could be worth between $2,300 and over $6,000 by 2030. It's impossible to know what the staked SOL will be worth by the time it’s unlocked in a few thousand years, but Liu says it would likely be a significant sum. “If SOL appreciates just 2–5% annually, the compounding over 3,000 years becomes exponential. In any market condition, long-term compounding remains one of the most powerful financial forces,” he said. Staking Solana for over 3 millennia To put it into perspective, 5 cents compounded annually at a 3% annual interest rate would already result in over $486 undecillion (486 followed by 36 zeros) after 3,115 years. However, the Solana sum would likely be much higher, given staking rewards are paid out every two to three days and compounded. Users on X are speculating that the stake could be an attempt at creating generational wealth, or a random stunt with no real long-term plan. Source: Arkham Intelligence Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at blockchain platform Komodo, told Cointelegraph he thinks the “3,000-year nickel play on SOL is a meme trade” that will one day be stamped on the SOL blockchain. Related: Solana TVL hits new high in SOL terms, DEX volumes show strength — Will SOL price react? “What will 3,000 years from now look like? Will humans still be around? Will the Solana blockchain? Such a long time horizon makes one ponder one’s place in the scheme of things,” Stadelmann said. He speculates people might even seek to outdo it by “making a 5,000-year play.” At the moment, depending on the platform and validator choice, Solana offers between 5% to 8% in staking rewards. Meanwhile, Cardano ( ADA ) starts at around 2%, and Ether ( ETH) staking rewards are between 2% and 7%. Four Solana whales recently profited over $200 million in a staking play that began in April 2021, when they staked 1.79 million Solana, worth $37.7 million at the time.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has had a rough start in April, falling to a three-week low of $77,077. In an Apr. 5 post on X, Ju pointed out how the current Bitcoin bear market condition is reflected in on-chain metrics like market cap and realized cap. Realized cap determines the actual amount of money entering Bitcoin based on wallet movements, while market cap is based on the most recent price on exchanges. A bear market is typically shown by stagnation or decline of market capitalization despite a rise in realized cap. This indicates that although capital is entering the market, prices are not reacting. #Bitcoin bull cycle is over — here’s why. There’s a concept in on-chain data called Realized Cap. It works like this: when BTC enters a blockchain wallet, it's considered a ""buy,"" and when it leaves, it's treated as a ""sell."" Using this idea, we can estimate an average cost… pic.twitter.com/xDHRin8N1K — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) April 5, 2025 Ju notes that a bull market happens when modest capital drives up prices. However, the current bearish trend is supported by the fact that even large capital purchases aren’t driving up the price of Bitcoin. He adds that historical data shows that a true reversal in the price of Bitcoin typically takes at least six months, making a short-term rally unlikely.

Losses in the first quarter have historically had a mixed effect on Bitcoin’s yearly performance. COVID fears caused a 9.4% drop in 2020, but Bitcoin ended the year up more than 300%. However, Q1 losses in 2014, 2018, and 2022 signaled the end of bull runs and preceded bear markets. The recent decline comes after President Trump imposed new tariffs that have triggered market volatility worldwide. Although Bitcoin saw increases following Trump’s election, its status as a U.S. economic hedge is now in question due to these new tariffs, which have raised fears about a recession. Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of economic uncertainty will be tested in the months ahead.

The SFC’s new rules highlight the benefits of staking, such as boosting blockchain security and helping investors earn yields in a regulated environment. This guidance lets licensed crypto platforms offer more services, supporting the SFC’s “ASPIRe” plan to grow Hong Kong’s virtual asset market. SFC Rules Aim to Make Crypto Staking Safer The SFC has laid out clear rules for licensed crypto platforms offering staking, aiming to boost investor protection. Platforms must safeguard staked assets, prevent service errors, and be fully transparent about the risks involved, marking a strong step toward safer staking in Hong Kong. Besides, the SFC has also revised its circular on SFC-authorised VA Funds, allowing them to stake assets—but only through licensed platforms or approved institutions. To reduce risk, a cap is set on how much they can stake, helping manage liquidity and protect investors. SFC CEO Julia Leung remarked that expanding the suite of regulated crypto services is key to growing Hong Kong’s virtual asset space. At the same time she also emphasized that the top priority should always be protecting investors’ assets through strong regulation and compliance. Hong Kong’s Efforts To Become a Global Crypto Leader Hong Kong is actively enhancing its cryptocurrency regulations to position itself as a leading digital asset hub. The SFC has introduced the ASPIRe framework, focusing on Access, Safeguards, Products, Infrastructure, and Relationships, aiming to streamline market access and bolster investor protections. ​ In February 2025, the SFC announced plans to establish new licensing regimes for over-the-counter virtual asset trading and custody services, seeking to improve market efficiency and investor safeguards.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 06:13:18

Speaking at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival , Chan said the forthcoming policy statement will expand on the government’s previous commitments, with a focus on using Web3 to enhance traditional financial services, support the real economy and strengthen the application of digital asset technologies. “Later this year, we will unveil a second policy statement on the development of virtual assets,” he said, adding that the goal is to foster a regulatory environment that supports innovation while safeguarding market integrity.

Since then, Hong Kong has rolled out a licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms , with 10 platforms licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission so far. Other efforts include authorising virtual asset spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with Hong Kong emerging as the largest VA ETF market in the Asia-Pacific region. The government also plans to introduce legislation to regulate stablecoins, with the licensing regime expected to take effect within the year. OTC and Custody Rules Under Review as City Deepens Web3 Supervision Authorities are currently conducting consultations on extending regulation to cover over-the-counter virtual asset trading and custodial services, further expanding the city’s oversight of the sector. Chan reiterated that the government’s approach is not solely regulatory. “We support a multi-stakeholder approach where governments, regulators and market players across different territories and regions come together to drive forward the sustainable development of Web3,” he said. One example is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Project Ensemble, a sandbox that allows financial institutions to experiment with tokenized real-world assets under regulatory supervision. Hong Kong has taken a more open stance towards Web3 than some neighbouring jurisdictions, positioning itself as a regional hub for blockchain-related activity while maintaining a focus on financial stability. “The lesson we have learnt,” he said, “is that we need to put it under a balanced regulatory framework so as to enable the sector to grow in a responsible and sustainable manner.” The post Hong Kong to Roll Out Updated Virtual Asset Policy Framework by End of 2025 appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|Crypto Regulations|Web3,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-07 06:17:05

This week is packed with economic events that could significantly influence market movements. For crypto investors, staying informed about these events is not just beneficial—it’s crucial. Buckle up, as we delve into the key economic releases and Federal Reserve (FOMC) speeches scheduled this week that could send ripples through the crypto sphere. Understanding these events is your first step to navigating the potentially choppy waters ahead. Decoding the Week’s Key Economic Events This week’s calendar is marked by significant announcements, primarily from the U.S., which traditionally has a strong global market impact , especially on digital assets. From Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) member speeches to critical inflation data releases, here’s a breakdown to keep you in the loop: Day, Date & Time (UTC) Region Event Importance Tuesday, April 8 – 18:00 U.S. FOMC Member Daly Speaks Medium Wednesday, April 9 – 16:30 U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks Medium Wednesday, April 9 – 18:00 U.S. FOMC Meeting Minutes High Thursday, April 10 – 12:30 U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) (March), Initial Jobless Claims Very High Thursday, April 10 – 13:30 U.S. Fed Logan Speaks Medium Thursday, April 10 – 16:00 U.S. Fed Goolsbee Speaks Medium Friday, April 11 – 12:30 U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) (March) High Friday, April 11 – 15:00 U.S. FOMC Member Williams Speaks Medium Why FOMC Speeches Matter for Crypto? FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) members’ speeches are closely watched by financial analysts and traders worldwide. Why? Because these speeches often provide hints about the future direction of monetary policy, particularly interest rates. For the crypto market, which is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, these pronouncements can be pivotal. Here’s why you should pay attention: Interest Rate Expectations: FOMC members’ views on inflation and economic growth can signal whether the Federal Reserve is likely to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates. Higher interest rates can sometimes lead investors to shift from riskier assets like crypto to bonds or cash, while lower rates can have the opposite effect. Market Sentiment: The tone and content of these speeches can heavily influence overall market sentiment. Hawkish comments (indicating a leaning towards tighter monetary policy) might trigger sell-offs in crypto, while dovish remarks (suggesting looser policy) could fuel rallies. Volatility Catalyst: Unexpected or strong signals from FOMC members can inject volatility into the crypto market, creating both opportunities and risks for traders. This week, we have several FOMC members scheduled to speak, including Daly, Barkin, Logan, Goolsbee, and Williams. Keep an ear out for any nuances in their language regarding inflation, economic outlook, and future policy actions. The FOMC Meeting Minutes released on Wednesday could also offer deeper insights into the committee’s recent discussions and policy stance. Understanding the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and its Crypto Connection The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a critical measure of inflation, reflecting the average change in prices consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. It’s released monthly and is a key indicator that the Federal Reserve considers when making decisions about monetary policy. Why should crypto investors care about CPI ? The CPI-Crypto Link Explained: Inflation Gauge: CPI data reveals the rate of inflation in the U.S. High inflation can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies, potentially making assets like Bitcoin, often touted as an inflation hedge, more attractive. Fed’s Reaction Function: The Fed closely monitors CPI. Higher-than-expected CPI readings can prompt the Fed to consider more aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, which can, in turn, negatively impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower CPI could suggest easing inflationary pressures, potentially leading to a more dovish stance from the Fed and positive reactions in crypto markets. Market Expectations vs. Reality: The market impact of CPI data often depends on whether the actual figures align with market expectations. Significant deviations can lead to sharp price movements. For instance, if CPI is unexpectedly high, we might see a knee-jerk reaction of crypto sell-offs followed by potential recovery if the market believes inflation is still under control in the longer term. Thursday’s CPI release for March will be a major focal point. Analysts will be scrutinizing the numbers to gauge the trajectory of inflation and anticipate the Fed’s next moves. Producer Price Index (PPI): Another Inflation Puzzle Piece While CPI measures inflation from the consumer’s perspective, the Producer Price Index (PPI) tracks inflation at the wholesale level. It measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Think of it as an early indicator of inflationary pressures that might eventually trickle down to consumers and be reflected in CPI . PPI and its Relevance to Crypto: Leading Indicator: Changes in PPI can sometimes precede changes in CPI . Rising producer prices can indicate future consumer price inflation, thus influencing expectations about monetary policy and market impact on crypto. Business Costs and Margins: PPI reflects the cost of goods at the producer level. Higher producer prices can squeeze business profit margins and potentially lead to businesses passing on these costs to consumers, further fueling inflation. This broader economic context affects all asset classes, including crypto. Complementary Data to CPI: Analyzing both PPI and CPI provides a more comprehensive picture of inflationary pressures in the economy. Friday’s PPI data will be crucial to confirm or challenge the inflation trends indicated by the CPI release the previous day. Keep an eye on Friday’s PPI figures to get a fuller understanding of the inflation landscape and its potential implications for the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors This Week Navigating a week loaded with significant economic events requires a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Monitor financial news outlets for real-time updates and analysis of the economic events listed above. Pay close attention to expert commentary on how these events might affect the crypto market. Manage Risk: Given the potential for increased volatility, consider adjusting your portfolio risk. This could involve reducing leverage, setting stop-loss orders, or diversifying your holdings. Analyze Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts immediately after each major announcement, particularly CPI and PPI releases and FOMC statements. These reactions can offer clues about prevailing market sentiment and potential future trends. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility might be unsettling, remember to maintain a long-term perspective. Economic data releases are just snapshots in time, and the fundamental drivers of the crypto market are still evolving. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Seas This week presents a series of crucial economic events that are poised to influence not just traditional markets but also the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. From FOMC member speeches offering insights into future monetary policy to the critical inflation data from CPI and PPI , staying informed and prepared is paramount. By understanding the potential market impact of these events and adopting a strategic approach, crypto investors can navigate the week ahead with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities.

Meanwhile, traders expect the market decline to continue through the Asian day ahead of the U.S. open. “Historically, crypto markets tend to front-run stock markets over the weekend, and this morning's Asia market declines seem to have reinforced this belief,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “We expect crypto markets to dip once US markets open.” “As to whether or not they’ll recover depends on which large countries are able to secure short-term tariff delays or deals this week. Thus far, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Taiwan have already pledged to lower their own tariffs and/or increase US investment in exchange for relief, but we would need a larger trading partner like Japan or China to do so to restore confidence and certainty in the markets,” Mei added. Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, said current price action was displaying bear market behaviour. “All the signs suggest that macro markets are now in 'bear market' mode, rallies are to be sold, and investors will be forced to accept this new reality against the long-term wagers being made,” Fan said in a Telegram message. “The market will likely continue to frustrate and shake investor confidence for quite a while longer.” “Over the longer term, charts might argue that BTC has broken out against global equities and is overdue to catch up with spot gold, but catalysts appear to be fleeting at this time and risk management (ie. lower prices) will likely dominate until global stops melting down,” Fan ended.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 07:23:58

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped by 19.32% in 24 hours to $1.69. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is down an eye-soaring 19.32% to $1.69. If the bullish momentum kick starts, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $1.942. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.55 Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 1.68987906 -19.15% Market cap $ 98,477,659,394.93 Circulating Supply 58,274,974,538.00 Trading Volume $ 9,609,566,055.9527 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

The crypto market is falling along with global stock markets following Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs. The crash was led by Bitcoin (BTC), which fell to nearly $75,000, triggering a cascade of forced liquidations across the board. The entire crypto market is down nearly 13% in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGlass , long-positioned futures traders bore the brunt of the market turmoil. Over $1.2 billion of long bets were wiped out, with Bitcoin longs accounting for more than $392 million in losses. Source: Coingecko ETH, SOL, and XRP Traders Suffer Nearly $730M in Liquidations Amid Market Crash Ether (ETH) traders lost close to $328 million, while altcoins—including Solana (SOL) and XRP—contributed nearly $400 million to the total, with each seeing about $60 million in liquidations. ETH plunged 20% to $1,449 while major altcoins like SOL, XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped by as much as 20% in the last 24 hours. BNB also dropped nearly 10%. Mid-cap and low-cap tokens were also swept up in the selloff, falling between 10% and 20%, per CoinGecko data. Nearly 86% of all futures traders had bet on a price rally, anticipating short-term relief in the market. However, the violent downturn forced exchanges to liquidate leveraged positions en masse, as traders failed to meet margin calls. Liquidations of this scale are often signs of extreme market stress. Forced selling during a downturn can accelerate price declines, while potentially setting the stage for a sharp rebound once the excess leverage is flushed out. Crypto Crash Mirrors U.S. Stock Futures Slump Crypto wasn’t alone in the selloff. U.S. stock futures also plunged Sunday night, heightening fears of a broader market crash. S&P 500 futures fell 5.98%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 6.2%, and Dow futures dropped 5.5%, all pointing to a chaotic start to the trading week. The sharp selloff follows growing macroeconomic uncertainty, intensifying trade tensions, and investor jitters over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff order. CNBC’s Jim Cramer referenced the 1987 crash in a post on Saturday, warning that a “Black Monday” could weigh heavily on the administration’s legacy. Surprised we can't get a short cover rally in case President Trump realizes that a Black Monday may not burnish a legacy — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) April 4, 2025 Markets in Asia mirrored the panic. Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 8.9% early Monday, while Taiwan’s Taiex index plunged nearly 10%, triggering circuit breakers on heavyweights like TSMC and Foxconn. Authorities responded by temporarily banning short-selling to curb further volatility. Meanwhile, retail investors pulled a record $1.5 billion from equities in just 2.5 hours on Friday, underscoring the depth of fear in the market. Institutional capital continued its exodus, making March 2025 one of the sharpest withdrawal periods in recent history. As reported, U.S. stock markets have experienced a staggering $11 trillion wipeout since February 19, with losses accelerating on April 4 following heightened concerns over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff measures. The single-day market loss amounted to $3.25 trillion—exceeding the total valuation of the global cryptocurrency market, which stood at $2.68 trillion at the time. Among major tech players, dubbed the “Magnificent 7,” Tesla led the plunge, falling 10.42%. Nvidia and Apple also saw steep losses, dropping 7.36% and 7.29% respectively.

With Ethereum (ETH) currently trading at $1,814, many investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising star in the DeFi lending market that is quickly gaining traction. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6.3 million has been accumulated and 7900 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $3 after launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 7900 investors put $6.3 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $3 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects.

Crypto Investors Watch Closely,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-stock-market-crypto-impact/,"In a whirlwind of financial speculation and political intrigue, the narrative around former President Donald Trump and the stock market has taken a dramatic turn. As crypto enthusiasts keenly observe traditional market movements for signals, a recent social media post by Trump himself ignited a firestorm: accusations that he is deliberately orchestrating a stock market crash . But is there any truth to these explosive claims? Let’s dive into the unfolding drama and what it could mean for the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Decoding the Stock Market Crash Controversy: What’s Really Happening? The controversy erupted when Trump shared a video on his Truth Social platform on April 4th, alleging that he was “purposely CRASHING the market.” This bold statement was interpreted by many as a calculated move to pressure the Federal Reserve (Fed) into lowering interest rates. The logic? Rate cuts could weaken the dollar and bring down mortgage rates – potentially beneficial outcomes in some economic scenarios. However, such actions, if intentional, raise serious questions about market manipulation and economic stability. Adding fuel to the fire, Kevin Hassett, a White House official and director of the National Economic Council, stepped in to quell the rumors. In an interview with ABC, Hassett firmly stated that President Trump is not intentionally crashing the stock market. According to CNBC, Hassett emphasized, “[The president is] trying to deliver for American workers.” This official denial attempts to counter the narrative sparked by Trump’s own social media activity, creating a confusing and uncertain landscape for investors – including those in the crypto space who often look to traditional market volatility for cues. Trump’s Stock Market Legacy: A Rollercoaster Ride? To understand the current situation, it’s essential to consider Trump’s historical relationship with the Trump stock market . During his presidency, the stock market experienced significant fluctuations, often reacting sharply to his policy announcements and tweets. While some periods saw robust growth, others were marked by volatility and downturns. This historical context makes the current allegations all the more pertinent. Investors, both in traditional equities and cryptocurrency, are acutely aware of the potential impact of presidential statements and actions on market sentiment and economic direction. Here’s a quick look at some key factors influencing the market under Trump’s previous administration: Tax Cuts: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was initially seen as a boost for corporate profits and the stock market. Trade Wars: Trump’s imposition of tariffs on goods from China and other countries led to trade tensions and market uncertainty. Deregulation: Efforts to reduce regulations were generally viewed favorably by businesses but raised concerns in other sectors. Federal Reserve Policy: Trump frequently criticized the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, often calling for lower interest rates. Now, as Trump is no longer in office, his influence on the market is arguably indirect, yet his voice still carries considerable weight, especially among his followers and within certain political and economic circles. This makes his social media pronouncements, even if seemingly contradictory to official White House statements, a factor that market participants cannot ignore. The Fed Rate Cuts Factor: A Desperate Measure or Economic Strategy? At the heart of Trump’s alleged market manipulation strategy lies the concept of Fed rate cuts . Lowering interest rates is a tool the Federal Reserve uses to stimulate economic growth. It makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging businesses to invest and consumers to spend. However, excessive or premature rate cuts can also lead to inflation and potentially destabilize the currency. Trump’s supposed motivation, as outlined in his Truth Social post, is to force the Fed into rate cuts. Why? Let’s break down the potential chain of events: Market Crash (Alleged Intentional): Trump supposedly wants to trigger a significant downturn in the stock market. Fed Reaction: A crashing market would likely pressure the Federal Reserve to intervene to prevent a deeper economic crisis. Rate Cuts: The Fed’s primary tool for intervention is often to lower interest rates. Dollar Weakening: Lower interest rates can make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors, potentially weakening its value. Mortgage Rate Reduction: Lower rates generally translate to lower mortgage rates, which can stimulate the housing market. While this is a simplified scenario, it reflects the core of the accusation. However, many economists argue that intentionally crashing the market is a dangerous and unpredictable strategy with potentially devastating consequences far outweighing any perceived benefits. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve operates independently of direct political influence, though political pressure can certainly exist. Crypto Market Impact: Navigating the Economic Uncertainty For those invested in cryptocurrencies, the unfolding situation presents a landscape of economic uncertainty . The crypto market, while increasingly mature, is still sensitive to macroeconomic trends and investor sentiment in traditional markets. A significant stock market crash could have ripple effects across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Here’s how the crypto market might be impacted: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Reaction Stock Market Crash: Initially, a broad sell-off across all markets, including crypto, as investors seek safety. However, in the longer term, some might see Bitcoin and other cryptos as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Fed Rate Cuts: Lower interest rates could make riskier assets like crypto more attractive compared to traditional fixed income investments. It could also contribute to inflationary pressures, potentially boosting the appeal of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Dollar Weakening: A weaker dollar can sometimes lead to increased interest in alternative currencies, including cryptocurrencies, as a store of value. Increased Volatility: Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the stock market and Fed policy is likely to increase volatility in all markets, including crypto. Traders should be prepared for potentially sharp price swings. It’s crucial for crypto investors to stay informed and exercise caution during periods of heightened economic uncertainty. Diversification, risk management, and a long-term perspective are always advisable, especially when traditional markets are exhibiting signs of stress. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do amidst this swirling vortex of claims, denials, and market speculation? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, Federal Reserve announcements, and statements from key political and economic figures. Reliable financial news sources are your best allies. Manage Risk: Consider reducing exposure to highly volatile assets if you are risk-averse, or at least diversify your crypto portfolio across different types of assets. Don’t Panic Sell: Market volatility can be unsettling, but avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear. Base your actions on careful analysis and your long-term investment strategy. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: In times of uncertainty, dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) can be a prudent strategy to mitigate risk. Seek Expert Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate these market conditions, consider consulting with a financial advisor who understands both traditional and crypto markets. Conclusion: Uncertainty Reigns, Vigilance is Key The debate over whether Trump is intentionally trying to crash the stock market injects a significant dose of uncertainty into already complex economic conditions. While White House officials deny these claims, the very fact that such accusations are being made and discussed widely highlights the sensitivity of the market and the potential impact of political rhetoric. For crypto investors, this situation underscores the interconnectedness of traditional and digital finance. Vigilance, informed decision-making, and a balanced approach to risk are paramount as we navigate these potentially turbulent times. The coming weeks and months will likely reveal more about the true direction of the market and the validity of these shocking claims.

In a time when most tokens struggle to prove real-world use, Remittix Tech stands out for its cross-border payments platform. Early adopters say a future price explosion seems inevitable as investor interest keeps growing. Below we go into the inner workings of this cutting-edge platform, talk about why excitement is growing, and examine how Remittix Tech can change everyday transactions in the blockchain world. Remittix Tech’s Growing Role in Crypto Payments Remittix Tech has stood out as an exemplary utility for merging blockchain efficiency with domestic banking networks. The company seeks to address the painstaking delays and undercover charges that frustrate remittance channels worldwide. Experts believe such a model could transform the $190 trillion cross-border payment segment, luring merchants, freelancers, and regular crypto consumers. Rather than indulging in hype, Remittix Tech delivers tangible benefits to businesses negotiating with overseas suppliers or families sending remittances abroad. By executing transactions within a few hours, it puts paid to the time-consuming wire transfers that enrage millions of people. All this real-world problem-solving makes Remittix Tech stand out from hype-fuelled altcoins. Among its most prominent aspects is an API that facilitates acceptance of cryptocurrency payments by small and large traders alike, immediately converted to local money. This ease of system translates to the interest Remittix Tech has found in an industry rife with untested businesses. Numerous now view it as a convenient option for something greater than gambley meme coins. Inside the Phenomenal Presale and Adoption Remittix Tech has well over doubled its presale in merely raising over $14.4 million, selling over 526 million tokens at a price of $0.0734 currently. This shows a market hungry for solutions that break inefficiencies. Early birds have been reportedly making healthy profits, and rumors are going around about even more price increases when the token lists on major exchanges. One of the attractions of Remittix Tech is its open ledger, which logs each transaction to limit fraud. For example, a web developer in South America charging a client in Europe can be paid in stablecoins near-instantly, while the client pays little in conversion fees. By incorporating an API for direct acceptance of cryptocurrency, Remittix Tech avoids the labyrinth of traditional banking channels. Experts credit the presale’s success to these applications in real life. With the platform enhancing, some project Remittix Tech can become an initial go-to for cross-border payments, outdoing the rest with no robust payment infrastructures. It’s not just retail consumers, either—merchants and businesses look at cost savings and faster settlements as a compelling incentive to onboard. Remittix Tech versus Legacy Systems While current wire transfers occur over days or even weeks, Remittix Tech brings the time down to hours. It also seeks lower fees, with the appeal being to anyone infuriated by the extortionate cost of global money flow. As the world sees online e-commerce booming, such an efficiency may be revolutionary. In contrast to buzz-only tokens, Remittix Tech addresses a headache every business and consumer day. With on-chain transparency, it builds confidence in a world where hidden fees can consume profits. That tangible utility means users don’t need to be crypto enthusiasts to realize the value—anyone interested in smooth transactions can enjoy the benefits. Critics sometimes wonder whether new startups can compete with established payment giants. However, Remittix Tech’s trapped liquidity, rigorous auditing, and ongoing partnerships show it’s heading towards long-term sustainability. Many early adopters believe the platform may one day be on par with the biggest altcoins that focus on real consumer value. Gaining Momentum Before the Price Spikes Press attention to Remittix Tech has increased, highlighting the notion that practical applications conquer fleeting manias. Analysts anticipate that when presale mania peaks, the token could surge considerably in value. Nevertheless, the period to purchase before prices rise runs out every passing day. Even conservative traders will see when a platform applies decentralized speed to conventional banking. Many are speculating whether Remittix Tech will replicate the success of previous crypto projects that solved specific pain points. The difference is that cross-border remittances touch a gigantic segment of the global population, potentially bringing mass adoption. For deeper insight into evolving crypto trends and how new coins like Remittix Tech shape global finance, watch the in-depth crypto guide. If things continue as they are, Remittix Tech would lead the charge into Pay-Fi, balancing decentralized tech with traditional money networks. Every completed transaction makes the argument of buying now—before the price spike—the more compelling one.

Bitcoin, a dominant force in the crypto market, fell to a three-week low of $76,693.20 on April 7, 2025, pulling altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Notcoin (NOT) down with it. Notcoin suffers as Trump’s tariffs disrupt the crypto market The catalyst for today’s downturn traces back to April 2, 2025, dubbed ‘Liberation Day,’ when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs aimed at nearly 200 US trading partners , igniting fears of a global trade war. The tariffs, a cornerstone of Trump’s economic agenda, impose a baseline 10% duty on most imports, with steeper rates for specific nations—34% on Chinese goods and 20% on European Union products. Designed to correct trade imbalances, these measures instead unleashed chaos across financial markets. US stock futures cratered , with Nasdaq 100 contracts tumbling 5%, while global indices followed suit. Asian markets plummeted as Japan’s Nikkei 225 shed 6%, and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 4.4%. This widespread sell-off in traditional markets has spilled over into cryptocurrencies, erasing Bitcoin’s brief post-tariff stability and dragging the broader crypto ecosystem into a tailspin. Notcoin, trading at $0.001748 as of April 6, 2025, has borne the brunt of this volatility. Its all-time high of $0.02836, hit on June 2, 2024, contrasts sharply with its recent low of $0.001688 on April 7, 2025—a 93.9% drop from its peak. Notcoin price chart by CoinGecko This steep fall highlights Notcoin’s vulnerability as a smaller-cap cryptocurrency, prone to exaggerated price swings when market sentiment sours. Is a crypto winter on the horizon? The economic fallout from the tariffs extends beyond immediate market reactions. Businesses face higher costs, which could fuel inflation, while consumers brace for pricier goods. Hedge fund titan Bill Ackman has warned of an “economic nuclear winter” if these policies persist, citing irreparable damage to US global credibility. In this climate of uncertainty, investors have fled riskier assets, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to 1 7, signaling “extreme fear.” On April 6, the crypto market saw $778 million in long positions liquidated in a single day, the largest such event in six weeks. Over the past 24 hours, 327,264 traders have been liquidated, bringing the total liquidations to $1.02 billion according to Coinglass data . Notably, Bitcoin’s decline has amplified the pressure on altcoins. Ethereum, today, hit a low of $1,538, its lowest since October 2023, while Solana dropped to $107. Notcoin, lacking Bitcoin’s robust institutional backing or market depth, has suffered disproportionately. Its 23.6% loss over the past week and 25.9% decline over the past month reflect a market in retreat, with traders favoring cash or safer havens over speculative tokens. Arthur Hayes believes the instability could bolster crypto BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes argues that prolonged economic instability could eventually bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized hedge against centralized policies. Freshly pardoned by Trump for past financial violations, Hayes envisions a scenario where investors seek refuge in Bitcoin (BTC), potentially lifting the broader crypto market.

The tariffs’ long-term implications loom large. If they spark sustained inflation or a global slowdown, the Federal Reserve may face pressure to adjust monetary policy, perhaps adopting a dovish stance that could buoy risk assets. Conversely, persistent trade tensions might deepen the downturn, keeping cryptocurrencies under strain. Notcoin, emblematic of altcoins’ struggles, stands at a crossroads, its fate tied to both Bitcoin’s trajectory and the unfolding economic narrative.

Notably, these ETFs experienced outflows on four of the five days between March 31 and April 4. Monday saw $71.07 million in outflows, followed by $157.64 million on Tuesday, $99.86 million on Thursday, and $64.88 million on Friday. The only positive day was Wednesday, with $220.76 million in inflows. The majority of outflows came from Grayscale GBTC, which lost $95.5 million over last week, followed by WisdomTree’s BTCW with $44.6 million per Faside data . Additionally, outflows came from IBIT, BITB, ARKB, and HODL funds that saw $35.5 million, $24.1 million, $22.2 million, and $4.9 million in net redemption, respectively.

Ethereum ETFs recorded $49.93 million in outflows last week, marking six straight weeks of withdrawals totaling over $795 million.

With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging into extreme fear territory and billions wiped from the market overnight, traders are bracing for what could come next. “An Economic Nuclear War” The crypto sell-off was triggered by rising fears of a global tariff war, which investor Bill Ackman called an “economic nuclear war.” The uncertainty is rattling markets, dragging Bitcoin down over 9% and pushing major altcoins down by up to 14%. XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have all dropped below key support levels as of Monday morning. Notably, the Fear and Greed Index dropped into “extreme fear” to 17 as per data from Coinmarketcap. Bitcoin tumbled to $75,000, dragging the total crypto market cap down nearly 10% to $2.4 trillion. Berachain led the plunge with a 21% crash to a record low of $4.6 — now down over 50% from its peak. Top tokens like AAVE, Litecoin, Lido DAO, Maker, Movement, and Ethena also fell sharply, losing more than 15%. Over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated as markets crashed, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for $638 million combined. More than 324,000 traders were hit, including one Bitfinex user who lost a staggering $23 million. The Fear & Greed Index tumbled to 17, signaling extreme fear across the market. Charlie Sherry from BTC Markets said the drop isn’t shocking because markets are usually illiquid on Sundays. That means a few big sales can cause prices to fall quickly. US Crypto Wallet Reveal To Spark Relief Rally? ​Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO of Mudrex, noted that investor sentiment is currently weak, with the Fear and Greed Index approaching “Extreme Fear.” However, he notes that there may be a silver lining as the U.S. federal agencies are expected to reveal their crypto holdings later today, and a strong disclosure could spark a much-needed relief rally. Federal agencies must disclose their Bitcoin and crypto holdings to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by Monday, a White House official confirmed to journalist Eleanor Terrett.

McGlone said that as long as the price of assets continues to rise, everyone identifies as a long-term investor. He said he doesn’t know how the price of Bitcoin went from $10,000 to $100,000 just a short time ago in 2020, but that trends came into play and made it happen. The analyst now argues that he sees a return to $10,000 in the BTC price. McGlone, who has been a pro-Bitcoin stance in the past, seems to have completely abandoned this behavior, as he also made fun of the technology behind BTC. He criticized Bitcoin, saying that its technology is “so great, that’s why the most traded cryptocurrency is Tether, which is a dollar token.” Related News: There Are Weekend Updates on Tariffs That Keep Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Under Pressure - These Should Be Known Ahead of Tomorrow's Market Open On the other hand, he argued that Tether's market value is on track to soon surpass that of the world's largest altcoin, Ethereum.

Crypto news outlet db recently highlighted on X a headline quoting Trump saying, “Trump, Asked About Markets, Says Sometimes You Have to Take Medicine.” This seemingly simple phrase has sent ripples through financial circles, leaving many to wonder: what kind of ‘medicine’ is he talking about, and what could it mean for the volatile crypto market ? Decoding Trump’s ‘Medicine’ for the Markets: What Could It Mean for Crypto? Trump’s comment, while brief, is open to interpretation. In the context of market questions , ‘medicine’ is likely a metaphor for intervention or measures taken to address perceived issues within the economy or financial systems. But what kind of intervention could this be? And more importantly, how might it affect the burgeoning crypto market ? Possible Interpretations of ‘Medicine’ in the Market Context: Economic Stimulus: Could ‘medicine’ refer to injecting liquidity into the economy through stimulus packages? This could indirectly benefit the crypto market as investors might seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies in an inflationary environment. Regulatory Measures: Conversely, ‘medicine’ could imply stricter regulations aimed at curbing perceived excesses or risks in the markets . For the crypto space, this could mean increased scrutiny and potentially tighter rules around exchanges, digital assets, and DeFi. Interest Rate Adjustments: Traditional economic ‘medicine’ often involves manipulating interest rates to control inflation or stimulate growth. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact investment flows across all markets , including crypto. Currency Intervention: In some cases, ‘medicine’ could refer to government intervention in currency markets to stabilize exchange rates. While less directly linked to crypto, broader currency stability can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite in all asset classes. Why is Trump’s Statement Significant for the Crypto Market? Trump’s words carry weight, especially within financial markets . His past actions and statements have demonstrably influenced market behavior, and the crypto market is no exception. Here’s why this comment is generating so much attention: Market Sensitivity: The crypto market is known for its volatility and sensitivity to news and sentiment. Even vague statements from influential figures can trigger significant price swings. Policy Implications: Trump’s potential return to politics and his views on economic policy make his statements relevant. His stance on regulation and economic intervention could directly impact the future of the crypto market in the US and globally. Investor Uncertainty: Ambiguous comments like “sometimes you have to take medicine” create uncertainty. Investors in the crypto market dislike uncertainty, and this can lead to cautious trading or increased volatility as they try to decipher the potential implications. Analyzing the Potential ‘Medicine’: What Kind of Market Intervention Could We See? To understand the potential impact, let’s consider different types of ‘medicine’ and their possible effects on the markets , particularly crypto: Type of ‘Medicine’ Potential Impact on Crypto Market Examples Stimulus Packages Potentially positive in the short-term as increased liquidity could flow into crypto; however, long-term inflation concerns could emerge. Direct payments to citizens, infrastructure spending, tax cuts. Increased Regulation Potentially negative in the short-term due to uncertainty and compliance costs; could lead to greater long-term stability and mainstream adoption if regulations are clear and balanced. Crackdown on unregistered exchanges, stricter KYC/AML requirements, new rules for stablecoins and DeFi. Interest Rate Hikes Generally negative as higher rates make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to bonds or savings accounts. Federal Reserve raising benchmark interest rates. Currency Controls Unclear and depends on the specifics. Could be negative if it restricts capital flow into crypto; could be positive if it drives demand for decentralized alternatives. Restrictions on USD conversions, capital controls on outflows. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amid Market Questions Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s statement and its potential implications, what should crypto market participants do? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic news, policy announcements, and further statements from Trump and his associates. Reliable crypto news outlets and financial news sources are crucial. Manage Risk: In times of uncertainty, risk management is paramount. Consider diversifying your portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and avoiding over-leveraging. Prepare for Volatility: Expect continued volatility in the crypto market as interpretations of Trump’s comments evolve and market reactions unfold. Focus on Fundamentals: In the long run, the fundamentals of strong crypto projects and the broader adoption trends will likely outweigh short-term political noise. Continue to research and invest in projects with solid use cases and strong teams. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market’s ‘Medicine’ Moment Trump’s seemingly offhand remark about ‘medicine’ for the markets has injected a dose of uncertainty into the crypto market . While the exact nature of this ‘medicine’ remains unclear, it’s crucial for crypto investors and enthusiasts to pay attention. By staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, participants can navigate this period of speculation and position themselves for potential opportunities and challenges ahead. The market questions raised by Trump’s comment serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the crypto world with broader economic and political forces. Understanding these connections is key to thriving in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.

A liquidation process happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to the trader’s incapability to meet the margin requirements. According to reports, no fewer than 86% of futures bets were bullish. This implies that traders were expecting prices to rise. Data shows that Bitcoin traders and Ethereum traders have lost $322 million and $290 million, respectively, as part of the latest liquidation development. Other major altcoin traders, including XRP traders and SOL traders, have faced a combined loss of over $80 million.

The controversy is built around the First Digital Trust (FDT) , a Hong Kong-based custodian reportedly involved in unauthorized fund transfers. Sun isn’t pulling any punches—he says this is “significantly worse” than what FTX pulled off. FTX vs. FDT: What’s the Deal? According to Sun, while FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried masked his misuse of funds as collateralized loans backed by tokens and shares, FDT allegedly skipped the smoke and mirrors altogether. In an x post, Sun claims FDT directly took $456 million from TUSD (TrueUSD) custodial reserves without client knowledge or permission, funneling it into a shady Dubai-based company without collateral. He further alleges that this company laundered the money, and that FDT CEO Vincent Chok played a direct role. That’s a bold accusation, especially considering the implications for users who trusted FDT to safeguard their assets. FDUSD Depeg and a $50 Million Bounty The fallout has already started. The FDUSD stablecoin briefly lost its peg , raising red flags. In response, Justin Sun has put up a $50 million bounty to track and recover the missing funds. He’s calling for swift action, warning that the credibility of Hong Kong’s entire financial system is now at risk. Meanwhile, a Hong Kong lawmaker has taken note, promising enforcement action if these claims hold up. So, this isn’t just crypto drama anymore soon, it could become a major legal and political issue. FDT Fires Back FDT hasn’t taken the allegations lightly. The company denied everything, calling Sun’s claims a smear campaign meant to damage its reputation and that of FDUSD. They insist they’re solvent and plan to pursue legal action to defend themselves. Despite the controversy, FDUSD has mostly held its value, staying above $0.99. But in crypto, perception matters and damage to trust can be hard to repair. Why It Matters Sun argues that while the U.S. acted quickly in the FTX case to protect financial integrity, Hong Kong needs to do the same now. With crypto adoption growing and more governments setting rules, this could become a defining moment for Hong Kong’s crypto credibility. If Sun’s claims prove true, it might be the biggest crypto scandal since FTX and this time, the world is watching.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|FDUSD|TUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 07:44:29

However, they must abide by guidelines meant to protect users from associated risks. According to a notice published by the Securities and Futures Commission on April 7, crypto firms operating in the region that hold a virtual asset trading platforms license may offer staking services. Though, they must take necessary measures to protect customers and fully disclose the potential risks associated with staking virtual assets. Staking allows customers to generate yield through their crypto holdings. This is done through “locking up” the crypto asset for a certain period of time and accumulating interest from it. Platforms usually offer this feature through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that generates returns and distributes it to investors. Before firms can start offering staking services in their Hong Kong product suite, they must first receive formal approval from the SFC. The prior written approval will include specific requirements that crypto platforms have to follow before they can start providing staking services. The SFC claimed that it has adjusted its circular framework on virtual asset funds to facilitate staking. One of the requirements mandates companies to only partner with licensed VATPs and authorized institutes for staking crypto assets. You might also like: Fake ‘Hong Kong coin’ promoted by chief executive impersonator account Hong Kong regulators aim to prioritize crypto industry Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Julia Leung, stated that expanding their virtual asset guidelines to accommodate crypto staking products is an important part of encouraging growth within Hong Kong’s digital asset ecosystem. “But the broadening must be done in a regulated environment where the safety of client virtual assets continues to be front and center of the compliance framework for offering such service,” said Leung in her statement. Hong Kong regulators have been making regulatory moves to accelerate the growth of their crypto industry. By the end of 2024, the region was criticized for its slow-moving licensing process, falling behind other Asian countries like Singapore . Earlier today during the Hong Kong Web3 Festival 2025, the Hong Kong government announced that it would soon launch a stablecoin legislation alongside licenses for over-the-counter transactions and custody businesses. Moreover, it aims to also allow licensed spot ETFs to provide staking services.

The panicked investors trigger a massive sell-off while the big whales have begun to liquidate massive amounts of ETH. This has set the stage for a huge descending trend, reviving the possibility of the beginning of a bear market. More Than 270,000 ETH Holdings At Stake In times of uncertainty, the whale movements have a massive impact on the upcoming price action. Interestingly, these have been shedding out their holdings, creating more panic among the market participants. As per some reports, a whale got liquidated for 67,570 ETH, worth more than $106 million with ETH at $1,650. Source:x Yet another whale who had held more than $22 million worth of ETH converts all his holdings into stablecoins. In the past few hours, this whale deposited more than 14,000 ETH into Binance and withdrew 15.5 million stablecoins. The whale had held the second-largest token for over 10 years and is now turning all the holdings into stablecoins, flashing a massive bearish signal or prudent hedging. In the latest development , a whale with 220K ETH and over $340 million just repaid 3.52 million DAI and deposited 10,000 ETH, lowering the liquidation price to $1,119.3. If the price drops below the liquidation price, all 220,000 ETH will be liquidated, which raises huge alarms. Yet another whale is feared to liquidate more than 15,000 ETH if he fails to increase the collateral or repay the debt. On the other hand, the spot ETH ETF witnessed huge outflows of over 26,230 ETH worth over $50 million, substantiating the bearish claim. Will Ethereum’s (ETH) Price Drop Below $1000? The latest market dynamics have caused the ETH price to plunge below the support levels, which have been a strong base since 2020. Despite this, the bulls remain passive, suggesting a lack of confidence amid the growing uncertainty due to the global market conditions. After breaking the major support, the selling pressure does not appear to have settled; hence, it keeps the bearish possibilities alive. As seen in the above weekly chart of ETH, the price is hedging towards the crucial support close to $1400, the 2018 highs, which may push the levels heavily down if broken. The weekly RSI has dropped to the lower threshold. Last time this happened was in 2022, which has dragged the levels below $900 from the highs above $4800. If the levels plunge below 30, a drop below $1000 could be imminent for the Ethereum (ETH) price.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 07:47:48

The tech-heavy Nasdaq futures are currently in a freefall, sending ripples of concern across global markets. If you’re tracking your investments or keeping an eye on market trends, you’ve likely noticed the alarming red numbers flashing across your screens. According to the latest data from TradingView, the NASDAQ 100 E-mini Futures are currently sitting at $16,632.25, marking a significant 5.14% drop in just the last 24 hours. But what’s fueling this dramatic market crash , and more importantly, what should investors like you be doing amidst this volatility? Let’s dive into the details to understand the current situation and strategize a path forward. Why Are Nasdaq Futures Experiencing a Sharp Decline? The significant dip in Nasdaq futures isn’t happening in isolation. Several interconnected factors are contributing to this bearish trend, creating a perfect storm in the financial markets. Understanding these factors is crucial for grasping the current market sentiment and anticipating potential future movements. Inflationary Pressures Remain Persistent: Despite efforts to curb inflation, recent economic data suggests that price increases are proving to be more stubborn than initially anticipated. This persistent inflation erodes purchasing power and forces central banks to maintain or even increase hawkish monetary policies. Anticipation of Further Interest Rate Hikes: To combat inflation, central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the US, are expected to continue raising interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, which can slow down economic growth and negatively impact corporate earnings, especially for growth-oriented tech companies heavily represented in the Nasdaq. Geopolitical Uncertainties and Global Economic Slowdown: Ongoing geopolitical tensions and concerns about a global economic slowdown are adding to investor anxieties. These uncertainties create a risk-off environment, prompting investors to move away from riskier assets like tech stocks and futures contracts. Profit-Taking After a Period of Growth: The Nasdaq, particularly the tech sector, has experienced substantial growth over the past year. Some investors may be engaging in profit-taking, selling off their holdings to secure gains, which can exacerbate downward pressure on prices. In essence, the current stock market decline is a confluence of macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment. The fear of continued inflation, higher interest rates, and global economic instability is weighing heavily on the markets, leading to the sharp drop in Nasdaq futures. Impact of Market Volatility on Tech Stocks The Nasdaq 100 index is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, making it particularly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment related to economic growth and interest rates. Here’s how this market crash scenario specifically impacts tech stocks: Impact Area Description Reduced Growth Expectations Tech companies, often valued on future growth potential, become less attractive when economic growth is expected to slow down. Higher interest rates also make future earnings less valuable in present terms. Increased Borrowing Costs Many tech companies, especially startups and those in expansion phases, rely on borrowing to fund their operations and growth initiatives. Higher interest rates increase their borrowing costs, potentially impacting profitability. Investor Risk Aversion In times of economic uncertainty, investors tend to become more risk-averse. Tech stocks, often considered higher-risk investments compared to more stable sectors, are typically among the first to be sold off during market downturns. Valuation Corrections After periods of rapid growth, tech stock valuations can become stretched. Market corrections, like the current one, can lead to a reassessment of these valuations, bringing them more in line with current economic realities. Therefore, the current decline in Nasdaq futures is a strong indicator of potential continued volatility and downward pressure on tech stock prices. Investors holding significant tech stock portfolios should be prepared for further fluctuations and consider strategies to mitigate risk. Navigating the Stock Market Decline: Investment Strategies for Turbulent Times While a stock market decline can be unsettling, it also presents opportunities for savvy investors. The key is to adopt a strategic approach to navigate these turbulent times. Here are some investment strategy considerations: Review and Rebalance Your Portfolio: Assess your current portfolio allocation. Is it still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals? Consider rebalancing your portfolio by reducing exposure to higher-risk assets and potentially increasing allocations to more defensive sectors or asset classes. Focus on Long-Term Value Investing: Market downturns can create opportunities to buy quality stocks at discounted prices. Focus on companies with strong fundamentals, solid balance sheets, and sustainable business models that are likely to weather economic storms and thrive in the long run. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider employing dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market price. This strategy can help reduce risk and potentially lower your average purchase cost over time. Diversification is Key: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies. Diversification can help mitigate risk and reduce the impact of downturns in any single area of the market. Stay Informed and Seek Professional Advice: Keep abreast of market developments and economic news. Consult with a qualified financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and investment goals. Remember, market corrections are a normal part of the economic cycle. A well-thought-out investment strategy , coupled with patience and discipline, can help you not only weather the storm but also position yourself for long-term financial success. Trading Outlook for Nasdaq Futures: What to Expect Next? Predicting the exact bottom of a market decline is notoriously difficult, and the trading outlook for Nasdaq futures remains uncertain in the short term. However, considering the current market dynamics, here are a few potential scenarios and factors to watch: Continued Volatility: Expect continued volatility in the near term as markets react to ongoing economic data, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments. Potential for Further Downside: Given the prevailing bearish sentiment and macroeconomic headwinds, there is a possibility of further downside in Nasdaq futures and the broader stock market. Monitor Economic Data Closely: Pay close attention to upcoming inflation reports, GDP growth figures, and employment data. These indicators will provide clues about the future direction of interest rates and the overall economic health, significantly influencing market sentiment. Earnings Season and Corporate Guidance: The upcoming earnings season will be crucial. Focus on corporate earnings reports and management guidance for insights into company performance and future prospects. Strong earnings and positive outlooks could provide some support to the market. Opportunities for Strategic Entry: While short-term volatility may persist, the current market downturn could present strategic entry points for long-term investors. Keep a watchlist of quality companies and be prepared to deploy capital when valuations become more attractive. In conclusion, while the current trading outlook for Nasdaq futures suggests continued caution and potential for further declines, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. Market downturns are temporary, and history shows that markets eventually recover. By staying informed, adopting a strategic approach, and focusing on long-term goals, investors can navigate these challenging times effectively.

Tether ( USDT ) CEO Paolo Ardoino says the company may consider launching a stablecoin specifically for the U.S. if new rules make the market more competitive. Speaking to the Financial Times , Ardoino said the company was involved in discussions about U.S. stablecoin rules and that the administration viewed them as “an important instrument for the United States,” though he didn’t elaborate on the details of those discussions. He also added that if the new rules make U.S. domestic stablecoins competitive, there could be an “interest from Tether to create a domestic stablecoin in the U.S.,” calling it “basically a settlement currency.” You might also like: Tether buys another $735M in BTC in Q1, bringing total holdings to $8.2B As of press time, Tether doesn’t serve U.S. customers, though it’s one of the most traded cryptocurrency worldwide, with around $144 billion worth of tokens in circulation. The company’s user base now exceeds 400 million, according to Ardoino, who recently said stablecoins are becoming part of a broader “stablecoin multiverse.” The U.S. is preparing new rules that may require foreign stablecoin issuers to follow local enforcement laws. Ardoino implied that “that is something that we [already] do… voluntarily,” adding that “we are the only ones that on-board the FBI, on-board the U.S. Secret Services.” Read more: Circle files IPO amid declining profits and stiffening competition — will this shake Tether’s stablecoin dominance?",News|Regulation|Stablecoin|Tether,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-07 07:51:33

The move, which imposes a 10% tariff on all countries —sent U.S. stock futures into freefall. As expected, the ripple effect didn’t spare crypto. Bitcoin slid more than 9.4% in just 24 hours, currently trading around $75,000. Ethereum bore a heavier blow, tumbling over 18.6% and clawing its way back to $1,466 at press time. The overall crypto market cap dropped over 11%, now sitting at around $2.37 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which gauges market sentiment, dipped to 23—deep in “extreme fear” territory. Sundays are typically more illiquid in global markets, but the scale of this drop felt different. Charlie Sherry, head of finance at BTC Markets, explained that thin weekend liquidity can exaggerate volatility. “A few big sell-offs, and things snowball,” he said. “But there’s no mystery here—the tariff shock has spooked everyone.” Wall Street Futures Dive Alongside Crypto The tremors weren’t isolated to digital assets. Stock futures pointed to a rough week ahead. Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, the Nasdaq bled red, and the Dow Jones futures fell by over 8%. Analysts from The Kobeissi Letter called the situation dire, stating that the S&P 500 is now officially in “bear market territory.” In a post on X, they noted the U.S. stock market has erased $400 billion daily, on average, for the past 32 sessions. Tom Dunleavy of MV Global even speculated it could become the “worst three-day move for U.S. stocks of all time” if Monday’s markets open in the red again. Tariffs and Talk of Bitcoin Resilience Despite the chaos, some in the crypto world see opportunity. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes this tariff-fueled economic instability might actually benefit Bitcoin in the long term. “Chaos and uncertainty are breeding grounds for alternative assets,” he said in a Telegram note. Meanwhile, President Trump is standing firm. On Truth Social, he declared tariffs “a beautiful thing to behold,” insisting the U.S. must correct long-standing trade imbalances. Whether that correction causes a sustained crypto rally or deeper market turbulence remains to be seen.

Based on data from Tokenomist, Aptos (APT) is at the forefront with about $49.76 million in tokens due for release. That constitutes 2.47% of its overall supply. This token release is happening at a difficult moment for the cryptocurrency market as Bitcoin recently fell to $75,000, failing to hold above $80,000. Aptos leads large token cliff unlocks Aptos (APT) is positioned at the top of this week’s token unlock schedule with 11.31 million tokens worth $49.76 million set to be released. This makes it the largest single unlock by value among all cryptocurrencies during this period. Following Aptos, SAGA is scheduled for an even larger unlock in terms of percentage of supply. As per the data, 133.33 million tokens valued at $33.58 million are entering circulation. This release will add 222.22% to SAGA’s current supply. Source: Wu Blockchain Some other large cliff unlocks are Axie Infinity (AXS) with 9.09 million tokens ($22.73 million, 3.58% of supply), MOVE with 50 million tokens ($16.16 million, 2.08% of supply), and TNSR with 120 million tokens ($14.58 million, 35.86% of supply). The definition “cliff unlock” applies to a model of token distribution in which lots of tokens all come on-stream simultaneously, rather than spread over time. Solana unlocks $50 million worth SOL Solana (SOL) dominates the linear unlock category with 465,770 SOL tokens worth $50.05 million to be released progressively this week. Unlike cliff unlocks where all the tokens are dropped at once, linear unlocks provide tokens progressively over a predetermined duration. Although the dollar value is large, this SOL unlock constitutes merely 0.09% of the prevailing circulating supply. The relatively small percentage impact on Solana’s supply suggests the unlock may have minimal direct effect on SOL’s price. The unlock comes at a time when SOL has dropped below the $100 level. Following Solana, Worldcoin (WLD) has the second-largest linear unlock with 37.23 million tokens worth $24.04 million (3.02% of circulating supply). Celestia (TIA) follows with 6.96 million tokens valued at $16.91 million (1.20% of supply), while Dogecoin (DOGE) will see 96.52 million tokens worth $16.09 million released. However, this represents just 0.06% of its massive supply. Other notable linear unlocks include OM ($14.49 million), TAO ($9.61 million), Avalanche ($11.35 million), Sui ($7.18 million), Polkadot ($8.52 million), and Internet Protocol ($9.60 million). Each of these projects will see their tokens gradually enter circulation throughout the week. Less popular token unlocks According to CoinMarketCap data, beyond the major token unlocks, several smaller or less mainstream cryptocurrencies are also scheduled for substantial unlocks this week. Among the smaller market cap tokens undergoing unlocks, Self Chain (SLF) is currently showing a 45.38% unlock progress with 9.89 million SLF tokens (worth $1.82 million) scheduled as its next unlock. The token has already dropped 11.98% in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Masa (MASA) is another token facing substantial unlocks, with 42.03% of its unlock schedule completed and 23.86 million tokens worth approximately $320,305 set for release. MASA has seen a sharp 21.53% decline in the last 24 hours. This is among the steepest drops of all tokens with scheduled unlocks. Trossard (TROSS) is approaching its next unlock of 100.02 million tokens. The project is currently at 38.17% of its total unlock schedule. Port3 Network (PORT3) has completed 19.25% of its unlock schedule, with 28.16 million tokens worth approximately $343,679 scheduled for its next release. This represents 2.82% of the total locked supply. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

It will be decided by who leads in cryptography. Just as past industrial and technological revolutions in its private sector yielded the US an edge in global power, the ability to secure and verify information through cryptographic breakthroughs, especially in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, will determine the balance of power in the digital age. The US risks falling behind. While China and other nations invest aggressively in technological advancements , America lacks a national strategy to maintain leadership in this critical domain. It’s time to recognize cryptography as a foundational technological asset and a key to securing the country’s economic and national security future. From industrial might During the world wars of the previous century, the US maintained a dominant global position through industrial strength. The country supplied around 75% of the oil used by the Allies in WWI and around 85% of their oil in WWII. The US also manufactured approximately two-thirds of all military equipment used by the Allies in the latter, playing a pivotal role in the war’s outcome. Industrial strength was not merely an asset. It was a strategic advantage in global conflicts. American influence will continue to be tied to the private sector’s innovations, especially as we move into more technologically advanced forms of warfare. To software superiority Superiority in software has become the most efficient way to sustain US leadership worldwide. Stuxnet offers an example in recent history. In 2010, the software-based operation led by the US and Israeli governments was able to remotely crash Iran’s nuclear development program without deploying a single soldier. Recent: ‘National emergency’ as Trump’s tariffs dent crypto prices Today’s private companies have followed suit and developed new software technologies for national defense purposes that have become essential in maintaining the US’s competitive edge. Defense contractors have enhanced US global influence with their contributions to AI, surveillance and advanced analytics for national security purposes. The historical trend is set to continue as cryptography starts to play an increasingly important role in defense technology. Cryptography and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs The use cases for cryptography, specifically ZK-proofs, extend far beyond the protection of financial transactions. Consider a shift in focus from the AI race for a bit. In that case, ZK-proofs become critical for more immediately tangible purposes, such as securing the country’s digital infrastructure. The US Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Department of Defense have already acknowledged the strategic importance of ZK-proofs for defense and national security and developed the Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) program. NASA and the European Space Agency are exploring blockchain and ZK-proofs to ensure the authenticity of satellite communication commands and prevent cyberattacks . Private sector contributions are embedding secure cryptographic elements into drones to prevent hacking and ensure safe defense and critical infrastructure operations. At the same time, cybersecurity firms are leveraging blockchain to create secure digital identity ecosystems . The private sector is currently at the forefront of innovation in this field. In 2019, there was a boom in research papers focused on ZK-proof technology driven by private efforts to find better solutions in blockchain scalability via ZK-rollups. New and innovative approaches to ZK-proofs emerged, with most of the research being led and funded by crypto companies in the private sector. These are all production-ready, future-proof technologies that are finding their way into civilian applications but could be applied to military purposes just as quickly. Global leadership through innovation America’s dynamism in the digital age, particularly in cryptography and blockchain technologies, will define its future role as a global power. The US must make bold, strategic investments in private-sector and public-sector research and development for ZK-proofs to maintain its leadership in cryptographic technologies, which are now indispensable to national security, defense and economic stability. With a pro-crypto administration and a supportive Congress, the time has come to move beyond merely regulating crypto as an investment class. There must be active cultivation and support for innovation in cryptography and emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs. The centuries-old relationship between the private sector and the government must continue to defend national interests. This is America’s moment to build a new wave of industrial and technological dominance. It’s time to seize this opportunity and ensure the next century of global leadership is powered by American innovation. Opinion by: Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, co-founder and CEO of Lagrange.

Yet crypto analyst Kevin, who posts under the handle @Kev_Capital_TA on X, has reiterated his stance that Dogecoin still holds a critical “bull market line” and builds momentum higher if broader market conditions improve. Dogecoin Must Hold Above This Price In a new update, Kevin writes: “Nothing much has changed on Dogecoin since my last post on 3/22. Higher time frame indicators are mostly reset and we are holding the bull market line in the sand of support. This may not be the popular X take at the moment but engaging on people’s fears is not what we do here. As long as BTC cooperates and economic data comes in favorable I say send it higher within the next few weeks.” He references an older post from March 22 in which he laid out a comprehensive technical perspective on Dogecoin’s position. In that post, he pointed to the $0.139 price level as the coin’s “Last line of bull market support,” warning that a durable weekly close below the multi-year downtrend line could signal a profound shift in sentiment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Moment Of Truth: Will It Hold The Line Or Freefall? “My #Dogecoin Community it is about that time where I must provide you the Alpha you all desire,” he wrote in March. “If we take a look at DOGE on the weekly time frame we can see that we received a weekly demand candle last week at the ‘Last line of bull market support’ [which is at $0.139] that I pointed out a couple of weeks ago. It will continue to be absolutely vital that Dogecoin hold this level while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3 Day MACD, Weekly Stoch RSI and 2W Stoch RSI all of which are getting very close to being fully reset.” According to Kevin’s assessment, those particular indicators—which are commonly used to gauge momentum and potential overbought or oversold conditions—are crucial for traders looking to pinpoint when Dogecoin might next see an upward price swing. He also mentioned a target for Bitcoin not to fall below $70,000 if Dogecoin’s bullish framework was to remain intact, emphasizing that broader crypto market conditions often set the pace for high-beta altcoins like DOGE. DOGE Vs. Global Liquidity In yesterday’s post, Kevin delved deeper into the macroeconomic context, overlaying the Global Liquidity Index onto Dogecoin’s price chart. In his words, “If we take a look at #Dogecoin with the Global Liquidity Index overlaid you can see we are at a very interesting point here. On the LOG chart DOGE is back testing the breakout point of what was the entire bear market range that lasted from May of 2021 to October of 2024.” This reference to a prolonged bear market range underscores the extent to which Dogecoin’s price has traveled between its 2021 peaks and subsequent declines. He further explains that this region coincides with the “macro .382” at $0.142 when measuring from the previous bull market highs to the bear market lows, which he regards as a major inflection point and a potential springboard for a renewed rally, provided the market cooperates. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.57 Or $0.06? Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level Kevin attributes a large share of crypto price direction to broader liquidity conditions, writing that “Global liquidity has shown to be throughout all of history a major driver of risk asset prices especially #Altcoins and we can see here that it has been trading perfectly in this downward channel since May of 2022 which lines up with central bank tightening of monetary policy across the globe as inflation was sky rocketing.” As global monetary authorities begin to wind down or at least slow the pace of interest rate hikes, liquidity levels may start to edge higher again. In his assessment, this easing, even if gradual, could supply the necessary fuel for a breakout in both market liquidity and Dogecoin’s price. “Based on history I believe it will likely start to breakout here. If the correlation remains true as it has through the years then this back test on Doge specially is providing one of the best risk reward ratios you can ask for in a long term hold entry or swing play,” he says, while making clear that a failure to hold $0.139 “durably below” would be his invalidation point. At press time, DOGE was just below Kevin’s last “bull line” and was trading at $0.13558.

43023792,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146816,1744012819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Truth: Are Meta’s AI Benchmarks for Maverick Model Misleading?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-benchmark-truth-revealed/,"The world of Artificial Intelligence is constantly evolving, with new models and breakthroughs announced almost daily. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors tracking AI’s impact on blockchain and decentralized technologies, understanding the true capabilities of these AI models is crucial. Recently, Meta, a tech giant increasingly involved in the AI space, unveiled its new flagship AI model, Maverick. Initial reports placed Maverick high in AI benchmark rankings, specifically on the LM Arena platform. But, is everything as it seems? Let’s dive into the revealing details and uncover potential discrepancies in Meta’s AI benchmarks for Maverick. Are Meta’s Maverick AI Model Benchmarks on LM Arena Genuinely Representative? When Meta launched Maverick, it quickly climbed to the second spot on the LM Arena leaderboard. This ranking, based on human evaluations comparing different AI model outputs, initially suggested Maverick was a top-tier performer. However, eagle-eyed AI researchers soon noticed something amiss. It appears the version of Maverick showcased on LM Arena, dubbed an “experimental chat version” by Meta itself, isn’t the same as the publicly accessible version for developers. This distinction raises serious questions about the validity of these AI benchmarks and their relevance for practical applications. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Customized for Benchmarks: Meta’s own Llama website states that the LM Arena testing utilized “Llama 4 Maverick optimized for conversationality.” This suggests a tailored version specifically designed to excel in LM Arena’s evaluation format. Benchmark Reliability Questioned: LM Arena, while popular, has faced scrutiny regarding its reliability as a definitive measure of AI model performance. Customizing a model specifically for this benchmark amplifies these concerns. Misleading Developers: The core issue is transparency. If the benchmarked version differs significantly from the standard Meta AI models available to developers, it becomes difficult to accurately predict real-world performance. This lack of clarity can hinder effective development and integration of the model. The Problem with Tailored Benchmarks: Why Does it Matter? Imagine purchasing a cryptocurrency mining rig based on advertised benchmark speeds, only to find the actual performance falls short in real-world mining scenarios. Similarly, in the AI world, misleading AI benchmarks can lead to wasted resources and misinformed decisions. Here’s why tailoring models for benchmarks is problematic: Distorted Performance Snapshot: Benchmarks should ideally provide an unbiased overview of a model’s strengths and weaknesses across various tasks. Customization defeats this purpose, offering an inflated or skewed representation. Unpredictable Real-World Behavior: Developers rely on benchmarks to gauge how a model will perform in specific contexts. A benchmark-optimized version doesn’t accurately reflect the behavior of the ‘vanilla’ model, making predictions unreliable. Erosion of Trust: Transparency is paramount in the tech world, especially with rapidly advancing technologies like AI. Discrepancies between benchmarked and publicly available Meta AI models can erode trust in both the model and the company providing it. Stark Differences Observed: Maverick on LM Arena vs. Publicly Downloadable Version Researchers on X (formerly Twitter) have already highlighted noticeable differences between the LM Arena Maverick and the downloadable version. These observations further fuel concerns about the representativeness of the LM Arena benchmarks. Examples of Discrepancies: Feature LM Arena Maverick Publicly Downloadable Maverick Emoji Usage Excessive Moderate/Normal Answer Length Long-winded, verbose More concise Overall Behavior Potentially ‘cooked’ or over-optimized for conversational tasks More balanced and general-purpose These seemingly superficial differences can indicate underlying adjustments made to the Maverick AI model specifically for the LM Arena evaluation. While conversational ability is important, optimizing solely for this aspect might come at the expense of other crucial performance metrics.

For developers, investors in AI-driven crypto projects, and the broader tech community, accurate and reliable benchmarks are essential for informed decision-making. Key Takeaways: Demand Transparency: AI companies should be transparent about any modifications or optimizations made to models used for benchmarking. Critical Benchmark Evaluation: Users should critically assess benchmark results and consider the methodology and potential biases of different evaluation platforms like LM Arena . Focus on Real-World Performance: Ultimately, the true measure of an AI model’s value lies in its performance in real-world applications, not just benchmark scores. As the AI landscape continues to evolve and intersect with cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, staying informed about the nuances of AI model evaluation is paramount. The Maverick case serves as a potent reminder to look beyond headline rankings and delve deeper into the details behind the AI benchmarks we encounter.

Anticipating a retest, it is yet to find a solid ground level. Starting the year on a bearish note, LDO posted a significant loss after forming a double-top pattern at $2.5 in late January. This pattern halted bullish sentiments, and the crypto took a sharp downturn after reinitiating drops from $2 in mid-February. The price fell consistently for a month before locating support above the $0.8 level in the following month. This lured the bears into the market, and they took control from a short-term scale. A bounce occurred and the price retraced briefly above $1. It lost momentum and resumed selling in late March. That led to a bearish crossover as the selling volume continues to increase daily. Today marked another major dip in LDO’s price after two weeks of sell, and is now looking extremely bearish on the day. Closing this week on a strong bearish note, it may register more losses in the upcoming week. Otherwise, it may consolidate for a while before releasing pressure. A retracement move from the current trading level could bring a slight retest at the broken $0.8 level before resuming selling. Such a move is not realistic at the moment as selling exhaustion is yet to set in. LDO’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview While there’s currently no key support level on the way down, the price is reaching $0.7. Lower levels to consider for a test are $0.6 and $0.5. Towards the upside, LDO marks resistance at $0.815. If the market recovers above this price level, the $0.92 resistance is the next level to watch, followed by $1.05.

Kang criticized the asset’s $215 billion market cap, pointing out the disconnect between Ethereum’s valuation and its underlying fundamentals. He noted that it seemed “absurd” for Ethereum to maintain such a market cap while growth and earnings were negative, especially considering that the speculative boom in the cryptocurrency market has clearly abated. “The downtrend is still valid,” he added.

According to data from crypto.news, BTC ( BTC ) has fallen as low as $74,604 in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has seen its price plummet around 30% below its all-time high price at $108,786, which occurred just three months prior. At press time, Bitcoin has recovered only slightly to $73,793. It has not yet managed to return to levels above $75,000. Its market cap has also suffered from the decrease in price, falling by nearly 8% and losing nearly $67 billion in the process. Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $1.48 trillion. The sharp decline comes shortly after Asian, European and American markets reported alarming drops in major stocks in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Asian markets, in particular, are seeing the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. On April 7, Japan’s main index, Nikkei 225, closed 7.8% lower than the previous date, while the broader Topix exchange decreased by 7.7%.

Imagine diving into the retro world of Quake II, but with a twist – it’s powered by AI Gaming . Yes, you heard that right! Microsoft’s Copilot AI has conjured up a playable demo of the classic shooter, accessible right in your browser. This isn’t just about reliving the 90s; it’s a peek into the future of interactive entertainment, and it’s raising some serious questions about where Generative AI is headed, especially in the realm of gaming. But before you get too hyped, Microsoft is upfront about the ‘limitations.’ Let’s unpack what this all means and why it’s a big deal. What is Microsoft’s AI-Powered Quake II Demo? Microsoft’s foray into AI Gaming takes the form of a browser-based demo level of Quake II. Think of it as a tech showcase for the gaming muscles of Microsoft’s Copilot AI platform. Here’s the gist: Playable AI World: Using their Muse family of AI models, Microsoft researchers trained the AI on a Quake II level. The result? An environment you can actually play in, controlled by your keyboard. Instant Interaction: The AI responds in real-time to your actions. Move, shoot, jump – your inputs shape the game world instantly. Research Exploration: Microsoft emphasizes this is experimental. It’s about “playing the model” not “playing the game” in the traditional sense. Try it Yourself: You can jump in and experience this for a limited time. Navigate the level, shoot barrels, and see AI gaming in action firsthand. This demo is more than just a fun experiment; it’s a tangible example of how Generative AI can create interactive experiences. For those in the crypto and tech space, this mirrors the rapid advancements we’re seeing in AI across various sectors, pushing boundaries and challenging what’s possible. Delving into the ‘Limitations’ of AI-Generated Gaming Microsoft is transparent about the shortcomings, and it’s crucial to understand them to grasp the current state of AI Gaming . Here are the key limitations they acknowledge: Fuzzy Enemies: Don’t expect crystal-clear graphics. Enemies can appear blurry, a visual reminder this is AI-generated and not traditionally rendered. Inaccurate Counters: Health and damage indicators might not be perfectly reliable. Gameplay isn’t about precise mechanics, but exploring the AI’s creation. Object Permanence Issues: This is perhaps the most striking limitation. The AI struggles to remember objects out of view for even a short time (under a second!). This means enemies can vanish and reappear unexpectedly. However, Microsoft cleverly spins this limitation into a quirky feature. Imagine defeating enemies by just looking away and then back! Or teleporting by glancing at the sky. These ‘bugs’ become unexpected gameplay mechanics, adding a surreal, almost comical element to the experience. Is This the Future of Game Preservation or a Misunderstanding? The demo sparked debate, particularly around Game Preservation . Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously suggested AI could help preserve classic games by making them “portable to any platform.” But game designer Austin Walker isn’t convinced. He argues this approach misses the point of what makes games special. Walker’s Critique: Loss of Edge Cases: Walker points out that the beauty of games like Quake lies in their intricate inner workings – code, design, art – that produce specific, sometimes surprising, gameplay scenarios (“edge cases”). Rebuilding vs. Simulating: AI simulation, like this demo, doesn’t rebuild the game’s core logic. It creates an approximation. This means losing access to those unpredictable and often delightful edge cases that emerge from the original game’s design. Fundamental Misunderstanding: Walker suggests this approach reveals a “fundamental misunderstanding” of both AI tech and how games actually work. It’s not just about visual or mechanical replication, but about preserving the nuanced interplay of systems that define a game’s unique character. Walker’s perspective is vital. While Generative AI can create impressive simulations, it’s not a straightforward replacement for the original artistry and engineering of game development. For crypto enthusiasts familiar with the nuances of blockchain technology, this resonates. Just as a simplified blockchain might miss the crucial security or decentralization aspects of the real deal, an AI-generated game might lose the subtle magic of the original. Why Should Crypto and Tech Enthusiasts Care About AI Gaming Demos? You might be thinking, “Okay, AI Quake II… cool, but what’s in it for me?” Here’s why this demo is relevant beyond just gaming: Showcase of AI Capabilities: This is a highly visible, interactive demonstration of what Microsoft Copilot and similar AI platforms can achieve. It’s not just theoretical; it’s playable. Exploring Generative AI Limits: The acknowledged “limitations” are just as important as the successes. Understanding where AI falters helps guide future development and manage expectations across all AI applications, not just gaming. Implications for the Metaverse and Interactive Worlds: As we move towards more immersive digital experiences, the ability of AI to generate and dynamically manage these worlds becomes crucial. This demo offers a glimpse into that future. Debate on Authenticity and Preservation: The discussion around Game Preservation mirrors broader debates about authenticity in the digital age. What do we value? Perfect replication or functional approximation? These questions are relevant in art, history, and even the preservation of decentralized technologies. In essence, the Quake II Demo is a microcosm of the larger AI revolution. It’s fun, it’s flawed, and it’s incredibly insightful. It prompts us to think about the potential and pitfalls as AI becomes increasingly integrated into our digital lives. Final Thoughts: AI Gaming – Intriguing Potential, Real Limitations Microsoft’s AI-generated Quake II demo is undeniably intriguing. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the potential of Generative AI to create interactive experiences. While it’s not about to replace traditional game development anytime soon, it opens up exciting possibilities for rapid prototyping, dynamic content generation, and perhaps even novel forms of gameplay we haven’t yet imagined. The “limitations” are real, but they are also part of the learning process. As AI models evolve, these boundaries will undoubtedly shift, and demos like this are crucial steps in that evolution.

In a Sunday blog post , Lopp cautioned Bitcoin holders, stressing the recent surge in attacks, where attackers mimic wallet addresses. An 18‑month blockchain study recorded nearly 48,000 suspicious transactions he wrote, adding that some victims have lost significant funds. Lopp also emphasized that such attacks are “only economically feasible during low-fee environments.” This means that the low fees in Bitcoin’s blockchain fuel such scams . Attackers Use Victim’s Transaction History for “Poisoning” According to Lopp’s findings, Bitcoin poisoning attack is similar to social engineering, where the attacker generates a Bitcoin address akin to the victim’s recently used addresses. The attackers use brute force or trial and error in an attempt to guess or crack private keys. The perpetrator then deposits a small amount of crypto into that address. “Then they ‘poison’ the target’s transaction history by sending the funds from this similar-looking address to the victim’s address.” Victims may unknowingly copy a previously used address from their transaction history without realizing it’s the attacker’s spoofed address. In January, pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Mononaut flagged “address poisoning dust attack,” cautioning users not to copy addresses from your transaction history. address poisoning dust attack be careful out there! don't copy addresses from your transaction history https://t.co/upRE493CCG pic.twitter.com/W5CdWlvvyW — mononaut (@mononautical) January 27, 2025 According to Lopp, the first such transactions did not appear until July 7, 2023, which recorded 36 such transactions on block 797570. “Then, all was quiet until block 819455, December 12, 2023, after which we can find regular bursts of these transactions up until block 881172, January 28, 2025, then there was a 2-month break before they started up again.” Attack Has No Specific Pattern Further, Lopp highlighted that it is hard to see a specific pattern in the poisoning attack. “I suspect the attackers were only looking at addresses with recent activity in the past year or so.” However, surprisingly, more than 12,000 targeted addresses had never spent funds. Additionally, most targeted addresses had fewer than 10 deposits. It was clear that the attackers generally ignored addresses with balances under 1 BTC, he added. Lopp cautioned Bitcoin holders to avoid relying on memory or recent transactions. “Don’t trust addresses just because they appear in your transaction history – even from deposits,” he wrote. “Don’t reuse addresses, period!

Joining the broader trend of the global financial market, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dipped, capping off an “ugly” Monday. In tandem with the equities market downtrend, BTC took a sharp dive, hitting severe lows. This major market downturn could be attributed to US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. Let’s take a closer look at Bitcoin’s current trend and its future journey. What Happens to Bitcoin Price? In a shocking turn of events, the Bitcoin price has seen a significant downtrend, kicking off the week on a disastrous note. Analyst Michael van de Poppe addresses today as a “Black Monday” in response to the market’s steep fall. The analyst noted that it’s hard to judge how deep the market will go in times of panic. He added that several key developments are on the horizon that could determine the market’s future track. However, van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin price’s rollercoaster ride will continue for the next two weeks. He noted, “I think we’ll see a rollercoaster 1-2 weeks in which we’re having a test of the lows for Bitcoin.” Global Financial Market Tumbles: What’s Next? Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, the stock market saw a massive decline, marking its largest fall since 2020. Experts predicted that the Bitcoin price would remain resilient to the industry-wide slump despite its strong correlation with the stock market. Notably, the Chinese stock market fell on Monday with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 10% in morning trade, marking the largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis. Aligning with this major shift, the Bitcoin price dipped to massive lows, contrasting expert predictions. A Severe Downtrend Ahead- What Awaits Bitcoin Price? As highlighted by Michael van de Poppe, the Bitcoin price could dip to $70k if its downtrend continues. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $75,204, down 9.6% in a day. Over the past seven days, the crypto has seen a decline of 7% while marking a 13% plummet in a month. Analyst MMCrypto predicted that Bitcoin is heading towards more steep declines. Considering the unpredictability of the crypto market, it needs to be seen if the Bitcoin price would further slip or make a bullish reversal.

It appears to have resumed impulsive moves after undergoing a short retracement in March. The last 24 hours saw OP through its biggest daily loss in two weeks as it reached a new monthly low today. This came with a significant crack to where it is priced at $0.61, although it is yet to find support. While last month’s trading was a bit relieving as the bears suspended pressure, things will likely get uglier in the next few days following the recent drag down. A technical look at the daily chart suggested that the supply level is currently high. A further increase in the supply level could cause severe pain and panic as it might put the market in a more bearish condition on the daily chart. As of now, the bulls are off the market. If they manage to step back with an interception, the selling may temporarily stop before resuming. This could bring a small recovery, as we experienced in March. Failure to recover might lead to a steady decrease until it finds support. Starting the second quarter of the years with a major sell-off signals a bearish continuation pattern. OP may post heavy losses before climbing back. Closing this quarter under $0.1 will signal a long-term bear run. OP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview OP is currently approaching the $0.6 level. A drop below this key level could send us to a low of $0.5. The next level for support would be $0.4. In the face of the dip, the bulls are technically suffering losses. If the market recovers, we may see a retest at $0.677. Higher resistance levels are mounted at $0.786 and $0.93.

The company’s mNAV multiple — market cap divided by the value of the holdings — sits just under 2, indicating the stock still trades at a premium. According to CoinDesk research , MSTR faces no liquidation risk even if bitcoin falls below its cost basis. As of April 2, Metaplanet (3350) disclosed bitcoin holdings of 4,206 BTC purchased at an average price of 12,925,027 yen ($88,800) per coin. That puts the Japanese company about 15% underwater on its bitcoin strategy. The stock dropped 20% on Monday alone, reflecting mounting pressure from the downturn. Semler Scientific (SMLR) has also seen losses on its bitcoin holdings, with an average acquisition cost of $87,854 per BTC, according to the most recent filing in February. With bitcoin down 20% this year, Semler has lost 38%, Metaplanet 15% and Strategy 2%.",Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|MetaPlanet,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 08:15:24

SOL has posted an over 60% decline since mid-January, with traders now concerned about how much further Solana will drop and whether a sub-$90 dip is on the horizon. Solana Price In Freefall Amid Intense Selloff Solana price trades at $97 at press time as risk assets record a brutal selloff due to President Trump’s tariffs. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that trading volumes have soared by more than 230% in 24 hours to $5.39 billion. This suggests that SOL has recorded billions of dollars in sell-side volumes. This decline has led to SOL recording the second-highest number of liquidations among altcoins. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, more than $62M long positions on Solana were liquidated. Despite this turbulence, a Solana whale remains optimistic that the Solana price could rebound . On-chain data shows that this address has staked 71,318 SOL, valued at over $7.63M, despite sitting at a loss. Token Unlocks At the same time, Helius Labs CEO noted that despite the dip, SOL was the most obvious bet amid the ongoing crypto market crash . He said, “I’m not sure how much lower the general market goes… but it is the most obvious asymmetrical bet for anyone without a time horizon.” Despite the optimism, other analysts speculate that the downtrend is not over yet, with a Solana price drop below $90 now looming. Will Solana Crash Below $90 This Week? Top crypto market analyst Jason Pizzino has stated that Solana price will likely crash below $90 this week. In his analysis, Pizzino noted that SOL is on the verge of a major correction like all top altcoins. Given that Solana has already dropped below $100 for the first time in twelve months, the analyst observed that the next target was $80. Hitting this level could then spark a crash below $60. Such a dip will represent an over 80% decline. Solana Price Chart Besides the bearish Solana price prediction by analysts, SOL is also headed for massive unlocks this week. Per Tokenomist, Solana will record 465,000 SOL unlocks , valued at more than $50M this week, which will trigger additional selling pressure. Meanwhile, the crypto fear and greed index has plummeted to a monthly low of 23, indicating that most traders are in a state of extreme fear. This further supports the bearish outlook, as it might precede an unwillingness by traders to buy the current dip. This data indicates that Solana price can drop below $90 this week.

The company executives shared this view at the recently organized UK Digital Assets Summit in partnership with Innovate Finance and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technology. According to Ripple Europe Policy Director Mathew Osborne, who wrote about the event, the UK already has the advantage of being one of the top financial services centers globally with expertise in various areas. Thus, the country only needs to enact the right regulations. Osborne noted that other jurisdictions, such as the European Union, Hong Kong, and Singapore, have already outdone the UK in regulating the crypto industry. However, he believes the UK has a second-mover advantage and can learn from these jurisdictions to create a better regulatory regime. He said: “The UK now has a ‘second mover advantage’, as it can learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and introduce a regulatory regime that supports the benefits of digital assets as well as mitigating the risks.” These comments echo panelists’ views at the summit, who believe that the UK needs to move fast with its crypto industry regulation, as clarity remains crucial for participants. They noted that such regulatory clarity could have several advantages for the UK, such as 24/7, faster and more efficient settlements for local and cross-border transactions, and more capital inflow into the country. At the root of it, they believe that if the UK should have clearer rules on digital assets, it could become a global crypto hub where consumers enjoy more protection as the standards of firms in the sector will improve. Panelists bemoan slow crypto regulation in the UK The call for rules enabling the crypto industry in the UK is not new. Although the Financial Conduct Authority already has some rules, industry participants believe more regulatory clarity is needed to encourage adoption. The report said: “Panelists reflected that progress so far has been fairly piecemeal, and a bold, ambitious and comprehensive approach is needed.” Some of those complaints also involve the FCA’s low approval rate for crypto licenses. Although the regulator has granted approval to Coinbase, PayPal BlackRock, and Galaxy, its approval rate of only 14% means several companies, including Ripple itself, remain without a license. Unsurprisingly, Ripple complained that banks in the country are unwilling to work with it because there is no regulatory framework. According to Cassie Craddock, the managing director for Ripple Europe and UK, large banks have yet to embrace Ripple due to regulatory uncertainty. Ripple calls for rules enabling stablecoins and tokenization Meanwhile, Osborne said panelists at the summit identified stablecoins and tokenization as the two main products crucial to the UK’s growth as a digital assets hub. He said the UK needs to have laws that enable these products and create an environment enabling stablecoin usage, including stablecoins not issued in the country. Stablecoin is currently a $230 billion sector with more potential for growth and lots of regulatory interest worldwide. Although the UK already has a roadmap for crypto regulation, with a consultation paper on stablecoins set for the first half of 2025, the Ripple executive wants the FCA to fast-track it. Additionally, he mentioned the potential of tokenization to transform the market and called on the UK government to move fast on enabling tokenization so the country can gain from it. He noted that all it would take is to remove all the barriers to it, which are mostly regulatory and legal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aims to proactively protect the network from potential quantum computing vulnerabilities, while recent analysis highlights the growing prevalence of social engineering scams like address poisoning, which have already resulted in millions of dollars in user losses. Bitcoin Under Siege: Casa CSO Jameson Lopp Warns of Exploding Address Poisoning Scam as Losses Mount Jameson Lopp, the Chief Security Officer at Casa, a leading Bitcoin self-custody provider, is sounding the alarm on an emerging and underreported threat in the cryptocurrency space: Bitcoin address poisoning attacks. In a detailed analysis published on Feb. 6, Lopp uncovered troubling patterns in blockchain transactions indicating that attackers are leveraging transaction history to launch deceptive scams aimed at tricking users into sending funds to lookalike addresses. Address poisoning is a form of social engineering scam that capitalizes on a user's familiarity and trust in previously interacted wallet addresses. In this attack, a scammer generates a Bitcoin address that closely resembles one in the victim's transaction history — often mimicking the first and last several characters, which are typically the only parts displayed in many wallet interfaces. The goal? To trick the user into sending funds to the fraudulent address, mistaking it for a legitimate recipient. Lopp’s investigation into the Bitcoin blockchain revealed that the first traces of these attacks didn’t emerge until block 797570 on July 7, 2023, with 36 suspicious transactions. The activity then went dormant until block 819455 on Dec. 12, 2023, after which a steady stream of attacks was observed through block 881172 on Jan. 28, 2025. After a short hiatus, the attacks resumed in late March. “Over these 18 months, just shy of 48,000 transactions were sent that match this profile of potential address poisoning,” said Lopp. The implications of these findings are not theoretical. According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, over $1.2 million was stolen via address poisoning scams in March 2025 alone, with February recording an even higher loss of $1.8 million. These scams are not just clever — they are devastatingly effective. In parallel, blockchain security firm PeckShield reports that Q1 2025 has already seen over $1.6 billion in crypto losses to various exploits and hacks. The majority of this figure stems from the historic $1.4 billion Bybit hack in February — now the largest crypto hack in history. Cybersecurity experts have attributed many of these coordinated attacks to North Korean state-affiliated hacking entities, notably the Lazarus Group, a collective notorious for its advanced social engineering tactics. Their strategies have included elaborate schemes such as fake job offers, phishing links distributed via social media, and even deepfake Zoom calls posing as venture capitalists. In response to these growing threats, Lopp has called on Bitcoin holders and wallet providers to adopt more stringent precautions. He emphasized the need for wallet interfaces to display full Bitcoin addresses to reduce the risk of being deceived by similar-looking addresses. Additionally, he advises users to double-check all addresses before sending funds, especially when copy-pasting from transaction histories. Industry Push for Defense The wave of recent scams is prompting the broader crypto ecosystem to re-examine wallet architecture, UX design, and educational efforts aimed at user protection. Startups and security firms are now developing tools that flag similar-looking addresses, introduce enhanced address verification, and issue warnings for suspicious transactions. But experts warn that technical solutions alone are not enough. The rise of address poisoning is a stark reminder of how cybersecurity threats in crypto are evolving. As the industry matures and more capital flows into digital assets, attackers are shifting from brute-force methods to stealthy psychological manipulation. While losses from hacks and scams have always been part of the crypto narrative, the sheer scale and sophistication of attacks in early 2025 suggest that new defense paradigms are urgently needed — both at the protocol level and the user interface level. As Jameson Lopp’s report shows, the blockchain may be immutable, but the way we interact with it must continually evolve. And if the nearly 48,000 poisoned transactions tell us anything, it’s that vigilance — not just decentralization — may be the true cornerstone of security in the age of digital finance. Bitcoin Faces a Quantum Crossroads: New BIP Proposes Hard Fork to Protect Network from Future Quantum Threats In related news, the Bitcoin network may soon face its most profound technological evolution to date. Developer Agustin Cruz has introduced a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) dubbed the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP). This proposal calls for a sweeping migration of all BTC holdings to post-quantum cryptographic addresses—an unprecedented initiative aimed at future-proofing the network against the looming threat of quantum computing. Unlike traditional computing, which relies on binary systems of ones and zeros, quantum computing leverages qubits—quantum bits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This exponential leap in processing power could one day crack encryption methods that modern computers would take millennia to break. Bitcoin’s current cryptographic backbone includes SHA-256 for mining and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for validating transactions. While these standards remain virtually unbreakable by today’s hardware, they are widely regarded as vulnerable to quantum decryption capabilities. According to Cruz, legacy addresses that haven’t yet transacted remain concealed by virtue of their cryptographic privacy. However, addresses that have made public transactions—thus exposing their public keys—are more vulnerable to decryption should sufficiently powerful quantum computers come online. Cruz’s BIP proposes a network-wide migration deadline, enforced at a future block height. After this point, nodes running the updated software would reject any transaction from addresses using ECDSA, effectively freezing funds that have not migrated to post-quantum wallets. This would require a hard fork, a fundamental change to the network that breaks compatibility with non-upgraded nodes. Historically, Bitcoin hard forks have been controversial—seen most notably during the block size wars that gave birth to Bitcoin Cash. The QRAMP proposal thus reopens deep philosophical debates within the community around decentralization, consensus, and immutability. “I admire the effort but this will still leave everyone who doesn’t migrate’s coins vulnerable, including Satoshi’s coins,” commented one Reddit user, highlighting the polarizing nature of the proposal. Another user added, “Bitcoin could implement post-quantum security for all coins, but that would need a hard fork, which due to Bitcoin’s history and the mantra repeated by maxis, would create a new coin and would not be Bitcoin anymore.” Importantly, the QRAMP initiative is not responding to an imminent quantum threat. It is a precautionary measure designed to prepare the network ahead of technological breakthroughs. Still, the timing is notable: the proposal comes just weeks after Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum processing unit (QPU) that aims to scale to a million qubits per chip—a potential game-changer for quantum acceleration. Cruz’s proposal allows for a migration window, during which users can freely move their BTC from vulnerable addresses to newly implemented quantum-resistant ones. Wallet developers, blockchain explorers, and infrastructure providers would need to integrate tools and warning systems to assist with this transition. After the cutoff block, un-migrated funds would become effectively unspendable on the upgraded network. If users and operators choose to stay on the legacy version, a chain split could occur, spawning a separate blockchain that continues supporting ECDSA—yet again raising concerns over network unity and coin fungibility. The Growing Push for Post-Quantum Blockchain Security QRAMP is not the only proposal seeking to safeguard Bitcoin from quantum threats. Startups like BTQ Technologies have proposed alternative cryptographic systems altogether. In a recent whitepaper, BTQ suggested replacing Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) model with a quantum-native algorithm called Coarse-Grained Boson Sampling (CGBS). This approach uses light particles (bosons) to generate unique, verifiable patterns that represent the blockchain’s current state—eliminating reliance on hash puzzles and possibly offering quantum-resistant validation. However, this solution, like QRAMP, would demand a full-scale hard fork and the replacement of existing ASIC hardware with quantum-compatible systems. Despite the urgency conveyed by Cruz, the success of QRAMP hinges on Bitcoin’s notoriously conservative developer and user community. Bitcoin maximalists, many of whom champion the ethos of “do not change lightly,” may resist any measure requiring a hard fork—particularly one involving abstract future threats rather than immediate vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, as quantum hardware development accelerates, the window to proactively defend decentralized protocols is closing. Industry veterans warn that waiting for a quantum “zero day” could be catastrophic—not just for Bitcoin, but for all public blockchains reliant on legacy cryptographic schemes. Cruz and others advocating for QRAMP believe that starting the conversation now—before quantum computers reach critical mass—is vital. Whether the community agrees remains to be seen, but what’s clear is that Bitcoin’s next evolution may not be ideological or economic—it may be cryptographic.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 09:30:00

Whispers from within China suggest a significant shift in strategy as top officials are reportedly engaged in critical discussions to bolster their nation’s economic resilience. This urgent move comes as a direct response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, particularly the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, these macroeconomic shifts are crucial to monitor, as they can ripple through global markets and influence risk sentiment. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters. Why is China Considering Economic Stimulus Now? According to reports from Solid Intel on X, Chinese authorities are actively exploring measures to inject fresh momentum into their economy. But why is this happening now, and what are the underlying factors at play? Several key reasons are likely driving this urgency: Impact of US Tariffs: President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods have undoubtedly put pressure on China’s export-oriented economy. These tariffs increase the cost of Chinese products in the US, potentially reducing demand and impacting Chinese businesses and employment. Slowing Economic Growth: While China’s economy remains a global powerhouse, recent indicators suggest a slowdown in growth. Internal challenges, coupled with external pressures like trade disputes, necessitate proactive measures to maintain economic stability. Global Economic Uncertainty: The broader global economic outlook is clouded by uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. China, as a major player in the world economy, needs to ensure its own stability amidst this turbulent environment. Proactive Economic Management: China’s government has a history of proactive economic management. Ramping up stimulus efforts can be seen as a preemptive move to safeguard against potential economic headwinds and ensure sustained growth. In essence, China is facing a confluence of factors that necessitate a robust response to maintain its economic trajectory. The proposed economic stimulus is a key part of this strategy. Decoding China’s Potential Economic Stimulus Measures What exactly might this economic stimulus package entail? While details are still emerging, we can look at past instances and general economic tools to speculate on potential measures: Stimulus Measure Potential Impact Relevance to Crypto Monetary Policy Easing: Lowering interest rates, reducing reserve requirement ratios for banks. Increased liquidity in the market, potentially boosting investment and spending. Lower interest rates can make riskier assets like crypto more attractive compared to traditional savings. Fiscal Policy Expansion: Increased government spending on infrastructure projects, tax cuts for businesses and individuals. Directly injects money into the economy, stimulating demand and creating jobs. Increased economic activity can indirectly boost investor confidence and potentially lead to more capital flowing into various asset classes, including crypto. Support for Specific Sectors: Targeted support for key industries facing challenges, such as technology or manufacturing. Can help stabilize and revitalize specific parts of the economy. Depending on the sectors supported, there might be indirect implications for blockchain technology and crypto-related businesses within China. Currency Management: Measures to manage the Renminbi (RMB) exchange rate. Can influence export competitiveness and capital flows. Currency fluctuations can impact the value of crypto holdings and trading strategies, especially for those involved in international markets. It’s important to remember that the specific details and scale of China’s stimulus package are yet to be officially announced. However, these potential measures provide a glimpse into the toolkit that policymakers might employ. Countermeasures to US Tariffs: What Could China Do? Beyond domestic stimulus, the report also highlights that China is considering countermeasures to US tariffs. What form might these countermeasures take? Here are a few possibilities: Retaliatory Tariffs: Imposing tariffs on US goods imported into China. This is a direct response but can escalate trade tensions further. Non-Tariff Barriers: Implementing regulatory hurdles or other non-tariff barriers to limit imports of US products. Support for Domestic Industries: Providing subsidies or other forms of support to Chinese industries affected by US tariffs, making them more competitive. Strategic Resource Management: Using control over key resources or supply chains as leverage in trade negotiations. Diplomatic Engagement: Intensifying diplomatic efforts to negotiate and resolve trade disputes with the US. The choice of countermeasures will likely depend on a careful calculation of economic and political factors. China aims to protect its interests while also managing the overall relationship with the United States. Impact on Global Markets and Cryptocurrency China’s economic moves, both in terms of stimulus and countermeasures , have significant implications for global markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Here’s a breakdown: Market Sentiment: A large-scale stimulus package from China could boost global market sentiment. Positive news from the world’s second-largest economy often has a ripple effect, encouraging investment across various asset classes. Risk Appetite: Economic stability in China can increase global risk appetite. When investors feel more confident about the global economic outlook, they are more likely to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Supply Chain Dynamics: Trade tensions and countermeasures can disrupt global supply chains. This could lead to inflationary pressures, which, in turn, can make assets like Bitcoin, often seen as an inflation hedge, more attractive. Capital Flows: Changes in China’s economic policy and trade relations can influence capital flows. For example, if the RMB weakens as a result of stimulus measures, there might be capital outflows, some of which could find their way into the crypto market. Technological Innovation: China’s focus on economic stability and technological self-reliance could accelerate its development in blockchain and digital currency technologies. This could have long-term implications for the global crypto landscape. Navigating Economic Instability: Actionable Insights For crypto investors and market participants, understanding these developments is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and analysis related to China’s economic policies and US-China trade relations. Reputable news sources and economic analysis platforms are essential. Diversify Your Portfolio: Economic uncertainty highlights the importance of portfolio diversification. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, but also consider traditional assets. Manage Risk: Be prepared for market volatility. Implement risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and understanding your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: Macroeconomic events can create short-term market fluctuations. Maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Understand Global Interconnections: Recognize that the global economy is interconnected. Events in one part of the world, like China’s economic policy shifts, can have far-reaching consequences for markets worldwide, including the crypto market. Conclusion: A World Watching Closely China’s discussions around economic stability and responses to US tariffs are a critical development in the global economic narrative. The decisions made in Beijing will not only shape China’s economic future but will also send ripples across international markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Crypto market sentiment is deep in bearish territory as the selloff accelerates, and this could well continue over the coming week as March inflation data is released in the United States. Additionally, President Trump’s tariff policies are scheduled to take effect Wednesday, with China’s retaliatory measures following on Thursday. Economic Events April 7 to 11 Responses to Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are likely to begin on Monday as nations across the globe figure out how to offset the impact. Fear is growing among Investors that Trump’s new tariffs would slow down US and global economic growth, and increase inflation. The minutes of Federal Reserve’s March Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be released on Wednesday, giving possible insights into the central bank’s next move. Thursday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will also be closely eyed as investors gauge price pressures following the tariff announcements. Economists expect March inflation to remain unchanged after February’s steeper-than-expected decrease, but recession fears have been reignited. Thursday will also see data on initial jobless claims released, shedding light on labor markets in the United States. Key Events This Week: 1. “Reciprocal Tariff” Responses Likely Begin – Monday 2. Fed Meeting Minutes – Wednesday 3. March CPI Inflation data – Thursday 4. Initial Jobless Claims data – Thursday 5. March PPI Inflation data – Friday 6. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data – Friday… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 6, 2025 Friday will see the Producer Price Index (PPI) report released, highlighting wholesale price trends that can ultimately affect consumer prices. Preliminary consumer sentiment data is also released Friday, and this includes consumer price expectations, an indicator of future inflation trends. If global tariff tensions escalate or economic data disappoints, the selling pressure will likely continue throughout the week. It is also a big week for bank first-quarter earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock slated to report quarterly results. Crypto Markets Bleed Crypto markets have seen one of the largest daily declines of the year, with a 9% slump in total capitalization. Around $250 billion has left the space in less than 24 hours, resulting in a fall to $2.5 trillion in total cap. Bitcoin fell 8% to just over $74,000 in its largest dump since March 11. Momentum remains bearish, and further losses are more likely than gains in the current economic outlook. Ethereum is at bear market lows, having fallen a whopping 18% to $1,450, its lowest level since October 2023. The altcoins are a sea of red this morning, with double-digit losses for XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar as the crypto exodus continues.

Russian social media company VK plans to shut down its marketplace for non-fungible tokens, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, the team said, ending a service that was launched in December 2022. In a public announcement , users were told to transfer their tokens to external wallets before the deadline. After April 15, the special visual markers on VK associated with NFTs — small neon diamonds that appeared on avatars — will be removed, leaving users who purchased NFTs for this feature with nothing. The NFT team added that existing content in the VK NFT community will remain, though it’s unclear whether VK plans to return to NFTs or digital assets in the future. You might also like: What is an NFT? A complete guide to non-fungible tokens The closure comes as VK faces financial pressure as the company’s net loss nearly tripled in 2024 to 94.9 billion roubles (around $1.1 billion), up from 34.3 billion roubles in 2023. Amid declining financial health, the company revealed plans to raise up to 115 billion roubles through a new share issuance to reduce debt. It’s understood that the company will direct the received funds to lowering its debt burden. As crypto.news reported earlier, March marked a turning point , with a series of marketplace shutdowns intensifying the situation. These included South Korean tech giant LG shutting down its LG Art Lab, as well as the closures of X2Y2, and Bybit’s NFT marketplace, among others.

This relaunch comes amid a steep decline in meme coin interest and a drop in Pump.fun’s token graduation rate. Meanwhile, stablecoins are booming while activity on Solana and Ethereum has slumped. However, Solana may get a boost from PayPal, which recently added support for SOL and LINK across its crypto services, including Venmo. Pump.fun Revives Livestreams with New Moderation Alon Cohen, co-founder of the Solana-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, announced the return of livestreaming on the platform. The announcement was made just five months after suspending the feature due to a surge of harmful and extreme content. In a post on X, Cohen revealed that the feature is being reintroduced with “industry standard moderation systems” and transparent community guidelines. The live-streaming capability has been made available to only 5% of users initially, while the team tests its new safeguards. The main goal of the revamped moderation policy is to strike a balance between creativity, freedom of expression, and user safety. It bans content involving violence, animal abuse, pornography, and youth endangerment. However, the policy raised quite a few eyebrows for its vague language around what constitutes inappropriate content, and it even acknowledges that much of what is considered NSFW may still appear on the platform. Pump.fun also explicitly reserves the right to determine and moderate content as it sees fit. The return of the live-streaming feature comes after its very abrupt removal in November of 2024, when the platform became flooded with disturbing broadcasts from meme coin creators who employed increasingly shocking methods to promote their tokens. In some cases, users even threatened violence or self-harm if token prices didn’t meet certain targets. Pump.fun pointed to overwhelming growth and the inability of its moderation team as the main reasons for the suspension. The platform then promised to relaunch only when a robust moderation system was ready. Mikko Ohtamaa of Trading Strategy previously warned that unmoderated streams could invite regulatory or media scrutiny, and could lead to the platform’s shutdown. Pump.fun’s move to bring back live streaming is happening as there is a steep decline in meme coin interest. Investors are especially shaken after several high-profile rug pulls, including Libra (LIBRA) and Melania Meme (MELANIA). The Trump (TRUMP) token price also fell by more than 90% from its January peak. Pump.fun weekly graduation rate (Source: Dune Analytics ) Recent data from Dune Analytics also shed some light on other investor concerns. In fact, the graduation rate of tokens on Pump.fun fell to below 1%, down from 1.67% earlier this year. This means that the number of tokens graduating plummeted from about 5,400 per week in January to under 1,500 in March. It is not just Pump.fun facing struggles as the broader activity on the Solana network has mirrored this drop. Solana Stumbles While Stablecoins Soar Stablecoins are showing remarkable resilience and growth despite the broader turbulence in the crypto market, according to asset manager VanEck’s monthly report . While major smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana are experiencing very noticeable slowdowns in revenue and activity, stablecoins seem to be entering a bull market of their own. VanEck’s head of research, Matthew Sigel, explained that ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly surrounding US President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policies and the potential for a trade war, may be enhancing the strategic appeal of crypto assets — especially stablecoins. (Source: VanEck ) In March alone, the total market cap of stablecoins grew by closer to $10 billion. This growth was driven by continued adoption and anticipation of new branded stablecoin products from major issuers, including VanEck itself. This surge happened even as average yields on stablecoins dropped significantly. They now range between 3% and 5%, down from highs of around 10% earlier this year. Despite the lower yields, institutional interest remains strong, which is clearly reflected by a 26% increase in the issuance of tokenized Treasury Bills between February and March. On the other hand, activity on smart contract platforms slumped. Revenues and trading volumes across platforms like Ethereum and Solana fell by 36% and 40% respectively. Solana bore the brunt of this decline, with daily fee revenues dropping 66% and decentralized exchange volumes shrinking by 53% in March. (Source: VanEck ) After briefly overtaking Ethereum and its layer-2 chains in February, Solana's DEX volume share fell back thanks to the platform’s vulnerability to shifts in meme coin trading activity . One of the most damaging events happened in February when the Libra meme coin , which was rumored to be linked to Argentine President Javier Milei, lost around $4.4 billion in market value shortly after launch. This scandal, and many others like it, weighed heavily on retail interest and contributed to the decline in trading activity. This was especially the case on Solana-based exchanges. Despite these headwinds for smart contract platforms, the continued momentum in the stablecoin sector suggests that certain parts of the crypto ecosystem are still firmly in growth mode. LINK and SOL Join PayPal’s Crypto Lineup Something that could give the Solana ecosystem a nice boost is the fact that PayPal expanded its cryptocurrency services to include Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL). This offers US-based users the ability to buy, sell, and transfer these tokens. The new functionality was announced on April 4, and will roll out over the next few weeks and extend to Venmo users as well. Venmo, which is PayPal’s popular mobile payment app, had around 83 million users in 2023, while PayPal’s overall global user base reached approximately 428 million by the end of the year, most of them located in the United States. Currently, PayPal’s crypto services are still exclusive to US residents. Part of PayPal’s announcement (Source: PayPal newsroom ) According to May Zabaneh, an executive in PayPal’s crypto and blockchain division, the expansion is a response to the increasing consumer interest in digital assets. The addition of LINK and SOL brings PayPal’s total supported crypto assets to seven, including its proprietary payment stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD). PayPal’s commitment to digital currencies deepened since the 2023 launch of PYUSD. The stablecoin reached a peak market capitalization of more than $1 billion before settling around $760 million in circulating supply. Despite PYUSD’s relatively smaller size compared to some of the other more dominant stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, its influence is big. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron recently talked about the role of major fintech firms like PayPal and Stripe when it comes to driving mainstream stablecoin adoption, especially at a time when both regulators and enterprises are still navigating and learning about the crypto landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,LINK|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|PYUSD,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 09:33:06
43027200,https://invezz.com/?p=2658335,1744018483,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) crosses new milestones as community growth aligns with on-chain activity,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/07/mutuum-finance-mutm-crosses-new-milestones-as-community-growth-aligns-with-on-chain-activity/,"While many crypto tokens rely on speculative hype or short-lived trends, Mutuum Finance is gradually earning its place among investor watchlists for all the right reasons. Still in its development phase, the protocol is already generating serious interest, and not just for what it plans to become—but for how it’s positioning itself right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built with accessibility and long-term utility in mind. Its structure aims to give users full control over their assets, offering flexible financial tools in a non-custodial environment. But what’s catching attention most isn’t just the concept—it’s the clear momentum the project has gathered during its early stages. Priced at just $0.025, MUTM is still flying under the radar, but many early participants believe that won’t last long. At this entry point, the value proposition is hard to ignore. The token sits at the core of the protocol’s ecosystem and will play a vital role in reward mechanisms, governance, and future integrations. As other major altcoins stagnate, long-time crypto investors are starting to reposition their portfolios—looking for lower-cap assets with stronger growth potential. For many, MUTM is that next move. The shift is real. Traders who previously backed larger-cap assets like Cardano and BNB in their earlier stages are now participating in Mutuum’s presale. Part of the draw lies in the project’s combination of clear token economics and practical utility. It’s a token that’s not just meant to be traded—but used. The presale itself has become a milestone worth noting. With over $6.3 million raised and more than 7,900 holders already onboarded, this momentum reflects a growing appetite for what the project is building. The fourth phase of the presale is currently live, and with the next price increase around the corner, the current $0.025 level is seen by many as one of the most favorable entry points. Importantly, Mutuum is preparing for several milestones that add further weight to its potential. The project has confirmed that a CertiK audit is underway, which will strengthen investor confidence in the codebase and core architecture before launch. Audits remain a critical step for DeFi projects, and Mutuum’s proactive approach here shows its focus on long-term trust, not just short-term funding. Another upcoming feature is the platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be backed by assets deposited within Mutuum’s own ecosystem. Pegged to the US dollar and deployed on Ethereum, this stablecoin is expected to serve as a reliable liquidity layer while complementing the core lending and borrowing functionality. Unlike stablecoins that rely on centralized backing, Mutuum’s model will give users greater transparency and control. As development continues, the team has also hinted at releasing a beta version of the platform close to token listing—meaning the community won’t have to wait months for utility to go live. This focus on usability shortly after launch is another reason investors are moving capital into MUTM now, rather than chasing momentum later. All signs point to a project moving with purpose: an affordable token price, a fast-selling presale, a growing user base, and features designed with actual use in mind. With CertiK’s stamp of approval on the horizon and the platform’s stablecoin in the works, Mutuum Finance is not just checking the right boxes—it’s building quietly but confidently. As the market cycles through noise and speculation, MUTM stands out as one of the few tokens offering something deeper: structure, direction, and timing. And right now, the window to enter before its next phase closes fast.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining hashrate—the measure of computational power used to mine and process transactions on the network—has surpassed 1 Zetahash per second (ZH/s), marking a 1000X increase since January 2016. This milestone was reached on April 5, although different sources report slightly varying peak ZH/s numbers due to different measurement methods. Mempool.space recorded a peak of 1.025 ZH/s, while BTC Frame measured it at 1.02 ZH/s on April 4. Source: mempool.space While a growing hashrate means the network is more resistant to attacks, it brings a challenge for BTC miners. As the hashrate increases, the network adjusts its difficulty to maintain the steady block time of approximately 10 minutes per block. ​This happens approximately every two weeks (or every 2,016 blocks) to ensure new blocks are added at a stable rate. You might also like: Bitcoin crashes below $75k as circuit breaker events hit Asian and European markets Since the rewards for mining BTC are fixed at 450 BTC per day until the next halving in 2028, this means that as more computational power is flooding the network, the mining rewards must be divided among a larger number of miners. With more miners competing for the same total reward, each individual miner’s share decreases, leading to a decline in hashprice—the amount of revenue a miner earns per unit of hashrate. Indeed, hashprice has seen sharp drop over the past three months, falling from around $60 in mid-January to around $40 at press time, confirming the profitability squeeze on miners as hashrate climbs. Source: Hashrate Index As hashrate increases, miners face increasing pressure to maximize operational efficiency. “Miners are doubling down: expanding sites and plugging in more efficient machines,” Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew told Cointelegraph. He also added that miners with less efficient equipment may soon be forced out of the market unless Bitcoin’s price increases in the near future. The challenge to Bitcoin miners has been further compounded by Trump’s tariffs , which have increased the cost of mining equipment for U.S. mining firms. China remains the top supplier of Bitcoin mining hardware but now faces a 34% retaliatory tariff on exports to the U.S., putting pressure on American miners’ ROI.

While commenting on the potential tokenization of RWAs, the XRP lawyer expressed his thoughts on Bitcoin and crypto. Let’s unveil experts’ insights on the necessity of tokenizing RWAs and what draws John Deaton to the world of cryptocurrencies. Ripple CEO To Embrace RWA Tokenization, Says John Deaton In a recent X post, XRP lawyer John Deaton shared insights on the potential adoption of RWA tokenization, about which key personalities like Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse remain optimistic. The XRP lawyer stated, “Brian Armstrong, Brad Garlinghouse, and Larry Fink are just a few of the biggest names in Crypto Finance to talk about how all RWA will eventually be tokenized.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, in his recent thread on X, suggested that every asset class is poised to get tokenized, acknowledging the massive growth of onchain lending and borrowing. Corroborating Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s backing for RWA tokenization, the XRP lawyer cited, “There seems to be little doubt this is correct.” RWA Tokenization Reshape Finance, Says Ripple CEO Recently, Brad Garlinghouse noted on his Facebook page, “Real-world asset tokenization is reshaping finance—making traditional assets more accessible and efficient.” His critical statement came on the heels of the growing adoption of Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). Reinforcing Brad Garlinghouse’s words, Ripple shared an X post, noting, RWA tokenization is accelerating, and the XRPL is at the center of driving institutional adoption. RWA.xyz now provides real-time insights into XRPL network performance, tokenized treasuries, commodities, and stablecoins like RLUSD. Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital also shared his bullish thoughts on the global expansion of the RWA tokenization . XRP Lawyer Reveals Take on Bitcoin and Tokenization While praising Brad Garlinghouse and others’ support for RWA tokenization, the XRP lawyer shared his take on the matter. Exploring the concept of tokenized assets, John Deaton suggested that fractional ownership could help bridge the wealth gap. Significantly, this idea aligns with his broader vision for crypto’s role in shaping the future of finance. Further, Deaton explained the reasons for backing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to the XRP lawyer, crypto helps eliminate intermediaries like banks and other financial institutions. In addition, Deaton believes that crypto will help achieve American Dream.

The agreements will enable a broader base of investors to enter Dubai’s real estate asset market. This aligns with Dubai Real Estate Strategy 2033 that seeks to grow real estate transaction volume to $272 billion. Dubai Land Department recently launched its real estate tokenization pilot The agreement comes weeks after Dubai Land Department launched its real estate tokenization project. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has launched the pilot phase of the ‘Real Estate Tokenization Project for property title deeds. The initiative introduced under the Real Estate Innovation Initiative ‘REES,’ establishes DLD as the first real estate registration entity in the Middle East to implement tokenization on property title deeds.

Unnamed sources within the White House say the reports are due by Monday, according to Fox journalist Eleanor Terrett. She noted that while agencies must share their holdings with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the executive order doesn’t require the information to be made public. “Unclear as of now if and when the findings could be made public,” Terrett wrote . A number of community members have voiced frustration over the lack of transparency, questioning why public crypto holdings remain undisclosed. Some say the government should release the data “since they work for the people,” while others described the situation as “shady.” You’d think the government would make it public since they work for the people…. — Cazzdezhands (@Cazzdezhands) April 6, 2025 You might also like: US crypto investors likely lost up to $5b on geoblocked airdrops, research shows Trump’s AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, during a podcast appearance last month, noted that the U.S. once held around 400,000 BTC but sold nearly half for just $366 million. He pointed out that if those coins had been held instead, they’d be worth over $17 billion based on recent prices. According to Arkham Intelligence data on April 7, the U.S. government currently holds roughly 198,000 BTC, worth roughly $15 billion. Other cryptocurrencies, such as ETH, WBTC, and BNB, account for an additional $380 million. The executive order, signed on March 6 by President Donald Trump, calls for a full audit of federal crypto assets and the creation of two new structures, a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. Dubbed a “digital Fort Knox,” the Bitcoin Reserve is designed to hold seized BTC as a long-term strategic asset, moving away from the government’s previous practice of auctioning off confiscated tokens . In contrast, the Digital Asset Stockpile offers flexibility for managing non-Bitcoin assets like ETH, BNB, or TRX, allowing for potential sales, swaps, or other operational uses depending on policy objectives. According to Sacks, the reserve would be filled using crypto that the government has already seized through civil and criminal forfeitures. At the time, Sacks estimated the U.S. holds around 200,000 BTC, though no full audit has ever been done. In the meantime, federal agencies have continued to seize illicit crypto. Last month, the Department of Justice confiscated over $200,000 in digital assets linked to Hamas, part of a broader terror financing network that moved more than $1.5 million through exchanges and wallets since October 2024. However, sometimes seized assets directly linked to victim losses are eligible for return. On March 3, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Ohio announced its intention to forfeit around $8.2 million in USDT tied to a crypto investment scam and return the funds to victims.

The whale is reportedly close to liquidation on a 220,000 Ether ( ETH ) position on MakerDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. To stave off liquidation, the investor deposited 10,000 ETH — worth more than $14.5 million — and 3.54 million Dai ( DAI ) to raise the position’s liquidation price, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain said in an April 7 post on X. “If $ETH drops to $1,119.3, the 220,000 $ETH($340M) will be liquidated.” Source: Lookonchain The development came hours after another Ether investor was liquidated for over $106 million on the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Sky. The whale lost more than 67,000 ETH when the asset crashed by around 14% on April 6. Sky’s system employs an overcollateralization ratio, typically 150% or higher, meaning that users need to deposit at least $150 worth of ETH to borrow 100 DAI.

Related: Smart money still hunting for memecoins despite end of ‘supercycle’ Crypto markets crash after Trump’s tariff announcement, but 70% recovery chance by June US President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which sent tremors across global markets, leading to a $5 trillion loss by the S&P 500, its largest two-day drop on record. Still, the tariff announcement may finally end the global uncertainty plaguing traditional and digital markets for the past two months. “In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. “Liberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty. Now it’s out in the open. Everybody knows the new playing field.” The end of tariff-related uncertainty may bring the start of a “rotation toward the crypto markets,” as investors will start buying the dip as digital assets become “undervalued,” said van de Poppe. Crypto intelligence firm Nansen also estimated a 70% probability that the market may bottom by June, depending on how the tariff negotiations evolve.

Ethereum ( ETH ), the largest altcoin, fell over 19% in just 24 hours, dropping to around $1,450. That puts it down more than 60% for the year. Other popular coins like XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) also lost key support levels, each dropping about 18–20%. In total, the crypto market recorded over $1.38 billion in liquidations, with the majority coming from long positions. Approximately $1.21 billion was wiped out from traders betting on prices to rise. The recent selloff in ETH and other altcoins appears to be largely driven by rising global tensions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff war. His plan includes a 10% tariff on most imports, with even higher rates, 34% on Chinese goods and 20% on EU products. Trump says the new tariffs will help bring in more money for the U.S. and fix trade issues with China and Europe. But the markets didn’t take it well. You might also like: Bitcoin crashes below $75k as circuit breaker events hit Asian and European markets China has hit back with its own retaliatory tariffs, targeting key U.S. exports like agricultural products and tech goods. Other countries, including some in the EU and Asia, have also hinted at introducing similar countermeasures, raising fears of a full-blown global trade war. Stock markets in China, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore experienced severe losses on Monday morning, triggering circuit breakers, a mechanism designed to halt trading during extreme volatility temporarily. Indexes across the region fell between 7% and 13% as panic selling swept through investors. Bitcoin ( B T C ) crashed alongside the stock markets. The leading cryptocurrency fell over 8% in the past day, dropping below the $76,500 mark, a level analysts had warned needed to be held to avoid deeper losses. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped 11 points in a day, landing in the “extreme fear” zone. It’s a sign that investors are pivoting away from risk assets. The decline has also raised doubts about Bitcoin’s role as a hedge during times of economic uncertainty, especially since it fell while gold and other precious metals saw price gains. Making matters worse, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the new tariffs could raise inflation and slow the U.S. economy. He also mentioned there’s no need to cut interest rates just yet, which isn’t great news for crypto or stocks, both of which tend to do better when rates are lower. Commenting on today’s crypto market drop, Georgii Verbitskii, founder of crypto investor app TYMIO, told crypto.news that he believes the sell-off isn’t about the failure of specific altcoins but rather a broader wave of “market stress” fueled by macro uncertainty. He pointed to Trump’s tariff announcements as a major driver of tension, saying they’ve led to a “broad sell-off in risk assets.” With over $1 billion in liquidations hitting the crypto sector, Verbitskii noted it’s understandable that altcoins took a hit. Still, he called it a moment for “caution, not panic,” and said the market would likely stay reactive until there’s more clarity on the regulatory and macroeconomic fronts. Slava Demchuk, CEO of AMLBot, also attributed the crash to a mix of external pressures and internal fragility. According to Demchuk, this is “just a storm” and not the end of the road. “In the short term, I expect volatility to persist, but the recovery will depend on positive catalysts, such as more stable economic policy in the US. We should focus on risk management and long-term fundamentals during this turbulence,” he added.

While well-established names like Polygon (MATIC) and Chainlink (LINK) continue to play their role in DeFi infrastructure, analysts are pointing to one lesser-known contender that’s quietly gaining traction — Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This protocol, currently in presale, is drawing interest from traders seeking early exposure to tokens with built-in utility and clear value drivers. With a price tag of just $0.025 and a development roadmap that includes a lending platform, decentralized borrowing options, and a native overcollateralized stablecoin, many are beginning to view MUTM as a standout among mid-cap opportunities. Why MUTM is on analyst watchlists The strength of Mutuum Finance lies in its forward-looking model. Although still under development, the platform is designed to support on-chain lending and borrowing via smart contracts, giving users a streamlined way to earn passive yield or unlock liquidity from their digital assets. The flexibility of the system allows users to choose between stable or variable rates while retaining control of their collateral — all without relying on centralized entities. Unlike many presale tokens that struggle to differentiate themselves, MUTM is positioning itself with a sustainable structure. A portion of protocol fees is used to repurchase tokens from the market, which are then distributed to active users through staking contracts. This mechanism aligns value with participation and sets the foundation for steady token demand once the platform goes live. How it stacks up against established mid-caps Polygon and Chainlink have already carved out their place in the market, supporting countless applications and integrations across the crypto space. Polygon has been instrumental in scaling Ethereum-based projects, while Chainlink’s oracle network powers smart contract data flows across multiple chains. Both tokens benefit from strong brand recognition and high liquidity. But with growth often priced in, some analysts argue these assets may face slower upside in the short-to-mid term. That’s where emerging tokens like MUTM offer a different kind of opportunity — one based on early-stage entry and future development. MUTM is still under the radar, but the numbers are starting to reflect momentum. Over $6.3 million has already been raised in the presale, and the community has surpassed 7,900 holders — notable traction for a project that hasn’t launched its mainnet yet. Phase 4 of the presale is now live, with the token set to rise from $0.025 to $0.03 once the next stage begins. That’s a 20% increase just between phases, which is drawing FOMO from buyers who recognize how quickly supply is being absorbed. Adding to investor confidence is the news that a full smart contract audit is underway with CertiK, a recognized blockchain security firm. Once completed, the audit will give further credibility to the protocol and could clear the way for listings on larger platforms. Meanwhile, the development of Mutuum’s overcollateralized stablecoin offers another utility case. Pegged to the US dollar and built on Ethereum, this stablecoin will be generated by users depositing approved assets above a defined LTV ratio. Since the stablecoin is tied directly to platform usage, its success is expected to drive additional volume and fees, benefiting MUTM holders in the process. Polygon and Chainlink have proven their place in the market, but when it comes to ground-floor opportunity, MUTM is now gaining serious attention. With clear token utility, fast-growing community support, and a presale that’s moving quickly, many investors see this as a rare chance to enter before the broader market catches on. For those looking to diversify into mid-caps with actual fundamentals and strong upside potential, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the most watched tokens of the year.

The stock markets across the globe, including the US, Japan, China, Taiwan, the UK, and many more, have opened on a huge bearish note. While many refer to it as Black Monday, experts believe the bearish influence may settle soon. With this, crypto markets are also expected to recover, and this could be when these altcoins may make a strong move. EOS (EOS) Price Analysis The EOS price has been demonstrating massive strength in the last few days of Q1 2025, but the token faced a 20% pullback after entering the crucial resistance zone between $0.82 and $0.88. Despite the plunge below the multi-month ascending trend line, the price remains within a bullish zone. Hence, it holds the possibility of a strong recovery upright. The EOS price has dropped significantly, but a potential ascending trend seems to be imminent. The price is testing the crucial support at the 200-day MA at $0.677, and even if it loses the 50-day MA at $0.588, it may offer a strong base. Therefore, the EOS price is expected to trigger a strong rebound as the volume has surged notably, which reflects the increased trading activity. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price Analysis The global market conditions have failed to heavily impact the FARTCOIN price, which is attracting the significant attention of the market participants. The bulls are trying hard to revive a rebound, which could elevate the levels back to $0.6 very soon. However, volume remains low, which could adversely impact the pace of recovery. As seen in the above chart, the Bollinger Bands have begun to squeeze, citing the drop in volume and volatility. Moreover, the 50-day MA is offering a strong base, which collides with the lower bands of Bollinger. Therefore, the FARTCOIN price is expected to trigger a rebound or else may drop to test the support levels and later trigger a rebound. The bulls seem to have entered the markets and are utilizing the ‘buy at dip’ opportunity well. However, the Bitcoin price has triggered a decent recovery, and if it rises above $78,000, the path towards a strong recovery may be activated. Otherwise, a plunge below $72,800 could further drag the entire crypto markets lower.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 09:44:39

Analysts compare Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with ADA, LINK, and DOGE",https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/07/best-crypto-to-buy-today-analysts-compare-mutuum-finance-mutm-with-ada-link-and-doge/,"As the broader crypto market navigates another consolidation phase, the question on many traders’ minds is simple: which token has the clearest upside from today’s prices? Long-standing players like Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are all back in the conversation, but analysts say one lesser-known token—Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—might be better positioned for real returns in 2025. A quick look at the mid-cap crowd ADA is still recovering from its recent slide, with momentum showing signs of hesitation despite the broader optimism around the altcoin market. While Cardano continues to lead in terms of blockchain development activity, its price growth has stalled due to slowing retail participation and reduced DeFi volume on its network. Chainlink, on the other hand, remains a favorite among institutional DeFi projects for its role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Yet LINK has struggled to break out of its range in recent weeks, facing the same volatility pressures that are keeping many altcoins in check. Dogecoin is also seeing renewed attention following a short burst of price action. Still, its lack of utility beyond speculation makes it more susceptible to sharp swings, as we’ve seen multiple times in the past. While DOGE continues to benefit from community support and occasional endorsements, it lacks the underlying mechanisms to drive consistent value for holders. Where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart In contrast to these more established tokens, Mutuum Finance enters the spotlight with a fresh value proposition and a rapidly growing presale. The protocol, still in development, is building a decentralized infrastructure for lending and borrowing without centralized custody. What sets it apart is how it ties token value directly to real platform use. Users who supply liquidity earn yield, and those who borrow do so through overcollateralized mechanisms, ensuring capital efficiency and protection. MUTM’s presale has already attracted over $6.3 million, with more than 7,900 holders onboard. The project isn’t just raising funds—it’s steadily forming a strong community around its use cases. With the upcoming launch of a stablecoin tied to the US dollar and secured by on-chain collateral, Mutuum is shaping a foundation designed for long-term participation. This stablecoin will exist on the Ethereum network and enhance lending options by offering users a more predictable asset within the ecosystem. The tokenomics of MUTM add another layer of appeal. A portion of protocol fees is set aside to buy tokens on the open market and distribute them to active users, particularly those staking mtTokens. This approach strengthens retention while increasing demand as platform usage grows. It’s not just about speculation—it’s about rewarding real contribution to the protocol’s growth. The CertiK audit, currently underway, is another factor boosting investor confidence. Security remains a major consideration in today’s market, and knowing that the code is undergoing professional review adds transparency and reassurance. That’s exactly the kind of validation early-stage investors look for. While ADA, LINK, and DOGE each have their own loyal communities and legacy value, many traders are starting to look beyond familiar names in search of more aggressive ROI potential. MUTM’s current price of $0.025 and its pre-launch positioning offer a rare window. With a working model on the way, a stablecoin in development, and a built-in reward structure that aligns with platform growth, Mutuum Finance isn’t just another presale—it’s becoming a strategic early entry for investors aiming to position ahead of the next market rotation. For those watching the market closely, this could be one of the few moments where shifting attention from the old guard to new infrastructure delivers results.

Ripple’s integration of its RLUSD stablecoin is bolstering its ecosystem, making XRP a favorite among both retail and institutional investors. Yet, as Ripple basks in the spotlight, another promising cryptocurrency project, RUVI AI , is quietly making waves with its secure Ethereum-based blockchain, innovative presale bonuses, and community-driven rewards system. XRP’s momentum and RUVI’s contrast Ripple has regained traction with a recent price recovery to $2.20, and analysts believe favorable regulatory moves could catapult it toward a $10 valuation. A proposed US Congress stablecoin bill could pave the way for Ripple’s RLUSD to transform cross-border payments, fueling market confidence. While Ripple demonstrates resilience and a strong payment-focused ecosystem, RUVI steps in as a refreshing alternative by focusing on community participation, long-term stability, and transparent returns. Unlike Ripple, which leans heavily on institutional adoption for growth, RUVI is designed to thrive on decentralization and grassroots engagement. The exciting potential of RUVI’s VIP 3 tier A standout element of RUVI’s compelling structure is its VIP 3 tier, which offers lucrative benefits for new investors. Those who contribute $1,000 at $0.01 per token secure 100,000 RUVI tokens and receive an extra 60,000 tokens as a bonus, giving participants 160,000 tokens total. With RUVI’s projected launch price of $0.07, this initial $1,000 investment transforms into $11,200, equating to an impressive 1120% ROI. This clear and structured tier system gives investors immediate confidence, knowing their contributions yield significant rewards. RUVI’s Leaderboard Rewards system takes community engagement to the next level. Designed to empower and reward active contributors, this program incentivizes participation on a competitive yet inclusive scale. The top 10 leaderboard participants are awarded a substantial 500,000 tokens each, while 250,000 tokens go to those in the top 50. Even newcomers making it into the top 1,000 are rewarded with 20,000 tokens. By enabling participation-based recognition, RUVI ensures that every community member feels valued and incentivized to stay engaged. Why RUVI stands out While Ripple focuses on transforming global payment systems, RUVI provides investors with a stable, community-driven alternative. Built on a secure Ethereum-based blockchain, RUVI emphasizes transparency in its tokenomics and prioritizes rewarding its investor community at every step. These features, combined with its innovative AI platform, make RUVI an attractive prospect for both new and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Seize your spot in RUVI’s future Ripple’s climb towards $10 is undoubtedly exciting, but comes with uncertainties tied to market sentiment and regulatory outcomes. RUVI, on the other hand, offers a refreshingly transparent and rewarding pathway to prosperity. Its Ethereum foundation ensures security, while the VIP tiers and Leaderboard Rewards program highlight its commitment to investor satisfaction. Don’t wait for the future to catch up. Join RUVI today and be part of a community-first blockchain ecosystem that prioritizes growth, rewards, and success.

In an April 7 announcement , the SFC announced new guidelines for crypto exchanges offering staking services and locally authorized funds exposed to digital assets involved in staking. The announcement follows recent remarks from Christina Choi, the SFC’s executive director of investment products, who said during a speech at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival: “The SFC is committed to supporting Hong Kong’s Web3 journey.” In its announcement, the regulator said it “recognizes the potential benefits of staking in enhancing the security of blockchain networks and allowing investors to earn yields.” Consequently, the latest guidance allows crypto exchanges to provide staking service offerings. Related: Hong Kong investment firm’s shares surge 93% after buying just 1 Bitcoin New rules for staking services The new rules were communicated by the regulator in its latest circular sent to crypto exchanges under its jurisdiction. The SFC requires crypto exchanges to obtain written approval before offering staking services, retain control over staked virtual assets and not delegate custody to third parties. Cryptocurrency exchanges engaged in staking must disclose all relevant risks and details concerning fees, minimum lock-up periods, unstaking processes, outage processes and custodial arrangements to their customers. Lastly, the providers must report on their staking activities to the SFC. A similar circular was sent to SFC-regulated crypto fund operators, with the new rules being relevant to funds with more than 10% of their net asset value invested directly or indirectly in digital assets. Funds can only acquire virtual assets that are also directly available to the local public and rely on SFC-authorized platforms. Leveraged exposure is prohibited. Funds can engage in staking if it is consistent with the fund’s objectives, while providing clear disclosure and robust controls. An investor notice and possibly shareholder approval may be required if staking implementation leads to material strategy or risk profile changes. Hong Kong bets on Web3 During her recent speech, SFC’s Choi recognized that the Web3 space is still evolving and that “its full benefits will unfold in time, likely with twists and turns.” She cited the speculative industry of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a cautionary tale that justifies caution in the current regulatory approach: “Therefore, rather than chasing every new spark, we believe in a pragmatic approach — strengthening the fundamentals and fostering a supportive ecosystem where Web3 can thrive in a sustainable manner.“ Related: Hong Kong remains an ‘open and vibrant market’ for crypto, says financial secretary The official’s comments follow recent reports that cryptocurrency exchange Bybit announced the shutdown of its NFT marketplace as the market is running out of steam. The decision follows a similar decision by major NFT marketplace X2Y2 announced in late March. The non-fungible token market is seeing a significant downturn. Daily NFT trading volume was over $18 million 364 days ago before Bybit’s announcements and stood at $5.34 million when the decision to shut down the platform was made public — a 70% fall. When arguing why Web3 companies should choose Hong Kong as their headquarters, Choi pointed out that Hong Kong ranks third in the Global Financial Centres Index. Furthermore, local regulators have set clear guidelines for crypto industry firms, and Hong Kong provides easy access to Asian markets. Global Financial Centres Index top 10. Source: LongFinance In her closing statements, Choi said, “We stand today at the crossroads where traditional finance and the digital economy are converging to drive promising outcomes for our financial markets.” She added: “The zero-to-one breakthrough has been made, and its future success would very much depend on how we nurture this convergence, that is, how we go from one to 100.“ Her statements echo Hong Kong’s financial technology sector, which has seen 250% growth since 2022 . The SFC recently introduced a new roadmap to position the city as a global cryptocurrency hub. The “ASPIRe” roadmap hopes to future-proof the local virtual asset ecosystem. It involves 12 initiatives spread across five broad categories, which include providing market access, optimizing compliance and frameworks and improving blockchain efficiency.

To be more precise, the token has seen its market cap drop from $121.81 billion on April 6 down to $100.28 billion by press time on Monday, April 7. XRP market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap What’s more, the XRP market cap drop happened on a strong surge in trading volume, which almost quadrupled, having increased from $2.26 billion to $9.6 billion in the same timeframe. All the while, the Securities and Exchange Commission is remaining oddly silent regarding the final resolution of the Ripple v. SEC case. Although not a clear-cut bearish signal, it’s notable that in previous instances, the commission officially dropped cases soon after similar announcements — something that has yet to materialize in XRP’s case. The losses might not stop there, either — the wider cryptocurrency market has lost $300 billion over the course of the weekend, and XRP’s network activity collapsed by as much as 65%, according to on-chain data. XRP price action and technical analysis By press time on April 7, XRP was changing hands at a price of $1.78, with a 14.96% drop on the daily chart which has brought year-to-date (YTD) losses up 14.21%. XRP price 1-day and year-to-date (YTD) charts. Source: Finbold The asset’s prior outperformance makes it a prime target for a sharp correction in the present. Although it hasn’t marked a greater loss than Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is currently in the red for 18.28%, XRP is currently down more than the S&P 500 , which has lost 13.54%, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Technical analysis also paints a rather grim picture. With the move below $2, price action could have confirmed a head and shoulders pattern shared by chart researcher Ali Martinez in an April 4 X post . If the pattern is legitimate, it could herald a drop to levels as low as $1.30 for the token.

Bitcoin dropped over 7% to hover near $75,000, while Ethereum crashed nearly 14.5%, dragging the ETH/BTC ratio to its lowest level in five years. This panic sell-off wasn’t limited to crypto; global stock markets also nosedived, wiping out over $8 trillion in value last week. Tariffs Trigger Panic Across Markets On April 2, Trump said the U.S. would start charging a 10% tax on everything coming into the country. He also added extra taxes on goods from 185 countries, calling them the worst in unfair trade. These new tariffs will begin on April 9. U.S. customs started collecting the 10% tax over the weekend, right after the stock market had its worst week since 2020. As a result, U.S. futures dropped Sunday night, and Bitcoin also fell since investors started avoiding risky assets. Trump’s new policy hit hard: a 10% tariff on nearly all imports, 34% on Chinese goods, and 20% on EU products. In response, China fired back with 34% tariffs on U.S. goods, triggering a risk-off sentiment globally. Trump’s tariff war caused a massive liquidation in the market with a $590M wipeout from the market, dropping Bitcoin below the $78K level, leading to a steep drop in both traditional and digital markets. Within 24 hours, $868 million in crypto long positions were liquidated—the highest since March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw nearly 6% declines, and crypto simply followed the pain. Bitcoin Faces Technical Breakdown Bitcoin didn’t just fall in price sadly, it broke a key rising wedge pattern, and a bearish “death cross” formed on the charts. This technical move is often a warning of a deeper downside. Analysts are now watching key levels like $74K as immediate support, $65K as the next line, and $57K as a last-ditch zone that buyers might defend. On April 6, Bitcoin touched a high of $83,813 but quickly reversed. The MACD flashed a bearish crossover, and RSI signals showed the asset was oversold multiple times heading into April 7. While a brief golden cross hinted at recovery, fresh bearish momentum pushed BTC lower, potentially opening the door to a dip below $75K. Analysts Weigh In Economist Peter Schiff declared that crypto is “finally starting to crack,” criticizing Trump’s economic strategy and the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He also warned ETF investors of rough times ahead. Even the Trump-themed meme coin fell over 13%, now down nearly 90% from January highs. But not everyone is bearish. Max Keiser sees this panic as the setup for a historic Bitcoin rally, predicting that BTC could hit $220,000 this month as global capital rushes to safe havens.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 09:54:38

Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have held strong positions for years, but one emerging DeFi token—Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—is beginning to grab serious attention. As the presale heats up, many are now asking: which of these three is the smarter move today? Cardano (ADA) Cardano was once seen as Ethereum’s quieter but more academically grounded competitor. It built a strong foundation based on peer-reviewed research and a unique proof-of-stake model. But despite upgrades and a growing ecosystem, ADA’s price has struggled to break past key resistance zones. While the platform continues developing, some investors feel the returns have lagged compared to other tokens in recent months. Its long-term vision remains intact, especially with ongoing smart contract development. However, in the short term, ADA seems more stable than explosive. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, by contrast, doesn’t pretend to be a serious smart contract platform. Originally launched as a meme, it’s sustained popularity largely thanks to community support and public figures like Elon Musk. That said, DOGE’s price action remains unpredictable—recent market dips saw it retreat after a short-lived spike. For traders who love volatility and quick flips, DOGE still delivers. But for those looking for tokens with clear utility, a path to yield, and consistent growth drivers, it may not offer the same level of confidence. Meet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers something very different from both ADA and DOGE. Still in its presale stage, MUTM is priced at just $0.025—but it’s already raised over $6.3 million and has attracted more than 7,900 on-chain holders. The interest isn’t speculative hype—it’s based on a working structure and a clearly defined purpose. At its core, Mutuum is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users will be able to deposit crypto assets and earn variable yields depending on market demand, or borrow overcollateralized funds without needing to sell their existing holdings. The protocol automatically balances utilization across its liquidity pools, creating a dynamic system where interest rates adjust based on supply and demand. What gives MUTM an edge is how its token integrates with the platform. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that reflect their share of the pool and accumulate interest over time. These can be traded, transferred, or held for passive yield. The system also supports a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, overcollateralized and designed to provide on-chain liquidity without the need for centralized backing. On top of that, the protocol includes a buy-and-redistribute mechanism, using revenue from fees to purchase MUTM from the open market and reward mtToken holders. This introduces a consistent loop of demand while directly benefiting the protocol’s most active users. With Mutuum’s token set to list soon and a beta release of the platform planned around the same time, there’s a strong incentive to accumulate before launch. Investors who got in at earlier phases have already seen price increases from $0.01 to $0.025. The upcoming move to $0.03 in the next presale phase represents a 20% jump—just for being early. Mutuum Finance is also ramping up engagement through a community-focused initiative, offering a $100,000 giveaway to early supporters. This move isn’t just about promotion—it’s designed to reward users who are actively participating in the ecosystem as the project gains traction. With presale interest climbing and more users joining daily, the giveaway adds another compelling reason for investors to get involved while the opportunity is still open. Unlike ADA and DOGE, which have already priced in much of their success, MUTM is still at the beginning. It’s one of the few altcoins currently offering both entry-level pricing and a clear path to post-launch utility.

More importantly, he connects it to the 1987 Black Monday crash, which wiped out trillions of dollars, affecting the global financial market. As Monday arrived and the market’s downfall anticipated to persist, did Cramer’s prediction come true? Let’s discuss this. Jim Cramer Predicts 1987 US Stock Market Crash Apart from his popular show and market prediction, Jim Cramer is known for the inverse Cramer index, a hypothetical theorem. According to this, the inverse or opposite of Cramer’s prediction comes true. As a result, when he predicted a 1987 similar US stock market crash, investors anticipated recovery, but that did not happen. The US president, Donald Trump, has introduced tariffs , which has led to the ongoing economic crisis affecting all financial markets, including the stock and crypto markets. Due to this uncertainty, Cramer has predicted that a massive crash, similar to 1987, where DJIA fell 22.6% in a single day, may take shape unless Trump revises his aggressive tariff polices. If the president doesn’t try to reach out and reward these countries and companies that play by the rules, then the 1987 scenario… the one where we went down three days and then down 22% on Monday, has the most cogency. Has Jim Cramer’s US Stock Market Crash Prediction Come True? Trump’s tariff and the impacted nations’ counterattacks, like China imposing an inverse 35% tariff on all US exports to them, have resulted in the worst market crash since the pandemic. The Dow Jones fell 3,910 points across Thursday and Friday, the S&P 500 dropped 5.97%, and the Nasdaq fell 5.8%, wiping out nearly $6.6 trillion. As the market’s downturn persists even today, the Jim Cramer stock market crash prediction seems true as he said, “We will not have to wait too long to know. We will know it by Monday.” More importantly, he added that he had lived through the 1987 Black Monday crash and knew what it felt like before adding that the employment data is the buffer. Adding to these concerns, financial institutes like JP Morgan believe that recession might hit America in 2025 due to these US policies. Amid this chaos, investors’ sentiments are seriously affected, with a few analysts like Peter Schiff claiming that the market did not crash because of tariffs but due to the fear of the tariffs’ continuing. ‘Donald Trump’s Market Crash Has a Purpose’ Amid the extreme criticism, Donald Trump stood true to his initial claims, calling tariffs an important measure to make America wealthy again. In a recent Truth post, Trump revealed that the country had a massive financial deficit with China, the European Union, and many others. More importantly, he claimed that Tariff is the solution as they would bring billions of dollars to the country before asserting that people will realize their positive impact someday. White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett also said that the stock market crash is not an intentional strategy. Still, it has the purpose of making America rich as it can push cash into treasuries. It weakens the dollar, drops the mortgage, and does much more to benefit Americans. He added that it’s a wild chess move, but it’s working. Although Jim Cramer’s US stock market crash prediction generates concern, there’s hope around the inverse Cramerer index, countries like Japan are willing to negotiate, and there is a possibility of Trump putting a hold on tariffs.

Real utility, market catalysts, and unstoppable hype are a must for the best altcoins to invest in to keep your portfolio in the green this year. Each of these has a clear roadmap for explosive growth and here’s why they’re about to take off: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) – Bringing meme mania to Bitcoin with the first-ever meme coin ICO on BTC and a Layer 2 built for retail adoption. PepeX (PEPX) – The only truly fair launchpad that thrives when markets bleed. CartelFi (CARTFI) – Best meme coin yield farm for both bull and bear markets. SPX6900 (SPX) – The anti-S&P500 meme coin, riding against TradFi. Hyperliquid (HYPE) – A next-gen decentralized trading platform with its own L1 blockchain and skyrocketing adoption. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) – The best altcoin for bringing meme coins & DeFi to Bitcoin Meme coins have ruled the game on Solana and Ethereum, but Bitcoin Pepe is aiming to make Bitcoin the new meme coin hub. For years, Bitcoin has been digital gold, but BPEP is injecting Solana-level speed, low fees, and meme culture straight into the world’s most trusted blockchain. BTC maxis can finally trade meme coins without leaving their comfort zone, and that’s a setup retail investors are going to flood into. Bitcoin Pepe is building the first-ever meme coin infrastructure on Bitcoin. To do this, Bitcoin Pepe introduces the PEP-20 token standard, mirroring Ethereum’s ERC-20, which fueled ETH’s insane growth. This means anyone can launch their own meme coins natively on BTC, unlocking $2 trillion of Bitcoin capital for meme trading. More meme coins equal more trading, a self-feeding loop unlike anything the space has seen. The presale is structured in 30 stages, with 5% price jumps at every stage. Buying early means catching the biggest discount before the retail crowd piles in. Apart from raw 100x potential, BPEP is rolling out staking rewards that put traditional finance to shame with a long-term 10,000% APY option for true believers. Holders will earn massive passive income while taking part in building Solana on Bitcoin from the ground up. Bitcoin Pepe is shaping up to be the next Solana, but on Bitcoin, with catalysts SOL never had. With over $6.1m raised, it’s time to prep your bags: this altcoin is ready for the moon landing. PepeX (PEPX) – Turning global ideas into investable assets PepeX is built for survival when everything else is falling apart, as it’s engineered to cut out the dirty tricks that leave retail investors holding the bag. In a bear market or recession, transparency and accountability are simple survival tools. Accessible launchpads have been a ruthless free-for-all where whales snipe tokens and founders dump the second they hit profit. PepeX dismantles that broken system by making sure no dev can walk away with a fat payday while everyone else gets left in the dirt. Anti-sniping protocols, transparent bubble maps, and locked liquidity that founders can’t touch unless their project delivers. PepeX’s AI marketing bot runs nonstop, managing Telegram and X accounts to pump out coordinated marketing campaigns. When retail interest is low, consistent marketing can be the difference between liftoff and a flatline. Pump.fun raked in nearly $400M last year, but PepeX isn’t chasing short-term hype; with $1.2m already raised, it’s expecting sustainable, community-first growth. When liquidity is scarce and investors are cautious, projects that can prove fairness and accountability are the ones that rise above the noise. CartelFi (CARTFI) – Turning idle meme coins into cash-generating assets CartelFi is a way to squeeze the most brutal markets for profit while everyone else is licking their wounds. This is the first farm for meme coins where you can turn speculative, high-volatility assets into cash-generating tokens. It is creating specialized liquidity pools that churn out yield while still maintaining full exposure to future moonshots. During a recession, when capital dries up and retail’s terrified of the next crash, CartelFi’s buyback-and-burn system turns scarcity into strength. Up to 100% of protocol fees go straight into buybacks and burns, which means constant upward pressure on token value even when the market’s bleeding out. When rate cuts come and banks are scraping by on 3% returns, CartelFi’s liquidity pools are spitting out insane APYs designed to keep printing money through the worst of it. The presale is split into 30 stages, and prices climb by 5% at every stage. With over $500k raised on day one, this presale is going viral simply because buyers see the opportunity to turn a profit in a bear market. SPX6900 (SPX) – The best altcoin for betting against traditional finance Crypto isn’t the only market feeling the pressure, traditional finance is taking a beating, too. The S&P 500 has slipped considerably since the election, and dropped almost record numbers following Trump’s tariff announcements. But while stocks flounder, SPX6900 has been on a tear, putting up a nearly 15,000% gain from April 2024 to April 2025. Even when meme coins tanked in January and February, SPX6900 held strong, rallying behind the Coinbase listing. With broader economic uncertainty and the Trump-fueled crypto revival, SPX6900 is the anti-traditional finance token and a rallying call for a new generation of traders. Hyperliquid (HYPE) – The best altcoin for next-gen decentralized trading While most decentralized exchanges run on Ethereum or Solana, HYPE is built on its own custom layer-1 blockchain, eliminating gas fees and network congestion altogether. Hyperliquid is engineered for speed, efficiency, and profitability. Its HLP token vaults also give liquidity providers a new way to earn passive income, making it more than just a trading hub. Its approach is similar to Solana’s Jupiter, it’s not relying on another chain to survive. This is one of the best altcoins to invest in before the next wave of DEX adoption hits. Best recession-proof altcoin to invest in right now: BPEP to surge 300% before launch Even in downturns, there’s still a fortune to be made if you know where to look. PepeX’s AI-powered launchpad is creating a haven for fair launches that actually protect retail investors, while CartelFi’s meme coin yield farm turns volatility into non-stop revenue through relentless buybacks and burns. Each of these cryptos is hitting a critical growth phase, but Bitcoin Pepe’s early-stage ICO makes it one of the best recession-proof altcoins right now. With over $6.1m raised, its presale structure rewards early backers with the biggest gains before launch. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

From crashing stock futures to collapsing oil and even gold prices, every major asset class is flashing warning signals. Currently, the cryptocurrency market is following the trend in the US stock market. All eyes are on the crypto market. The big question is: Will it support investors to overcome this market uncertainty? Stock Futures Crash 15% in Just Three Days Since the start of April 3, the S&P 500 index has declined by nearly 7.62%, and the Nasdaq 500 has dropped by 7.30%. A recent report revealed that the stock futures slipped at least 15% in just three days. Generally, it is when the market is heading towards a serious economic depression that major indices show serious negative signals. Is the global market under serious threat? Oil Prices Slide Below $60: Big Demand Collapse? To understand the scenario better, it is important to analyse other major indices. Let’s start by analysing the cruise oil scenario. At the beginning of this month, the WTI Crude Oil price was around $71.35. Since then, the market has plummeted by over 16.62%. Right now, the price of WTI Crude Oil remains at $59.49 – slightly below the crucial $60 level. Between April 3 and April 4 alone, the market declined by over 11.27%. Plummeting oil prices is the early sign of a shrinking economy. Gold Prices Tank as Investors Flee to Cash Gold is generally considered a safe asset. During economic uncertainty, investors flock to gold in order to protect their assets from the impact of a potential market decline. Between April 3 and 4, even the gold market slipped by over 3.17%. This implies that investors are even unsure about the ability of gold to overcome the present global economic crisis. As of now, the gold price stands at $3,030.505. Bond Market Signals Economic Freeze At the beginning of this month, the US Treasury Bond Futures price was $118.59. Since the market has risen by nearly 1.68%. Currently, the price stands at $120.59%. This usually happens when people are looking for safe havens and believe the economy is facing serious trouble. AI Hype Cools: ‘Mangificent 7’ Stocks Drop 35% A recent report revealed that the Magnificent 7 index – an index representing the performance of major tech companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla – plummeted by 35%. This also indicates that investors are pulling out of risky sectors. Investor Sentiment Hit Rock Bottom The CNN Fear and Greed Index, which considers seven key indicators – S&P market momentum, NYSE stock price strength, NYSE stock price breadth, put and call options, S&P market volatility, and US safe haven demand – sits at 4. This indicates that investors are under extreme fear. Reports suggest that investor fear is now at the same level as March 2020, when COVID lockdowns started. How This Will Impact the Cryptocurrency Market? The current wave of market panic could spill over into the crypto industry. In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has already dropped by 11.2%. Bitcoin has slipped by 8.6%, Ethereum by 17.2%, XRP by 16.2%, BNB by 8.7%, Solana by 16.4%, and Dogecoin by 16.9%. However, if trust in centralised systems continues to erode, crypto could also gain favour as an alternative store of value. The coming days will reveal whether crypto acts as a safe haven – or gets swept up in the global sell-off.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 09:58:29

As capital begins to rotate out of overbought assets, smart money is moving into projects with real fundamentals, strong upside potential, and growing ecosystems. Right now, one token is catching serious attention: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While ADA and SHIB have dominated headlines in the past, their momentum is fading. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is gaining ground fast—and for good reason. Whales and early-stage DeFi investors are already positioning themselves, betting on a post-launch breakout fueled by utility, tokenomics, and growing demand. Why whales are rotating into MUTM The shift toward MUTM isn’t speculative—it’s strategic. Blockchain analysts have tracked multiple high-volume wallets acquiring MUTM during the presale. These aren’t short-term traders; they’re long-term holders looking for value-based growth. MUTM is priced at just $0.025 during its fourth presale phase, but large investors are expecting the token to surge by at least 1,400% shortly after launch. The upcoming exchange listing and protocol rollout are expected to push the token to $0.40 and beyond in the early stages, with projections targeting $6 by the end of the year. Let’s put that into perspective. A $1,600 investment today would buy 64,000 MUTM tokens. When the price reaches $0.40, that position becomes $25,600—a 16x gain. And as the price climbs toward $6, that same allocation will be worth $384,000. Why MUTM Offers More Value Than ADA and SHIB Cardano (ADA) is a well-known Layer 1 with a solid foundation, but its growth has slowed. Much of its market cap is already priced in, making it harder to deliver high percentage returns. Meanwhile, SHIB is a meme-driven asset. Despite its community strength, it lacks a structured utility model that supports long-term price growth. Mutuum Finance , on the other hand, is still early—meaning it has the most room to grow. It’s not just another DeFi token—it’s a protocol with two working mechanisms for users to generate yield: supplying assets and earning passive income, or borrowing against crypto collateral without selling it. MUTM powers the platform’s entire economy. As activity grows, a portion of fees generated by the protocol is used to buy MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to active users. This buy-and-distribute mechanism increases token demand while rewarding those who contribute liquidity and activity to the system. Long-term potential: what drives the $6 price target? The target of $6 per token by the end of 2025 isn’t a random prediction—it’s built on the math behind Mutuum’s tokenomics and roadmap. The platform is preparing to roll out a beta version of its lending and borrowing protocol at the time of token launch, delivering immediate utility. Unlike many presale tokens that wait months to go live, MUTM will begin generating value from day one. Additionally, the expected listing on major exchanges will create substantial buy pressure, increasing visibility and daily volume. As more users begin to explore its DeFi tools—especially in the P2C and P2P models—Mutuum Finance is positioned to become one of the few platforms where early participation directly correlates with real yield. Traders who provide liquidity in these models earn passive returns while maintaining control of their assets. Borrowers unlock capital without having to sell long-term holdings. Combined, this creates a circular economy that sustains growth and increases usage over time. While ADA and SHIB have already had their moment, the next wave belongs to tokens still flying under the radar—but not for long. Mutuum Finance is already showing the signals of a breakout project: strong tokenomics, growing community, whale accumulation, and a real financial engine behind it. With whales betting big and utility around the corner, MUTM is the most compelling buy under $1 right now. The question isn’t whether it will rise—it’s whether you’ll be early enough to catch it before the price leaves this zone for good.

Because Trump imposed an additional 34% tax on the tax imposed on China, and China responded with retaliation. While the tension between the US and China and Trump's statements have caused BTC and altcoins to drop to levels not seen for a long time, important BTC statements came from Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Jack Dorsey recently appeared on the “Presidio Bitcoin” podcast, claiming that Bitcoin will ultimately fail if it is used solely as a store of value and does not become a payment method. Dorsey noted that Bitcoin has strayed from its original vision as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” outlined in the whitepaper, advocating for the development of fast, private and secure payment solutions and the inclusion of Bitcoin as a payment method. Stating that Bitcoin is a store of value comparable to gold and that many people have invested in BTC, Dorsey said that even if this is a success, if Bitcoin is not accepted as a payment method, it risks extinction as a result. “I think for Bitcoin to continue to exist in everyday life, it needs to be used for payments. Otherwise, it's something you buy and forget about, and only use in emergencies or when you want to get liquid again. So if it's not used for payments and doesn't find everyday use, Bitcoin becomes less and less relevant. And that's a failure for me.” *This is not investment advice.

This drop has fueled market concerns, as investors were anticipating a strong recovery in Pi Coin’s value this week. On the other hand, a market expert has predicted a potential dip to $0.3 for the asset, while saying that the recovery might not start anytime soon. Pi Network Price Retreat: Here’s All The investors are keeping close track of the Pi Network price, especially as the crypto has continued to fall over the past few weeks. Notably, the crypto reached as high as $3 before wiping off much of its gain, with many urging the Pi Core team to help revive the asset’s price through token burns. As of writing, Pi price was down more than 12% and traded at $0.56, after falling to as low as $0.53 in the last 24 hours. Notably, the crypto’s trading volume from yesterday also recorded a slump of over 57% to $469 million. Meanwhile, the dip comes amid a broader crypto market crash , which resulted in a liquidation of $1.4 billion in the last 24 hours. Besides, the robust Pi Coin unlocks since its launch has further weighed on the investors’ sentiment, potentially dragging down the crypto’s price. However, despite that, the investors were hopeful for a strong recovery this week, which appears to have faded by the recent performance. Why Investors Were Hoping For Pi Network Recovery? The Pi Coin unlocks will be at their lowest from April 7 to April 11, which has fueled optimism over a potential recovery, PiScan data showed . Only about 1.5 million Pi tokens are scheduled to get unlocked daily during this period, as compared to the monthly highest unlock of 9.8 million Pi, scheduled for April 18. With this lower influx into the market, the investors were anticipating a strong recovery in the Pi Network price. However, it appears that despite the lower unlocks, a lack of any crucial announcement from the Pi Core Team has dampened the market sentiment. Besides, the absence of any major exchange listings has further dampened the market sentiment. Is Pi Coin Poised To Hit $0.3? With Pi Network price continuing its fall, the investors are keeping close track of the future movement of the crypto. Amid this, a renowned Pi enthusiast and market expert has predicted a potential slump to $0.3 in the coming days. For context, prominent crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has issued a stark warning to Pi Coin investors, predicting a significant price drop to $0.30 or lower in the coming days. According to his analysis, the lack of substantial changes to Pi’s tokenomics and the absence of major announcements or partnerships by the Core Team will likely trigger this downturn. Meanwhile, the influx of unlocked Pi coins to centralized exchanges (CEXs) is expected to exacerbate the situation, leading to increased selling pressure. Dr. Altcoin’s forecast suggests that investors should prepare for a prolonged period of stagnation, with no signs of recovery until the end of August 2025. This forecast has significant implications for Pi Coin holders, who are eagerly awaiting a price surge. Besides, it also comes in tandem with a recent Pi price prediction , which suggests a bearish road ahead for the asset, unless any significant announcement helps boost the market sentiment.

The big Daddy of them all, the U.S. S&P 500, opens later. In the midst of this sea of red, and the possible carnage to come, Bitcoin (BTC) is fast approaching the top of its previous bull flag at $73,800. Is the crash of the century about to hit? Will the sharpest drop in history take place? If the S&P 500 records a further fall on Monday of 4%, it will be the sharpest drop in price since the Great Depression. At no time since then have there been three consecutive down days of 4% or more. The U.S. stock market Fear and Greed Index has just fallen to a score of 4 in the Extreme Fear sector. This has never been seen before, and is lower than during COVID and the 2008 Great Financial Crash. This gives one an idea of just how bad market sentiment is currently. Trump’s plan fraught with danger It seems that the Trump Administration has gone all in on its plan to bring bond yields lower so that this year’s maturing $7 trillion parcel of debt can be refinanced at a much lower rate. The strategy appears to be to force capital out of stocks and into bonds. Bonds would then climb in price, but the yields would lower. This would enable much improved refinancing rates, and at the same time could force the hand of the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates and providing the liquidity with which to drive the economy back up afterwards. The plan looks to be fraught with danger, but the US is in such a perilous position with its debt that something drastic is needed in order to be able to service it. How does Bitcoin perform in this kind of situation? $BTC price forming a descending channel Source: TradingView For the last 3 days Bitcoin is down about 10%. That said, it is so far holding up better than the S&P 500, which is down 10.5% over 2 days. The closing price on Monday will give an updated idea of how Bitcoin is able to cope with this environment compared with stocks generally. The price action in the daily chart above looks as though it has formed a descending channel since the $109,000 all-time high. The price has fallen through the support of the last 37 days, and the bears are favourites to force the confirmation below at the end of today, thereby flipping the support into resistance. If the $BTC price continues to drop, and gets down to the lower trend line of the channel, this would coincide with strong support from the bull flag within which Bitcoin traversed through most of last year, as well as the top of the previous bull market in 2021. Bitcoin approaches truly epic support Source: TradingView The 2-week view of the Bitcoin macro picture is very telling. Could Bitcoin be in another bull flag? At the very least, the price would be more likely to leave the descending channel to the upside. As it stands, as mentioned above, if the price continues down, it will meet the adamantine support of the top of the previous bull flag, and the very top of the 2021 bull market. This also matches the bottom trendline of the channel. In its entire history, once Bitcoin has succeeded in breaking and confirming above its previous bull market high, it has never fallen back below this level. The 2-week Stochastic RSI is bottoming, with the weekly Stochastic RSI also coming back to the bottom, while the indicator on the Relative Strength Index has reached the 50.00 level, which has acted as strong support and resistance previously. As Monday’s price action plays out, especially once the U.S. stock exchanges open later in the day, who knows where it will end up? That said, the $69,000 support is of truly epic proportions, and price is not likely to continue to fall without any reversal rallies.

The investor, who had locked 67,570 ETH — worth roughly $106 million — into the DeFi lending platform Sky, was liquidated. This comes as ETH plunged nearly 18%, sending shockwaves through the decentralized finance ecosystem. Whale Wipeout Stuns DeFi as Ether Freefalls Sky, formerly known as Maker , operates by allowing users to borrow its DAI stablecoin by depositing crypto as collateral — primarily ETH. To safeguard the system, Sky requires an overcollateralization ratio of at least 150%, meaning users need to pledge $150 worth of ETH for every 100 DAI they borrow. But when Ether’s price sharply dropped , this whale’s collateral ratio slipped to 144%. That small margin was enough to trigger an automated liquidation, leading Sky to seize and auction the collateralized ETH to cover the outstanding debt and fees. The event was flagged by both DeFi Explore and Lookonchain, and has since become the talk of the DeFi world. Another whale, who had posted nearly 57,000 wrapped ETH — valued around $91 million — was reportedly on the brink of liquidation as well, according to Spot On Chain. The fear now is that a continued decline in ETH could lead to a domino effect across other leveraged positions. Market Braces for More Pain Ether’s price tumbled to $1,547 at its lowest point — a level not seen since October 2023. The broader market sentiment was battered by fears of a looming recession , following President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs on global trade partners. The crypto crash mirrors the bloodbath in traditional markets, where nearly $6.6 trillion in value was erased over two days. ETH is now down 70% from its 2021 all-time high, and analysts warn that without fresh capital or collateral injections, more DeFi borrowers risk being liquidated. According to data from CoinGlass, over 320,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, wiping out close to $1 billion — the majority of those losses tied to Ether positions.

This marks a major shift in the firm’s strategies, as the platform hasn’t historically supported American clients. CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed the company’s potential plan to introduce a US-focused stablecoin if the country introduces new stablecoin regulations. Tether To Introduce US Stablecoin: What To Know According to a recent report by Financial Times , Tether, the issuer of USDT, is planning to introduce a stablecoin exclusively for the United States. This move is anticipated as the first of its kind, as the platform has historically not served US clients. The firm’s decision aligns with the United States’ progressive stance on cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump. As cited by CEO Paolo Ardoino, the US considers stablecoin as an “important instrument for the United States”. This approach influences the company to offer a stable digital asset available solely in the US. Interestingly, Ardoino added that the platform is awaiting the US’ new rules for stablecoin regulation. He posited that the firm would launch US domestic stablecoin if new regulations make them competitive. Also, Ardoino called the company’s potential stablecoin “basically a settlement currency.” Paolo Ardoino Explains Tether’s Regulatory Compliance Further, Palo Ardoino underscored Tether’s regulatory compliance with US law enforcement. Adding that he has direct connection with the regulatory agencies, Ardoino noted, We are the only ones that on-board the FBI, on-board the US Secret Services. We work directly with the [Department of Justice] and we don’t wait for court orders to act, but we actually have a direct connection with the law enforcement. The firm’s stablecoin proposal comes on the heels of the United States’ STABLE Act . Recently, the Trump government passed the act to establish a regulatory framework for USD-backed stablecoins. Donald Trump’s Crypto Moves Influence the Global Crypto Market It is noteworthy that Tether’s stablecoin proposal is primarily driven by Donald Trump’s crypto-focused moves and policies. With his inauguration as the 47 th President of America, the US crypto market has experienced a major shift. The US SEC has seen a restructuring, which led to the dismissal of multiple crypto lawsuits. Moreover, Trump’s crypto reserve plans have also influenced other global powers. As the US has embraced Bitcoin as a national reserve and muses to adopt other altcoins to the reserve, countries across the world are considering restructuring their financial policies.

After falling dangerously close to $0.3, the once-hyped Pi Coin has left many in the community frustrated and uncertain. Now, a bold new idea has entered the conversation—a decentralized, community-driven strategy designed to stop the bleeding and restore confidence in the ecosystem. Also Read : Pi Network News Today: Millions of Pi Coins Withdrawn From OKX, Users Detect Unusual Activity Pi Network Update An unknown figure going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto has proposed a Community-Driven Liquidity Pool (CDLP) aimed at giving Pi Coin some much-needed price support. Instead of relying on big investors or centralized exchanges, the CDLP puts the power in the hands of regular users. Each participant would commit to buying a small amount of Pi every month for instance think $10 worth—as part of a broader, collective strategy to keep the market balanced. The idea draws from the concept of dollar-cost averaging, where steady, routine buying helps smooth out volatility over time. And since users keep full control of their Pi coins (no need for intermediaries), this model stays true to crypto’s decentralized roots. Why This Could Actually Work According to Nakamoto, this kind of consistent monthly demand could significantly reduce selling pressure while boosting liquidity. That means fewer dramatic price swings and a much stronger floor for Pi Coin. If enough users commit, it could result in over $100 million flowing into the market—without relying on whales or outside exchanges. Nakamoto believes this could help create a stable environment for developers and merchants alike. It would give builders the confidence to launch new projects on Pi while also encouraging real-world businesses to adopt Pi for payments. And as utility grows, so does long-term value. Short-Term Fixes and Bigger Problems Moreover, while the CDLP is a long-term vision, some in the community, like Dr Altcoin, are calling for more immediate solutions, such as burning billions of tokens to shrink the supply and give prices a quick jolt. Meanwhile, frustrations are growing over Pi’s absence from major exchange listings like Binance , which has only deepened the bearish mood. But Nakamoto is confident. He says this strategy doesn’t just prop up price; it will rebuild trust, strengthen the network, and empower the community. If Pi holders rally behind this idea, it could mark the beginning of a real turnaround not just for the price, but for Pi Network’s future as a decentralized currency with real use cases.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 11:44:03

When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of outflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an outflow of $207 million, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an outflow of $37.7 million. When we look at other altcoins, Solana (SOL) experienced an outflow of $1.8 million, SUI $4.7 million, while XRP $4.5 million and Toncoin (TON) $1.1 million inflow. “The vast majority of outflows occurred in Bitcoin, with $207 million in outflows, bringing the total inflow since the beginning of the year to $1.3 billion. Flows in altcoins were mixed, with Ethereum seeing $37.7 million in outflows, while Solana and Sui saw $1.8 million and $4.7 million in outflows respectively. More esoteric tokens like Toncoin (TON) saw $1.1 million in inflows.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an outflow of 210 million dollars. Germany came in second after the USA with an output of $17.7 million. Contrary to these outflows, Canada and Brazil saw smaller inflows of $4.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively. *This is not investment advice.

According to Cathiesark.com , Ark Invest placed three buy orders for Coinbase stock on April 4th, amounting to over $13 million, making COIN the second-largest holding in all its combined exchange-traded funds (ETFs). COIN is currently trading at $161, about 54% down from its December 2024 high. In a recent video update, Wood says that she expects Bitcoin ( BTC ) to begin outperforming gold in the coming months. According to the investor, the BTC to gold ratio hasn’t broken its long-term uptrend. “Gold has had a good run against Bitcoin. Bitcoin did very well relative to gold in 2023 and 2024, but not so this year. Nonetheless, we do think over time, Bitcoin will appreciate relative to gold, and as you can see, it has not broken the uptrend line.” Source: Ark Invest/YouTube While bullish on Bitcoin and Coinbase, Wood said last month that she expects many other crypto assets to go to zero, particularly tokens in the memecoin space. In an interview with Bloomberg, Wood predicted that “millions” of memecoins would become worthless. “What we think will happen is there will be some fearsome declines in the prices of some of these meme assets, and there’s nothing like losing money for people to learn. Now learn that the SEC and regulators are not taking responsibility for these memecoins… The millions of memecoins will probably end up worthless.

In a recent X post, Schwartz wrote “Finally some good news,” in response to a warning of a potential stock market crash, reminiscent of the 1987 “Black Monday” collapse. Meanwhile, the warning came from CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who predicted a massive downturn. However, Schwartz’s optimism wasn’t about the crash itself but rather about who made the prediction. When a confused follower asked why a collapse could be considered “good news,” Schwartz wrote, “Cramer hasn’t gotten a prediction right since 2009.” This exchange quickly caught fire online, hinting at the popular “Inverse Cramer” concept. According to this theory, betting against Jim Cramer’s predictions often results in better returns, essentially flipping his forecasts into opportunities. Schwartz’s comment suggests that Cramer’s pessimism could signal a potential rebound, thus offering hope amid panic. Stock Markets Plunge Amid Global Tensions The Ripple CTO’s post comes during a brutal trading session across global markets. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index nosedived over 10% on Monday, marking its steepest fall since the 2008 financial meltdown. This sharp decline followed Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs on US imports, escalating fears of a prolonged trade war. With over 50% US tariffs now hitting China, global investors are growing wary of a deepening economic rift between the two superpowers. Adding to the volatility, China’s sovereign wealth fund had to step in to stabilize the local markets. Meanwhile, the Asian indices followed the slump, sparking broader market anxiety. Besides, the crypto market also followed suit, with Bitcoin price today falling around 7% during writing. Crypto Market Mirrors Global Financial Jitters As said earlier, the crypto market also crashed today, mirroring the same trend as the global stock market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and others, have recorded massive slump, with over $1.4 billion liquidation recorded in the last 24 hours. So, while Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s post has gained traction, recent trends suggest that Cramer’s prediction is coming true . However, the “Inverse Cramer” mindset has gained popularity among retail traders who’ve noticed a pattern in Cramer’s off-target calls. Having said that, the recent sarcastic post by the Ripple CTO appears to have provided some relief to the investors.

Mantra, a layer-1 (L1) blockchain built for tokenized RWAs, launched the Mantra Ecosystem Fund (MEF) to accelerate the growth and adoption of projects and startups building on its network, according to an April 7 announcement shared with Cointelegraph. Mantra said it will deploy the capital over the next four years among “high-potential blockchain projects” worldwide, with investment opportunities sourced through Mantra’s network of partners. The fund’s backers include a wide range of institutional partners including Laser Digital, Shorooq, Brevan Howard Digital, Valor Capital, Three Point Capital and Amber Group.

Despite a broader market slump triggered by US tariff-related concerns, the value of tokenized RWAs recently surged to a record high .

However, far from his expectations, the token flopped right after launch, creating questions about the credibility and future of such celebrity tokens. This became more important as US President Donald Trump’s meme coin failed despite his position and popularity among investors. Conor McGregor Meme Coin Flops With Presale Failure A day after Conor McGregor’s meme coin team launched the REAL token on April 5, it flopped. And the crypto market crash has nothing to do with this. Instead, the team could only collect 31% of the anticipated presale. In a 28-hour presale event, the REAL memecoin raised only $391k, 61% down from the $1M target, but the original goal was to collect $3.6 million and sell 60 million tokens (3% of total supply) at a starting price of $0.06 each. McGregor revealed that they did not hit the minimum raise before revealing the plans to refund all the bids. Although the token had already been launched, the crash was imminent, but McGregor claimed this wasn’t the end. In a decrypt interview, he revealed plans to relaunch it. However, the concern is whether this will survive, considering the state of other celebrity cryptos. Why Have the McGregor Crypto Coin & Other Celebrity Cryptos Failed? In the last few years, many famous personalities have tested their luck in the crypto industry. However, almost none have succeeded. Even though Conor McGregor promised that its meme coin would come with transparency, DAO voting rights, and use cases in the gaming ecosystem, the downfall of meme coins made the fall imminent. The hype of meme-themed cryptos has been on a downtrend since the beginning of the year. The ongoing crypto market crash amid Trump’s trade war has exacerbated the situation even more. More importantly, the investors’ trust in celebrity crypto has hit its bottom since Donald Trump’s meme coin collapsed. In addition, the rising frauds on Pump.fun launched cryptos and the historical record of celebrity cryptos like the Hawk Tubah Girl scam and others left investors with poor confidence in these digital assets. The concerns of US recession and financial market conditions will likely impact their performance for longer.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has been forming a rising wedge in a falling market, signaling further capitulation during the day, potentially towards $70k. Moreover, the heavy liquidation of long crypto traders, amounting to around $1.42 billion in the past 24 hours, has fueled the possibility of a further Selloff due to a long squeeze.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $51.4 billion, dropped over 15 percent to trade at about $99.66 on Monday, April 7, during the early New York session. Worth noting that SOL traded volume surged over 330 percent in the past 24 hours to hover at about $6.9 billion.

The recent downturn has pushed SHIB to its lowest level since February 2024, despite heightened activity on Shibarium after transactions rose to 1 billion. Shiba Inu Price Plunges to 13-Month Low Shiba Inu price trades at $0.0000108 at press time, its lowest level in more than 13 months. Traders are actively dumping this top meme coin after President Trump spooked investors after the “Liberation Day” tariffs led to 34% retaliatory tariffs from China. As the downtrend continues, SHIB’s open interest has declined by $454M from the peak of $542M recorded in mid-January. As open interest declines alongside the price, it highlights a strong bearish trend. At the same time, SHIB funding rates have plunged into negative territory. This setup shows a negative outlook where short-sellers are looking to make profits during the ongoing turmoil. SHIB Funding Rates Shibarium Transactions Soar to 1 Billion The bearish momentum with Shiba Inu price comes despite the growth of the Shibarium layer 2 network. This network has surpassed 1 billion transactions, marking a major milestone in the meme coin’s growth. Shibarium has processed more than 10.3 million blocks since its launch, and has a daily transaction count of approximately 4.4 million. These figures make it one of the fastest-growing layer-2 networks on the Ethereum blockchain. Shibarium Transactions A previous Coingape article reported that attaining this milestone could be bullish for Shiba Inu price. However, with the bloodbath across the crypto market, SHIB may fail to rally. Shiba Inu Price Risks Crash to $0.000009 The SHIB community might have to wait longer for a price rally to $0.0001 as the current trend shows that the most likely target is a drop to $0.000009. SHIB is trending within a descending parallel channel on its weekly chart. This indicates that selling activity has been gradually increasing, making a crash to $0.000009 even more likely. Technical indicators also support this bearish Shiba Inu price prediction . The RSI has declined to 35 and has been making a series of lower lows. This points to a gradual rise in sell-side activity. The negative MACD line further highlights a bearish momentum. SHIB/USDT: 1-Week Chart Shiba Inu price has dropped to a 13-month low despite the growth of the Shibarium network, which recently attained 1 billion transactions. The decline comes as crypto traders unwind their positions due to concerns about the impact of President Trump’s tariffs on risk assets. This suggests that SHIB may crash to $0.000009.

The recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has taken its toll on Ethereum, which has seen a 1.7% drop in its price, bringing it closer to multi-month lows. Ethereum’s struggles, coupled with its inability to hold key support levels, are increasingly worrying investors. Many are now turning to alternatives, with Coldware (COLD) emerging as a promising new contender. As the Ethereum network faces difficulties, Coldware continues to gain traction, offering innovative solutions that cater to the growing demand for scalability and efficiency in the blockchain space. Coldware (COLD) Enters the Market with Disruptive Innovation The innovative approach of Coldware (COLD) has not gone unnoticed. The platform offers a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, ensuring faster and more secure transactions. Furthermore, Coldware (COLD) is designed to scale easily, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from DeFi projects to gaming and beyond. With Ethereum’s dominance being questioned, Coldware is rapidly gaining a foothold in the blockchain ecosystem. As Ethereum holders experience increasing uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) is proving to be an attractive alternative. The platform’s presale has been met with strong demand, with early investors eager to get in on the ground floor. As Coldware (COLD) continues to gain momentum, the project is poised to emerge as a key player in the decentralized finance space, attracting a growing community of developers and investors. Ethereum Faces Persistent Struggles Amid Market Downturn Ethereum has faced considerable headwinds in the first quarter of 2025, underperforming in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC). Analysts have raised concerns about Ethereum’s potential to break below the critical $1,750 support level, as it struggles to maintain momentum. Ethereum's recent decline reflects broader market trends, with tariffs and macroeconomic instability contributing to the uncertainty. Despite Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space, its failure to capitalize on market opportunities has caused many to look for better-performing platforms. Ethereum’s technical analysis paints a grim picture, as the cryptocurrency’s inability to break above key resistance levels suggests a continuation of the downward trend. Over the past few months, Ethereum has posted significant losses, and its price has been unable to rebound, leading many investors to reassess their positions in the asset. Etherzum's Market Shift: Why Investors Are Turning to Coldware (COLD) As Ethereum's price continues to struggle, investors are increasingly migrating to other blockchain platforms that offer more scalability and lower transaction costs. Coldware (COLD), a new decentralized platform, has gained significant attention for its ability to address many of the issues that have plagued Ethereum. By providing a more efficient and scalable solution, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as the next-generation blockchain that can serve the needs of both developers and investors. One of the standout features of Coldware (COLD) is its ability to process transactions quickly and with low fees. This is a major improvement over Ethereum, which has been burdened by high gas fees and slow transaction times, especially during periods of network congestion. Coldware (COLD) offers a user-friendly and efficient platform that could redefine how decentralized applications (dApps) are developed and operated, attracting investors who have become frustrated with Ethereum’s limitations. Looking Ahead: Ethereum's Path to Recovery or Further Decline? As Coldware (COLD) rises in prominence, Ethereum’s future remains uncertain. The Pectra upgrade, which promises to enhance Ethereum's scalability and staking capabilities, may offer some relief, but its ability to reverse Ethereum's fortunes is still in question. Ethereum's ongoing struggles, coupled with the growing interest in Coldware, suggest that a market shift is underway. For Ethereum to regain momentum, it must overcome its scalability issues and high transaction costs. Until then, investors will continue to explore alternatives like Coldware (COLD) , which offer the efficiency and scalability that Ethereum lacks. Conclusion: The Future of Ethereum and Coldware Ethereum’s recent price decline and the shift toward Coldware (COLD) are indicative of a changing landscape in the blockchain space. While Ethereum’s future remains uncertain, Coldware is poised to capitalize on the growing demand for scalable, low-fee blockchain platforms. As Ethereum struggles to regain its footing, Coldware is attracting more attention from investors and developers looking for a better alternative. With its innovative approach and strong presale momentum, Coldware (COLD) is on track to become the next big player in the crypto ecosystem.

Top meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Official TRUMP ($TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK) all suffered heavy double-digit percentage losses . What Triggered the Meme Coin Sell-Off? This sharp downturn results from a combination of macroeconomic pressures and signs that the recent meme coin hype cycle is fading. Renewed investor fears over President Donald Trump’s aggressive global tariff strategy contributed to a wider market decline, hitting risk assets hard. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000 Monday (trading near $76,946 at press time ), while Ethereum plunged over 18% to trade near $1,490 .

Bitcoin (BTC) got slapped down under $76K and altcoins are painting the town red. It is turning out to be Black Monday for the financial markets. US stock futures are also throwing tantrums as the S&P 500 dropped almost 6% while the Nasdaq 100 spiraled 6.2%. Trump’s tariff war has impacted over 180 countries, and global markets are crashing down, reacting to that. Investors are now asking for a minute to breathe under the emerging selling pressure. Bitcoin gets rugged below $76K As per the data, the cumulative crypto market cap dropped by a massive 8.69% over the last day to sink below the $2.5 trillion mark. Its 24 hours trading volume spiked by a whopping 275% to hit $159 billion. This suggests that the traders are moving their funds invested in crypto heavily to get away from the crashing market. Data provided by CoinGlass shows that over 450k traders got liquidated in the last 24 hours. The total liquidations recorded stood at $1.4 billion, hinting that more might be seen ahead. Over $1.21 billion liquidated positions (87%) turn out to be long bets. This suggests that traders weren’t hoping the crypto market to collapse in front of traditional financial markets. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin tripped and nosedived to hit the $76K zone in its worst start to a historically bullish month. This might be its worst April Fools follow-up ever. BTC saw $465 million get liquidated over the past 24 hours as the bears took control. Someone please check on the bulls, they might need emotional support now. BTC price plunged by almost 9% over the last day while it has been dragged down by 25% in the past 90 days. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $76,662, at press time. Altcoins didn’t escape the wreckage either. Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) all took a 15% nosedive before catching a breath. SOL even dropped below the crucial $100 mark. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH) sinked 17% in the last 24 hours, trading below the $1,500 mark. Markets in mayday mode Veteran market commentator Jim Cramer reportedly sounded the alarm. He even pulled a history card, whispering “Black Monday.” He mentioned that if US President Trump doesn’t ease his aggressive policies then the global economy will watch chaos happening in front of them on April 7, Monday. Japan’s Nikkei crashed 9%, its lowest since October 2023, while Asia’s looking like someone pulled the plug on optimism. Shigeru Ishiba, Japan’s Prime Minister even said that he is ready to visit the US and negotiate tariffs with President Trump. According to the Kobeissi Letter , global markets have lost $20 trillion since February 19. That’s more than the GDP of the entire Eurozone. India’s Sensex and Nifty 50 crashed by 3.61% and 3.87%, respectively. The Shanghai Composite Index has declined to 3,065 points with a drop of 8.28%. The Hang Seng Index has fallen to 20,176 points, down 11.70% on the same day. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

These milestones mark a major step in Hive’s mission to make AI-driven blockchain applications faster and more accessible, positioning the company at the forefront of the emerging AI+crypto space. Key Highlights Mainnet Launch: Developers can now leverage Hive Intelligence’s unified API to query real-time data across 60+ blockchains using natural language—eliminating the need to navigate fragmented data sources. NVIDIA Inception Membership: Hive gains access to NVIDIA’s best-in-class AI tools and networking opportunities, fueling the development of advanced AI-driven blockchain solutions. $HINT Utility Token: The native token powers Hive’s ecosystem, enabling payment for on-chain data queries, AI computations, governance participation, and more. The Industry Challenge: Driving AI Adoption in Blockchain The growing convergence between AI and crypto has highlighted a persistent challenge: fragmented on-chain data that’s difficult to ingest, analyze, and act upon at scale. Traditional approaches rely on disparate APIs, complex node infrastructure, or manual data aggregation—all of which limit the potential of autonomous AI agents and advanced blockchain analytics. Hive Intelligence solves these pain points by merging dozens of data providers and blockchains into one streamlined API, enabling near-instant queries optimized for large language models (LLMs) and other AI workflows. “Hive Intelligence’s mainnet debut isn’t just a product release—it’s an invitation for businesses across Web2 and Web3 to harness the power of on-chain intelligence,” said Rishabh Narang, spokesperson for Hive Intelligence. “By joining NVIDIA Inception and going live on mainnet, we’re proving that AI-driven analytics can become the new standard for blockchain innovation, fueling use cases from DeFi to NFTs, compliance, and beyond.” Mainnet Ushers in a New Era of AI+Blockchain The launch of Hive Intelligence’s mainnet opens its AI-driven blockchain data infrastructure to the world. Developers and enterprises can now integrate directly with Hive’s platform to pull real-time, multi-chain data through a single, robust API. Crucially, Hive eliminates the historical fragmentation of blockchain data across disparate networks. For the first time, AI agents can seamlessly query and interact with multiple blockchains in one place, overcoming a major bottleneck in crypto analytics and application development. Hive’s API is designed to be LLM-ready, supporting natural language queries and AI-friendly responses. This means developers can ask complex questions about blockchain activity in plain English—such as, “What was the total trading volume on decentralized exchanges across Ethereum and Binance Chain in the past 24 hours?”—and receive structured, insightful answers immediately. The platform’s ability to handle such queries across several chains and data types (from DeFi lending stats to NFT marketplace trends) sets it apart as a universal data layer for Web3. Joining NVIDIA Inception to Turbocharge AI Innovation Hive’s acceptance into NVIDIA Inception, NVIDIA’s global startup program, provides significant momentum to the project’s AI ambitions. NVIDIA Inception offers technical guidance, go-to-market resources, and networking opportunities to promising companies in artificial intelligence and data science. In Hive’s case, membership comes with access to NVIDIA’s expertise in scaling AI models and infrastructure, as well as potential collaboration on cutting-edge AI research. This partnership is expected to speed up Hive’s roadmap of new features, potentially including enhanced natural language processing models for blockchain queries and more sophisticated AI agent integrations. $HINT Token: Powering the Hive Ecosystem At the core of Hive Intelligence’s platform is the $HINT utility token, which launched in tandem with the network. Far more than just a cryptocurrency, $HINT functions as the fuel driving the Hive ecosystem—it is required to access certain services and features on the platform, acting as the key that unlocks Hive’s advanced search and analytics capabilities. Developers and users utilize $HINT to pay for API calls and data queries on the Hive network, ensuring those who contribute resources are rewarded. As usage grows, demand for $HINT increases, incentivizing more data providers and validators to support the network. The token also underpins community governance and security: $HINT holders can vote on platform upgrades and parameters, aligning Hive’s evolution with its most invested users. Over time, staking and other incentive mechanisms will reward constructive behavior, foster network growth, and reinforce Hive’s commitment to a sustainable, user-centric ecosystem. A Vision for the Future Hive Intelligence envisions a world where AI agents seamlessly interact with blockchains, delivering insights, executing transactions, and transforming everything from finance to gaming in real time. With the mainnet live and support from NVIDIA Inception, Hive is uniquely positioned to drive that vision forward—reducing complexity for developers, unlocking opportunities for businesses, and sparking a new wave of AI+crypto applications. “As the demand for intelligent, on-chain solutions continues to surge, we’re excited to be at the forefront,” Rishabh Narang concluded. “We invite developers and enterprises across industries—Web2 or Web3—to explore Hive Intelligence’s platform and start building the AI agents of tomorrow, today.” About Hive Intelligence Hive Intelligence is a pioneering AI+blockchain company providing an infrastructure layer for AI agents and applications to interact with decentralized data in real time. Its unified API offers seamless, natural-language access to dozens of blockchains, enabling a new generation of AI-powered dApps and analytics tools. By solving the data fragmentation problem and delivering comprehensive, LLM-ready blockchain insights, Hive Intelligence accelerates the convergence of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. As a member of NVIDIA Inception, Hive has access to advanced AI technology and expertise, further empowering innovation at the intersection of AI and crypto. With its mainnet now live and the $HINT token fueling its ecosystem, Hive Intelligence stands as a leader in bridging blockchain technology with AI-driven analysis and decision-making—fulfilling its vision of making on-chain data as accessible and actionable as information on the traditional web.

These milestones mark a major step in Hive’s mission to make AI-driven blockchain applications faster and more accessible, positioning the company at the forefront of the emerging AI+crypto space. Key Highlights Mainnet Launch: Developers can now leverage Hive Intelligence’s unified API to query real-time data across 60+ blockchains using natural language—eliminating the need to navigate fragmented data sources. NVIDIA Inception Membership: Hive gains access to NVIDIA’s best-in-class AI tools and networking opportunities, fueling the development of advanced AI-driven blockchain solutions. $HINT Utility Token: The native token powers Hive’s ecosystem, enabling payment for on-chain data queries, AI computations, governance participation, and more. The Industry Challenge: Driving AI Adoption in Blockchain The growing convergence between AI and crypto has highlighted a persistent challenge: fragmented on-chain data that’s difficult to ingest, analyze, and act upon at scale. Traditional approaches rely on disparate APIs, complex node infrastructure, or manual data aggregation—all of which limit the potential of autonomous AI agents and advanced blockchain analytics. Hive Intelligence solves these pain points by merging dozens of data providers and blockchains into one streamlined API, enabling near-instant queries optimized for large language models (LLMs) and other AI workflows. “Hive Intelligence’s mainnet debut isn’t just a product release—it’s an invitation for businesses across Web2 and Web3 to harness the power of on-chain intelligence,” said Rishabh Narang, spokesperson for Hive Intelligence. “By joining NVIDIA Inception and going live on mainnet, we’re proving that AI-driven analytics can become the new standard for blockchain innovation, fueling use cases from DeFi to NFTs, compliance, and beyond.” Mainnet Ushers in a New Era of AI+Blockchain The launch of Hive Intelligence’s mainnet opens its AI-driven blockchain data infrastructure to the world. Developers and enterprises can now integrate directly with Hive’s platform to pull real-time, multi-chain data through a single, robust API. Crucially, Hive eliminates the historical fragmentation of blockchain data across disparate networks. For the first time, AI agents can seamlessly query and interact with multiple blockchains in one place, overcoming a major bottleneck in crypto analytics and application development. Hive’s API is designed to be LLM-ready , supporting natural language queries and AI-friendly responses. This means developers can ask complex questions about blockchain activity in plain English—such as, “What was the total trading volume on decentralized exchanges across Ethereum and Binance Chain in the past 24 hours?” —and receive structured, insightful answers immediately. The platform’s ability to handle such queries across several chains and data types (from DeFi lending stats to NFT marketplace trends) sets it apart as a universal data layer for Web3. Joining NVIDIA Inception to Turbocharge AI Innovation Hive’s acceptance into NVIDIA Inception , NVIDIA’s global startup program, provides significant momentum to the project’s AI ambitions. NVIDIA Inception offers technical guidance, go-to-market resources, and networking opportunities to promising companies in artificial intelligence and data science. In Hive’s case, membership comes with access to NVIDIA’s expertise in scaling AI models and infrastructure, as well as potential collaboration on cutting-edge AI research. This partnership is expected to speed up Hive’s roadmap of new features, potentially including enhanced natural language processing models for blockchain queries and more sophisticated AI agent integrations. $HINT Token: Powering the Hive Ecosystem At the core of Hive Intelligence’s platform is the $HINT utility token, which launched in tandem with the network. Far more than just a cryptocurrency, $HINT functions as the fuel driving the Hive ecosystem—it is required to access certain services and features on the platform, acting as the key that unlocks Hive’s advanced search and analytics capabilities.

In a post on X, Farina declared, “I’m not selling a single $XRP until the New York Times runs a front-page story titled ‘XRP Millionaires Take Over Wall Street.’” Farina’s statement reflects a growing mindset among XRP holders who believe the asset remains undervalued relative to its long-term potential. Farina’s belief is rooted in the digital asset’s utility in global finance. He and others in the community argue that short-term price action does not reflect the token’s eventual role in financial infrastructure. I’m not selling a single $XRP until the New York Times runs a front-page story titled ‘XRP Millionaires Take Over Wall Street.” — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 5, 2025 The Sleeping Giant Farina previously described XRP as a “ sleeping giant ,” attributing the asset’s potential to Ripple’s globe-spanning partnerships, its potential role in the U.S. financial system, and its adoption by big financial institutions like Santander and Bank of America. Many experts believe the digital asset’s current price stagnation is a result of regulatory constraints, not a lack of technological value or utility. Now that the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ended , XRP has become an even stronger contender in the market. How High Can XRP Go? Farina recently stated that XRP should already be trading above $100 . As the only asset with full legal clarity, he has big expectations for the digital asset and is confident that the current price does not reflect its true market value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina stated that XRP would have reached that price under normal circumstances but argued that the largest transfers of wealth don’t happen under normal circumstances. He believes one major development that could kickstart a surge is breaking away from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin often leads the market, XRP has been gaining dominance recently , and many experts believe it is coming for Bitcoin and Ethereum. For supporters like Farina, the asset’s fundamentals, strength, and potential support their strategy of accumulation and long-term holding. Mainstream Recognition for XRP Farina has also described not owning at least 1,000 XRP as insanity , and many in the community share this belief that the asset’s fundamentals, combined with its potential adoption in broader financial systems, make it a strategic asset to accumulate. With XRP now gaining mainstream recognition, more people are seeing its potential. A positive story on the New York Times’ front page, like what Farina is looking out for, would signify broad recognition and add credence to the digital asset’s reputation as a top player in the market.

In a recent post on X , he flagged $78,250 as a critical level for the leading cryptocurrency. He stated that a close below this threshold could open the door for a deeper correction, potentially bringing BTC down to its “last line of defense” at $72,673. As the market grapples with increased volatility, attention is now turning to the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 3-day chart—an indicator EGRAG highlights as signaling an imminent and potentially defining move. #BTC – Price Alert: $78,250! If we close below $78,250, our last line of defense is at $72,673. The 21 EMA on the 3-Day chart is signaling some important moves. Mark your calendars: Monday, April 7th, 2025, will be a day to remember! pic.twitter.com/L6PyAbMq78 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 6, 2025 $78,250: The Make-or-Break Level Bitcoin’s current price action places it in a vulnerable spot. The $78,250 support is not merely a psychological line; it represents a technically significant zone that has repeatedly acted as a pivot for price reversals over the past few weeks. A daily close beneath this mark could suggest waning bullish momentum and increase the probability of a stronger retracement. If such a breakdown occurs, EGRAG points to $72,673 as the final structural defense—a level that could either trigger a sharp bounce or lead to further declines if breached. The 21 EMA and the 3-Day Chart Narrative This warning is especially noteworthy because EGRAG Crypto bases it on the 21 EMA on the 3-day chart. This moving average has historically provided reliable insight into medium-term trend direction. When prices remain above the 21 EMA, Bitcoin often continues its upward trajectory. However, once it falls decisively below, it tends to usher in a period of consolidation or correction. Currently, BTC is dancing around this average, indicating growing indecision among market participants and hinting at a major move just ahead. The convergence of price action near the 21 EMA, alongside the key $78,250 level, creates a technical pressure cooker. A breakout in either direction from this confluence could result in significant volatility and price expansion, making the next few candles critical for traders to monitor. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 April 7: A Potential Turning Point Perhaps most intriguing is EGRAG’s emphasis on Monday, April 7th, 2025, which he describes as “a day to remember.” While he has not elaborated on what may occur on that date, its mention underscores a broader expectation that the market will witness a significant shift. Historically, EGRAG has made similar time-based calls that align with high-impact developments, whether on-chain, regulatory, or macroeconomic. Given current market dynamics, this date could coincide with key institutional announcements, ETF inflows or outflows, or even geopolitical events that affect risk assets. At the very least, it is a marker for investors to reassess their positioning and prepare for heightened activity. EGRAG Crypto’s latest insights serve as a timely reminder of how tightly wound the Bitcoin market is. With $78,250 acting as a critical line in the sand, and the 21 EMA adding weight to directional uncertainty, traders have reason to stay alert. Whether Bitcoin holds firm or falters could determine whether bulls continue the march toward all-time highs—or if the market detours into deeper consolidation. Either way, all eyes now turn to April 7 for what could be a defining chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing 2025 narrative.

Will this hold, or will the crash persist? Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) are analysed from a macro perspective. $ETH continues the rout Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for $ETH shows that the rout is continuing without respite. 65% down from the last pivot high, and the damage could be about to get even worse, depending on how the stock market reacts on Monday. The $ETH price has definitively dropped the $1,900 support, turning this into resistance, and the bears are now battling to do the same to the $1,500 support. Below this there is horizontal support at $1,400, and then the very last major support is at $1,000. That said, if the price did get down to these levels, we are probably talking about a bear market. A bounce needs to happen, and it needs to happen now! $BNB still in an uptrend Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for $BNB does not look at all like the $ETH chart. The price is very much in an uptrend. $BNB is still within the triangle pattern, and some solid support is just below this at $504. The stochastic RSI is bottoming for both the weekly and the 2-week chart, and so this means that big upside price momentum may be no more than two or three weeks away. The all-time high was surpassed in June 2024, and then a new all-time high was made in December 2024. The trend is still up, and unless the US goes into a severe recession, a higher low is probably assured. $SOL plunges through major support Source: TradingView The $SOL price has just plunged through the major horizontal support at $122. Given that this support was so strong, now that it has been pierced, the price fell all the way down to the next big support at $94. Below this is the last-ditch horizontal support at $79. However, the game is not over yet for the $SOL bulls. The whole of this week still remains for the bulls to try and send the price back up above the $122 critical support. If they are able to do so, this would leave a potential pin-bar candle, which would be extremely bullish for a price rally. As is the case for $ETH and $BNB (and incidentally $BTC), the 1-week and 2-week Stochastic RSIs are at or very close to the bottom. When these turn back up, they are likely to signal very heavy upward price momentum. It’s not all over yet! Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The long-awaited move was announced on April 7 during the Hong Kong Web3 Festival 2025. The guidance, laid out in a newly published circular , provides detailed requirements and expectations for VATPs and SFC-authorized virtual asset funds (VA Funds) looking to engage in staking. This strategic expansion is closely aligned with Hong Kong’s “ASPIRe” roadmap, particularly under Pillar P, which focuses on enhancing virtual asset products. Until now, such services were prohibited under SFC guidelines dating back to June 2023, which barred VATPs from entering any return-generating arrangements involving client assets. The Hong Kong SFC officially released stake-related guidelines. For licensed virtual asset trading platforms: they are allowed to provide staking services, but they must take measures to reduce risks, protect customer assets, and fully disclose stake risks.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 7, 2025 Strict Requirements Enforced to Ensure Investor Safety Under the newly released circular, VATPs must adhere to a detailed list of compliance measures if they wish to engage in staking activities. These include maintaining direct possession or control over client assets at all times, prohibiting custody via third-party service providers, and implementing robust internal controls to manage operational risks. The platforms are also required to disclose comprehensive information about their staking programs on their websites and apps, including details about fees, lock-up periods, unstaking processes, and the potential risks involved. Among the key risks highlighted are slashing, where assets may be penalized due to validator misbehavior, lock-up risk, hacking, inactivity of validators, and blockchain bugs. VATPs must be transparent about how such risks are managed and how any associated losses would be handled. Notably, any staking activities outsourced to third parties must undergo rigorous due diligence, including ongoing monitoring of the third party’s infrastructure, track record, and risk management systems. SFC-authorized virtual asset funds are also permitted to stake assets, but only via licensed VATPs and approved institutions. To manage liquidity risk, these funds are subject to staking caps and must consult with and receive approval from the SFC before engaging in any staking-related activities. Before initiating staking services, crypto firms must obtain prior written approval from the SFC. The SFC will evaluate their readiness and impose specific licensing conditions tailored to each platform. These terms are outlined in the circular ‘s Appendix and will be enforced as part of the licensing agreement. Hong Kong Signals Serious Commitment to Crypto Evolution The updated guidance does more than merely expand the list of services offered by VATPs; it sends a clear message that Hong Kong is doubling down on its crypto ambitions. This approach reflects a larger policy shift across the Hong Kong government as financial authorities prepare to introduce a second, more detailed policy framework on virtual assets by the end of 2025 . Hong Kong will release an updated virtual asset framework later this year to deepen Web3 adoption, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said. #HongKong #Web3 https://t.co/ghoXxl8qo5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 7, 2025 According to the report, this forthcoming policy will aim to integrate Web3 technologies more deeply into traditional finance, support the real economy, and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as a fintech leader. These moves follow the successful rollout of a licensing regime for VATPs, which has already approved ten platforms, and Hong Kong’s emergence as Asia-Pacific’s largest market for virtual asset spot ETFs. Further legislation, including regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading, and custodial services, is expected in the coming months. As part of its Web3 transformation, the city is also expected to enable staking functionalities within licensed spot ETFs. This move could attract greater institutional involvement and further legitimize crypto finance in Hong Kong. Ultimately, this move by the SFC highlights the maturing of Hong Kong’s crypto regulatory regime. With additional reforms on the way, Hong Kong is strongly positioned as a key player in the global race to define the future of crypto.

Citing an unnamed White House official, journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the deadline for federal agencies to report their crypto holdings to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is April 7. However, the disclosures will remain confidential for now. “Unclear as of now if and when the findings could be made public,” Terrett wrote. Source: Eleanor Terret Crypto disclosure follows Bitcoin Reserve establishment The reporting requirement follows an executive order signed on March 7 that directed the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile. The Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve will be seeded with BTC forfeited to federal agencies through civil or criminal asset seizures. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks described the reserve as a “digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency,” saying that the US will not sell any BTC held in the reserve. “It will be kept as a store of value,” Sacks added. Sacks previously lamented the US government’s selling of 195,000 BTC for $366 million . The official said the BTC sold by the US government could’ve gone for billions if it had only held on to the assets. The reserve will initially be seeded by the BTC kept by the Treasury, while the other federal agencies would “evaluate their legal authority” to transfer their BTC into the reserve. Regarding the digital asset stockpile, Sacks said it would promote “responsible stewardship” of the government's crypto assets under the Treasury. This includes potential sales from the stockpiles. On March 2, Trump said that the crypto reserve would include assets like XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ). The US President later added Ether ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ) to his crypto reserves list. Related: 10-year Treasury yield falls to 4% as DXY softens — Is it time to buy the Bitcoin price dip?

Markets Fall as Investors Believe Fed Will Have to Cut Rates in 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) fell 10% on Monday to around $74,500, while U.S. stock markets are on track for their worst three-day decline in years. S&P 500 futures are down nearly 5% in a single session, bringing the total loss since last week to close to 15%. As riskier assets come under pressure, investors are increasingly pricing in a dramatic reversal by the Federal Reserve that could lead to as many as five rate cuts in 2025, futures markets show. Credit Markets Signal Fed Has No Other Choice The CME FedWatch Tool shows investors see a 61% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting on May 7, which would lower the target federal funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Markets expect rates to fall to 3.00%-3.25% by year-end. Historically, the Fed has responded to market downturns with aggressive policy easing, including rate cuts, bond purchases and liquidity injections. Investors appear to be positioning for a similar playbook this time around as financial conditions tighten rapidly. The market's growing belief is that the Federal Reserve cannot withstand the pressure for long. Falling asset prices, rising credit stress and the need for the U.S. government to refinance suggest that policy will need to be changed sooner rather than later. We'll see if the Fed will meet these expectations at its May meeting or if markets will have to wait for further deterioration. But one thing is clear: financial markets are signaling loud and clear that the Fed's tightening cycle may already be over and the next move could be a rapid race to lower rates. *This is not investment advice.

After a month of inactivity, the trader took advantage of the sharp decline in Ethereum ( ETH ) prices by opening a long position with 20x leverage on Hyperliquid. The position consisted of 47,253 ETH, worth approximately $70.86 million with an entry price of $1,459 and a liquidation price of $1,391.

The position was valued around $340 million and almost sparked a market crash on the liquidity platform. After closing at 15,000 ETH, the whale transferred around 17.09 million USDC in margin back to their address. After the margin was withdrawn, it triggered the platform to automatically liquidate the remaining 160,000 ETH. Due to large liquidation size, Hyperliquid vault took over the position at $1,915 and tried to unravel it. As a result, Hyperliquid took on the brunt of the liquidation and suffered a loss of more than $4 million. Even after the massive liquidation, the whale still managed to secure a net profit of around $1.8 million.

According to Tracxn’s report, as of January 2025, there are 412 asset tokenization startups, with 179 receiving funding and 41 securing Series A or higher rounds. In a further step supporting the growing landscape of RWA startups, MANTRA, the RWA-focused layer-1 blockchain, has launched MANTRA Ecosystem Fund (MEF) of over $108 million to support the developing RWA Projects. The launch, coming only a month after it received VASP License in Dubai, will deploy the funding assets in innovative RWA projects over the next four years. Notably, MEF will implement the funding with the helo of its vast partner network which includes Laser Digital, Shorooq, Brevan Howard Digital, Valor Capital, Three Point Capital, Amber Group, among other big names. This would ensure that the project applicants seeking investment can be from any part of the world. What kind of Projects will MANTRA’s MEF Support? Investor interest in RWA startups has intensified significantly. In 2024, investments in RWA-related startups grew by 150%, with $2 billion allocated to asset tokenization projects. Certain notable funding rounds include Maple Finance raising $50 million to expand its tokenized debt offerings and Tokeny securing $25 million to digitize corporate bonds. And now with this new fund, RWA projects are set to receive further boost. As per the Press Release shared with CoinGape, the MEF will support the best projects that are innovating with RWA tokenization, and even those that are chain agnostic. Notably, it will support not only early stage projects but projects at all the stages. It will evaluate the projects on the basis of introductory pitches. “MEF will operate an open-arms policy, welcoming projects at any developmental stage globally with a particular focus on RWA’s and DeFi”, told John Patrick Mullin, MANTRA CEO. With no limit on the number of projects to be chosen, the fund would seek projects who are focused on DApps and infrastructure in the RWA or Defi Universe. It has listed the kind of projects in which the fund would seek to fund. This includes domains such as Trading and Exchange, Lending and Borrowing, Asset Management and Derivatives and Synthetics. Boost for RWA Innovation and Market The MANTRA Fund launch also comes at a time when the major financial institutions are also increasingly engaging with RWA tokenization amid growing market uncertainity over Trump tariffs. Last week only, Fidelity filed to SEC seeking the registration of a tokenized version of its money market fund. BlackRock, in another instance, launched a dedicated RWA tokenization fund in late 2024, signaling strong institutional commitment to this trend. Additionally, tokenized money market funds have attracted over $1 billion in assets under management, with offerings from both traditional firms like BlackRock and Web3-native entities such as Ondo Finance. The market for RWA tokenization is also poised for substantial expansion. Estimates suggest that the total market value of tokenized assets could significantly exceed $10 trillion by 2030. Real estate is projected to become the largest segment, accounting for nearly one-third of the overall market by 2030. Thus, MANTRA’s MEF Fund can prove to be a boost for the RWA innovation and provide the capital support to the needed founders and builders.

Metaplanet and Semler stumble as Bitcoin dips; Strategy holds firm As of April 2, Metaplanet holds 4,206 BTC bought at around $88,800 each, putting the firm 15% in the red. The situation worsened on Monday when its stock dropped a sharp 20% in just one day. Similarly, Semler Scientific has also faced setbacks. Having bought BTC at an average price of $87,854, the company’s stock has dropped by 38% due to a 20% decline in Bitcoin’s value this year. Meanwhile, MetaPlanet has seen a 15% drop in its stock, while Strategy has only experienced a minor 2% decline. Strikingly, Strategy owns a whopping 528,185 BTC, worth $39.5 billion today, with each coin bought at an average of $67,458.

This follows a partial repayment of 1.5 billion JPY made on March 27, 2025. The funds for this redemption came from EVO FUND’s exercise of stock acquisition rights, as previously disclosed. Since the bonds were interest-free, the full repayment will have little impact on Metaplanet’s financial performance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.

It also recently boosted its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 696 BTC, bringing the total to 4,046 BTC.

The position was wiped out as Ether (ETH) tumbled over 14% on April 6, causing the collateral ratio of the whale’s vault to fall below the critical liquidation threshold. According to data from DeFi Explore and Lookonchain, the liquidation was triggered when the collateralization ratio dropped to 144%, just under the platform’s required 150%. This allowed the Sky protocol to seize and auction off the ETH collateral. As $ETH plummeted, the 67,570 $ETH ($106M) held by this whale on #Maker was liquidated! https://t.co/kXSkKh1H0P pic.twitter.com/IDjzbQ8P3z — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 7, 2025 Sky, a rebranded version of the MakerDAO lending platform, allows users to lock up ETH as collateral to borrow the decentralized stablecoin DAI . The protocol enforces an over-collateralization policy, requiring users to deposit significantly more ETH than the value of the DAI borrowed. When the market value of ETH plunges, collateral ratios shrink, and positions become vulnerable to automatic liquidation. In this whale’s case, the market crash proved catastrophic. The timing couldn’t have been worse. With ETH falling to a seven-month low of $1,547, marking its steepest single-day drop since October 2023, the protocol’s automated liquidation system kicked into gear. Over a few hours, the whale’s once-massive position vanished, making this one of the most high-profile liquidations in DeFi history. Whales Scramble to Save Positions as ETH Collapses The situation quickly escalated beyond a single whale. Spot On Chain reported that another large holder, with 56,995 wrapped ETH (approximately $91 million) used as collateral, narrowly avoided liquidation by making emergency capital injections. A whale who supplied 56,995 $WETH ($90.8M) to borrow $DAI on #Maker is on the verge of liquidation, with a liquidation price of $1,564.58.

A whale with 220,000 $ETH ($340M) on #Maker just repaid 3.52M $DAI and deposited 10,000 $ETH — lowering the liquidation price to $1,119.3.

These deposits raised the position’s liquidation threshold and temporarily bought time against further ETH price declines. However, the scale of market-wide damage was unprecedented. CoinGlass data revealed that over 446,000 positions were liquidated in a single 24-hour window, with total losses surpassing $1.36 billion. Source: CoinGlass A staggering $1.21 billion of those were long positions, showing just how quickly bullish bets were undone. The single largest liquidation recorded was a $7 million Bitcoin position on OKX. With Ethereum dropping below 0.02 BTC , a psychologically significant ratio not seen since early 2020, analysts warned that ETHBTC could slide further to levels last seen in September 2019 (0.01615 BTC) or even March 2017 (0.0128 BTC) if the trend continues. ETH is now down 44% against BTC year-to-date and remains 79% off its 2021 peak when DeFi and NFT mania drove demand. Trump Tariffs Trigger Global Panic and Crypto Meltdown The crypto market collapse didn’t happen in isolation. The catalyst behind the rapid downturn was a wave of macroeconomic fear sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs . The crypto market dropped 3% Friday as Trump’s new tariffs raised fears of a global economic slowdown. #TrumpTarrifs #CryptoMarket https://t.co/SmiMbnTGOz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 4, 2025 On April 2, Trump unveiled a package that included a 25% tariff on vehicle imports and a baseline 10% duty on all imported goods, coupled with “reciprocal tariffs” targeting countries with trade barriers against the U.S. The announcement sent global markets spiraling. The S&P 500 suffered its worst two-day loss in history, wiping out $5 trillion in value. Crypto markets soon followed suit. Bitcoin dipped below $75,000, and major altcoins like Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell by over 20% in a matter of hours. XRP broke below its 200-day moving average, SOL plunged under $100, and DOGE crashed to $0.13. Even traditional markets weren’t spared. The Hang Seng Index dropped over 12%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell nearly 7%. U.S. stock futures plunged across the board, pointing to a chaotic start to the week. Amid the panic, safe havens like gold and the Japanese yen saw renewed demand, further draining liquidity from the crypto market. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman voiced concerns , urging Trump to suspend the tariffs for 90 days. In a strongly worded post, Ackman warned of an “economic nuclear winter,” claiming the business community was rapidly losing confidence in the administration’s leadership. The country is 100% behind the president on fixing a global system of tariffs that has disadvantaged the country. But, business is a confidence game and confidence depends on trust. President @realDonaldTrump has elevated the tariff issue to the most important geopolitical… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) April 6, 2025 “This is not what we voted for,” he said, noting that confidence is paramount in business, and the president’s current trajectory threatens to undermine that trust. Despite the chaos, some believe this could signal the market’s bottom. Nansen Research estimates a 70% chance that the market could bottom out by June, depending on how tariff negotiations unfold. Meanwhile, the fallout from Black Monday continues. Ethereum now trades around $1,515, and Tether (USDT) is within striking distance of overtaking ETH by market cap. If the bloodbath continues, ETH could lose its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency entirely. With over $1.36 billion liquidated in one day, the market’s message is clear: risk appetite is fading fast, and unless prices rebound, more whales could soon meet the same fate as the $106 million Sky liquidation victim.

It recently dropped to a record low of $0.40, worrying investors. But in a surprising move, the token jumped 70% in just a few days before settling at a 45% gain. This has raised hopes—could this be the start of a big comeback towards $1? PI Price Offers New Hope After weeks of struggling, Pi Coin has finally made a strong comeback, jumping 40% to $0.56. This sudden rise has given investors new hope, with many wondering if the token could finally reach $1 . Market data shows that Pi Coin has broken out of its downward trend, giving hope for a possible recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 52.13, above the neutral 50 but still below the overbought level. This means buying interest is growing, but not too fast. Market Sentiment Begins to Shift One of the key signals pointing toward renewed investor interest is the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator, which has shown a rise in positive inflows. This suggests that more money is entering Pi Network, likely because investors believe the recent price drop may have been the market bottom. For months, many investors hesitated to invest as Pi Coin kept falling. But with signs of a potential recovery, confidence appears to be returning. If this trend continues, Pi Network may be poised for further growth. Another key factor is Pi Network’s connection to Bitcoin. While still low at 0.24, this correlation has improved. If Bitcoin rises, Pi Coin could also gain from the strong market trend. Pi Coin Price Analysis Pi Coin’s recent price recovery to $0.56 highlights its potential for rapid reversals. If such bullish momentum continues, Pi Network could target the $0.87 level, and possibly even hit the highly anticipated $1 mark. Such a recovery would restore faith in the project and attract more investors. However, if bearish signals return and Pi Coin falls below the critical support level of $0.50, it may drop back to $0.40 or even lower. This would erase recent gains and put the token at risk of further declines.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 12:28:16

One Ethereum whale injected over $14.5 million into MakerDAO to avoid liquidation on a $300M ETH position, while another investor wasn’t as lucky, and lost more than 67,000 ETH—worth over $100M—on DeFi platform Sky. Meanwhile, a symbolic gesture drew attention in the Solana ecosystem after one user staked SOL until the year 5138. Ethereum Whale Moves Quickly to Prevent Liquidation An unidentified crypto whale injected millions of dollars into MakerDAO to avoid the liquidation of a massive $300 million Ethereum (ETH) due to the sharp market downturn. The investor is reportedly holding 220,000 ETH, and now faces the risk of liquidation if ETH drops to $1,119.3. To help raise the position’s liquidation threshold, the whale deposited an additional 10,000 ETH and 3.54 million DAI, which is worth more than $14.5 million, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. This intense market volatility led to widespread liquidations across the crypto space. Data from CoinGlass indicates that more than 446,000 positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours, with total losses exceeding $1.42 billion. Long positions accounted for the vast majority, at $1.21 billion, while short positions lost $152 million. The single largest liquidation was a $7 million Bitcoin position on the OKX exchange. 24 hour liquidations (Source: CoinGlass) The broader market crash was triggered by a major macroeconomic shock following US President Donald Trump's announcement of reciprocal import tariffs on April 2. The tariffs sparked panic across global markets, and contributed to a historic $5 trillion wipeout from the S&P 500 in just two days. Despite the turmoil, some market analysts see a potential silver lining. Michaël van de Poppe , the founder of MN Consultancy, suggested that the clarity around the tariffs could be the end of a prolonged period of uncertainty, and could even potentially usher in a rebound for the crypto market. He argued that with the new rules of the economic game now in place, investors may begin rotating into undervalued digital assets. Crypto intelligence platform Nansen also estimated a 70% chance that the crypto market could reach its bottom by June, depending on the evolution of tariff negotiations. Whale Loses 67K ETH Not all whales are lucky enough to prevent liquidations. An Ethereum investor was liquidated for more than $100 million after the price of ETH plummeted by around 14% on April 6. This was one of the largest single liquidations in recent memory. The investor lost 67,570 ETH, which was worth approximately $106 million, on the DeFi lending platform Sky, according to data from DeFi Explore and Lookonchain. Sky rebranded from Maker in August, and it allows users to create collateralized debt positions by locking up ETH to borrow the stablecoin DAI. However, the protocol enforces a minimum overcollateralization ratio of 150%, and when this investor's ratio fell to 144% thanks to the ETH price drop, the position became eligible for automatic liquidation. Sky’s protocol is designed to autonomously liquidate positions that fall below the required ratio by seizing and auctioning the ETH collateral to repay the borrowed DAI and associated fees. Any remaining ETH after the debt is settled is returned to the user, but in this case, the sudden and steep decline in ETH's value triggered a big loss. Another whale was very close to a similar fate, having supplied 56,995 wrapped ETH—worth around $91 million—as collateral to borrow DAI. This put their position at risk of liquidation as well. At press time, Ethereum was trading hands at close to $1,491 after its price dropped by more than 16% in the past 24 hours. ETH’s price was also down by 17% on its weekly time frame. This means that the altcoin returned to levels not seen since October of 2023. ETH’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The market crash comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs, which triggered a massive sell-off across traditional and digital markets. ETH is currently down more than 60% from its all-time high in 2021, and further declines could lead to even more collateralized positions being liquidated. So far, the majority of recent liquidations involved ETH positions. This is likely due to the vulnerability of leveraged DeFi strategies during periods of extreme market volatility. Crypto User Stakes SOL Until Year 5138 It is not only Ethereum whales making moves in the market. Another crypto user made a bold and symbolic bet on the long-term future of Solana by staking a small portion of the token for the next 3,000 years. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence , the anonymous user staked just $0.05 worth of SOL in 2023, which will remain locked until the year 5138. While the amount may be small, the gesture certainly captured attention across the crypto community. Many people saw it as an expression of extreme confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, called the move a reflection of mindset rather than financial gain. “Legacy staking is more than locking assets—it’s a mindset,” Liu said. “The real edge in crypto isn’t in chasing short-term hype, but in holding long-term conviction assets through cycles. This kind of thinking builds not just portfolios, but long-term legacies.” SOL’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $99.66 after its price fell by close to 15% throughout the past day of trading. Forecasts from firms like Bitwise suggest that the token could reach between $2,300 and $6,000 by 2030. With a 2%–5% annual appreciation rate, Liu shared that compounding over such an extended timeframe could generate an astronomical return. For instance, 5 cents compounded annually at just 3% for 3,115 years would result in more than $486 undecillion—a number with 36 zeros. What makes this even more compelling is that staking rewards on the Solana network are typically paid out every two to three days, allowing for much more frequent compounding than traditional yearly models. While it’s impossible to predict what the staked amount will be worth in thousands of years, the idea still caused a wave of speculation online . Some believe it’s a serious attempt at building generational wealth, while others see it as a humorous meme trade destined to be immortalized on the Solana blockchain. Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of the Komodo blockchain platform, explained that the act raises philosophical questions as well. “What will 3,000 years from now look like? Will humans still be around? Will the Solana blockchain?” Currently, staking returns on Solana range between 5% and 8%, depending on the validator and platform used. In comparison, Cardano and Ethereum offer lower starting yields.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 13:30:12

While most metaverse projects focus on fiction, demand has been increasing for environments that reflect places in the real world. According to a recent study, over 39% of metaverse users value it because it removes the limitations in the real world. The job of NeoTech is to bring the idea to life using sub-2cm scans to create the perfect digital versions of real locations, ready to be used, owned, and monetized. With the metaverse market expected to exceed $7.6 trillion by 2032, NeoTech has already gained commercial attention–generating over $1 million in revenue in Q1 2025. Scanned Environments, Not Imagined NeoTech uses LiDAR, GPS, and scanning systems powered by AI to capture the real thing down to every measurement. The project captures places like residential buildings, schools, public places, and cultural landmarks, converting them into a detailed digital geo-referenced model. This means that these places maintain their real-world coordinates and measurements, which allows them to be replicated accurately within the virtual environments. NeoTech also uses its library of high-fidelity scans to unlock new possibilities for developers, creators, and investors looking for virtual places that hold real world importance, with the project providing them with city squares, landmarks, and modern urban spaces. NeoTech has also entered into a partnership with Google Maps. As part of the agreement between both parties, Google has been using NeoTech’s camera system and scanning equipment to capture 360 degrees imagery and 2D visuals for global map data. Built for Real Use Cases: From Games to City Planning The applications for digital twins are broad. The assets were built for engines like Unity, Unreal, and Godot, allowing developers to drop real-world locations directly into gameplay, simulations, or educational environments. Gaming worlds often include real cities, where there is no need for guesswork or generic models. In education, students will be able to walk through historical places, architectural landmarks, or campus grounds as if they were there. And in events, producers will be able to recreate real venues for virtual concerts, exhibitions, and meetups. NeoTech’s assets are already being used in big cities like Targu Mures, Romania, where city officials can access infrastructures or plan public works within a 3D model of their jurisdiction. These use cases point to a growing interest in using detailed spatial data to build experiences that have a root in reality, whether they are for the public, commercial, or creative purposes. Digital Ownership and Monetization Options In addition to their utility, the scanned objects are available digitally as tokenized assets. Each scan is connected to an Intrinsic Value NFT (IVN), in a partnership between the project and Fate Labs that links ownership to on-chain metadata, licensing rights, and revenue. This allows holders of the assets to use their models any way they place inside the NeoTech platform. The platform is presently working and developing other features like advertising, leasing, and other Monetization options which can be done digitally. The IVNs are designed to retain their values based on usage, rather than the usual market speculation, with the project generating revenue through licensing fees, staking mechanisms, and service integration. This structure provides long-term support for engagement without relying on short-term hype or market volatility. A New Layer of Reality for the Metaverse Economy NeoTech is still improving its scanning efforts, with the current archive covering 500 cities and thousands of locations. The project includes major metropolitan centers as well as smaller cultural and historical sites across Europe, North America, and Asia. The company has also prioritized public landmarks and heavy infrastructure zones where 3D data can be used to improve planning, tourism, and community engagement. The project is expected to release the beta version of its asset marketplace this year, allowing users to browse, license, and use digital environments based on verified physical locations. To follow the platform's development and upcoming launches, visit the website or explore the roadmap. About NeoTech NeoTech is a leading 3D mapping and RWA tokenization company using AI to build a strong foundation in enterprise geospatial solutions. Having worked with governments, municipalities, and businesses in Romania, NeoTech is now expanding into the Web3 world to bring real-world ownership to Blockchain.

Most mining stocks fell more than 10% on Monday, adding to last week's sell-off. MARA Holdings (MARA) fell nearly 11%, Riot Platforms (RIOT) slumped about 8%, and CleanSpark (CLSK) dropped 10% in early Monday U.S. trading. Other crypto-linked stocks, such as Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), also slid more than 10%. Read more: Strategy Treads Water on BTC Bet, While Metaplanet, Semler Reel From Heavy Losses The sell-off comes as traders around the world panic-sell most asset classes, with equities hit the hardest. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs added uncertainties to the market and a trade war with China added more concerns for the miners. Currently, Chinese manufacturers hold the lion's share of the market for the machines most miners use to mine for their block rewards. If the tariffs hold, they will likely make mining more expensive for those who are already navigating higher energy costs and lower profit margins following the recent halving that cut their rewards by half. Adding to the pain, the Bitcoin network's computing power — a measure of competition for the miners — hit a new all-time high of 1 zettahash per second (1 ZH/s) on Friday, according to data from Glassnode. The previous record was set on Jan. 31, when the network hit 975 exahashes per second (EH/s). As the competition ramped up, the bitcoin price has fallen from the recent high of over $109,000 to $77,0000, pressuring mining revenue. Hashprice, a measure of daily income relative to hash power — has fallen to a record low $42.40, squeezing the miners even further.

Additionally, the company expects to report a net loss for the first quarter due to a $5.91 billion unrealized loss on its bitcoin holdings, according to a filing Monday morning. This follows the adoption of new accounting rules requiring crypto assets to be marked to market. A $1.69 billion tax benefit is expected to partially offset the loss. Strategy raised a total of $7.69 billion during the quarter, $4.4 billion of that from common stock sales and the rest from preferred stock issuance.

DOGE price has lost nearly 15% value in the past 24 hours, stooping to a $0.13 low in sync with broader trends. In response, crypto market traders and investors are now reflecting a highly cautious approach toward the meme coin’s future prospects. Dogecoin Whale Dumps 300M Coins Sparking Investor Concerns Data from the transaction tracker Whale Alert revealed that a Dogecoin whale deposited 300 million coins worth $41.77 million to Binance on April 7. This whale selloff has made traders and investors buckle up for additional price volatility ahead. Notably, the wallet address ‘DU8gPC5mh4KxWJARQRxoESFark2jAguBr5’ was recorded making the transactions. For context, usual market sentiments remain bearish amid such transfers as they bring potential selling pressure and increase the exchange supply for an asset. These dynamics negatively impact a coin’s price, abiding by the law of supply and demand. What Prompted The DOGE Whale Move? Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that the Dogecoin whale’s selloff may be to mitigate losses amid an ongoing crypto market crash . The broader sector faces a black Monday as Bitcoin, Ether, and leading alts lose alarming values due to broader trends. Primarily as Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kicked off, global markets and risk assets are facing heat in sync. As a result, even DOGE price is facing immense pressure, aligning with the whale dump mentioned above. Will Dogecoin Price Face Further Heat? The current market sentiment orbiting the renowned dog-themed meme coin is highly uncertain. Crypto market traders and investors are awaiting signs that show crypto prices have digested trade war tensions. Nevertheless, the current scenario remains highly bearish. As mentioned above, DOGE price has lost nearly 15% intraday and is resting at $0.13. In the interim, renowned crypto market analyst Berke Oktay warned that further downside risk may await traders as the token lost vital support and fell below $0.17. However, analyst Trader Tardigrade conversely revealed a bullish projection for the meme coin. Despite the price crash and massive Dogecoin whale dump, the analyst revealed that DOGE has formed its second RSI bullish divergence. This suggests momentum is improving even though the price is falling — often a sign that a trend reversal to the upside might be near. Source: Trader Tardigrade, X As a result, crypto market investors continue to reflect an uncertain sentiment and await a prominent bullish or bearish takeover in the coming days. The chances of DOGE slipping below $0.1 remain relatively low at the moment, although market concerns persist due to broader trends.

The pre-launch phase introduces several changes, like the price of the HINU token increasing every two days until they sell out. According to the Husky Inu team, the pre-launch phase is designed to empower the community and ensure those joining early can benefit from favorable pricing. The pre-launch phase comes when the crypto market has been battered thanks to President Trump’s tariffs, with several tokens, including prominent meme coins, trading in the red. The Husky Inu Pre-Launch Phase Husky Inu recently announced several major updates in a blog post and revealed the official launch date of the HINU token. It also issued an update about the Earn App launching in May. The team at Husky Inu describes the pre-launch phases as a progressive token pricing strategy that rewards early adopters and supporters of the project while promoting transparent growth. With the pre-launch phase officially underway, the HINU token price will increase every two days, following a compounded growth model. The price will continue to rise until all the tokens are sold out. How Will The Pre-Launch Phase Work? Let’s understand how the pre-launch phase will work. The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000. This price will increase every two days until all the HINU tokens have been sold out. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. The table below highlights the projected price if the presale continues uninterrupted. Day Token Price 0 $0.00015000 2 $0.00015043 4 $0.00015087 6 $0.00015130 8 $0.00015174 10 $0.00015217 …. Compounded …. Compounded If the project reaches its fundraising goal, the price of the HINU token will jump directly to the next “Big Phase” stage. The Big Phase stages will see prices at $0.0000175 at Stage 5, $0.000200 at Stage 6, $0.000250 at Stage 7, and $0.000335 at Stage 8. All the price points during the “Big Stage” are fixed price points. Husky Inu has raised $737,226 from its stated goal of $1.2M. A Challenging Market While the Husky Inu presale and pre-launch phase are going strong, the project is entering this pivotal stage at a difficult time for both the crypto and traditional markets. The crypto market has endured a torrid start to the week as Trump’s tariffs and trade tensions decimated global markets. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged almost 10% over the past 24 hours, dropping to a low of $74,389 before staging a marginal recovery and moving to its current level of $77,427. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) plunged below $1,500, falling to a low of $1,412 before moving to its current level. ETH is down over 15% during the ongoing session. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is down over 13%, and Solana is down $13% and trading just above $100 after falling to a low of $95 during the current session. The meme coin ecosystem also saw a substantial decline, with Dogecoin (DOGE), down almost 14%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down nearly 9%, while Pepe (PEPE) is down 11.43% at the time of writing. Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and Dogwifhat (WIF) also registered substantial declines. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ripple ( XRP ), the cross-border-focused token, dropped to a low of $1.6185, its lowest level since November last year. The coin crashed because of the ongoing cryptocurrency crash that was triggered by Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff speech. That speech and the retaliations from China have pushed more analysts to predict that the US will have a recession this year. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their recession odds to 45%, up from last week’s 35%. Similarly, experts from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi have warned of a sustained economic slowdown unless Trump changes course on tariffs. On the positive side, a recession could act as a bullish catalyst for cryptocurrencies and other risk assets by pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Meanwhile, some well-known crypto analysts are cautioning about a prolonged market downturn. Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, warned that the ongoing crypto meltdown could persist for 6 to 12 months.

Technicals point to further XRP price crash XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ripple continued its recent downward trend and moved to $1.6185, down by over 52% from its highest level this year. The coin broke below several key support levels during the decline. Notably, it dropped below the psychological $2 level, which bulls had defended for months. It also moved under $1.9193, the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level and the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern. A head and shoulders pattern is a common bearish reversal formation composed of three peaks: the head (at $3.4220 in this case) and two shoulders (at $3). A breakdown below the neckline typically confirms the bearish trend. Worse, Ripple price moved below $1.80, where it made a false breakdown in February. It has also formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages have flipped each other. The WMA is often more responsive than exponential moving averages as it places greater emphasis on recent data. XRP has also moved below the weak stop & reverse level on the Murrey Math Lines. Given these factors, the most likely scenario is that Ripple’s price drops below the $1 psychological mark and falls to $0.9340. This target is derived by measuring the distance from the head to the neckline, then applying that same distance downward from the neckline.

Table of Contents Tariffs rattle the global markets Why is crypto down? How much worse can it get? What’s next for Bitcoin and crypto? Tariffs rattle the global markets As of Apr. 7, the global market environment has taken a sharp downturn, triggered by a single policy shift. On Apr. 2, President Donald Trump announced what he called “Liberation Day” tariffs — aggressive import duties that immediately shifted the tone in both equity and crypto markets. Trump’s tariff regime has been sweeping. Imports from Canada and Mexico now face a 25% duty, while Chinese goods have been hit with an additional 34% tariff. In certain cases, products from other countries are facing combined tariffs climbing as high as 54%. For Chinese imports, the layered effect of both new and existing tariffs means many goods are now entering the U.S. under an effective rate exceeding 54%. The impact on the U.S. stock market was swift. By Apr. 4, the market had lost nearly $5.5 trillion in value in just two days. The S&P 500 alone shed $2.4 trillion on Apr. 3, followed by additional steep losses the next day. In percentage terms, the Dow Jones dropped over 4,000 points, or 9.48%, the S&P 500 fell 10%, and the Nasdaq plunged 11% — all in a span of 48 hours. Trump’s move was met with a fast response. On Apr. 4, China announced a 34% retaliatory tariff, escalating the situation and further straining market sentiment. The resulting volatility has been felt across global markets. As of Apr. 7, total losses across major U.S. indices are estimated to be in the range of $6–7 trillion, with exact figures still being updated. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” surged to a multi-year high, hitting 60 by Apr. 7. This level hasn’t been seen since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and, before that, during the 2008 financial crisis, when the VIX spiked to nearly 80. Global markets outside the U.S. have also been hit hard. China’s Shanghai Composite dropped more than 7%, and Japan ’s Nikkei fell nearly 8%. Bond markets are showing strain as well, with Treasury yields bear-flattening, 2-year yields rising, and 10-year yields falling. The volatility hasn’t been limited to equities. The crypto market has also taken a hit , with CoinGlass data showing $1.4 billion in liquidations over the past 24 hours as of Apr. 7 — one of the highest single-day totals in recent months. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell nearly 8% to $76,500, briefly touching lows near $74,400. Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped 17% to the $1,500 level, with a brief dip to $1,415. Other major altcoins followed suit: Ripple ( XRP ) declined 16%, now trading around $1.76, while Solana ( SOL ) fell to around $101. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in a letter to shareholders, described the current climate as one of “widespread economic anxiety,” adding that such unpredictable tariff moves have made financial planning “impossible” for businesses trying to assess global supply chains. So, what exactly is driving this wave of sell-offs? How do experts interpret the path ahead? And how much worse could things realistically get? Let’s take a closer look. Why is crypto down? When tariffs rise, so do the costs of imported goods, which typically drives inflation higher, especially when those tariffs are widespread and apply to major trading partners. Trump’s announcement, targeting multiple regions, has reignited fears of a global trade war. For investors, this shift in the economic climate changes everything. In times of economic uncertainty, riskier assets are usually the first to be sold. This includes stocks, but also crypto. Despite being often seen as independent from traditional markets, history shows that during periods of acute stress, digital assets tend to behave more like tech stocks than safe havens. This pattern was clearly visible in early February, when a previous round of tariffs led to $2.2 billion in crypto liquidations, pushing Bitcoin down to $92,000. Now, this pattern is repeating, but on a larger scale. Adding complexity to the situation is the interest rate outlook. In a slowing economy, the Federal Reserve would typically be expected to cut rates. However, tariffs complicate that playbook. Since tariffs are inflationary, they limit the Fed’s flexibility. If inflation rises, the central bank may be forced to delay expected rate cuts, or even raise rates again. Higher rates reduce liquidity, and this tends to hurt speculative markets the most. Crypto, being one of the most liquidity-sensitive asset classes, often reacts strongly to these shifts. This is where institutional sentiment becomes critical. According to The Kobeissi Letter, a widely followed macro newsletter, the market has entered a phase where fear is beginning to dominate. In a post on X, Kobeissi noted that the market had “lost its orderly nature,” with assets being sold across the board — including traditional safe havens like gold, which briefly dipped below $3,000 per ounce. Another clear sign of capitulation? Even the safe haven assets like gold are selling off sharply. Until Friday, gold has pushed sharply higher amid tariff uncertainty. Today, gold is back below $3,000/oz as the rush to the sidelines has accelerated. Again, more panic. pic.twitter.com/cjQxbr003V — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 6, 2025 Such broad-based selling often signals that the market is entering a capitulation phase, where investors are no longer making strategic decisions but are instead focused on preserving capital. Supporting this shift in sentiment, data from March reveals that institutional capital has been rotating out of U.S. equities at the fastest pace in years, tightening liquidity across asset classes. And as capital exits equities, it’s not flowing into crypto. Instead, it’s moving toward short-term cash instruments and defensive plays. How much worse can it get? The selloff we’re witnessing may not be the worst of it. If current trends persist, and retaliations escalate as expected, the global economy could be heading toward one of its toughest periods in over a decade. Let’s begin with trade. According to Oxford Economics, if all major U.S. trade partners respond with reciprocal tariffs, global trade volumes could shrink to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, excluding the COVID-19 period. This scenario is no longer hypothetical — China has already imposed a 34% retaliatory tariff, and further responses from the EU, Japan, and other major economies are widely expected. The Tax Foundation estimates that Trump’s full tariff plan could result in a $1.8 trillion tax increase on American consumers. This could reduce U.S. imports by $900 billion in 2025, tightening supply chains and driving up the cost of goods across multiple sectors. Tariff rates are quickly approaching historic levels. If reciprocal policies continue, the U.S. average tariff rate could exceed 33%, nearing the Smoot-Hawley era of the 1930s — widely viewed as one of the factors that deepened the Great Depression. For context, the U.S. hasn’t seen average tariff levels above 20% since 1946. The result will be reciprocal tariffs on these reciprocal tariffs and one of the largest trade wars in history. The average US tariff rate is already up to ~8% with tariffs announce this year, the highest since 1970. By the end of April, we expect the 1946 high to be broken. pic.twitter.com/5mBfXQKkaR — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 30, 2025 Key sectors are already under pressure. By midday on Apr. 4, Apple and Nike had lost $470 billion in combined market value, according to The Guardian. Boeing shares dropped 10%, as disruptions ripple through aerospace supply chains, particularly with China and Vietnam , countries now facing tariffs of 52% and 46%, respectively. Tech, retail, and manufacturing industries that rely on global sourcing are bearing the early weight of these policy changes. The broader macro impact is beginning to take shape. JPMorgan has warned, in comments to CNN, of a potential U.S. and global recession in 2025 if these trade measures persist. Investor Bill Ackman captured the market’s concern in a recent post, warning that business confidence is eroding quickly. While he supports reforming global trade imbalances, Ackman cautions that a full-scale, multi-front tariff approach is damaging America’s reputation as a stable trade partner. The country is 100% behind the president on fixing a global system of tariffs that has disadvantaged the country. But, business is a confidence game and confidence depends on trust. President @realDonaldTrump has elevated the tariff issue to the most important geopolitical… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) April 6, 2025 If Trump continues without pause, Ackman writes, the result could be a freeze in corporate investment, a collapse in consumer spending, and widespread layoffs, especially in small and mid-sized businesses that have less ability to absorb sudden cost increases. If a global slowdown does materialize — driven by shrinking trade, rising inflation, and tighter monetary policy — capital will continue to flow out of risk assets. And crypto will likely be near the top of that list. What’s next for Bitcoin and crypto? There’s little disagreement that we’re currently in a high-stress macro environment. According to crypto analysts, Bitcoin may face more short-term pain, but the long-term case for its role in a fragmented global economy is growing stronger. Jamie Coutts, a chartered market technician and crypto strategist formerly at Bloomberg, highlights that Bitcoin is testing critical levels, specifically “the top of last year’s 7-month range,” as defined by on-chain metrics like exchange volumes and URPD (UTXO Realized Price Distribution). Some thoughts as Bitcoin tests the top of last year’s 7-month range—a line in the sand per onchain metrics like URPD and exchange volumes. After outperforming over the weekend, it’s the only asset letting macro investors express negativity for the trade war escalation. When the… pic.twitter.com/Vig9xPQLv3 — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) April 6, 2025 What makes this moment unique, Coutts explains, is that Bitcoin has become one of the only risk assets allowing macro investors to express concerns about the escalating trade war. “When the dust settles, Bitcoin will lead as the world realizes it’s not just a store of value… It’s an asset outside the system purpose-built for trade settlement,” he said. Coutts also cited a recent report from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which emphasized Bitcoin’s position as a “scarce, global, decentralized, non-sovereign asset.” While BlackRock stops short of calling it a settlement currency, it acknowledges Bitcoin’s clear hedging value in portfolios exposed to geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. Meanwhile, Michaël van de Poppe, a well-known crypto trader and analyst, believes that panic-driven price movements are not over yet. There we go. Black Monday, #Bitcoin back to the lows. It's hard to judge how deep we'll go in times of panic, but we're taking the liquidity beneath the low and we'll be waiting on: – Trump delaying Tariffs (not happening) – FED announcing emergency meeting (max 1-2 weeks) -… pic.twitter.com/acAPJrS5xB — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 7, 2025 With Bitcoin down nearly 30% from its recent highs, he expects further testing of support levels, possibly as low as $70,000, especially if there’s no delay in tariffs or if the Federal Reserve doesn’t call for an emergency policy meeting. However, van de Poppe also views these levels as potential long-term buying opportunities: “In 12–24 months from now, you’ll be happy that you’ve bought in these areas,” he said. Others are framing the current price drop as a setup for a broader shift in narrative. Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, notes that Bitcoin could evolve into a hedge against tariff-induced risks. In a note shared with The Block, he connected the growing U.S. isolationist stance to rising concerns about fiat exposure: “U.S. isolationism is akin to increased risks of holding fiat, which will ultimately benefit Bitcoin,” Kendrick wrote. He identified $76,500 as a critical support level, marking the high from the day after the U.S. election, and emphasized Bitcoin’s relative strength compared to major tech stocks, aside from Microsoft and Google. All in all, while short-term volatility may persist, especially with tariff escalations shaping rate expectations and capital flows, the long-term thesis for Bitcoin is gaining traction. However, caution is still warranted. If tariffs expand further or inflation accelerates, Bitcoin could face renewed pressure alongside broader markets. The market remains highly volatile, so it’s important to trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",Feature|Markets|Bear Market|Donald Trump|United States,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-07 13:41:33

This is important as investors anticipate that Donald Trump will approve a zero tax policy once the tariff or trade war ends. So, what should you buy for the best returns? Let’s discuss this. Best 5 Crypto to Buy Once Donald Trump Approved Zero Tax Policy The Donald Trump trade tariffs have crashed every market, including stocks, crypto, and even the hard assets. However, he and his associates stand firm on the claim that this would boost the USA’s economy, bringing more job and business opportunities to the country. As that remains optimistic, investors are focused on the zero tax policy, where some even sarcastically joked that no gains equal no tax . Despite these events, if Trump approves the policy, investors should consider Bitcoin, XRP, Chainlink, Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, and other bullish crypto to buy. Bitcoin is the most popular and in-demand crypto token to buy based on its growing adoption, U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve discussion, ETFs, and various other factors. XRP is the top altcoin to buy & hold due to better regularity clarity in 2025, potential ETF approval, and potential price rallies amid Donald Trump’s capital gains tax policy. Chainlink is also gaining popularity, and investors predict massive LINK price rallies this year. Lastly, Dogecoin and Pepe Coin are the top meme coins of the market. The former is considered relatively stable due to Elon Musk’s support and gaining investor demand, while the Pepe Coin’s bullish performance hints at an upcoming rally. However, it is just an anticipation based on their demand, historical price performance, and technical factors. The actual performance can vary significantly, so caution is a must. Will Donald Trump Approve Zero Tax Policy After Tariff War? Before becoming the U.S. president for the second time, Trump made multiple promises to crypto investors, including reducing taxes on capital gains. Previously, investors anticipated the revelation of zero tax policy at the White House Crypto Summit , but that did not happen. Now, the eyes are on the post-tariff settlement. However, there’s no significant news on the subject, leaving investors awaiting further announcement. Once this happens, it could introduce a significant crypto market rally. Before that happens, consider Bitcoin, XRP, Chainlink, Pepe Coin, and any other bullish crypto to buy after research.

The week started with a bloodbath as Donald Trump’s tariffs decimated the global stock markets. Crypto prices crashed after the US stock futures market opened significantly lower on April 6, as the Trump administration doubled down on tariffs. BTC plunged below $80,000 after shedding over 7% and is trading around $77,317. Analysts had warned the flagship cryptocurrency risked a decline to $75,000 if bearish sentiment returned. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) plummeted over 15% as its price tanked to $1,530. ETH could slip below $1,500 should selling pressure intensify. Ripple (XRP) also registered a significant decline, dropping almost 16%, falling below $2 to its current level of $1.79. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is struggling to stay above $100, with the price down over 15% at $101. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered significant losses. As a result, the crypto market cap has plunged almost 8% and sits at 7.47 trillion. Crypto Plunges As Trump Tariffs Decimate Global Markets The crypto market plunged as markets tanked after the Trump administration doubled down on its tariff strategy. The US imposed a 10% tariff on all countries starting April 5, hitting some trade partners with even higher rates. This included China (34%), The European Union (20%), and Japan (24%). As a result, BTC slumped over 6% on Sunday and is down almost 2% during the ongoing session as investors pull out of riskier assets. The flagship cryptocurrency has hit a low of $76,614 during the ongoing session. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for crypto, fell to 23, a level regarded as “Extreme Fear.” Charlie Sherry, Head of Finance at Australian Crypto exchange BTC Markets, said he believes the drop should not come as a surprise, given that markets were more illiquid over the weekend. “As a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly. There’s no mystery behind the trigger: President Trump’s recent tariff talk has rattled macro markets, with global trade relations suddenly looking uncertain.” However, others like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner, stating that while tariffs have rattled the market, they could lead to a substantial Bitcoin rally. Meanwhile, the US Stock Futures opened in the red, with Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropping nearly 4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also entered bear market territory, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slumped over 8%. According to the Kobeissi Letter, the US stock market has erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days. Tom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm, MV Global, believes it could be the worst three-day move for US stocks of all time if the futures held. President Trump doubled down on his tariff strategy, stating that the US had massive financial deficits with China, the EU, and other trading partners, which the tariffs would solve. “The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA. They are already in effect and a beautiful thing to behold.” White House Official Confirms Bitcoin, Crypto Holdings Reports A White House official has confirmed that federal agencies have until Monday to report their Bitcoin and crypto holdings to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The reporting is part of President Trump’s executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. The order mandates that all federal agencies disclose their Bitcoin and digital asset holdings to the Treasury Secretary within 30 days. However, it is unclear if the results will be made public since the order does not require public disclosure. The Treasury Secretary will also oversee two new offices that manage government-held digital assets. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, designed as a digital Fort Knox, will hold Bitcoin obtained during criminal or civil forfeiture and maintain these holdings long-term without selling them. Meanwhile, assets in the digital assets stockpile will also be acquired through civil and criminal forfeiture. However, the Treasury Secretary can liquidate these assets for active management, setting it apart from the Bitcoin Reserve. Brazil’s Largest Bank Mulls Stablecoins Banks in several countries are studying stablecoins and looking to integrate them with their business model. The latest bank to join the fray is the Itaú Unibanco, Brazil, and LATAM’s largest bank. The bank recently floated the possibility of issuing an in-house stablecoin to serve its over 55 million customers. Guto Antones, the head of digital assets at Itaú said the bank’s interest in stablecoins surged after the US government pivoted to crypto and the growing relevance of stablecoins as tools to protect and promote the sovereignty of the Dollar. “Of course, it is always on the agenda. The issue of stablecoins has always been on Itaú’s radar. We cannot ignore the power that blockchain has to settle transactions atomically.” However, Brazil has hesitated to adopt Bitcoin and crypto as an investment asset. The country’s National Monetary Council recently issued a regulation banning retirement funds from investing in cryptocurrencies. The resolution, published on March 27, amends a previous regulation regarding the rules that supplementary pension entities must follow. The rules have been amended to state that these entities cannot acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, investments in virtual assets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing double-digit losses over the past 24 hours, with the flagship cryptocurrency down almost 10% over the past 24 hours. Crypto and the broader markets have been decimated by tariffs and trade war pains. As a result, investors adopted a complete risk-off sentiment across markets as selling gathered pace. A drop to $70,000 became a sobering reality just days after analysts waxed eloquent on BTC, claiming it had decoupled from traditional equities and reinforced its status as a hedge during difficult market times. The slide comes after President Donald Trump doubled down on tariffs, imposing sweeping levies on trading partners, wiping trillions from the equities market. US equity-index futures plunged, and the yen surged as deepening turmoil engulfed the financial market. Trump backed his tariffs, stating it was short-term pain for long-term gain, but investors who have seen trillions wiped out could soon ask, “How much pain is too much pain?” Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes Bitcoin could remain in a bear market for at least six months. BTC has endured a torrid start to April and has plunged below $75,000 during the ongoing session, with a drop to $70,000 becoming a real possibility. Ju pointed out that BTC’s bear market is reflected in several on-chain metrics like market capitalization and realized cap declaring that the bull cycle is over. Ju stated, “Bitcoin bull cycle is over — here’s why. There’s a concept in on-chain data called Realized Cap. It works like this: when BTC enters a blockchain wallet, it's considered a ‘buy’ and when it leaves, it's treated as a ‘sell.’ Using this idea, we can estimate an average cost basis for each wallet. Multiply that by the amount of BTC held, and you get the total Realized Cap. It’s often seen as the total capital that has entered the Bitcoin market through actual on-chain activity.” Ju stated that a bull market occurs when modest capital significantly drives prices higher. However, BTC’s bearish trend is supported by the fact that even large capital purchases of the asset are failing to drive up the price. He added that historical data shows that a true reversal in the price of Bitcoin generally takes six months, making a short-term rally highly unlikely. According to data from Coinglass, BTC declined nearly 12%, enduring its worst Q1 start since 2018. Losses in the first quarter have historically had a mixed impact on Bitcoin’s yearly performance. The price chart shows the extent of BTC’s decline, with the flagship cryptocurrency down almost 11% over the past two days and continuing to drop. BTC fell below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 last Friday and settled at $84,422. Price action remained bearish on Saturday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,704. Sellers retained control on Sunday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $82,404. The price encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, moving past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $85,152. Source: TradingView BTC surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, BTC lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $82,525. The price recovered on Thursday and Friday, rising 0.82% and 0.76% to settle at $83,828. However, price action turned bearish on Saturday, and BTC registered a marginal decline to settle at $83,423. Markets went into freefall on Sunday as Trump’s tariffs drove steep losses. As a result, BTC fell over 6%, plunging below $80,000 and settling at $78,301. The current session sees BTC down over 4% and trading at $74,903. The RSI and MACD indicate that bearish sentiment has overwhelmed the market. If selling pressure continues to gather steam, BTC could slump to $70,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) crashed below $1,500 as the crypto market plunged into the red after global markets were decimated thanks to Trump’s tariffs. ETH has fallen over 18% since Monday, dropping below key levels. Continued selling pressure could drive ETH below $1,400 and even $1,000 as markets struggle with mounting losses. Charlie Sherry, head of finance and analyst at Bitcoin Markets stated in a research note, “For a moment, it seemed as though crypto might hold steady, but with the 24/7 nature of crypto markets, investors woke up on Sunday in full ‘sell mode.’” ETH had stabilized around the $1,800 mark after slipping below the 20-day SMA last Friday. Price action remained bearish over the weekend, with ETH dropping almost 4% on Saturday and 1.14% on Sunday to settle at $1,807. The price recovered on Monday, rising 0.79% and settling at $1,822. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ETH registered an increase of almost 5% and settled at $1,905. However, bulls lost momentum on Wednesday as ETH dropped nearly 6%, slipping below $1,800 and settling at $1,794. The price recovered on Thursday despite overwhelming selling pressure, registering an increase of .23% and settling at $1,816. Source: TradingView ETH lost momentum on Friday and registered a marginal decline, with neither buyers nor sellers influencing price action. A marginal drop on Saturday saw ETH drop to $1,806 as buyers struggled to hold on to $1,800. Markets tanked on Sunday as bears took control. As a result, ETH plunged over 12%, slipping below $1,800 and settling at 1,579. The current session sees ETH down almost 7%, with the price registering a marginal increase after falling to a low of $1,412. The MACD and RSI indicate bears are dominating the markets, and ETH could see its decline continue. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s bearish trajectory has intensified after markets went into freefall after Donald Trump’s trade tariffs kicked in. The crypto and traditional markets have been decimated as tariffs wreaked havoc on the market, causing extreme price drops as the market correction shows no signs of stopping. SOL had been trading downwards since March 25 and slipped below the 20-day SMA on Friday. The price continued to drop on Saturday, dropping almost 4% and settling at $124. Despite the selling pressure, SOL registered a marginal increase on Sunday to end the previous weekend positively. However, it was back in the red on Monday, registering a marginal decline. SOL recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of almost 2%, and settled at $126. It surged to an intraday high of $135 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified but lost momentum, dropping over 7%, slipping below $120 and settling at $117. Price action remained bearish on Thursday, with the price registering a marginal decline.

As a result, SOL plunged over 12%, slipping below $120 and settling at $105. SOL has remained in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 6% and trading below $100. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis The meme coin ecosystem has declined substantially since Sunday, with prominent tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dogwifhat (WIF) registering significant losses. DOGE fell below the 20-day SMA last Saturday after a drop of over 6% and settled at $0.669. The price continued to drop on Sunday, dropping 1.12% and settling at $0.167. DOGE registered a marginal drop on Monday but recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of almost 5% and settling at $0.174.

The platform paused the functionality in November 2024 following incidents of inappropriate content streaming, but it’s now returning — cautiously and with revamped guardrails. Pump.fun then livestream feature allowed users to stream themselves while launching or promoting tokens directly through its interface. The feature, launched as an experiment to increase community engagement and virality, quickly caught on. But it also opened the door to unmoderated and sometimes harmful content, including hate speech and graphic material. But now Alon Cohen, co-founder of PumpFun announced in a X post on April 4 revealed that his memecoin launchpad is rolling back its livestream feature with “industry standard moderation systems in place and transparent guidelines.” pump fun livestreaming has been rolled out to 5% of users with industry standard moderation systems in place and transparent guidelines: https://t.co/26r5M4Awam — alon (@a1lon9) April 4, 2025 PumpFun LiveStream Feature Makes a Controlled Comeback Pump.fun has opted for a phased reintroduction of the feature introducing these key changes: 1. Enhanced Content Moderation: Pump.fun has established new guidelines prohibiting content involving violence, harassment, sexual exploitation, and illegal activities. Violations may result in stream termination and account suspension. 2. Limited User Access: The livestreaming feature is currently available to only 5% of users during this initial phase, allowing the platform to monitor and adjust its moderation systems effectively. Notably, it also recently launched its latest product PumpFi, helping users to allow users to buy digital assets A New Rulebook The updated livestream policy bans any content that contains harassment, hate speech, nudity, graphic violence, or any form of illegal activity. Violations could result in stream shutdowns, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans depending on severity. “We’re drawing a hard line,” said the platform in its blog post announcement. “We want to be a hub for memes, not mayhem.” Moderation will include both automated AI tools that flag suspect content in real-time and community reporting systems. Livestreamers must also now agree to a streaming code of conduct before they go live. New Guidelines Reactions From the Community post PumpFun Relaunch News The reaction from the Pump.fun community has been mixed — but mostly optimistic. “I’m glad they’re not scrapping it entirely,” said one user on X (formerly Twitter). “The livestream feature gave small creators a stage — it just needed rules.” Others remain skeptical about the moderation tools. One user reminisced the incident in which a 13 year old kid rugged $30,000 live. He said, “That’s when the real trouble started. “ Another user posted how a antisemite was burning live the Israeli flag.

Can Livestreaming and Token Culture Balance the Hype The broader significance of Pump.fun’s livestream revival ties into a growing trend: real-time community interaction in token economies. As Web3 platforms continue to blur the lines between content creation and financial speculation, tools like livestreaming allow users to generate hype, drive liquidity, and foster community identity around tokens. But these tools come with the same moderation dilemmas seen on Web2 platforms — often with fewer safety nets. Pump.fun’s decision to reboot livestreaming — rather than abandon it — signals a willingness to embrace that challenge. It has also been working on strengthening its position in the DeFi space as Raydium launched its own token issuance platform, shunning PumpFun The company has not shared a specific timeline for when livestreaming will be made available to all users but says it’s “closely monitoring feedback” and will scale access gradually. Whether Pump.fun’s approach to content moderation sets a precedent for other crypto-native platforms remains to be seen. But the caution and challenges in its comeback is something PumpFun must keep in mind.

This partnership enables the exchange to provide Apple Pay and Google Pay features for its clients. Notably, with more than 1,000 payment methods, Binance intends to make crypto accessible to everyone. Let’s unveil the key details and implications of this groundbreaking announcement. Binance Integrates Apple Pay and Google Pay via Worldpay Binance, the top crypto exchange , has joined hands with the payment technology provider Worldpay to integrate Google Pay and Apple Pay. In an official blog post , Binance announced the tactical move, offering more convenient payment methods for its customers across the world. The exchange stated, Binance has partnered with global payments technology provider Worldpay® to introduce two of the world’s preeminent digital wallets – Apple Pay and Google Pay – into its fiat onramp ecosystem. Our users can now seamlessly purchase crypto using credit or debit cards already linked to these wallets, whether on desktop or in the Binance app. Binance Ensures Seamless Payment Solutions Interestingly, Binance acknowledges this collaboration “more than just a technical update.” Instead, it marks the exchange’s commitment to providing users with seamless payment solutions and fiat-to-crypto transactions. The exchange noted, “This integration brings Binance’s fiat-to-crypto experience even closer to the convenience and speed users expect from their daily digital payment tools.” Meanwhile, Thomas Gregory, the exchange’s VP of Fiat, underscored the significance of the partnership with Worldpay and highlighted the payment provider’s global reputation. He asserted that the partnership envisions empowering users by “providing broader choice and smoother access to crypto through familiar, mobile-first platforms.” This development comes following the rumors of Binance’s sell-off. In response to the rumors, co-founder Ye Hi clarified that they were baseless claims . Why Worldpay In This Partnership? With this crucial development, Binance intends to enable users to access Google Pay and Apple Pay features. By integrating Apple Pay and Google Pay directly into the app or website, the exchange is making crypto more accessible, allowing users to explore digital assets through familiar and trusted platforms. Significantly, Worldpay is a prominent player in the crypto exchange operations. The platform handles $2.3 trillion in transactions annually for top companies across the world. This robust infrastructure ensures secure and seamless payments for Binance users globally.

Chainsaw Massacre’,https://finbold.com/rich-dad-r-kiyosaki-reveals-his-strategy-for-d-o-g-e-chainsaw-massacre/,"In an X post published late on Sunday, April 7, the prominent investor and author of the best-selling book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki , gave a strange yet strangely appropriate name for the second Trump administration’s economic policy: the D.O.G.E chainsaw massacre, or, as he put it, ‘DOGE CHAINSAW MASSACRE.’ In the same tweet, Kiyosaki also revealed his strategy for weathering the storm and thriving as it unfolds and after it is over – no matter its eventual impact. Specifically, the author plans to continue building his own ‘standard’ based on Bitcoin ( BTC ), gold , and silver . Indeed, the prominent investor has been bullish about cryptocurrency and the two commodities for years and has frequently recommended that his followers buy the three assets. In late 2024, Kiyosaki even went as far as to urge his fans to sell their homes to buy BTC. Furthermore, the approach proved rather successful last year, and the focus on the three assets was relatively fruitful by April 1, according to Finbold’s report from the day. Silver has been relatively successful during the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, with Kiyosaki forecasting it would hit $70 per ounce by the year’s end. Likewise, gold has continued hitting new all-time highs (ATHs), and only Bitcoin has been noted for losing ground. At press time, it is trading at $77,144 after a brutal 6.76% one-week drop. BTC one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Does Kiyosaki support Trump and Musk’s ‘Chainsaw massacre?’ Despite giving the policy a rather grim name, Kiyosaki joined the legions of wealthy individuals who agree that the ‘DOGE CHAINSAW MASSACRE’ is necessary to save the U.S. economy long-term. However, the author of ‘ Rich Dad ’ conceded that he does not know if the policy will eventually yield the desired results. The TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is an old movie. Today there is a new horror show known as PRESIDENT TRUMP and ELON MUSKS’ DOGE CHAINSAW MASSACRE While I feel for the millions who are losing their jobs….something had to be done….and Trump and Musk are doing it. Even Warren… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 7, 2025 Lastly, while there is no shortage of yesmen in the media sphere, some prominent economists and finance professors believe President Donald Trump’s aggressive implementation of tariffs will, at best, not achieve its stated goals. For example, as Finbold reported on April 4, Michael Pettis opined that returning manufacturing to American shores is a positive ambition but opined that resolving the long-standing issues would require a more strategic approach. However, he did not rule out the possibility that Trump could eventually succeed, though he made it clear that a positive outcome would be more a result of blind luck than tactical acumen.

The MSTR stock is also in bear territory at the moment, thanks to the widespread market crash due to Donald Trump’s tariffs. MicroStrategy Halts Bitcoin Purchase Amid Market Crash MicroStrategy, now Strategy, has halted its Bitcoin purchase, failing to acquire any BTC between March 31 and April 6 . This is significant as the company has developed a knack for purchasing BTC every other week, thanks to its capital raise through stock sales. Last week, Coingape reported that Michael Saylor’s firm bought 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion the previous week, one of their largest purchases to date. Meanwhile, the company purchased 6,911 BTC a week earlier for $584 million. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that MicroStrategy bought 80,715 BTC for $7.66 billion in the first quarter of this year at an average price of $94,922. The company currently holds 528,185 BTC, which it bought for $35.63 billion, at an average price of $67,458 per Bitcoin. Thanks to the recent drop in the Bitcoin price , Strategy risks watching its BTC investment return to its entry price or even run into a loss. The company revealed in a filing that its unrealized loss on digital assets for the first quarter was $5.91 billion. The company’s Bitcoin investment dropping into the red is significant as it could force them to offload some coins, which could negatively impact the market. Although Saylor and his firm would carry out this sale over the counter, news around it could dampen investors’ confidence and spark a bearish sentiment. For context, the software company currently holds over 2% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. MSTR Stock Slides Over 13% Nasdaq data shows that MicroStrategy’s stock is down over 13% and is currently trading around $256. The drop in the MSTR stock price isn’t only due to the Bitcoin price decline, although both assets share a strong positive correlation. MSTR has mainly declined thanks to Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have put the US stock market close to bear market territory. According to a Bloomberg report, the S&P 500 lost 3.5% at the open and is now on the brink of entering a bear market. The Nasdaq is also not far off. As a result, MSTR has lost all its gains from earlier in the year and currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) loss of 8%. The stock is still at risk of suffering more declines as Trump’s trade war heightens.

According to an April 7 announcement , 93.1% of voting creditors who hold 94.6% of the value voted in favor of the plan. All creditors who held crypto balances on the platform were eligible to vote on the Kroll Issuer Services platform from March 19 until March 28. WazirX co-founder and CEO Nischal Shetty told Cointelegraph that with the plan approved, stolen asset recovery is “a primary focus.” Still, he pointed to profit sharing as a further measure that the firm hopes to use to compensate its users. The news follows early February reports that WazirX had warned that repayments from the $235 million hack against it could be delayed until 2030 if creditors didn’t approve its proposed restructuring plan. At the time, the platform said that creditors might need to endure “unclear and potentially extended timelines” if the plan wasn’t approved. WazirX said creditors could face repayment delays if they voted against the restructuring plan. Source: WazirX Shetty celebrated the vote results in a subsequent X post . He wrote: “The people have spoken. We will work hard on rebuilding and creating value for everyone.” Related: CoinSwitch launches $70M recovery fund for WazirX hack victims The plan for repaying creditors Shetty described the result as “an important milestone in the recovery process” that “reflects a shared belief in the proposed restructuring plan.” The plan in question was developed under the supervision of Singapore’s legal system and announced in January, it entails WazirX holding liquid assets amounting to $566.4 million USDt — while the claims amount to $546.5 million USDT. The exchange also released recovery tokens to settle outstanding claims, which allows creditors to benefit from future platform operations and asset recovery. WazirX promised to return funds through token distributions that could yield 75% to 80% of the value of users’ account balances at the time of the cyberattack. The rest would be represented by recovery tokens, which will be periodically repurchased using profits generated from platform operations and a proposed decentralized exchange (DEX). Plans to launch the DEX were unveiled in November 2024 , when Shetty said that it will help prevent hack losses from happening again: ""The best thing is that you'll be able to self-custody your assets here — your assets will be completely under your control — and you can freely trade or do what you want with your assets.” Shetty also told Cointelegraph that the DEX will aim to be much simpler to interact with than the usual experience of decentralized trading platforms. He said, “Our goal is to make it on par with our CEX in terms of ease of operating.” Related: Binance, WazirX among crypto firms evading taxes in India, says gov’t A North Korea-linked hack WazirX lost $234.9 million of digital assets in a Safe Multisig wallet in mid-July 2024. The attack was attributed to North Korean state actors and unfolded with alarming speed and precision, with many speculating on its impact on the broader crypto industry in India . Shetty told Cointelegraph that — to prevent future hacks — WazirX has moved to BitGo and Zodia for crypto custody, promising “enhanced protection of funds.” The partnerships also reportedly include insurance. Hacks continue to be a significant issue for the cryptocurrency industry. According to recent reports, over $2 billion was lost to cryptocurrency hacks in the first quarter of 2025 alone, with nearly $1.63 billion being lost to just access control exploits. This is also the third quarter in a row that — much like in WazirX’s case — the top exploit was a multisignature-related event. Hacken shared a key lesson on the subject: “Securing digital assets requires more than just secure on-chain code — the entire infrastructure, from front-end interfaces to internal processes, must be equally hardened, as all it takes is a single weak spot to wreck the entire system.“ Magazine: China’s ‘point running’ crypto scams, pig butchers kidnap kids: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-07 13:56:13

Ripple’s chief technology officer David Schwartz showed an interest in selling stocks to obtain tax benefits from the losses he incurred. A new cryptocurrency named Remittix has gained trading interest by obtaining more than $14.4 million from the sale of its 527 million tokens at $0.0734 each. Ripple Latest News: Surprising Twists and Investor Reactions Source: tradingview . XRP’s price is currently near $2.07 The Ripple latest news reveals changes in how XRP is perceived for its intended uses and how its executive team is managing their finances. John Squire predicts XRP could link with American infrastructure but in non-commercial environments which led to internet-based discussions about regulatory approval. The potential of cryptocurrency to improve government operational streams continues to spark discussion among enthusiasts even if skeptics describe the idea as too positive. Through tax-loss harvesting David Schwartz chose to sell stocks with inferior performance for the purpose of capital gains offset. Ripple insiders agree with everyday individuals when they need to manage their finances through this strategic decision. Since its inception Ripple has maintained XRP as an accessory to SWIFT instead of developing it as a direct competition. The company coin has produced both dramatic spikes and rapid downturns in value. Since 2017 XRP has increased in value above 1,500% via strong momentum that was accompanied by major market fluctuations. Today, XRP hovers near $2.07 , down about 40% from its January peak. Although some market participants search for higher prices others predict that volatility will continue. The Ripple latest news reveals to many observers that XRP continues as a key player yet external factors combined with internal corporate decisions can produce surprising outcomes for its value. A Fresh Pay-Fi Contender: Remittix on the Rise The Ripple latest news generates both optimism and fear yet Remittix continues developing toward becoming a 100x investment opportunity by 2025. This altcoin system focuses on payment operations worldwide to reduce transfer costs and shorten international transaction delays. The Remittix presale achieved over $14.4 million in funding during its presale phase which most beginner coins fail to accomplish at this speed. Remittix solves actual problems that international money transfers face so it does not depend on hype elements. The project targets both crypto fans and everyday users seeking better financial performance through their solution. Early adoption of Remittix increased because analysts praised its intuitive interface along with straightforward messaging. The team stands apart through its clear demonstration of the methods it will use to decrease remittance costs compared to general token promises. With reliable performance the platform has the potential to obtain a significant market share from beyond speculators into remittance services. Why Remittix Could Outperform XRP’s Long-Term Gains The Ripple latest news about XRP growth potential contrasts against Remittix supporters who believe their project has better potential for upward movement. One reason is timing. The substantial price increases of XRP have minimized the possibility of predicting future growth. Remittix begins its launch with a presale price at $0.0734 which creates an ability to achieve significant price growth. The basic operating feature of Remittix which enables speed and economical money transfers addresses fundamental requirements. The token's demand would surge if Remittix establishes partnerships with major remittance providers or digital payment platforms. A 100x return on Remittix tokens might occur if the project achieves its planned milestones and fulfills genuine customer needs. This prospect attracts investors who want to benefit from XRPs high growth potential. Conclusion Recent Ripple latest news reports show a mix of hope and doubt which has led crypto sphere watchers to start paying attention to Remittix. The Pay-Fi altcoin project has accumulated $14.4 million from donors through its initial funding period before claiming it will change the way global money transfers operate. The combination of positive outlook and watchfulness reinforces a larger reality which demonstrates that useful crypto projects remain superior to established tokens because of their market instability. Prospective 100x gains for Remittix by 2025 appear likely thanks to its affordable presale phase and defined mission.

Institutional Bitcoin demand is a long-term bullish signal — but will have limited effects in the near term Bitcoin’s technical outlook remains dire, as a death cross chart pattern was recently spotted — and the ongoing decline in prices is happening on strong volume, indicating that the asset could still be far from reaching a bottom. Ultimately, near-term price action will depend on wider macro factors. The chief driver behind the current decline is President Trump’s budding trade war. Unless the U.S. administration’s approach to tariffs changes substantially in the coming weeks, the wider crypto market, as well as BTC, will likely continue to see prices move downward as investors shift their focus to safer, low-risk assets.

Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a top Solana meme coin, was trading at $0.4755, up by 35% from its lowest level this month. It has outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins like Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ) as it has surged by 135% from the year-to-date low. Fartcoin has potential catalysts that may push its price higher in the near term. The first is that investors have continued accumulating the token despite the ongoing crypto sell-off. Nansen data shows that the number of tokens on exchanges has dropped over the past few days. Exchange balances fell by 3.62% in the last seven days to 138.65 million, down from 143.86 million a week ago. Net flow to exchanges was minus 2 million, indicating that investors are moving their tokens from exchanges to self-custody.

This channel forms the handle section of a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation setup. This particular pattern has a depth of 72%, suggesting that the token may rebound to $1.2286. That target comes from measuring the same distance from the upper side of the cup and represents a 160% increase from current levels.

While Dogecoin ($DOGE) has been struggling to break through critical levels, newcomer Yeti Ouro ($YETIO) has been experiencing a remarkable presale momentum with only 16 days remaining in its Stage 3 offering. The project has also raised more than $3.2 million from interested investors. Dogecoin Faces Critical Resistance Amid Market Volatility Dogecoin, the first-ever ‘meme’ cryptocurrency, has been all over the place in terms of price lately, with the asset finding it tough to make any real progress. Right now, Dogecoin is trading around $0.17 after finding it hard to break past the resistance levels at $0.1740 and $0.180. Experts think it could be a sign of good things to come if the asset eventually breaks past the resistance levels. The OG meme coin has been facing downward pressure, seeing a price drop of about 7% in the last 24 hours, and nearly 18% in the past week. While prediction from Coincodex shows that Dogecoin price might reach close to $0.609273 in April 2025, representing a 257% increase from the present price, the asset needs to first overcome its challenges. Technical analysis also shows that DOGE must stay above the $0.25 psychological mark to avoid seeing a bigger decline. Even some analysts who were optimistic about the token hitting $4 are now warning of a potential drop to $0.20 if it fails to hold on to the critical support levels. According to analyst Ali Martinez in 2024, the asset has been trading in the ascending channel and if it holds on to that level and rises above 19 cents, then we could be looking at a test of the $4 price mark. However, other analysts have mentioned that a price range between $0.25 and $0.30 is a realistic price mark for April. YETIO Redefines Meme Coin Ecosystem With Gaming Integration Compared to DOGE’s consolidation, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) has been progressing with its impressive presale. The project has become the go-to place for investors seeking profits in the market due to its 212 million tokens sold at a current price of $0.024 in Stage 3. In addition, the project has raised more than $3 million, which is about 15.3% to the finish line. YETIO’s presale structure was designed to reward early investors, with Stage 1 participants realizing 100% ROI, a 20% bonus on purchases, and a 25% bonus on all investments exceeding $500. Some analysts have predicted a 5000% jump for YETIO after its listing on exchanges, with the project predicted to attract investors from known projects like Cardano. YETIO’s appeal lies in its improved Play-to-Earn (P2E) ecosystem built around Yeti Go, a racing game developed with Unreal Engine 5. This game allows users to earn while competing, creating an engaging model that is more than the typical coin speculation in the meme market. Yeti Go is being developed by the project alongside one of the gaming industry’s top studios–the same team behind games like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, and some others. The result is that the game doesn’t just look good, it feels cinematic in all aspects. However, what makes it different is its sound. The audio was created by experts who have worked with Grammy-nominated acts like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel and some others, adding energy, emotion, and depth to the game. Scroll down to meet the first character and view the bold new world that it is about to take on. YETIO’s smart contract is audited by SOLIDProof, which increases the project’s trust score. To invest in YETIO is easy. Investors need a good DeFi wallet on the network of their choice, including Metamask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc. The next step is to place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website for the amount of YETIO tokens and complete it in a one-click transaction. Investment Outlook: DOGE Consolidation vs. YETIO Growth Potential While Dogecoin continues to benefit from its popularity and Elon Musk’s influence, YETIO offers a better advantage for investors looking for the best opportunities in the market. The project’s tokenomics, which features a supply capped at one billion tokens and an impressive burn mechanism, sets it apart from DOGE’s inflationary model. Dogecoin investors now need to closely monitor the support levels of DOGE as the token continues to find its way to reclaim its previous high in a tough market. Meanwhile, with 18 days left in its presale, YETIO is a new player that shows promise in the crypto world. Instead of the usual hype, it provides real benefits while showcasing the $200 billion GameFi industry.

43034554,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=726275,1744034418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43034554.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Looks Set To Crash To $1,000-$1,500, But Can It Fill The CME Gaps Upwards To $3,933",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-to-crash-to-1000-1500/,"Ethereum is facing renewed downward selling pressure, with the entire crypto market entering a fresh downtrend in the past 24 hours. This renewed selling pressure has seen the Ethereum price lose a strong support level at $1,800, causing it to fall by about 14.5% from its price 24 hours ago at the time of writing. The trading trend shows that the Ethereum price is about to break below $1,500, with one analyst even suggesting a potential break to $1,000. Yet, despite the sharp decline, technical patterns suggest the possibility of Ethereum revisiting much higher price levels upwards to $3,933, specifically to fill multiple CME futures gaps that are still open above. Ethereum Breaks Below Key Support, Larger Breakdown Ahead The loss of the $1,800 support has strengthened the bear case for Ethereum, especially amid broader weakness in the altcoin market. One of the more blunt takes comes from crypto analyst Andrew Kang, who argued that the price of Ethereum is actually overvalued. He described Ethereum’s $215 billion market cap as “ridiculous” for what he calls a “negative growth/profitability asset.” Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bullishness On Ethereum Price At This Point, Can It Hit $4,000 Again? According to Kang, the momentum of speculative winds that used to ignite Ethereum’s price surge has run dry, and a revisit of the $1,000 to $1,500 zone is not only likely but overdue. What adds weight to Kang’s warning is how quickly the market appears to have validated his concerns. Since his statement, Ethereum’s market cap has dropped significantly, sliding to $186.5 billion at the time of writing. Although the decline is due to other market factors, the pace and depth of this decline suggest that investor confidence in Ethereum may be lower than expected, with no immediate signs of reversal in sight. If bearish pressure continues, Ethereum could soon find itself trading at the lower end of Kang’s projected range at $1,000. CME Gaps Above $2,500 Offer A Technical Outlook For Rebound Even as price action trends lower, Ethereum’s CME futures chart tells a different story. Titan of Crypto pointed out that three distinct CME gaps are unfilled above the current market level. These include a gap between $2,550 and $2,625, another between $2,890 and $3,050, and a partially filled third gap between $3,917 and $3,933. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Hits 300-Week MA For The Second Time Ever, Here’s What Happened In 2022 The CME gap theory is rooted in the observation that asset prices often return to fill these voids, even if the move takes weeks or months. In the case of Ethereum, the odds of a return to the CME gaps are very low in the short term. However, considering Q2 2025 is only just starting, there is still enough time to witness the buying pressure needed to fill these levels before the end of the year. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,540, down by 14.5% in the past 24 hours.

Amid this, a top analyst has made headlines in the XRP news thread with his recent warning over a potential Ripple’s coin crash to $0.74, citing historical trends. However, it’s worth that despite the short-term bearish outlook, the analyst remained optimistic on the future trajectory of the coin. XRP News: Historical Patterns Hints At Ripple Price Crash Ahead As XRP price today recorded a massive slump amid a broader crypto market crash , market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has once again sparked discussion in the crypto community with a stark warning. According to him, Ripple’s native asset could be on the verge of repeating historical crashes witnessed in previous market cycles. This prediction has made headlines in the XRP news column. He pointed to data from both the 2017 and 2021 cycles, where XRP nosedived by 73% and 78%, respectively, from local highs to lows. Meanwhile, according to the pundit, similar price actions could send XRP plunging to $0.91 or even $0.74. These targets are drawn from how XRP behaved in those cycles before making massive comebacks. Notably, EGRAG noted that during those periods, the coin dropped significantly but also bounced sharply, rising 2700% in 2017 and 1000% in 2021. Having said that, the analyst maintained a bullish outlook, suggesting that history could repeat itself on the upside too. Key Technical Indicators Hints At XRP’s Bullish Run Ahead EGRAG highlighted the 200-day Moving Average (MA) as a critical support zone. He explained that in past crashes, XRP fell below this average but managed to bounce back. The crucial signal to watch, he said, is the relationship between the 50 MA and 200 MA. “As long as the 50 MA hasn’t crossed bearish with the 200 MA, and #XRP pumps back to the 200 MA then gets rejected, we are still in a #BULLRUN!” he suggested. In other words, if XRP touches the 200 MA and rebounds before a bearish crossover, a strong upside move could follow. How’s Ripple’s Coin Is Performing? XRP price today slumped more than 13% and exchanged hands at $1.78, while its one-day volume rocketed around 500% to $12 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour low of $1.64 while witnessing a high of $2.09. Besides, the XRP Futures Open Interest also fell 18% to $2.9 billion, reflecting the gloomy sentiment in the market. In addition, experts like EGRAG CRYPTO have further sparked discussions with the latest prediction over a further dip ahead. Despite that, it appears that the pundits remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin. Besides, it also comes as Ripple CTO David Schwartz has shared “good news” for the market, which has caught the investors’ attention.

Analysts are tracking three familiar projects—Bitcoin (BTC), Solana, and XRP—as they begin to display the signs of renewed strength. From increased trading volume to heightened network usage, these signals are suggesting the market could be setting up for a new phase of upward pressure. Meanwhile, solid performers like TON, XLM, and SUI are steadily maintaining their roles in the current cycle—while an early-stage project, MAGACOINFINANCE, is making a strong case for wider attention. PRE-SALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE – Early and Well-Positioned While established tokens regain attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is creating a lane of its own. With over $5.3 million raised, it has quickly emerged as one of the few early-access projects left with real structure and community traction. Its capped 100 billion token supply and public-only distribution model make it stand apart. There are no private allocations or insider deals—just open participation from the start. That transparency has resonated with retail investors, leading to a surge in wallet adoption and growing conversation across social platforms. Though it launched quietly, MAGACOINFINANCE is now entering the spotlight as listings approach and final token availability runs low. Its setup is designed for long-term engagement—and those who’ve been tracking its movement know that time is running short to enter early.

From a marketplace full of vague ideas Remittix has established itself through its realistic business path for simplifying worldwide money transfers. The presale accomplishment has earned Remittix top status for April while attracting numerous interested holders. The popularity of flash-in-the-pan ventures has led Remittix to prove that practical use cases can beat short-lived excitement in the market. Breaking Barriers in Cross-Border Finance: The Remittix Mission The core advantage of Remittix consists of concentrating its efforts toward addressing concrete real-world problems. Customers encounter multiple problems in traditional remittance services including expensive fees together with extended settlement delays and excessive intermediary service providers. The blockchain efficiency allows Remittix to solve existing issues in its framework. The decentralized framework aims to cut down expenses and minimize waiting times for international transfers so users including both companies and households can transfer funds more efficiently. The project achieved rapid growth due to its well-defined purpose. Remittix directs its services toward all users who experience dissatisfaction with traditional money transfer systems. The innovative approach has met with strong backing since many tokens in this space fail to address basic everyday financial requirements despite their technological promises. Remittix attracts extensive marketplace opportunities by focusing on cross-border financial services which addresses migration workers sending money to family while also serving global freelancers and businesses with international clients. Surging Presale Figures: $14.4 Million and Counting The outstanding achievement in Remittix's growth model comes from its pre-sale activities. The project’s vision has drawn substantial investor interest which resulted in both $14.4 million in fund collection as well as 527 million token sales. The accessible pricing at $0.0734 makes these tokens available to many prospective buyers who want to join Remittix at its initial phase. The crypto market's previous letdowns have inspired many investors to recognize Remittix as an exciting service-based cryptocurrency project for early stage investment. Remittix's quick rise has received additional momentum from social media discussions and a robust community base. Communities of enthusiasts distribute exciting news about the platform and motivate new members to participate by showcasing its valuable prospects. So far the project has upheld its commitment to continuous communication which has prevented the development from appearing unrealistic. The project constantly shows its progress to its token holders which proves that its increasing numbers represent actual plans for real-world adoption. Looking Ahead: Can Remittix Outshine the Competition? Remittix experiences undeniable progress but it requires the same basic barriers that all new cryptocurrency systems need to overcome. A cross-border finance solution faces a significant regulatory challenge since different countries apply varying standards to digital assets and requires meeting compliance standards in multiple jurisdictions. Remittix still holds hope according to many observers. The platform will build trust and attract more users through its systematic roadmap execution and its strategic regional partner formations in high remittance areas. Through its ability to keep meeting performance expectations Remittix stands to move beyond competing with established competitors by building a system which establishes accessible and affordable transfers as the standard practice for the future. The project stands out because its visionary goals combine with concrete implementation steps which distinguish it from numerous similar projects that make empty promises. Conclusion Remittix exceeded $14.4 million during its presale period which demonstrates widespread belief in its mission to change international money transfers. Through addressing common issues and demonstrating transparency while acquiring thousands of users Remittix proves its move beyond ungrounded enthusiasm into functional implementation. The volatile nature of crypto provides no certainty yet the strong market reaction shows that authentic utility tokens find growing numbers of investors. The initial success of Remittix could lead to its establishment as a landmark of innovation that enables quicker and less expensive international money transfers.

Why Traders Are Betting Big On This New Pay-Fi Altcoin Named Remittix",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/monero-jupiter-or-remittix-why-traders-are-betting-big-on-this-new-pay-fi-altcoin-named-remittix,"The evolving crypto landscape in 2025 has brought about a new focus on tokens that not only boast compelling narratives but also solve real problems. In the midst of this shift, investors are comparing classic privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and ecosystem enablers like Jupiter (JUP) with a new entrant in the payments sector — Remittix (RTX). Placed as a ""Pay-Fi"" pioneer, Remittix is drawing significant attention from traders who anticipate the next cycle of growth will be fueled not by speculation or anonymity in itself, but by genuine financial utility. While interoperability platforms and privacy-focused networks maintain niche utility, Remittix is creating its own niche — one based on the utilitarian need for speedy, cheap, and compliant cross-border payments. That market, long dominated by stodgy financial institutions, may at last be seeing a genuine blockchain-based alternative. Monero's Privacy Legacy Faces New Market Realities Since nearly a decade ago, Monero has come to be used as the generic term for anonymity in crypto. With a proof-of-work-based blockchain, XMR offers solid anonymity through ring signatures and stealth addresses — elements that have helped it find popularity in markets whereanonymity reigns supreme. As of April 6, 2025, Monero's price is around $211.35, a figure reflective of both how old it is and a dip from its maximum use case fame in crypto's early years. Though Monero's utility in privacy-minded transactions remains solid, it has also faced headwinds in the form of regulatory scrutiny. Several exchanges have delisted XMR in jurisdictions that are promoting more compliant digital asset ecosystems. With today's market — increasingly driven by institution capital and mainstream influence — complete anonymity can be as much a liability as an asset. This is not to imply Monero is antiquated. But for long-term investors seeking exposure to scalable crypto infrastructure or adoption-driven growth, privacy coins are a harder sell, especially versus tokens that can natively fit into global financial systems. Jupiter Seeks to Simplify Blockchain for the Masses Jupiter (JUP), however, is not interested in privacy but accessibility. The primary mission of the platform is to increase access to blockchain technology, specifically for developers and firms wanting to incorporate decentralized functionality into consumer applications. At a cost of around $0.3680, JUP has benefited from inclusion in new wallet additions and cross-chain bridges, which have increased its visibility among developers. But Jupiter's progress has mostly been contained within specialized corners of the broader blockchain universe. Its success relies on enterprise partnerships and developer adoption — both of which are more elusive to quantify and slower to deliver concrete price moves. For those investors and traders looking for short-to-mid term returns facilitated by mass consumer adoption, JUP provides a potentially valuable but less direct way to upside. Furthermore, Jupiter's challenge is to stand out from an ocean of Layer-1 and Layer-2 competitors, some of whom are chasing similar goals around simplicity, scalability, and low fees. While it may be great at its technical mission, it's yet to catch up with the same level of passion as utility tokens solving high-friction, real-world financial use cases. Remittix Seizes Momentum With Real-World Payment Solutions Enter Remittix (RTX) — a cryptocurrency project designed from scratch to address the inefficiencies of cross-border remittances and payments. Remittix is not trying to build a new kind of blockchain or privacy system like Monero and Jupiter. It's building a product that confronts head-on an inherent problem for millions of people: sending money quickly, inexpensively, and securely across borders. Remittix allows individuals to convert cryptocurrency to fiat, and deposit that fiat directly into the bank accounts of recipients in the supported countries. This reduces friction for migrant workers, freelancers, small exporters, and NGOs who traditionally have to put up with high costs and slow transfer times when they use traditional remittance companies. Up to April 2025, Remittix has raised in excess of $14.4 million in presale funding and sold over 527 million tokens during a presale of $0.0734. The site has gained traction not by means of publicity but by virtue of an actionable, scalable design that is beginning to resonate within diverse segments of users — ranging from retail crypto adopters to regional fintech networks. RTX is viewed with optimism by analysts, with a few seeing it growing 100x in price by the conclusion of Q3 if the venture hits exchange listings and continues to build remittance partners. Remittix's key to success lies not merely in what it promises, but what it already delivers — a hassle-free, blockchain-backed means of solving a multi-billion-dollar problem. Shaping the Future: Remittix as a Model Altcoin Monero, Jupiter, and Remittix comparisons aren't a question of technical superiority — they're a question of market fit. Monero will always be praised for its innovations in privacy, and Jupiter might yet be the basis of Web3 usability. But for right now, as a question of market influence, accessible value, and mainstream use, Remittix is the gold standard. In a year where investors are looking for clarity and confidence in an oversubscribed market, RTX offers a special combination: an in-the-real-world solution, early-stage entry, and real momentum. That's why increasing numbers of traders are going all-in on this new Pay-Fi altcoin — and why Remittix could be the most important project to watch in 2025.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/hong-kong-financial-regulator-approves-crypto-staking-for-licensed-exchanges-here-are-the-details/,"Hong Kong’s top financial regulator has released long-awaited guidelines that allow licensed crypto exchanges and funds to offer staking services, marking a significant step toward the city becoming a global digital asset hub. Hong Kong Approves Crypto Staking for Licensed Exchanges Under New SFC Rules Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs), Hong Kong’s term for licensed crypto exchanges and authorised virtual asset funds, can now legally offer staking services to clients under strict regulatory conditions, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today. Staking allows crypto holders to earn passive income by locking up their tokens to help secure blockchain networks, particularly those built on proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. The SFC said in a press release that its new framework is part of the city’s broader “ASPIRe” roadmap to foster a vibrant, regulated crypto ecosystem while protecting investors. “Expanding the suite of regulated services and products is crucial to maintaining the healthy progress of Hong Kong’s virtual asset ecosystem,” said SFC Chief Executive Julia Leung. Basic Requirements for Licensed Exchanges Under the new rules, crypto exchanges operating in Hong Kong must: Having full control over client assets used for staking. Prohibiting the outsourcing of staking activities to third parties. Providing transparent risk disclosures to users, including risks of blockchain errors, validator outage, or hacking. Explaining the staking process, including fees, minimum lockup periods, and contingency plans for operational disruptions. With staking now officially permitted under a licensed framework, Hong Kong’s crypto sector is set to grow even further, offering both local and international investors new regulated ways to participate in blockchain networks and earn returns on their assets. *This is not investment advice.

The race for Real-world asset dominance is heating up. On Monday, April 7, MANTRA Chain launched a $108.8 millio ecosystem fund to support the development of the RWA industry. The MANTRA Ecosystem Fund will allocate the funds over four years to startups in all stages of growth globally. You might also like: What is tokenization? How it works and how to invest in it MANTRA will find startups to invest in through its network of investment partners and incubators, said MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin. According to the company, these include Brevan Howard Digital, Amber Group, Laser Digital, Shorooq, Valor Capital, and more. “By aligning with top investors and incubators, we are opening doors for visionary founders and teams to join us in building and creating a thriving ecosystem and bringing more of the world on-chain,” John Patrick Mullin, CEO and founder of MANTRA. The fund will primarily focus on the MANTRA ecosystem, which is building a platform for RWAs that focuses on regulatory compliance. However, other projects in the industry will also have a chance to receive investments. We genuinely believe in playing a non-zero-sum game, where collaboration and a broad open-arms policy will serve our community and industry best,” said Gideon Daitz, partner at Three Point Capital. MANTRA secures Dubai VASP licence The launch of the fund comes after MANTRA obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Dubai on February 19. Dubai is a key market for MANTRA, where the company started several projects. These include a partnership with Dubai-based DAMAC Group to offer tokenized financing worth $1 billion for its real-estate projects. Asset tokenization is a key use case for crypto. Due to its ability to make investments more accessible, it is growing rapidly, reaching a market cap of $50 billion in 2025. Moreover, projections by McKinsey suggest that the total RWA market cap could hit $2 trillion by 2030 .

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped below $80,000 , as investor sentiment continues to sour amid intensifying global trade tensions. The decline mirrors the broader market selloff, with U.S. equities experiencing their worst trading session since the COVID-19 crash in 2020. Amid this widespread downturn, investors are actively searching for signs of a bottom, and potential buying opportunities. On April 7, Finbold turned to 12-hour Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) data from CoinGlass , a popular timeframe for identifying short-term trading setups. With the average RSI across the crypto market sitting at 33.50, signaling weakening momentum and nearing oversold territory, a few assets stand out as candidates for a rebound. Among them, Ethereum ( ETH) and Jito ( JTO ) are showing early signs of recovery. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is showing early signs of a potential recovery after slipping into oversold conditions. The second-largest cryptocurrency is currently trading at $1,543.59, with its 12-hour RSI falling to 27.5, well below the average of 33.50. The 24-hour RSI is even lower at 27.01, signaling sustained selling pressure and hinting that a short-term bottom may be forming. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: ETH. Source: CoinGlass This comes as Ethereum continues to trade below all major moving averages , showing a persistent bearish trend. However, the confluence of oversold signals across multiple timeframes suggests that the asset could be nearing a technical floor. Historically, such RSI levels have preceded relief rallies, drawing interest from traders seeking a low-risk entry point. Over the past 12 hours, ETH has declined 2.36%, adding to its recent slide. Still, with RSI levels firmly in oversold territory, momentum appears to be shifting. If buying interest picks up, Ethereum could be set for a short-term bounce. Jito (JTO) JTO is currently trading at $1.5711, showing signs of a potential rebound after entering deeply oversold territory. The token’s 12-hour RSI has dropped to 27.14, well below the average RSI of 33.50, signalling strong selling pressure that may be nearing exhaustion. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: JTO. Source: CoinGlass Notably, the price has already begun to recover, gaining 1.14% over the past 12 hours, a signal that buyers could be stepping back in. For investors, these conditions suggest a possible short-term bottom, positioning JTO as a candidate for a near-term bounce. That being said, while oversold RSI levels suggest a potential buying opportunity, RSI alone is not a definitive indicator of a reversal. A sustained recovery will require confirmation through rising trading volume and broader market sentiment.

The rebound follows a sudden drop that saw BTC drop to as low as $74,000 in the last 24 hours. The price action was during a fake news that President Donald Trump is considering suspending tariffs for 90 days on all countries except China. Fake Trump Tariff Pause Reports Drive Bitcoin Price Relief Fake news surfaced Monday suggesting President Donald Trump is considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China. This fake news initiated a brief market rally that helped Bitcoin price to cross the $80,000 threshold before retreating to its current price. The White House has since referred to the reports as “false,” adding to the cloud of uncertainty for the markets. Trump continues to state that his tariffs are necessary for making trade fairer and restoring domestic manufacturing. He singled out China as “the biggest abuser of them all.” Crypto Market Shows Mixed Recovery The brief recovery in cryptocurrency prices appears directly linked to this tariff pause news. In the short term, the entire cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery, as Ethereum rose to $1,567.92, up 2.04%. XRP climbed to $1.88, up 4.88%, and Solana rose to $106.84, gaining 4.69% over the past hour. Dogecoin also showed the highest hourly gain among major cryptocurrencies at +5.5%. BNB has posted a 1.49% gain, lagging behind other major altcoins in the current relief rally. Source: CoinMarketCap Economic Concerns Persist Despite Price Recovery Goldman Sachs has issued a new forecast suggesting that a recession has become more likely even if President Trump reverses his tariff policies. The financial firm predicts economic growth will slow substantially due to “a sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty.” These economic concerns remain a backdrop to the cryptocurrency market’s recovery. The 5.64% decrease in global crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours shows that the hourly gains have not yet erased the overall downtrend. While the global crypto market nosedived, the 24-hour trading volume has surged by over 400%. As per Alternative data , the overall bearish outlook has also pushed the crypto fear & greed index to extreme fear at 23. The report was released during a period of notable market volatility, as Bitcoin and altcoins saw double-digit declines in the past 24 hours and total crypto liquidations surpassed $600 million .

The investment plan aims to accelerate the growth and adoption of blockchain projects within the project’s blockchain. The Ecosystem Fund According to an April 7 press release shared with CryptoPotato , the fund will be deployed over the next four years to support blockchain projects worldwide. The team described the initiative as a strategic growth engine that will provide capital to startups and globally recognized investment firms. “In an era where blockchain technology is revolutionizing finance, the MEF will serve as a catalyst for groundbreaking projects that drive real-world adoption through a focus upon the tokenization of real-world assets,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO and founder of MANTRA. Investment opportunities will be sourced through the platform’s extensive partner network, which includes leading incubators and accelerators. According to the announcement , the MEF will focus on supporting projects that are innovating in RWA tokenization, including those at any stage of development and even those that are chain-agnostic. The initiative also aims to create collaboration between blockchain pioneers and leading investment firms to support the adoption of RWA tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). Gideon Daitz, partner at Three Point Capital, who will lead the project, emphasized the mission to support RWA tokenization globally by providing teams with capital, network, and expertise to put high-quality assets on-chain. He explained that the company would mainly focus on building on the MANTRA ecosystem while emphasizing the importance of collaboration and an open-arms policy for the benefit of the community and the industry. Daitz added that this approach will include making focused investments into fewer teams with stronger ties to its network of resources. More Developments MANTRA Chain is a permissionless layer 1 blockchain that enables the tokenization of real-world assets while ensuring compliance with real-world regulatory requirements. To achieve this, the network offers advanced technology modules, compliance mechanisms, and cross-chain interoperability. The MEF launch follows a previous achievement of becoming the first DeFi platform to obtain a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This permit allows MANTRA to operate as a virtual asset exchange and offer broker-dealer and management and investment services. The latest development also comes less than two weeks after DWF Labs, a Dubai-based crypto market maker and investor, launched a $250 million liquid fund aimed at expanding blockchain projects of various sizes.

Bitcoin’s core holder base is too robust to be swept away by tariff fallouts. Cryptocurrencies could see new all-time highs if economic conditions reverse soon. Anthony Pompliano weighed in on the market turmoil Monday, arguing President Trump’s tariffs don’t directly target crypto but hit prices indirectly by creating investor uncertainty. He also offered a unique perspective on the tariffs’ long-term goals and Bitcoin’s resilience. During a recent podcast , Pompliano noted that investors withhold their funds whenever the market’s uncertainty level rises. That is why Bitcoin’s price drops under such circumstances, considering how the lack of clarity demoralizes investors who prefer to wait for more definite conditions to re-enter the market. Focusing on the hot topic of how Donald Trump’s tariff regime could affect the US economy, the renowned analyst considers the ongoing policy adjustments by Trump a good development.

Bitcoin’s network processing power has reached an unprecedented 1 Zetahash per second (ZH/s), marking a major milestone in the cryptocurrency’s 16-year history. Multiple blockchain tracking services confirmed the achievement between April 4-5, 2023, though they disagree on the exact timing of when the threshold was crossed. Related Reading: XRP Will Explode—And This Korean Expert Says He’ll Be ‘Laughing’ At Critics Different Trackers Report Varying Dates For Historic Milestone A Zetahash (ZH/s) is a unit of computational power used to measure Bitcoin’s hashrate, which reflects how much computing power is being used to secure the Bitcoin network through mining. According to mempool.space data, Bitcoin’s hashrate peaked at 1.025 ZH/s on April 5. BTC Frame’s metrics showed a slightly earlier breakthrough at 1.02 ZH/s on April 4. Meanwhile, Coinwarz reported an even higher peak of 1.1 ZH/s on April 4 at block height 890,915, but also suggested the network first hit the 1 ZH/s mark on March 24. The differences stem from how each service calculates hashrate. Blockchain analyst Jameson Lopp previously pointed out that using one “trailing block” versus five blocks for estimation can result in differences exceeding 0.04 ZH/s. Mitchell Askew, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, said viewing the raw Hashrate metric can be deceiving due to random variations in block times. He noted that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average hashrate remains around 0.845 ZH/s. Network Shows Massive Growth Since 2016 This achievement represents remarkable growth for the Bitcoin network. The current hashrate of 1 ZH/s equals 1,000 Exahashes per second, marking a 1,000-fold increase since late January 2016 when the network first reached 1 EH/s. To put this computational power in perspective, Bitcoin now processes approximately 40,000 times more calculations per second than Litecoin, the second-largest proof-of-work cryptocurrency network. Based on Coinwarz data, Litecoin currently operates at just 2.49 Petahashes per second. Commercial Mining Operations Drive Hashrate Growth According to Askew, the surge in hashrate has coincided with increased competition among commercial Bitcoin mining firms. Miners are doubling down, and expanding sites and plugging in more efficient machines, he said. However, he warned that less efficient miners might struggle unless Bitcoin prices increase in the coming months. Related Reading: Ethereum Slips Below Triangle—Is A $1,600 Crash Next? At least 24 publicly listed companies now operate Bitcoin mining equipment, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com. MARA Holdings leads the pack with more than 50 EH/s of computing power. Other major contributors include Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, Hut 8 Mining, and TeraWulf. Most of the network’s hashrate flows through major mining pools, with Foundry USA Pool and AntPool controlling the largest shares, according to the Hashrate Index. Record Hashrate Coincides With Market Downturn The network’s technical achievement occurred during a sharp market decline. Bitcoin’s price fell 8% over a 24-hour period to $77,210, while US stocks experienced what analysts called the largest two-day loss ever.

The market cap of all crypto coins plunged by 10% in the last 24 hours to $2.41 trillion. Crypto investors have three options in these market conditions. They can buy the dip, sell the rip, or continue holding their positions. This article explores the top 3 cryptocurrency tokens to dollar cost average (DCA) on for 5x gains in April. Top 3 Crypto Tokens to DCA for 5X Gains this April Crypto analysts who have watched the industry for years have seen this before. This is where a black swan event happens, investors panic, and dump their tokens. The Fed then intervenes and these tokens stage a strong comeback. A good example of this happened at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The real winners in these conditions are people who buy the dip, either at once or through dollar cost averaging (DCA). DCA is a situation where one buys a falling several times. Assume you have $10,000 to invest. Instead of using it all to buy Litecoin at $65, you can divide it into three and buy it as it drops. The best crypto tokens to DCA during this Black Monday for 5x gains are Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Pepe (PEPE), and Polkadot (DOT). Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Meme coins will be some of the best-performing crypto tokens when the industry rebounds. Fartcoin, a top Solana meme coin, is one of the top ones to DCA and benefit as its price bounces back. The bullish case for the Fartcoin price is that investors seem to be accumulating the dip, as the chart below shows. Investors are buying Fartcoin Also, technically, the token has formed a cup and handle pattern , a popular bullish continuation sign. The upper side of this pattern is at $0.7153, while its depth is about 71%. The recent decline is part of the formation of the handle section. Therefore, if this pattern works well, it means that the Fartcoin price will soar to $1.2286. Fartcoin Price Chart Pepe (PEPE) Pepe is another top crypto token to buy, primarily because of its strong technicals. On the 1D chart, the Pepe price is in the process of forming a double-bottom pattern at $0.000005320. The neckline of this pattern is at $0.000009185, its highest level last week. The double bottom is forming after the coin created a giant falling wedge pattern . A wedge has two descending and merging trendlines. This convergence has already happened, pointing to more gains in the coming weeks. The most likely Pepe price forecast is to the upside, with the initial target at $0.00001466, the 50% retracement level. A drop below the support at $0.000005320 will invalidate the bullish view. Pepe Price Chart Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is an interesting contrarian cryptocurrency token to buy. The most notable fundamental is that it is working on the final step of the Polkadot 2.0 launch, and there are odds that the SEC will approve a DOT ETF . Technically, the coin has resisted moving below the important support at $3.61 despite the ongoing crypto crash. That is a sign that it is forming a quadruple-bottom pattern, which may lead to a strong comeback, initially to the resistance at $11.20. The bullish Polkadot price forecast will become invalid if it loses the quadruple bottom. Polkadot Price Chart Summary on Top Cryptocurrency Tokens to Buy Polkadot, Fartcoin, and Pepe coin have strong fundamentals, including their popularity and on-chain metrics. They are also showing strong technicals, pointing to an eventual comeback once the crypto meltdown wanes.

Most crypto-assets plummeted in value. Bitcoin dipped below $75,000, Ethereum below $1,500. This led to the liquidation of futures positions worth more than $1.36 billion. The Coinpaper editorial staff gathered experts' opinions on the reasons for the sharp collapse and their predictions for the future. Between April 6 and April 7, 2025, the cryptocurrency market suffered a sharp decline. Bitcoin collapsed by more than 10% overnight to below $75,000. Ethereum fell to $1500, hitting lows since March 2023. This led to liquidation of over 441,800 traders' futures positions worth $1.36 billion. On April 2, 2025, US President Donald Trump introduced a large package of customs tariffs, including reciprocal and base tariffs. Most experts cited this as the main reason for the collapse of the cryptocurrency market. Coinpaper team analyzed the comments of experts and collected their opinions on the current state of the crypto market and its future. Reasons for the correction Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee said in a commentary that bitcoin and Ethereum have entered a critical phase of price consolidation amid heightened macroeconomic tensions. According to him, the market has become more volatile following Trump's statements on new tariffs and concerns over a possible trade war. In addition, Ryan Lee added that the strengthening of the US dollar and rising Treasury bond yields also contributed to the fall in the price of the first cryptocurrency. Peter Chang, head of research at Presto Research, noted in a commentary on The Block that bitcoin investors have been gripped by a ”sell now, think later” mindset due to the pace and scope of Trump's imposition of new tariffs. He said the market's recovery will depend on three factors: the reaction of other countries, the Trump administration's ability to develop a long-term plan, and expected actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to address the current instability. Jeff May, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BTSE, explained that cryptocurrency markets historically precede stock markets over the weekend. The collapse of Asian markets on the morning of April 7 likely confirmed this observation, he said. Matrixport experts said that the probability of correction of the first cryptocurrency to the $73,392 mark is growing. They added that the support level at $87,000 remains an important barrier, especially after Trump's announcement of new duties. In addition, analysts noted that additional pressure is created by the restraint of U.S. consumers due to inflation, as well as the statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that the regulator does not plan to change its policy yet. This may delay the positive impact on bitcoin from monetary support, Matrixport believes. Back on April 5, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Yang Ju said that bitcoin's bull cycle has already ended due to the asset's weak price response to the influx of large amounts of capital. The expert referred to an indicator that reflects the actual amount of money that has entered the network. If it rises and the market capitalization stands still or declines, it indicates that investors are buying bitcoin but the price is not responding - a typical signal of a weak market, Yang Ju explained. According to him, even small purchases with low selling pressure can significantly raise the price of an asset. But now the opposite is observed - despite significant capital injections, the price almost does not grow due to high pressure from sellers. Such conditions are characteristic of a bear market, CryptoQuant CEO noted. ”And although the selling pressure may subside at any moment, historically it takes at least six months for a real reversal. Therefore, short-term recovery is still unlikely,” the expert summarized. Expert forecasts and the market situation Block CEO Jack Dorsey said that bitcoin will fail unless it becomes a convenient payment instrument. According to him, the first cryptocurrency must be a daily means of payment, otherwise it will ”turn into something you buy and forget until the next crisis.” He added that without active use in payments, cryptocurrency will lose relevance. The expert also called for simple payment solutions that are fast, secure and private. Investor, businessman and author of the bestseller ”Rich Dad, Poor Dad” Robert Kiyosaki said that the biggest stock market crash has already begun and could turn into a depression. In his opinion, after the collapse of ”paper assets,” the authorities will turn on the printing press again, devaluing the dollar. In such circumstances, he advises to pay attention to gold, silver and bitcoin. Blogger Miles Deutscher stated that it is possible to make money in the cryptocurrency sector only 10% of the time. 90% of the time, the market is either stagnant or falling - that's when you need to be patient. ”But in that 10%, there are opportunities for incredibly high returns - and that's when you have to act as decisively as possible,” Deutscher added.” Andrew Kang, co-founder of venture capital firm Mechanism Capital, predicted Ethereum to fall into the $1000-1500 range this year. A trader and analyst under the pseudonym DaanCrypto said bitcoin volatility is declining, while the VIX volatility index for stocks closed at its highest level since the crash in 2020. DWF Labs CEO Andrei Grachev said that if countries offer zero-tariff deals to the U.S. and the Fed lowers interest rates, stocks and cryptocurrencies will rally. If the Fed starts printing money, bitcoin could hit an all-time high, Grachev said, adding that all will become clear in the coming weeks. According to Ryan Lee, bitcoin may remain stable near the $70,000 mark as the cost of mining 1 BTC varies between $60,000-$65,000. He summarized that further market dynamics will depend on how investors interpret policy and liquidity changes in the coming weeks. Arthur Hayes, investment director at venture capital firm Maelstrom and co-founder of the BitMEX exchange, said he has been buying bitcoin all day and plans to continue. According to him, it is not worth buying altcoins yet, as the bitcoin dominance rate is likely to grow to 70%. The expert also urged to remember the possibility of launching a printing press. Parallels to the historic crash Analysts on social network X are actively discussing the possibility of a repeat of a historic crash comparable to Black Monday. ”Tomorrow [April 7] could be Black Monday 2.0,” announced a Maine analyst. ”Black Monday” refers to the sudden stock market crash that occurred on Oct. 19, 1987. On that day, major stock indices around the world collapsed sharply, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the U.S. fell by 22.6%, which was the largest daily drop in history. Panic erupted in the backdrop as trading volumes overwhelmed the markets. The lack of trading halt mechanisms in the face of extreme volatility allowed the freefall to continue unimpeded. Following the mass liquidations, Google Trends shows that global searches for the phrase ”Black Monday” peaked. What's behind the drop ”Bearish sentiment is at its highest level in history,” noted analyst The Kobeissi Letter. He attributed the gloomy sentiment to uncertainty over Trump's trade war, describing ”Black Monday” as the consensus view. Based on this, the analyst predicts a ”short-term capitulation” this week. The Kobeissi Letter cites the results of the AAII Sentiment Survey, which recorded a record 61.9% bearish outlook. Notably, this is double the average of 31.0%. Duo Nine analyst supports this assessment of what is happening in the market. He warns that Trump's tariffs could disrupt global supply chains, lower WFP and lead to a recession. ”If the US doesn't change course soon, the only conclusion is that this was done deliberately and the damage will only escalate over time. Unfortunately for cryptocurrencies, this means the start of a prolonged bear market. It could last 1-2 years or longer if a global recession starts,” Duo Nine explained. An alternative view However, everyone agrees on the apocalyptic tone. Ryan Wollner, founder of Pearpop, urged not to exaggerate the danger of what is happening and rejected comparisons to the 1987 crash. ”I think we're only going to see a 2-3 week transition period, after which people will start buying again once the tariff situation becomes clearer,” Wollner stated .",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 15:30:31

In the past week alone, DAO shed another $3.5B in value. Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are one of the trends affected by the sliding crypto market. In the past week alone, DAO treasuries declined by $3.5B in notional value. The biggest treasury, belonging to Mantle (formerly BitDAO), is at $2.3B, down 11.4% in the past week. The collection of all DAOs tracked by DeepDAO currently holds only $14.6B, down from $42.5B in March 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, DAO treasuries declined by over $23B, driven by an outflow of users and a sliding price of ETH. Ethereum is home to hundreds of DAOs that use the token as collateral. The lost value of ETH also affects legacy treasuries from the earlier DAO. USDC and DAI are also among the top holdings of DAO, but some also hold UNI, MKR, SKY, and BNB as treasury assets. DAO treasuries range from predominantly ETH-based reserves to treasuries of native tokens, as in the case of Mantle. DAO remains one of the biggest crypto reserves with the potential to be deployed or reinvested, but for now, their influence is limited by the overall market sentiment. Any crypto project can also be a DAO, as token holders are given voting rights to decide on protocol developments. DAO can be large-scale and have thousands of users or be limited to a small pool of voters. The leading Mantle DAO has 22.2K holders with potential voting rights, while newer DAOs like Euler Finance have around 2.2K holders. DAO treasuries also have different ways of fundraising, ranging from initial token allocations to donations or earnings from activities. Some of the leading DeFi protocols also serve as DAO for fee distribution. DAOs were also formed with explicit fundraising tasks, such as buying copyrights for specific works of art. Some DAOs were also built around NFT ownership. DAO voters slow down their activity The loss of treasury value coincided with an outflow of voting activity. In January 2025, DAO usually led to as many as 1,500 decisions. In March, only 748 votes were held, with 73 votes in April to date. Voting activity is often tied to token-based incentives or rewards. With the overall drop in token prices, DAO participants may not have enough reasons to decide on issues. Some DAOs, like Jupiter, only have limited voting periods, which are heavily incentivized and marketed on social media. For others, there are almost no new proposals to vote. Additionally, DAOs rely on a small subset of power users, who often take part in hundreds of DAOs. Those power users also make up the bulk of new proposals. The influence of whales in voting may work against some DAOs, where retail holders are outvoted by whales. DAO tokens supported by Mantra (OM) DAO tokens have lost value, following the general market trend. The overall market capitalization of DAO tokens is down to $23B, losing 4.51% in the past day. Mantra (OM) is the only token with strong gains. The asset also saved the high gains of the entire tokenized real-world assets (RWA) sector. Other major DAO tokens were mostly tied to DeFi, including UNI, MKR, AAVE, CRV, LDO, and COMP. Those assets slid as the DeFi narrative also suffered losses. Losses for DAO also came from other narratives slowing down in the past months, including NFT and Web3 gaming. The lack of new crypto startups also slowed down the creation of new DAOs, leaving the market with legacy organizations. The biggest problem with DAOs is that some were formed around narratives and ideas instead of products. For some DAOs, voting was either semi-centralized or depended on proxies and whales.

It is the prospect of the sovereign individual that seems to most trouble the nation-state today. This odd threat perception has been the outgrowth of a political genealogy that, in the generations since the American Revolution, has increasingly come to equate the state with society while constellating the individual as the enemy of both. This equation would have been profoundly disconcerting to the founders of the American republic, who called forth a new national project precisely to preclude the abuses of an entrenched and predatory overclass—an aristocracy—that deemed itself the rightful custodian, in perpetuity, of the fate and best interests of a people. The political question animating America’s founders was, therefore: How can a people self-govern without creating a hereditary class of governors? How can sufficient tension , if not conflict , remain between state and society that the rule of law is preserved without becoming a prison? The founders devised an ingenious solution to this problem based on a revolutionary premise: That the rights of the individual, not those of the state, are fundamental for a free society.[1] In other words, people have rights; governments do not have rights. Governments have powers, but only those powers that are explicitly delegated to them by the people they represent. Put more precisely, the people have the totality of enumerated and unenumerated rights, while the state has only those powers explicitly enumerated. Any actions taken by agents of the state outside of their enumerated powers are a usurpation of the people’s rights. The people must safeguard these explicit limits and can take the enumerated powers of the state back at any time. In other words, the American founders reversed the dominant political assumptions in their cultural world: It was not the people who had to prove that they were deserving of rights, that they were innocent before the law, or that they had cleared themselves of inherited obligations to the state. Rather, it was the state that bore the burden of proof: That it was worthy of trust; that it had the power to take a particular action; that any person or entity was guilty under the law; or that its war powers should be exercised with the people’s blood and treasure. Concretely, this meant that during the era of the US Constitutional Convention, when the debate between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists raged, a formative consensus emerged that the American state would have no power of its own, no money of its own, and no army of its own. The American Constitution stipulated that all of these things would be effectively on loan from the people, in whom true sovereignty resided. But things have changed profoundly since the Constitution was ratified. Not only did America establish a standing army quickly thereafter; that army has been engaged in almost unceasing warfare—over a hundred conflicts both foreign and domestic, declared and undeclared—since that time. While most Americans today would likely be familiar with the large-scale conflicts in which their nation has participated—the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and two world wars, for example—they probably would be surprised by the majority of the wars in which the United States has been involved. During the nineteenth century, those wars were fought mostly against American Indian tribes as part of the push to colonize the West, while during the twentieth century they were waged predominantly against socialist and communist movements around the world. Twenty-first-century conflicts, in turn, have been prosecuted under the banner of the war on terror and, more recently, the containment of adversary nations. Although the Constitution grants Congress the sole power to declare war, in practice, Congress has only declared war in a few major conflicts: The War of 1812, wars against Mexico and Spain, and wars against particular belligerents in the First and Second World Wars. The rest have been waged through some form of unilateral executive action, whether by presidential decree or by the determination of military officers. Just as the US government now seems to have its own army, it seems to have its own money. In 1913, Congress passed the Sixteenth Amendment, giving it the right to levy permanent income taxes on the American people; estate taxes, gift taxes, capital gains taxes, and corporate taxes followed soon thereafter, while other permanent forms of taxation have been introduced in the decades since. This money has since come to be widely referred to as “government revenue” rather than “the people’s money.” But the federal government does not confine its spending to the people’s money; rather, it borrows extensively, supporting a ballooning administrative state whose agencies are so numerous and ill-defined that there is no authoritative reference for exactly how many there are. The Federal Register, the Online Federal Register, the US Government Manual , the Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies , the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, FOIA.gov, and USA.gov all list widely differing numbers and definitions of agencies.[2],[3] These agencies function as both rulemaking and rule-enforcing bodies, collapsing all three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) into one in their own operations. This eliminates the checks and balances that the authors of the Constitution put in place to constrain the power of the state, subjecting the American people to a growing thicket of laws that they have had no part in making and have no electoral capacity to alter or repeal. As a result, an illusion is created that the government has its own power. But while military conflict, taxation, and bureaucratic rule are all visible manifestations of the power of the state, they are underpinned by a platform that seems so normal and ubiquitous today that it largely goes unnoticed: A financial system in which central banks issue and manage the supply and price of unredeemable fiat currencies. These currencies serve as the base money that commercial banks, in turn, use as reserve assets to make loans. Commercial banks and central banks around the world form a network of financial intermediaries who share with each other information about every transaction that passes through their networks—which is also shared with the military, intelligence, and policing agencies of governments and intergovernmental organizations worldwide. Government’s gaze into the economic activity of every person and organization anywhere in the world is effectively unconstrained by any privacy laws or constitutional provisions regarding search and seizure of assets. This alliance between banking power and policing power took hold during the early twentieth century in what can be called the Banker Revolution—a revolution so successful that few are even aware it happened.

In a Monday, April 7 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm disclosed $5.91 billion in unrealized digital asset losses, primarily tied to its massive Bitcoin treasury. The Michael Saylor-led firm stated that the losses are partially offset by $1.69 billion in income-tax benefits. “Our unrealized loss on digital assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was $5.91 billion, which we expect will result in a net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, partially offset by a related income tax benefit of $1.69 billion,” the company stated. Bitcoin’s challenging period The announcement comes during a challenging stretch for Bitcoin ( BTC ), which has dropped below the $80,000 support level. BTC was trading at $79,295 at press time, down over 4% in the past 24 hours. BTC seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As of March 31, 2025, Strategy held 528,185 Bitcoins, acquired at an average price of $67,458 per coin, amounting to $35.63 billion in total purchase costs. Based on Bitcoin’s market price at the time of reporting, the company’s BTC holdings were valued at approximately $41.87 billion. An excerpt from Strategy’s Form 8-K report. Source: SEC Despite the unrealized losses, Strategy pressed on with its Bitcoin buying spree in Q1, acquiring 22,048 Bitcoins between March 24 and March 30 for $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 per coin. However, no additional purchases were made during the week of March 31 to April 6. The company raised $7.69 billion to finance its crypto acquisitions through various share offerings during the quarter. Still, Strategy warned that its enterprise analytics software business has not generated positive cash flow recently and may struggle to meet financial obligations, including $8.22 billion in outstanding debt and $146.2 million in annual dividends on preferred stock. Additionally, Strategy faces tax liabilities of approximately $2.28 billion related to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings, though deferred tax assets like net operating losses partially offset these. A continued decline in Bitcoin’s value could force the company to increase valuation allowances, further impacting its financial stability. MSTR stock price analysis Unsurprisingly, the unrealized losses have weighed on MSTR stock. As of press time, shares were trading at $279, down nearly 5% on the day. Year-to-date, Strategy stock has dropped about 7%. MSTR YTD stock price chart.

MUTM is currently in phase 4 of its presale (having already raised $6,300,000 from 7,900 investors) and demand appears to be accelerating. Selling at $0.025, the token has injections directly in front of phase 5 which will activate a 20% rise to $0.03. At a target exchange listing of $0.06, today’s buyers are in line for an easy 140% return upon launch, which puts it above the speculative price predictions of power coins such as ETH. Presale Momentum Builds This is a crucial crossroads mission for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – it is a sense of great need with measurable upside as we move into phase 4. Now, investors purchasing tokens lock in a cost 20% lower than the next stage, which means instant paper gains when phase 5 starts. Aside from presale bumps, tokenomics built into the project peg a $0.06 listing price, but outside analysts predict a move to $3.50 within months post exchange listings. Such growth — a potential 13,900% leap from the current rate — is made possible by Mutuum’s ultra utility-driven model, which bears little resemblance to Ethereum’s dependency on broader market sentiment. Lending Mechanics Fuel Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart from speculative counterparts through the combination of decentralized lending protocols and continued token demand. Users deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins and receive mtTokens that accrue interest over time. Not only do these tokens multiply the liquidity available across DeFi protocols, but they also accrue passive yield, making it a self-reinforcing cycle. At the same time, 14% of platform fees are continuously used to buy back MUTM from the open markets with tokens redistributed to stakers. This combined mechanism curbs sell-offs, while rewarding long-term holders—a structural advantage missing in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Ethereum Comparisons Fade Amid Ethereum’s scalability war, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes perfect advantage of real-time lending demand. Borrowers obtain loans through overcollateralizing assets, which guarantees the long-term stability of the system, while lenders accrue variable yields, determined by the utilization of the pool. The utility is further expanded with peer-to-peer options, allowing for direct negotiations for specialized assets such as meme coins. This granular functionality makes MUTM serve as a DeFi staple and not simply a tradable proxy like ETH, shielding it from the kind of sell-offs witnessed during market downtrends. Audit Assurance Almost Finish Transparency still plays a crucial role in Mutuum Finance’s rise. A smart contract audit with CertiK – a leading blockchain security platform – is in the final stages, a key event that will build investor confidence. Formal announcements will come through official channels once finalized, likely alongside presale phase transitions. This proactive security attitude —alongside $100,000 worth of active presale giveaways — only further strengthens the project’s legitimacy in a sector inundated with unvetted business ventures. Closing Window for Entry Phase 4’s $0.025 price point is now the final barrier as successive hikes blunt profit margins. Historical presale data shows each stage has sold faster than the one before or contained within it, a trend likely to continue as exchange listings loom. Just for context, that means if you sink $1,000 there today, it could grow into $140,000 if its post-launch targets are met—and for as little as $3.50—a math that’s changing the calculus of portfolios around the world. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an auditable safeguard infused with economic ingenuity that overcomes hype. With Ethereum growth plateauing, this token taps into algorithmic allegations and organic demand to become the only opportunity of choice for 2025! Phase 4 is still hanging around, but not forever. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official platform to purchase tokens before prices rise. With phase 4 nearing capacity, delaying risks forfeiting triple-digit gains. Act now—or face the regret of missing crypto’s next seismic shift.

This was decided in preparation for its first set of targeted countermeasures. Ursula von der Leyen said , “We have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods as we have successfully done with many other trading partners. Because Europe is always ready for a good deal. So we keep it on the table.” The US imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars on the 27-nation group and will be subject to 25% tariffs on imports. Also, starting Wednesday, almost all other goods will be subject to 20% reciprocal tariffs. In total, over 380 billion euros in EU-made products will be affected. BREAKING: European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen says the EU stands ready to negotiate a zero for zero tariff deal with the United States. pic.twitter.com/q1haL7VVWB — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) April 7, 2025 Today, ministers in charge of trade gathered in Luxembourg to discuss the EU’s answer and its relationship with China. Most European Union ministers said the most important thing was to start talking and avoid a full-on trade war. Meanwhile, investors are scared because of Trump’s trade war, and financial markets around the world have lost trillions of dollars or euros. In fact, European stocks dropped the most in a single day since the COVID-19 pandemic began. This could be why the EU has made this decision. Trump’s tariffs are working! The retaliatory tariffs from the EU are still possible. Based on trade weights, the EU only charges 1.6% in tariffs on US goods that aren’t agriculture. But it puts a 10% tax on American cars brought in from other countries. The US is the only G7 country that still pays this tariff because TTIP wasn’t finished. Talks with Washington have been hard so far. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said that his two-hour meeting with US officials on Friday was frank. He told them that their taxes were harmful and unfair. This week, the group will likely agree to the first set of countermeasures against up to $28 billion worth of US imports. This includes everything from dental floss to diamonds. These will be in response to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, not the larger set of reciprocal levies. But even that move has been troublesome. Trump has threatened to put a 200% tariff on EU alcoholic drinks if the group goes ahead with its plan to put a 50% duty on US bourbon. France and Italy, which sell a lot of wine and spirits, are worried. In reaction to the US car and reciprocal tariffs, the 27-nation bloc is likely to come up with a bigger set of countermeasures by the end of April. However, if there is a war of taxes on goods, Brussels doesn’t have as much to target as Washington does. In 2024, U.S. goods imported into the EU were worth 334 billion euros ($366.2 billion), while EU exports were worth 532 billion euros. Of course, America is the one to call the shots. Dutch Trade Minister Reinette Klever said, “We need to remain calm and respond in a way that de-escalates. The stock markets right now show what will happen if we escalate straightaway. But we will be prepared to take countermeasures if needed to get the Americans at the table.” The EU is afraid that Asian countries will send their exports to Europe. The Commission worries about Trump’s choice and how it might affect international trade, especially in Asia. They also worry about the immediate effect on trade between the EU and the US, which could wipe out billions of dollars. A lot of Asian countries have been hit harder than the group as a whole. For example, Malaysia has been hit 24%, India 26%, Indonesia 32%, Thailand 36%, Vietnam 46%, Laos 48%, and Cambodia 49%. China got hit with a “reciprocal” tax of 34% on top of the 20% rate they already had, for a total of 54%. In short, there have been no negotiations between the two greatest economies. The issue is that the prices are so high. Therefore, Brussels is afraid that Asian countries whose economies depend on exports will not be able to get their goods into the US market and will instead send them to Europe. China is especially scary because it is already getting a lot of attention for sending cheap, highly subsidized goods to the West. In fact, during her Monday speech, von der Leyen said that a new task force would be set up to closely watch how global trade changes. She said, “We will also protect ourselves against indirect effects through trade diversion. For this purpose, we will set up an ‘Import Surveillance Task Force We look at what are the historical imports that we have and had and (whether) there is any specific surge all of a sudden of a certain product or in a certain sector that we have to act on.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This time, the volatility could also be attributed to a recent report that was quickly refuted. *WHITE HOUSE SAYS “UNAWARE” OF 90-DAY PAUSE RUMOR ATTRIBUTED TO WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR HASSETT WHITE HOUSE ADVISORS ARE SAYING 1 THING AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING SOMETHING ELSE WE NEED ADULTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE https://t.co/OE4Ln9pWgv — GURGAVIN (@gurgavin) April 7, 2025 The report in question indicated that the White House considered implementing a 90-day delay to the tariffs, which intensified last week. Recall that US President Trump slapped every country with a 10% tax, while China, the EU, and a few more got much larger percentages. Instead, Washington became even more aggressive in its stance against the world’s second-largest economy. According to CNBC, Trump warned China that he would impose another 50% tax on it if Beijing didn’t retract the 34% tariff it imposed on the US in retaliation. Thus, the total tariffs against the Asian giant will surge to 104%, the White House confirmed. Bitcoin reacted with immediate price volatility to the fake report and the actual one. After the massive drop to $75,000 following the market-wide crash, the cryptocurrency skyrocketed to just over $81,000 (on Binance and Bitstamp). However, that was short-lived, and the subsequent rebutal, as well as Trump’s latest warning, led to just as violent a retracement that drove BTC below $79,000. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Wall Street reacted in a similar fashion, with immediate price declines after the opening bell. The past several trading days have been particularly painful.

Schiff says the broader selloff affecting Ethereum will worsen in the coming days and can push prices below $1,000 Peter Schiff Sees Ethereum Price Tumbling Below $1,000 As the market reels from the bloodbath over the weekend, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff says darker days are coming for Ethereum. In a post on X , Schiff predicts that the Ethereum price will continue the steep correction that will see it fall under $1,000. The Bitcoin critic is hinging his prediction on the recent jarring price drops faced by the largest altcoin in recent days. The latest correction sees ETH hold onto $1,500 after falling by 20% over the last day. Ethereum price reached a daily low of $1,400 before gingerly picking its way above the $1,500 mark. Given the grim price action, Peter Schiff says it is only a matter of time till the Ethereum price falls under $1,000 with technicals and fundamentals painting a grim picture. “Ether crashed below $1,500 for the first time in over two years,” said Schiff. “So far, the intraday low was just above $1,400, a 20% drop overnight. I don’t think it will be long before it breaks below $1,000.” ETH remains stuck under $2,000 since it slipped below the psychological level back with on-chain indicators showing no signs of a resurgence. Comparisons With Bitcoin And Gold Reveal Ethereum’s Dire Condition While optimists may disagree with Schiff’s prediction, historical patterns point to a deeper decline in the Ethereum price. Peter Schiff argues that during the last market crash in mid-2022, Ethereum slipped below $1,000, noting that there is little evidence that the cryptocurrency will trade above the psychological level in the market downturn. He adds that while the Ethereum price is weak in dollar terms, the asset is faring worse on ETH/BTC charts. A steady downtrend on the ETH/BTC chart confirms massive selling pressure for the Ethereum price, with gold being its “worst-looking chart.” “It barely held $1,000 in June 2022,” said Schiff. “The chart is horrible, even worse priced in Bitcoin than dollars. Of course, its worst-looking chart is priced in gold.” Despite the dour predictions, investors say Ethereum price can rally as high as $4,000 but will have to contend with whale selloffs and market risk-on sentiment. Peter Schiff’s grim predictions extend to the top cryptocurrency with the economist tipping Bitcoin price to $10K . He went on to criticize claims of Bitcoin as digital gold, pointing to steep declines in the face of macroeconomic woes.

Earlier this month, Solana witnessed a major token unlock and whale sell-offs, which could have added to the selling pressure. How Worse Can It Get? Solana (SOL) is among the worst-affected cryptocurrencies following the latest crash of the digital asset market. Its price briefly collapsed below $100 for the first time since February 2024 before slightly rebounding to the current $101 (per CoinGecko’s data). SOL Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset’s major pullback comes less than three months after its all-time high of almost $290, registered shortly before Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States. The surge back then was partially fueled by the frenzy surrounding some Trump-themed meme coins, which are based on Solana’s blockchain. Ironically, the POTUS, or more specifically, the trade war he declared to the rest of the world, appears to be the main factor behind the recent bloodbath in the crypto market and SOL’s crash. Several renowned analysts noted the asset’s plunge, predicting further pain for the bulls in the short term. Ali Martinez believes SOL’s dive below $114 could be followed by a slump to as low as $60 . This would represent a roughly 40% decline from the current valuation. Another person, using the X moniker Crypto_Jobs, assumed that Solana could find a “key bottom level” at approximately $68-$70. SOL’s recent price decline coincides with a gradual decrease in the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem and its DEX volume. Those developments generally signal low user engagement, diminishing traders’ confidence, and lower liquidity. It is important to note that Solana’s TVL is measured in USD, meaning that if the price of the underlying token drops, the metric automatically goes down even if the same amount of SOL stays locked. DefiLlama’s data shows that the indicator hit an ATH of almost $12 billion at the end of January, while currently, it is less than $6 billion. The Retreat of the Whales Earlier this month, a total of $200 million worth of Solana tokens were unlocked, which, according to Arkham Intelligence, marked “the largest single-day unlock of staked SOL until 2028.” Prior to the event, some big investors unstaked and offloaded millions of assets. Those developments are typically considered bearish in the short term since they increase Solana’s circulating supply, which currently stands at over 515 million tokens. The whales’ actions could also spark panic in the community, prompting smaller investors to follow suit and further amplify the selling pressure.

Experienced Analyst Explained, Shared the Expected Bottom Level!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/has-bitcoin-survived-black-monday-experienced-analyst-explained-shared-the-expected-bottom-level/,"Tariff tensions fueled by US President Donald Trump have increased panic selling and negatively impacted Bitcoin and altcoins. Tariff tensions have caused panic, leading to massive sell-offs in stocks and cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin falling to a four-month low of $74,000. As the uneasy atmosphere in Bitcoin continues, CryptoQuant CEO warned investors by stating that the bull market in Bitcoin is over. At this point, a warning came from popular analyst Michael van de Poppe. Poppe stated that volatility in Bitcoin will increase in the coming days. The analyst also said that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $70,000 before rallying again. “Black Monday!” Poppe described the sharp decline in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market as “Black Monday.” The analyst warned investors that the next few weeks could be unpredictable and Bitcoin could face a major test by falling further from its current levels. Poppe added that despite the uncertainty in BTC, he sees the sharp correction as a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors. “Black Monday, Bitcoin is experiencing a return to the lows. In times of panic, it is difficult to predict how low we will fall. However, for recovery, we will expect: – Trump's delay of Tariffs (will not happen) – FED announces emergency meeting (may be in 1-2 weeks maximum) – Nothing for recovery and we will go down much more heavily. As a result, I think we will see Bitcoin testing the bottom levels and experiencing a fluctuation in the next 1-2 weeks. We can drop to $70,000 from these levels. Bitcoin is in a 30% correction from its ATH, so in 12-24 months you will be happy you bought at these levels.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Has Bitcoin Survived ""Black Monday""?

BlockDAG Explodes Raising $212M In Few Months,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-chainlink-holders-fear-crypto-crash-as-prices-drop-blockdag-explodes-raising-212m-in-few-months/,"In a market buzzing with narratives, three coins are grabbing attention for very different reasons. XRP is finally catching a bullish wind, riding on legal clarity and strong technicals, with projections aiming as high as $7. Chainlink, meanwhile, stands at a technical cliff—facing either a rebound to $19 or a freefall to $6. Yet neither coin has generated the sheer early-stage momentum of BlockDAG (BDAG) . With over $212 million raised, 10 confirmed exchange listings on the horizon, and a price already up 2,380% from presale batch one, BlockDAG is more than just hype. It’s a real utility project with testnet traction, miner rollouts, and full EVM compatibility. While XRP and LINK reflect market maturity and macro uncertainty, BDAG is still in launch mode—and might just be the most asymmetric bet on the table. Chainlink Teeters on $12—Will It Crash to $6 or Rebound to $19? Chainlink (LINK) has lost key support, falling below $13 and triggering fears of a deeper slide. The next critical level sits at $12, where long wicks suggest mixed sentiment. If LINK fails to hold above this zone, it could revisit $9.50, with further downside to $7.30 or even $6—the site of a massive 376 million LINK accumulation. Technical breakdowns and bearish sentiment dominate, with retail and institutional traders both showing strong pessimism. Yet, the $6.26 level has historically triggered buying, and a reversal here isn’t off the table. A rebound could push LINK to $15 or even $19, but only if momentum returns quickly. With nearly half of LINK holders currently at a loss, the next few moves could define whether this is a buying opportunity—or a signal to wait out more losses. XRP Crashes to 5-Month Low—Trump’s Tariffs Trigger Crypto Meltdown XRP has plunged 25% in the past month, hitting $1.67—its lowest level since November 2024. The drop follows U.S. President Trump’s aggressive tariff rollout, triggering fears of a global trade war. As stocks tank and investors flee risk assets, the crypto market is reeling, with over $47M in XRP liquidations and a broader $800B market wipeout. Analysts warn that if XRP fails to hold above $1.50, a slide to $1 is possible. The macro environment is crushing sentiment, with rising inflation fears and a flight to safer assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum also dropped sharply, dragging XRP with them due to their high correlation. Despite this panic, long-term XRP forecasts still range between $3 and $27 by 2025—but only if key support levels hold. BlockDAG’s Exchange Listings Could Trigger the Next Big Crypto Surge—Are You In Before the Jump? BlockDAG (BDAG) is on fire. With over $212 million raised and 19.1 billion coins sold during its presale, momentum is only building. Starting at $0.001 in Batch 1 and now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, early investors have already seen a massive 2,380% return. But what’s coming next could make this just the beginning. The real game-changer? BlockDAG’s confirmed plans to list on 10 major centralized exchanges (CEXs). Each listing means more liquidity, more exposure, and more volume. It’s not just about accessibility—it’s about accelerating demand. The first listing could spark interest, but by the tenth, BDAG could be trading at a completely different level. This isn’t hype—it’s strategy. Listings act as multipliers, pulling in new traders, strengthening the price floor, and drawing institutional eyes. Combined with a live beta testnet, weekly rewards, and an expanding user base, BDAG has all the signs of a breakout crypto. Analysts are already floating a $20 long-term target. If you’re still on the sidelines, the next price jump might leave you behind. With each CEX listing, BlockDAG isn’t just rising—it’s gaining momentum. Get in while it’s still early. Takeaway XRP appeals to institutional narratives, and Chainlink remains a core DeFi pillar—but both are established names contending with the weight of past cycles. BlockDAG, in contrast, is building from the ground up, stacking real milestones before hitting major exchanges. With a testnet already live, a user base surpassing 170,000 wallets, and over 19.1 billion coins sold, BDAG’s growth isn’t speculative—it’s structured. The coin’s unique DAG+PoW architecture solves legacy speed and cost issues, and upcoming CEX listings could send demand soaring. Analysts see a $20 long-term target, making its current $0.0248 price feel almost irrelevant in hindsight. As the market braces for the next bull wave, BlockDAG offers what others can’t: early access to real tech, real hype, and real upside. Miss this, and you may be left watching from the sidelines while BDAG becomes 2025’s breakout giant.

Cardano continued its methodical climb through technical upgrades, while Toncoin gained traction via Telegram-driven expansion. Still, BlockDAG managed to stand out—not just for its numbers, but for how it chose to communicate and deliver its message. Keynote 3 marked a turning point for BlockDAG. Drawing comparisons to Apple’s famous WWDC events, the presentation didn’t just offer project updates—it delivered perspective. As crypto continues its push toward mainstream adoption, execution is beginning to matter more than speculation—and BlockDAG leaned into that shift. ADA Moves Up 34.6% As Cardano Stays Focused on the Long Game Cardano (ADA) has continued its pattern of consistent, calculated growth into Q1 2025. On January 4th, its market cap stood at approximately $13 billion. By April 4th, that figure had reached $17.5 billion—an increase of $4.5 billion, reflecting a 34.6% gain. This rise has been supported by ongoing improvements to the network, steady progress in smart contract capabilities, and Cardano’s continued commitment to research-based development. Its eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake model and academic reputation continue to attract long-term believers, while a growing DeFi ecosystem and new cross-chain bridges signal that ADA is being positioned for broader adoption. Cardano’s performance shows that consistent development—not hype—can still move the needle. As the market recovers and tech evolves, Cardano appears ready for larger-scale enterprise and developer use. Toncoin’s 63.8% Jump Highlights Telegram’s Power in Crypto Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network, has been one of Q1’s top gainers. Starting the year with a $7.2 billion market cap, it reached $11.8 billion by April 4th—an increase of $4.6 billion, or 63.8%. A large part of that growth comes from its integration with Telegram, which now has more than 900 million active users. The addition of in-app wallets and Telegram mini apps helped drive usage and push TON into the spotlight. This performance underscores Toncoin’s unique approach: combining social messaging and blockchain into one seamless ecosystem. With rising community engagement and growing network activity, TON is making a case for itself as more than just another layer-1—it’s aiming to be a daily-use blockchain. Its growth over the quarter points to a strong start in 2025, with momentum that may carry further. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Shows Crypto May Be Entering a New Phase BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 wasn’t just a routine update—it was a reminder that crypto is evolving. Compared to tech industry events like Apple’s WWDC, this presentation felt well-thought-out and confident. From visuals to messaging, everything about the keynote suggested a project that’s not just building—but already delivering. For many, this marked a shift from vision to validation. The content itself reflected that too. The keynote covered the launch of a functioning testnet, improved transaction speed, an upgraded user interface, and growing community support. But what made it resonate was the delivery—it felt polished, structured, and forward-thinking. Rather than pushing potential, BlockDAG presented progress. Backing that up, the numbers speak clearly. BlockDAG has raised $212 million in its presale and is currently in batch 27 at $0.0248. More than 19.1 billion coins have been sold, and early adopters have already seen a 2,380% ROI since batch 1. These aren’t theoretical projections—they’re on-chain indicators of traction. Much like WWDC defines the next chapter for Apple, Keynote 3 gave BlockDAG a similar moment. It didn’t rely on promises or buzzwords. It showed tools already working and a direction already being followed. For those paying attention, this was less of a launch and more of a signal: BlockDAG isn’t just another project—it’s establishing itself as a platform for builders and users alike. Beyond Price: Why How You Grow Matters Gains are easy to measure, but the method behind them matters even more. Cardano’s steady rise and Toncoin’s sharp rally reflect two strong but very different paths. Yet, BlockDAG’s approach introduces something different—clarity, structure, and a commitment to delivering what’s been promised. Rather than selling features or chasing narratives, BlockDAG used Q1 to demonstrate what it can do—and how it thinks about the future. In a market that’s slowly shifting from hype to performance, BlockDAG’s message stood out: results speak louder than projections. As 2025 unfolds, it’s becoming clear that the market is beginning to value delivery over discussion. And so far, BlockDAG seems to be one of the few buildings with that in mind.

The lawsuit, filed in light of claims that the U.S. Government possesses knowledge regarding Nakamoto's identity, seeks to compel the government to disclose what it knows. This legal action highlights ongoing interest and speculation surrounding Nakamoto, whose identity has remained a mystery since Bitcoin's inception. The case adds to the broader discourse on cryptocurrency regulation and transparency in the United States. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

The cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $74,637, reflecting a broader downturn in financial markets as investors react to escalating trade tensions. The drop in Bitcoin's price comes as part of a wider sell-off across risk assets, with over $1.41 million in crypto positions liquidated in the past 24 hours. The decline follows Trump's announcement of a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, with higher rates targeted at specific countries, including a 34% tariff on Chinese goods and a 20% tariff on products from the European Union. Ether also fell to $1,446, marking an 18.5% decline over the past week.

In the last three months, BNB declined 13.5% while maintaining relevance within the Binance ecosystem. Solana dropped 33%, largely due to lingering uncertainty from FTX-linked holdings. Both moves reflect familiar patterns during broader corrections. BlockDAG , however, has taken a more proactive approach. Following Keynote 3, the project has transitioned from theory to application—launching a live testnet, delivering physical miners, and releasing a mobile app. Its ongoing crypto presale has reached $212 million, generating a 2,380% ROI for early adopters since batch 1. BNB (BNB): Holding Value While Navigating a 13.5% Price Drop BNB, the native token tied to Binance’s ecosystem, declined from $704.28 on January 1, 2025, to $610.11 by April 1—marking a 13.5% slide. This drop is in line with wider market trends and investor repositioning. Still, BNB maintains a significant presence with a market cap of $89.39 billion. Its value continues to be supported by its integration across Binance’s products and services. Analysts suggest that as long as BNB holds above the $500 mark, the token could find footing and potentially recover. For now, market participants are watching Binance’s platform developments and broader crypto sentiment to gauge its next move. Solana (SOL): A 33% Slide Reflects Market Pressure & Ecosystem Concerns Solana (SOL) saw sharper losses over the past quarter, falling from $188.87 on January 1 to $126.68 by April 1, representing a 33% drop. Contributing factors include general market volatility and concerns tied to the FTX bankruptcy, which raised fears about token sell-offs. Despite the price pressure, Solana still holds a solid market cap and remains a key platform for developers. Some analysts anticipate a recovery toward the $200 level, while others see the potential for further downside below $120. The outlook depends on how quickly network developments progress and whether broader market sentiment stabilizes. Keynote 3 Signals BlockDAG’s Shift From Plans to Performance In a space filled with big promises and delayed deliveries, BlockDAG used Keynote 3 to demonstrate actual results. Rather than outlining distant goals, the team showcased real progress—highlighting a running testnet, a live mobile app, and mining hardware already reaching users. The presale numbers reflect the response. BlockDAG has raised $212 million, now in batch 27 at $0.0248. With over 19.1 billion coins sold and a 2,380% ROI from batch 1, the project has moved beyond speculation and into verified traction. The X1 Miner App is already operational. The X30 and X100 miners are shipping. The Beta Testnet V1 is live. With more than 140,000 holders, the demand is clearly visible. Keynote 3 wasn’t just a presentation—it was proof. It redefined expectations around blockchain updates by leading with delivery. For many in the space, this moment marked a clear shift in how project credibility is earned. Execution Defines the Difference in 2025 BNB remains a reliable component of Binance’s utility offering, even after a 13.5% price adjustment. Solana, though still favored by builders, is navigating a 33% decline tied to external uncertainty. Both continue to play important roles, yet neither has reshaped what on-chain delivery looks like this year. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has used its Keynote 3 moment to display measurable progress. A live testnet, functional mining app, hardware deliveries, and 140,000+ holders—all achieved during an ongoing presale—are setting a different standard. With $212 million raised and 2,380% ROI since batch 1, BlockDAG is showing that in 2025, performance speaks louder than projection.

43040557,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=726467,1744045253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43040557.jpeg,Red Alert For Solana: 21% Price Drop Raises Fears Of Further Collapse,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-sees-21-price-drop/,"Solana has taken a sharp nosedive, losing nearly 22% of its value and trading around $98.09. This steep drop has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, sparking fears of an imminent larger breakdown. SOL is now flashing red across the board, with sellers firmly in control and bulls scrambling to defend critical levels. The decline highlights increasing bearish sentiment, likely fueled by technical breakdowns, weak market confidence, and rising concerns over broader economic trends. With the $100 psychological barrier now broken, all eyes are on the next key support zones. Is A Deeper Correction On The Horizon? In his recent post on X, King_Ab highlighted that Solana is currently trading around $98.09, marking a sharp 21.84% drop from its previous close. He further noted that the day’s trading session has been highly volatile, with SOL reaching a high of $120.07 and dipping as low as $98.06, underscoring the intense pressure in the market. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Freefall—Can It Hold Above The $100 Danger Zone? According to King_Ab, this substantial drop in Solana reflects the broader downturn witnessed across the cryptocurrency market over the past week. The decline isn’t isolated but rather part of a wider trend of risk-off sentiment as investors react to global macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting market dynamics. He pointed out that Solana’s market capitalization currently stands at approximately $51.15 billion, while its 24-hour trading volume hovers around $5.17 billion, indicating sustained trading activity despite the sharp correction. This combination of declining price and high volume could suggest either panic-driven sell-offs or aggressive repositioning by market participants Critical Support Breached: Can Solana Hold The Line Below $100? Solana’s drop below the key $100 mark signals a potential shift in momentum from bullish to bearish. This level has previously acted as a solid support zone, providing a bounce point during corrections. However, with the recent 21% decline, that line has been breached, and market sentiment is growing increasingly cautious. Related Reading: Solana Faces Defining Level At $120 – Will History Repeat? For SOL to regain its bullish momentum, it needs to swiftly reclaim and sustain levels above $100 to avoid further downside pressure. If this key level remains unheld, Solana might drop to the next support zone around $79.25. A break below this level could accelerate bearish sentiments, opening the door for an extended decline toward the $58.25 support area, where the bears may gain additional control. At this critical juncture, it’s essential to closely watch the price action for signs of stabilization or the risk of continued capitulation. As the bearish volume rises, Solana’s ability to reclaim the broken support level will likely dictate its short-term trajectory. Whether the price can recover above key levels will be a decisive factor in determining if the downtrend will persist or if a reversal is on the horizon.

Amid fears of a 1987-style black Monday crash, crypto’s total market cap sank roughly 10% to $2.44 trillion before a short-lived bounce on tariff delay hopes. Rumors of ongoing talks with 50+ trading partners offered brief relief, but the selloff quickly returned. Over the past 24 hours, more than $1.25 billion in long positions were wiped out, fueling a brutal $1.63 billion liquidation wave. Most of the damage came during the 12-hour window, where Longs took a massive $559 million hit. Market sentiment indicators were flashing red at press time, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sliding 10 points into extreme fear territory. The broader altcoin market mirrored Bitcoin’s downturn, with only a handful of the top 99 tokens returning to profitability by late Asian trading hours on Monday. Will Bitcoin price crash? Bitcoin failed to hold the crucial $80K support after the White House dismissed rumours of a 90-day delay in the new tariffs. The brief rally that followed the initial reports quickly faded, and BTC slid below $78K as sentiment turned sharply bearish, confirming that crypto markets remain highly reactive to global macro signals. QCP Capital, in a bulletin to its Telegram subscribers, said that markets are likely to stay nervous as global powers rush to position themselves in ongoing trade talks. The firm noted that uncertainty around tariff policy is driving investors to de-risk, with crypto taking a hit alongside traditional markets. They also pointed to recent remarks from the US president, who, despite expressing a desire to avoid market losses, indicated that “sometimes you have to take medicine.” According to QCP, this suggests the administration may be prepared to weather short-term economic pain to push through its trade agenda, raising the stakes for global markets and potentially dragging crypto lower if no progress is made in the coming days. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin has found some footing in the mid-$70,000 range, brushing close to its March 2024 all-time highs before stabilizing. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the recent lows weren’t random, and they lined up neatly with key cost-basis levels where large portions of BTC supply had previously changed hands. Glassnode pointed out that around 50,000 BTC were last moved near $74.2K, forming the first major supply cluster below $80K. This zone is mostly held by investors who had been steadily raising their cost basis until 10 March and have remained inactive since, which indicates they’re likely long-term holders. Below that, on-chain data shows additional support between the recent lows and the $70,000 mark, with approximately 175,000 BTC concentrated in this zone. The largest cost basis clusters were identified at $71,600, holding around 41,000 BTC, and $69,900, where roughly 68,000 BTC are held. At press time, Bitcoin was consolidating just above these levels, suggesting that long-term holders may be stepping in to absorb selling pressure. According to crypto analyst Ted, for a relief rally to transpire, Bitcoin needs to reclaim its weekly 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically marked the dividing line between bullish and bearish momentum. Source: Ted on X At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $78,468, just above the 50-EMA. The reclaim, if confirmed, could serve as a short-term bullish signal, potentially triggering a relief rally as confidence begins to creep back into the market. However, Ted warned that if BTC fails to hold this level, the door remains open for a drop toward $69,000–$70,000. Altcoins caught in the fallout In the last 24 hours, the altcoin market cap has dropped 4%, sitting at around $1.03 billion at the time of writing. This sharp pullback coincided with a weak reading of 16 on the Altcoin Season Index, meaning only 16 of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past three months. Ethereum (ETH), the biggest altcoin by market cap, took a serious hit, falling 11.36% in a single day. Other heavy hitters like XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) weren’t spared either, logging losses between 7% and 10%. Even in the sea of red, a few outliers stood their ground. SPX6900 (SPX) was the only token in the top 99 to notch double-digit gains, defying the broader market meltdown. Meanwhile, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Four (FORM) managed to post modest gains. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Weighing in on the situation, Ming Wu, CEO of Rabbit, X told Invezz that the steep drop isn’t just a crypto story; it’s part of a broader macro storm. “With Trump reintroducing global tariffs, markets were already jittery,” he said. “Stock markets crashed across several trading sessions, and because crypto trades 24/7, altcoins were quickly caught in the fallout.” He added that these tokens are among the most liquid speculative assets, which makes them extra vulnerable in times of panic. Komodo CTO Kadan Stadelmann also shared his thoughts, saying that altcoins are particularly unproven during periods of quantitative tightening, unlike the bull runs we’ve seen during looser monetary policy. “Altcoins thrived in the easy money era,” he said. “But in a risk-off environment, with higher rates and tighter liquidity, they’re struggling to show real resilience.” The post Crypto prices today: Bitcoin steadies around $78K amid major liquidations; SPX6900 leads top altcoins appeared first on Invezz",Altcoins|Crypto|Bitcoin|Donald Trump|USA,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-04-07 17:02:58

To read full editions, subscribe . When Trump said “tariff” was the most beautiful word in the dictionary, he neglected to mention that beauty is subjective. Since Trump’s “reciprocal” tariff announcements on April 2, the S&P 500 is down about 10.6%. Even gold, typically considered to be uncorrelated with equities, took about a 6.4% dive on the tariff news. Crypto markets held up over the weekend, much to everyone’s surprise. Many theories were offered for explanation. Some suggested crypto assets showed resistance on anticipated rate cuts and quantitative easing; some said the equities selloff on Friday was simply institutional outflows; and Galaxy’s Alex Thorn posited that BTC was simply “ tariff-proof .” Yet, after this brief flirtation with the idea that crypto assets would decouple from equity markets, it turned out to be pure hopium. As the weekend drew to a close, bitcoin took a 6% nosedive on noon Sunday from $82.5k to its current trading levels of $77.2k. In the same time period, ETH took a harder tumble of 15.7%. Down, but not a panic yet, according to CF Benchmarks’ head of product Thomas Erdösi. He notes that “CME basis remains firm above 6%, and the demand for downside protection, as seen in the 25-delta skew, underscores cautious sentiment without signaling panic.” Total crypto market cap wiped thus far? About $0.23 trillion, or 8.6%. At bitcoin’s current price of $77k, that is about a steep 27.2% drawdown from January’s all time-highs of $106k, but still a relatively light drawdown compared to past years. The pink part of the Glassnode chart demonstrates yesterday’s drawdown relative to the last cycle. Based on CoinGlass data , total estimated liquidations of crypto assets in the last 24 hours equaled to about $1.42 billion. BTC saw about $479 million while ETH saw $418 million in liquidations. On the April 6 and 7, Aave v3 on Ethereum saw a total $91.85 million in liquidations and accumulated zero bad debt, based on Blockanalitica data . It wouldn’t be crypto if you weren’t looking for opportunities in a downturn. Based on the four-hour chart of CoinGlass’ relative strength index (RSI) heatmap, notable tokens in the $400-$500 million market cap range showing relative strength include the AI memecoin FART (RSI: 51), the DePIN token GRASS (RSI: 54) and the DeFi token PENDLE (RSI: 47). All three tokens are trading within the neutral RSI band, outperforming a broader market skewed toward oversold conditions. This may suggest bullish upward momentum as these tokens diverge from downside pressure everywhere else. Get the news in your inbox.

The observation highlighted by well-followed market analyst Merlijn The Trader on X is now gaining traction as a textbook example of what seasoned traders refer to as a “top signal.” Ethereum has dumped 51% since @EricTrump said it was a “great time” to buy. The top signal was presidential. pic.twitter.com/oWGXODUNcc — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) April 7, 2025 The Presidential Endorsement That Marked the Peak Eric Trump’s enthusiastic commentary on Ethereum came during a period of elevated optimism across the cryptocurrency sector. His statement, though not anchored in any clear technical or macroeconomic analysis, appeared to reflect a broader sentiment-driven endorsement of digital assets. For many retail investors, hearing such bullishness from a public figure associated with political influence and wealth may have felt like a green light to enter or double down on positions. However, as Merlijn The Trader has pointed out, the timing could not have been worse. Since Trump’s proclamation, Ethereum has steadily declined, shedding more than half its market value. The 51% drop is not only significant in terms of price action but also emblematic of how emotionally driven market entries — particularly those triggered by non-specialist endorsements — can coincide with market tops rather than sustainable entry points. The Psychology of Top Signals In financial circles, especially among contrarian and technical analysts, public endorsements by high-profile individuals — particularly those not deeply embedded in financial markets — are often viewed as lagging indicators. These “top signals” typically emerge after a strong rally, when the media frenzy and public excitement have reached a peak. By the time public figures begin touting an asset, seasoned investors have often already started to exit. This psychological cycle of euphoria and distribution is well-documented in market theory and has played out repeatedly in the history of crypto assets, from the 2017 ICO boom to more recent meme coin manias. Eric Trump’s Ethereum moment may now be remembered in a similar light — a sign not of a promising entry but of an overheated market ripe for correction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s Technical Breakdown Since that fateful endorsement, Ethereum has broken below multiple key support levels. The decline has erased a substantial portion of its earlier gains and is testing investor conviction at current levels. Traders are closely watching for signs of capitulation or structural bottoming, but as of now, bearish momentum remains in play. Macro factors have not been favorable either. With regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s potential classification as a security in the U.S., sluggish institutional flows compared to Bitcoin, and rising competition from newer smart contract platforms, ETH has struggled to regain bullish traction. A Lesson in Market Timing The Ethereum drop serves as a stark reminder of the risks tied to market timing — especially when that timing is influenced by celebrity or politically-adjacent commentary. While public endorsements can drive short-term sentiment, they rarely align with sound technical or macro analysis. In this case, what appeared to be a casual, bullish comment from Eric Trump now marks what many traders regard as the local top for Ethereum. Merlijn The Trader’s assessment, rooted in market behavior and historical pattern recognition, resonates with experienced investors who understand the cyclical nature of crypto volatility. As Ethereum seeks to stabilize and potentially reclaim its bullish structure in the future, this episode may serve as yet another chapter in the ever-evolving story of hype cycles, human psychology, and financial markets.

The global markets faced a dreadful weekend following Trump’s Liberation Day. The global crypto market cap plunged by over $300 billion but with the beginning of the American trading session, things seem to have turned in favor of the bulls. Bitcoin price reclaims $78,000 while Solana climbs above $100 after marking lows around $95. This suggests the traders utilized the buy-the-dip opportunity, which could pave the way for a decent recovery. Solana price has been facing massive upward pressure since the start of the year that has dragged the price lower by more than 60%. The token formed constant lower highs and lows, hinting towards the bears holding a tight grip over the rally. In such a scenario, a slight rise in the price may not be considered as a rise above the bearish influence until the pivotal resistance is secured. Presently, the SOL price is juggling at a threshold, and hence a slight drop below the range could squash the bullish possibilities. The bears dragged the price below the crucial support levels but the bulls have managed to lift the levels within the range. Despite this, the bearish impact on the rally continues to persist as the Ichimoku cloud has not confirmed a bullish reversal, as the base line and conversion line continue to descend. Meanwhile, the RSI is trying for a rebound, which is yet to be validated and once done, the rebound could be confirmed. In case of a rebound, the SOL price is required to rise to secure levels above $118, which could squash the bearish possibilities. Otherwise, the possibility of a continued descending trend may drag the levels to the 2024 lows below $80. However, one of the smartest plays during this sell-off is to accumulate a Solana position in anticipation of the SOL ETF later this year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 17:12:04

Larry Fink says it’ll only get worse",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-stock-market-makes-history-sp-500-bottom/,"The US stock market just broke every known rule of trading, economics, and logic—live on Monday morning. Wall Street kicked off with a meltdown after President Donald Trump pushed higher tariffs across major trading partners, triggering full-blown panic. By the time the dust settled, $3 trillion in market cap had vanished in under 30 minutes. This is the first time in history traders watched that kind of money appear and disappear faster than a crypto rug pull. Trump opened the week by warning of even more aggressive tariff hikes against China on Truth Social, as the two countries escalated threats. That came right after the administration rolled out sweeping new tariffs that already hammered global trade and sent shockwaves through every asset class. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, dragging it nearly 20% down from its February high, putting it squarely inside bear market territory. That drop erased almost everything investors gained in the last year. Stock heat map. Source: TradingView White House rumor sparks $3 trillion rally, then crash The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 755 points, a 2% drop that followed two straight 1,500-point collapses last week—the worst back-to-back hits in history. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2% as investors dumped tech stocks to raise cash. It’s now 24% below its previous record. For a moment this morning, it looked like things were turning around. A fake headline did that. At 10:10 AM ET, word started spreading that the White House might approve a 90-day tariff pause. Five minutes later, CNBC reported Trump was weighing that pause for every country except China. At 10:18 AM ET, the S&P 500 surged, gaining $3 trillion in value in just eight minutes. That gain was entirely based on nothing real. At 10:25 AM ET, someone inside the administration told CNBC they didn’t know where the rumor came from. One minute later, CNBC walked back the headline. At 10:34 AM ET, the White House officially called the story “fake news.” By 10:40 AM ET, the S&P 500 had dumped $2.5 trillion of the value it had just gained. That 30-minute swing broke records and left traders scrambling. Never before has Wall Street seen that much capital whip around off the back of pure rumor. Traders turn to moving average while Larry Fink calls recession While the market kept bleeding, traders started looking for any level that could stop the drop. Jonathan Krinsky, head market technician at BTIG, told CNBC that the S&P 500’s 200-week moving average—currently sitting at 4,674—could be the bottom. That’s 8% below where the index closed Friday. If it crashes through that level, it’ll wipe out all of last year’s gains and return the index to 2023 territory, when it ended the year at 4,769. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, told the Economic Club of New York that CEOs across industries already see the US as being deep in recession. “The canary is sick,” Fink said, warning he wouldn’t rule out another 20% crash from here. That wasn’t optimism—it was a flat report. Fink added that the current climate still offers long-term opportunities, but only for those who can afford to sit through hell. Larry also called out Washington’s failure to deliver the growth agenda it promised, saying the Trump administration needed to follow through with tax reform, reduced regulation, and faster approval for infrastructure projects. Those were the things he said would put pressure on the economy to actually grow, rather than just bounce off panic cycles. During his interview with Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker, Larry said, “The economy is weakening as we speak.” He said people don’t realize how tariffs hit regular Americans. “Most Americans don’t understand the extent to which tariffs are going to affect them,” Larry said. He added that 62% of Americans own equities, which means most people are directly exposed to this chaos whether they know it or not. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Its 3.0 upgrade gave the protocol a fresh burn model tied directly to activity—meaning more action equals more deflationary pressure. But what really sets Injective apart is its TradFi Index, mimicking the S&P 500 in a fully decentralized way. The AI Index Perpetual Market lets crypto buyers ride the wave of AI-sector growth, tracking popular AI stocks and tokens in one smooth play. Injective is building where real-world demand meets on-chain possibility—something most projects just promise but don’t deliver. Then there’s Arweave, quietly becoming the backbone of blockchain data storage. Unlike AWS or Google Cloud, Arweave gives users the chance to store files permanently with a one-time payment. Whether it’s NFT metadata, historical legal records, or mission-critical archives, Arweave doesn’t blink. Major names like Solana and Meta have already tapped into its power for long-term digital preservation. It’s not hype—it’s working infrastructure. And as demand for decentralized, permanent data storage balloons, Arweave’s role in Web3 gets even more vital. But here’s where the spotlight shifts: Qubetics. While other chains try to bolt on features after launch, Qubetics is purpose-built to fill the cracks the others left wide open. Its protocol isn’t just about decentralization—it’s about real-world tools. From a seamless multi-chain wallet to its decentralized VPN and tokenization features, this one doesn’t just check boxes. It actually fits into the daily grind of North American professionals, small businesses, and everyday users. That’s why it’s becoming one of the best crypto for beginners to start with in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN, Real-World Tools, and High ROI Potential What makes Qubetics stand out for beginners? It’s usable from day one. The decentralized VPN built into the Qubetics ecosystem means users don’t have to rely on centralized, snoop-prone services to protect their identity. Whether it’s a freelancer in Austin, a startup in Vancouver, or a remote team in Portland—Qubetics helps them operate with privacy, security, and freedom. This VPN is woven directly into the Qubetics protocol, ensuring low-latency access and encrypted channels across multiple chains. For everyday users, this means faster, safer online activity without worrying about data breaches or location restrictions. For businesses, it’s a no-brainer alternative to expensive and unreliable VPN providers. And for crypto buyers looking for utility-backed tokens, this is exactly the kind of infrastructure that adds real value beyond speculation. Beyond the VPN, Qubetics also packs a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, easy tokenization tools, and native interoperability—making it a one-stop solution for beginners looking to explore the blockchain ecosystem without getting wrecked by complexity. Qubetics Presale Status and ROI Breakdown Qubetics is currently in Stage 29 of its presale. With over 506 million tokens sold to more than 24,400 holders , the presale has already brought in $15.9 million in funding. Tokens are now available at $0.1573 , and that still leaves serious room for new entries. Those who jumped in at Stage 1 paid just $0.01 —and they’re sitting on a staggering 1473% return . That’s not hype. That’s math. But this isn’t just a look-back story. Based on current entry points, analysts estimate that if $TICS hits $1 post-presale , buyers entering now could realize a 535% ROI . At $5 , that jumps to 3078% . A move to $6 would result in a 3713% ROI . And if Qubetics climbs to $10–$15 after its mainnet launch , current buyers could see returns between 6256% and 9434% . That kind of upside, combined with practical, working tools, is exactly why it’s being called the best crypto presale of the year. It’s not about chasing moonshots. It’s about getting in on solid tech with long-term application—and doing it before the crowd catches on. Arweave (AR): Pay Once, Store Forever Arweave’s not trying to be flashy. It’s trying to be forever. That’s the whole premise— permanent, decentralized storage . And for newcomers to crypto, this makes Arweave one of the best crypto for beginners who want real-world applications baked into the token’s value. Most cloud storage platforms make users pay monthly or annually, plus they control access. Arweave flips that script. You pay once, and your data stays up, immutable, and accessible for life. This is especially useful for NFTs, legal archives, research data, or anything that shouldn’t ever disappear. It’s no accident that Solana and Meta use Arweave under the hood. It’s dependable, scalable, and perfectly aligned with Web3 values. For anyone stepping into crypto looking for utility rather than hype, AR is a strong pick. It’s easy to understand, even easier to use, and it sits at the heart of the blockchain’s long-term storage problem. Injective (INJ): Traditional Markets Meet On-Chain AI Injective is the protocol for those who want traditional market exposure without stepping off-chain. That makes it an excellent fit for beginners who want to ease into crypto while still recognizing familiar formats. With its AI Index Perpetual Market , users get access to top-performing AI-related assets—all tradable on-chain. Want a basket of trending tech tokens in a single tap? Injective already built it. Add in its TradFi Index , which mimics the performance of the S&P 500, and now users can get exposure to legacy markets directly from a decentralized exchange. This breaks down a huge barrier for crypto beginners: the gap between what they know (stocks) and what they want to learn (crypto). Injective bridges that without dumbing anything down. With its upgraded token burn model from the 3.0 update and institutional attention building, INJ is more than DeFi hype—it’s a long-term protocol with deep roots in real-world financial strategy. That’s what makes it one of the best crypto for beginners exploring the decentralized finance landscape. Final Thoughts Starting out in crypto doesn’t have to feel like jumping into a hurricane. Projects like Qubetics, Arweave, and Injective offer smart, structured ways to enter the space—without compromising on long-term potential. Each one delivers clear utility, simplified access, and community momentum that even newcomers can feel confident backing. But Qubetics is the one that’s turning heads right now. With a live presale, rising community numbers, real-world tools like a decentralized VPN, and ROI figures that speak for themselves, it’s hard to ignore. There’s still time to enter the presale, and those who move now could be setting themselves up for a powerful entry into the crypto scene. For anyone looking for the best crypto for beginners , these three aren’t just smart bets—they’re blueprints for how blockchain tech should actually work.

The pullback saw the S&P 500 drop 2.79%, with the index officially entering a bear market, following a 20% decline from its recent all-time highs. However, the SPX momentarily rallied by 6% after a rumor began to spread on X that US President Donald Trump was contemplating a 90-day tariff pause. Bitcoin (BTC) price also rallied above $80,000, but after 30 minutes of positive price action, the White House confirmed that the rumor was not true. Source: X The S&P 500 is currently in positive territory for the day. Still, despite this uptick, the sustainability of the recovery remains uncertain as bearish undercurrents remain the same as before the tariff-pause rumor started to circulate. In Asia trading sessions, where economies heavily depend on favorable global trade, stock markets plummeted. Hong Kong's equity index suffered a staggering 13% drop, marking its worst performance since the Asian financial crisis. Major indexes in Shanghai, Taipei, and Tokyo also saw sharp declines, ranging from 7% to 10%. In fact, the Nikkei 22 futures suspended trading after it hit circuit breakers during its session. Tensions continued to escalate between the US and China after President Trump confirmed an additional 50% tariff on Chinese exports on April 9 if the country did not withdraw its initial 34% tariffs on the US by April 8.

This is Bitcoin’s lowest price since Nov. 7, with speculators expecting further drawdowns in the charts. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, said, “Don't catch the falling knife. Conditions have not improved for Bitcoin yet. Only one bull signal is on in the Bull Score Index.” On a positive note, Glassnode data revealed that BTC whales (holding over 10,000 BTC) are intensifying accumulation while smaller holders continue to distribute. The Accumulation Trend Score for whales briefly hit a perfect 1.0 around April 1, reflecting a 15-day buying spree—the most significant since late August 2024.

Meanwhile, cohorts holding less than 1 BTC to 100 BTC have shifted to distribution, with scores dropping to 0.1–0.2 for most of 2025. This trend aligns with Bitcoin finding support at $74,000, a level backed by over 50,000 BTC held by investors dormant since March 10. Meanwhile, Axel Adler Jr., a Bitcoin researcher, also pointed out that the supply dynamics metric indicates that the new Bitcoin supply is currently outpacing the annual change in active coins. A positive uptick indicates growing demand or accumulation in the market, and historically, such increases in this metric have coincided with Bitcoin price recoveries.

More and more crypto enthusiasts are doubling down on their investments, sensing an explosive growth opportunity. The buzz around MUTM predictions show the token could surge a staggering 43x post-launch, potentially reaching $1.08 in the near future. Investors searching for the next big crypto opportunity are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-rising altcoin gaining serious momentum. Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum in its recently launched presale. The presale is now in phase 4 after selling out the third one faster than expected. Over $6.3 million has been raised, attracting more than 7900 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.025 before the price jumps 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Those buying today are set for a 140% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its cutting-edge dual-lending model, which has driven rapid adoption. With over 7900 investors contributing $6.3 million during the presale, confidence in the project continues to grow. Currently trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, the price is set for a 20% jump in Phase 5, giving investors an opportunity for significant gains. Combining high market demand with unique lending mechanics, analysts see MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to surpass $1 post-launch. Mutuum Finance makes its lending platform stand out because it unites both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users participating in P2C model liquidity pools can obtain passive income through smart contract-based automated USDT lending operations. Users who select P2P transactions handle their money directly through peer-to-peer deals which bypass financial institutions. Mutuum Finance combines P2C and P2P models to create features which improve protection along with efficiency and decentralization and thus aligns well with DeFi investors who want yield-bearing alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem As proof of its commitment to stability, Mutuum Finance is issuing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins, which have been criticized for potentially leading to insolvency, this token will be over-collateralized to minimize risk and make it trustworthy in the long term. Combined with open financial architectures and audited smart contracts, this architecture increases investor trust while filling the biggest gaps seen in past DeFi projects. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community The company makes continuous community expansion possible through generous rewards programs. The giveaway provides 10 lucky winners with MUTM tokens worth $10,000 from a million-dollar fund and the referral program compensates users for referring new investors. Platform users who join at an early stage get premium staking pools alongside governance power along with exclusive updates while continuing their relationship with the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Tokenomics mechanisms of the project create controlled distribution and maintain lasting value growth. The presale token distribution limitation together with deflationary mechanisms enables Mutuum Finance to maintain token scarcity that might fuel price elevation. Through its staking system the project offers valuable benefits which motivate constant user engagement while supporting the token’s continuous development throughout the system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, with a unique hybrid lending model and strong market demand. Having already raised over $6.3 million and attracted more than 7,900 investors during its presale, the platform’s momentum is undeniable. For those looking to capitalize on this emerging opportunity, now is the time to get involved. Don’t miss your chance to invest today and become a part of the future of decentralized finance with Mutuum Finance.

With President Donald Trump’s return to office in January, sweeping new tariffs have shaken global markets and reignited fears of a full-blown trade war. President Trump’s new set of tariffs, announced after markets closed on April 2, has raised U.S. import taxes to levels not seen since the Great Depression—specifically, to about the same high levels as those set by the controversial Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of the 1930s. The latest insights shared with Finbold on April 7 from Binance Research reveal that crypto has lost $1 trillion in market value since the first round of U.S. tariff announcements, with total capitalization plunging 25.9% from its January highs. As global trading partners respond with retaliatory measures and investors flee risk assets, the crypto sector has borne the brunt of the uncertainty, with sentiment slipping and capital rotating into traditional safe havens. Capital flees crypto as risk-off sentiment intensifies The tariff shock has sparked a broad risk-off reaction in financial markets. Both crypto and equities have slid into correction territory, while traditional safe havens like gold have rallied . Since the first tariff shock, the S&P 500 is down 17.1%, while gold has surged 10.3%, breaking successive all-time highs as investors seek refuge from economic instability. Crypto markets, however, have borne the brunt of investor flight. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 19.1%, but losses have been far more severe in the altcoin space. Altcoins suffer deeper losses than Bitcoin as tariff-driven fears hit crypto markets. Source: Binance Research Ethereum ( ETH ), the second-largest digital asset, has plummeted 44.1%. High-beta categories such as memecoins and artificial intelligence tokens have suffered steep declines of 58.1% and 52.5%, respectively. Gaming and Layer 2 tokens have dropped around 50%, while DeFi tokens are down 31.9%. This widespread sell-off has erased early-year gains across much of the crypto market and pushed Bitcoin into negative territory for the year—despite a strong performance in 2024. Institutional confidence weakens The downturn is also being reflected in institutional sentiment. A recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey shows that only 3% of fund managers currently favor Bitcoin in the context of a trade war, compared to 58% who prefer gold. Just 3% of investors prefer Bitcoin in a trade war scenario . Source: Binance Research Volatility has surged as well. Bitcoin’s one-month realized volatility rose above 70%, and Ethereum’s spiked past 100% in the wake of the tariff news. As liquidity tightens and risk aversion grows, crypto’s narrative as a hedge against economic uncertainty is being called into question. For now, it appears that investors are prioritizing capital preservation—and crypto is no longer at the top of their list.

While time machines don’t exist, opportunities like that still do. The crypto space is filled with hidden gems that have yet to make headlines, but once they do, their prices could skyrocket. The trick is knowing which tokens have real-world utility, solid technology, and strong community backing—before the rest of the market catches on. With 2025 on the horizon, some projects are positioning themselves as the next big thing, and those who act early could be in for massive returns. One standout in this category is Qubetics ($TICS), an innovative Web3 aggregator set to disrupt the blockchain landscape. With its best crypto presale already raising over $15.8 million and its price increasing every week, early adopters are locking in their positions before it's too late. But Qubetics isn’t the only project showing massive potential. Gala (GALA) is leading the charge in blockchain gaming, while Astra (ASTRA) is making waves with its AI-powered DeFi solutions. These three projects are among the best cryptos to buy for 2025, and here’s why they won’t stay under the radar for long. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): How it Makes Cross-Border Payments Instant and Hassle-Free The Qubetics Network is offering a powerful new solution for making international payments way faster and smoother. Right now, transferring money across countries can be slow and messy, with tons of red tape and hidden costs. But Qubetics flips that whole system. By teaming up with banks and financial institutions, it uses blockchain tech to move funds in near real-time—no long waiting periods, no unnecessary fees, and way more transparency. This kind of speed and simplicity is a huge win, especially in a world where businesses and people need instant access to money across borders. Let’s say a U.S.-based export company needs to pay a manufacturer in Vietnam within hours to keep production running. With traditional systems, that transfer might take days, delaying shipments and causing stress. But with Qubetics, the payment could be completed in minutes, helping the company stay on schedule and keeping their partners happy. On the personal side, think of someone sending money back home to their family overseas. Instead of waiting days for a remittance to land, the funds arrive instantly—no hassle, no high transfer fees. The Qubetics presale is another reason why this token is making waves. Currently in its 28th stage, the token price is $0.1430, with over 506 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 24,300 holders already onboard. Every Sunday at midnight, the price increases by 10%, making early entry crucial. Those who secure their tokens now could see incredible returns, especially considering the ROI projections. But the real potential comes after launch—$TICS hitting $1 means 599.21% ROI, while a $5 valuation shoots that up to 3,396.06%. At $10 post-mainnet launch, early adopters could see 6,892.12% ROI, and if it climbs to $15, that’s a staggering 10,388.18% return. For example, a $1,000 investment at the current price would yield approximately 6,990 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $10 post-launch, that initial $1,000 would be worth nearly $69,900—a life-changing gain. And with the Qubetics mainnet launching in Q2 2025, the timeline for these returns isn’t far off. This is why early participants are securing their positions now. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s the backbone of a more connected blockchain ecosystem. Its best crypto presale has already raised millions, and its real-world application makes it a long-term contender. With a growing community and a time-sensitive price increase every week, this is easily one of the best cryptos to buy for 2025 before it hits mainstream attention. 2. Gala (GALA): The Future of Blockchain Gaming Blockchain gaming has been on the rise, but many projects struggle with scalability, sustainability, and real player ownership. Gala is tackling these issues head-on by creating a decentralized gaming ecosystem where players truly own their in-game assets. Unlike traditional gaming platforms that lock items behind centralized servers, Gala's blockchain technology ensures that every item, skin, and character belongs to the player—not the game developer. Major gaming studios have started integrating blockchain into their models, and Gala is leading this shift. It has already launched GalaChain, its own blockchain dedicated to gaming, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency. With partnerships expanding and AAA-quality games in development, Gala is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 gaming. The recent introduction of Gala Film and Gala Music further strengthens its ecosystem, providing new revenue streams beyond gaming. The growing adoption of blockchain gaming means tokens like GALA could see significant demand. With more games launching on GalaChain and player numbers rising, the token’s utility will expand beyond simple transactions. As blockchain gaming moves into mainstream entertainment, Gala’s dominance in the space makes it an attractive long-term hold. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Gala is bridging the gap between traditional gaming and Web3, ensuring players have full control over their assets. With its expanding ecosystem and industry-first initiatives, it’s well on track to becoming a leader in blockchain entertainment. Those looking for exposure to the gaming revolution should keep this token on their radar. 3. Astra (ASTRA): AI-Powered DeFi at Its Finest Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is evolving fast, and Astra is at the forefront of the next major shift—AI-powered finance. Traditional DeFi platforms often require manual intervention for staking, lending, and yield farming, but Astra changes the game with self-optimizing DeFi strategies powered by AI. This allows participants to maximize their earnings with minimal effort, making DeFi more accessible to the masses. One of Astra’s standout features is its smart yield optimization, which continuously scans DeFi protocols to find the highest returns for stakers and liquidity providers. This eliminates the need for manual research and portfolio adjustments, giving users an effortless way to grow their holdings. Businesses and institutional players are also taking notice, with Astra providing AI-driven financial tools that automate investment strategies. Astra’s commitment to security and efficiency makes it one of the most promising projects in DeFi. With partnerships forming and real-world use cases expanding, it’s only a matter of time before Astra gains mainstream attention. Those who get in before this happens could see significant returns as AI-driven finance takes over the DeFi sector. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Astra is bringing AI-powered automation to DeFi, making it easier and more profitable for users to navigate decentralized finance. As AI integration becomes a staple in Web3, Astra’s potential to disrupt the industry makes it one of the best cryptos to buy for 2025 before the rest of the world catches on. The Clock is Ticking—Don’t Miss Out on These Best Cryptos to Buy For 2025 Opportunities like these don’t come often. Qubetics, Gala, and Astra are more than just tokens—they are pioneers in their respective fields, bringing real innovation to Web3.

Speaking publicly after the dramatic 20% drop in markets in just three days, Fink confirmed the shockwaves that hit investors. “I see this as a buying opportunity rather than a selling opportunity,” Fink said. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t go lower.” “We are probably in a recession right now,” Fink said, noting the compounding pressures from both monetary policy uncertainty and inflation risks stemming from recent White House decisions.

He noted that inflationary pressure is higher than market participants expect and that many already believe the U.S. to be in a recession. As a result, he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. Last month, Fink published a letter to shareholders, warning about Bitcoin’s (BTC) threat to the U.S. dollar, which could weaken if Americans believe the cryptocurrency to be a safer asset than the dollar. Markets, including the crypto market, have been in turmoil since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a host of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. BTC is currently trading 5% lower over the past five days and 11% lower in the past month.

This drop in investment happened because of worries over new U.S. trade tariffs , which caused uncertainty in the financial markets. However, despite the outflows, the overall value of crypto assets remained stable. This shows that the digital asset market is stronger than many might think. Bitcoin Saw the Biggest Outflow Bitcoin (BTC) saw the biggest outflow, with $207 million withdrawn from Bitcoin-focused investments, reducing this year’s total inflows to $1.3 billion. Ethereum (ETH) saw $37.7 million in outflows, and Solana (SOL) and Sui lost $1.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Toncoin (TON) saw a small inflow of $1.1 million. Regionally, the U.S. led the outflows with $210 million, followed by Germany at $17.7 million, but Canada and Brazil saw inflows of $4.8 million and $1.4 million. Despite these outflows, the total value of crypto assets grew slightly by 0.8%, reaching $132.6 billion. This shows resilience compared to traditional investments like global stocks, which fell by 8.5%. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted that the slight increase in AUM shows digital assets’ strength. This is despite the economic uncertainty caused by tariff issues. Tariff Worries Trigger a Market Sell-Off The big drop in global crypto funds happened after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on U.S. trading partners. This created fear in financial markets, causing many investors to sell their assets, including cryptocurrencies. As a result, Bitcoin lost more than 6% of its value in the past week. However, some experts believe this is just a normal market reaction and not a sign of deeper problems within the crypto industry. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, pointed out that the market is going through typical ups and downs. He added that the crypto sector is much stronger now than in previous downturns. Kazmierczak also mentioned that the crypto industry has grown with more solid infrastructure and real-world use cases. This helps it stay resilient even during times of economic uncertainty. Blockchain Crypto Funds Gain Momentum While the broader crypto market faced some challenges, blockchain-related stocks did better. CoinShares reported $8 million in inflows into blockchain stocks for the second week. This marks a positive trend for blockchain companies like Coinbase, which have faced challenges in recent months . Kazmierczak pointed out that experienced investors are taking advantage of lower prices to buy shares in blockchain companies. They see this as a chance to invest while the market is down. This shows that, even though the crypto market faces some tough moments, investors still see value in blockchain technology.

Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency touched a daily low of $0.5817 and a high of $0.6995, indicating sharp volatility. The token, built on the Ethereum blockchain, is seeing active trading across several major platforms, with on-chain data tracked via Etherscan.io . Its smart contract address on Ethereum ends in 318753, confirming its authenticity for cross-checking. The current rating stands at 4.3 out of 5, signaling strong user interest and moderate confidence from the community. According to CoinMarketCap, the platform only considers WLD tokens on Ethereum under its “Addresses by Holdings” metric, excluding Optimism and World Chain tokens from its data scope. The WLD to USD converter confirms the token’s live value at $0.65 per unit, supporting the displayed real-time rate. The token has recently shown considerable intraday volatility, which could be linked to broader market corrections or profit-taking pressure following brief upward momentum. Community activity remains strong across socials like Discord, X (Twitter), and GitHub, suggesting continued engagement despite the downturn. Worldcoin Daily Chart: WLD rejected at $0.675, downtrend holds The daily chart shows WLD opened near $0.6982, followed by a steady decline in the early hours. A sharp dip occurred during the night session, dragging the price down below $0.60, where it established temporary support at $0.5817. This area marked the lowest point within the past 24 hours. Volume started to build gradually afterward, with minor pullbacks forming a rounded bottom pattern around $0.60. ETH/USD 1-day price chart Midday trading saw a brief consolidation between $0.615 and $0.625, suggesting short-term accumulation. A visible spike near $0.68 occurred late in the session, likely driven by speculative buying or stop-loss triggers being hit. However, the price quickly rejected that level, indicating resistance. The current price of $0.6501 places the token below key resistance near $0.675, with buyers attempting to regain control. The lower shadow in the candle wick below $0.59 signifies buying pressure at discounted prices, but momentum has yet to follow through convincingly. 4-hour analysis: WLD struggles at key resistance as bearish momentum builds The 4-hour chart shows multiple rejections near $0.675, confirming intense overhead pressure. Price is forming lower highs; if $0.64 fails to hold, a move to retest $0.60 is likely. ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) likely remains under the neutral 50 zone, hinting at current bearish conditions. The lack of strong volume confirmation during the recovery phase implies a weak bull response. If the price fails to hold above the $0.64 region, it risks retesting the $0.60–$0.58 demand zone again. Conversely, a break and hold above $0.675 would signal short-term bullish reversal potential, targeting $0.70 and beyond. Traders should also monitor the behavior around moving averages, especially the 20-day EMA, which might act as a dynamic resistance.

Its approach prevents impersonation and supports Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution, potentially reducing economic inequality. The upcoming World Chain Layer 2 platform, backed by Ethereum’s security, promises efficient user onboarding and robust blockchain operations. These advancements position Worldcoin as a forward-thinking investment in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD’s price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, as it would require substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption.

The BlackRock CEO’s comments come as the market crash sees stocks plummet for more than 30 days straight. Crypto has also suffered in the past few weeks, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) dipping below $80k to touch lows last seen in early November 2024. However, Fink, sharing his opinion during an interview with Bloomberg TV, believes the dip is for buying. “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go down further…I would not be taking money off the table right now. It’s a great entry level,” he said.

That means opportunity in tech innovation, artificial intelligence and other U.S. sectors. Crypto is also likely to rally following the massive dump. Earlier during the U.S. trading session, stocks rose and Bitcoin briefly edged to above $81k on what turned out to be fake news. Major accounts on X posted that White House was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. The S&P 500 soared on the news, as did cryptocurrencies – only for the markets to give up the gains on news that this was “fake.” Fink also commented on the potential rate increase amid the current market outlook, noting the Federal Reserve could still have this on the table. Notably, the BlackRock CEO says most of the other chief executives he’s talked to opine that the recession is on at the moment. Bitcoin trades around $78k at the time of writing, but largely negative after the volatility experienced in the past few days.

Amid this, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, is on the verge of a major crash. According to CoinMarketCap data, ETH has lost almost 25% of its value in just five trading days and has reached a make-or-break level. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Technical Analysis While examining the weekly chart of ETH, it appears that the asset has recently lost its long-held support from the ascending trendline that had been in place since July 2022. Source: Trading View Following the breakdown, the asset has been steadily falling, during which it has lost two key support levels at $2,200 and $1,830, and has now reached another critical support level at $1,530. Ethereum Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, if this downside momentum does not stop, the price could crash hard. The daily chart reveals that if the ETH price fails to hold this support level and closes a daily candle below $1,450, there is a strong possibility it could drop by another 30% to reach its next support level at $1,000 in the near future. Source: Trading View Following the continuous price decline, ETH is now trading below the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour, daily, and weekly timeframes, indicating a strong bearish trend. Current Price Momentum At press time, ETH is trading near $1,550 and has lost nearly 10.50% of its price over the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume jumped by a record 550%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous days. $200 Million Worth of Bullish Bet This record surge in trading volume includes the liquidation of traders’ short and long positions, recent investor accumulation or sell-offs, and all other ETH-based trading activity. Despite the massive price crash over the past 24 hours, traders seem optimistic and are strongly betting on the bullish side, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at the $1,526 support level, having built $201 million worth of long positions. On the other hand, $1,571 is another over-leveraged level, where traders have built $100 million worth of short positions. While examining these levels and traders’ positions, it appears that the bulls are currently dominating and could potentially liquidate $100 million worth of short positions.

In just 12 hours, these deep-pocketed investors poured about $60 million into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, despite it plunging over 17% in a single day. Whales Dive In as ETH Hits Years Low Data shared by on-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain shows the mysterious group known as “7 Siblings” leading the charge. They spent a hefty $42.66 million to buy 25,100 ETH at an average of $1,700. The group then quickly deposited the full amount into the Aave lending platform, possibly to earn yield or borrow against the assets. Another wallet, identified as “0x709,” borrowed 8.25 million DAI from Spark protocol to snap up 5,227 ETH at around $1,578 each. This whale also received 6,924 ETH from the Railgun privacy platform, with the stash worth about $11 million, raising speculation on their next move. Not to be left behind, a third address, “0x5f1,” deployed $8.13 million in DAI to grab nearly 5,000 ETH at an average price of $1,631. The buying spree marks an opportunistic push from large holders probably betting on a rebound, given that it comes at a time when the price of Ethereum is struggling to recover from one of its worst-ever quarters. It lost more than 45% of its value in the first three months of 2025. Their moves may suggest they see current prices as a long-term bargain , especially with ETH down nearly 56% from a year ago. Market Turbulence and Mixed Sentiment At the time of writing, the asset had dropped 17.1% in 24 hours, dragging its value down to levels not seen since March 2023. Over the past seven days, ETH dipped 16.6%, underperforming the broader crypto market which lost slightly more than 9% in that timeframe. Additionally, against Bitcoin, ETH/BTC has hit its lowest ratio since February 2020, standing at 0.01959. The network is also facing multiple challenges , including declining fee revenue, stiff competition from Solana, especially in the meme coin space, as well as lacklustre institutional interest compared to Bitcoin. It has led some industry observers like Lekker Capital’s Quinn Thompson to sound Ethereum’s death knell, recently describing the asset as “completely dead” as an investment. However, Standard Chartered remains bullish, predicting the crypto asset could hit $10,000 by 2029 despite its current woes.

During Monday, the price dipped to $74,000, but later shifted to the upside. The defining factor for bitcoin and most other cryptocurrency and traditional assets was the so-called ”Emancipation Day” - the presentation of President Donald Trump's new duties to U.S. trading partners on April 2. The day before, on April 1, QCP Capital analysts warned that the introduction of overly aggressive tariffs could increase negative sentiment in the market and provoke further falls in risky assets. In Q1 2025, Bitcoin, Ethereum and the S&P 500 showed the worst performance in the last three years. Since March 29, the digital asset market has lost more than $160 billion in capitalization. With consumer confidence at 12-year lows and stock markets already shaken by a 4-5% weekly drawdown, the time to tighten trading conditions is extremely bad, QCP said. ”However, political theater often leaves room for realignment. A softer-than-expected implementation of the measures could give markets a short respite,” the experts said. On April 2, the bitcoin price reached a local high above $88,000 by the time Trump's presentation began. After the announcement of the U.S. government's plans, the exchange rate collapsed to Monday's level of around $82,000. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes noted that the market ”didn't like” the new tariffs. In his opinion, if bitcoin holds the $76,500 level until U.S. tax day on April 15, the market will get rid of the uncertainty and volatility triggered by the announcement of duties. During Trump's speech, the market capitalization of the S&P 500 index fell by more than $2 trillion in just 16 minutes, The Kobeissi Letter pointed out. ”Nasdaq 100 futures are currently trading 850 points lower after a daily gain of 400. This puts us on track for the largest daily reversal in 2025. Fasten your seatbelts to be prepared for more volatility,” said the authors of the resource. Within a day of the presentation, the cryptocurrency's fear and greed index collapsed to 25 points into the ”extreme fear” zone over the past 24 hours. On the eve of ”Liberation Day,” the metric was showing cautious growth. On April 4, the volume of daily liquidations in the crypto market reached $250 million. Bitcoin managed to rise from $81,800 to $84,700, but collapsed to its initial values after China announced retaliatory duties against the United States. Digital gold gradually recovered during the day, but then reacted again with a drawdown to the publication of labor market data in the United States. The negativity was added by the subsequent speech of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. At the same time, the digital gold dominance index approached 63%. The index has been increasing since January 2023. The exchange rate continued to fall over the weekend. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $82,000. The Fear and Greed Index has partially recovered and is at 35. The dynamics of Ethereum largely coincided with digital gold. At the beginning of the week, the price was $1790. By April 1, the chart reached a local peak near $1918. On April 2, after a drawdown to the $1750 level, the Ethereum price surpassed $1900 again, but collapsed to $1794 on the background of ”Liberation Day”. For the next three days, the exchange rate was in the range of $1750-1840. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum is $1742. During the week, all assets from the top-10 list by capitalization experienced a drawdown, except for TRX with a 3.4% gain. SOL (-8.7%), ADA (-7.1%) and DOGE (-4.7%) had the most significant losses. Experts assessed the consequences of ”Liberation Day” ; On April 2, US President Donald Trump announced duties for trading partners as part of the so-called ”Emancipation Day.” The new policy provides for ”reciprocal tariffs” for a number of trading partners about half as much as they impose on U.S. goods. For other states introduced a minimum of 10%. In particular, the announced duties for China amounted to 54%, for the EU - 20%, Vietnam - 46%, Taiwan - 32%, Japan - 24%, India - 26%, South Korea - 25%. Trump also mentioned 25% tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. According to experts, the effect of the introduction of duties will not be limited to short-term negative impact on the markets. In particular, industry experts consider that this will directly affect American miners. Most cryptocurrency mining devices are now imported into the country from Malaysia (the new duty rate is 24%), Thailand (36%) and Indonesia (32%), noted Mason Jappa, founder and CEO of Blockware Solutions. ”The rigs already delivered to the U.S. will become more valuable,” he stated. BitMars general manager Summer Meng added China (54%) to the cited list. All factories of Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining equipment, will be affected, she emphasized. According to The Mining Pod, the PRC-based company occupies about 80% of the ASIC-miner market. Another 7% is accounted for by its Chinese competitor MicroBT, whose enterprises are located in the same jurisdictions. Both companies have previously announced the opening of production lines in the United States. However, their scale remains unknown, and chips for the plants are still imported from overseas. Blockware Solutions analyst Mitchell Askew described the impact of the tariffs as ”huge”. According to him, it will lead to a reduction in imports, which will increase domestic demand. ”If you combine this with the growth of BTC, we could see ASIC miner prices jump 5-10 times, as they did in 2021,” Eskew said. Synteq Digital CEO Taras Kulik believes that the announced tariffs will ”suppress further development of the sector.” According to leading BRN analyst Valentin Fournier, Trump's duties have to some extent dissipated the uncertainty around bitcoin's further dynamics, and the long-awaited clarity in U.S. trade policy ”creates preconditions for the activation of bulls.” ”Uncertainty is decreasing and institutional buyers are returning. Given the convergence of key catalysts, we expect bitcoin to regain momentum and make another attempt to reach the $90,000 level in the near future,” Fournier reported. David Hernandez of 21Shares supported his colleague, noting that the first cryptocurrency's resilience to tariffs compared to equities could reignite institutional demand. The network also pursued a theory that ”liberation” fees are actually designed by artificial intelligence. Some X users turned to ChatGPT to calculate rate plans and received similar figures. ”I think [the administration] asked ChatGPT to calculate other countries' tariffs, and that's why the numbers make absolutely no sense. They just divide the trade deficit we have with a country by our imports from that country or set it at 10%, whichever is greater,” one commenter noted. Journal of Public Economics editor Wojtek Kopczuk conducted a similar experiment and received a corresponding response. U.S. Authorities Outline Stablecoin Regulation U.S. authorities have two simultaneous bills to regulate Stablecoin - the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act — under consideration. Both await debate in the House and Senate. There are differences between the two proposals, but lobbyists from the crypto-industry suggest a coordinated effort to reconcile them to avoid delaying the process. Taking another step toward clear regulation, on April 4, the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance named the characteristics of non-securities-based stablecoins. According to the statement, such stablecoins are ”designed to maintain a stable value against the U.S. dollar and are backed by U.S. dollars and/or other assets that are considered low-risk and liquid.” Funds must be held in reserve and meet or exceed the value of the stablecoins in circulation. The issuer must issue and redeem the asset on demand in unlimited quantities. Trading on the secondary market and the participation of intermediaries in transactions is allowed, however, the stablecoins must not entitle holders to any form of dividend or share in the issuer's company or other business. A conflict has erupted between Justin Sun and FDT On April 2, stablecoin FDUSD deviated ~12% from parity with the dollar amid Justin Sun's statements about the insolvency of First Digital Trust (FDT). First Digital Trust is a Hong Kong-based fiduciary firm hired by Techteryx to manage TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin reserves. According to CoinDesk , FDT reportedly created a $456 million deficit on the project's balance sheet between 2023 and 2024. According to court documents, the firm was supposed to invest the reserve funds in the Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF) in the Cayman Islands, but directed the money to Aria Commodities DMCC, an unauthorized fund registered in Dubai. Matthew Brittain, listed in the documents as the manager of Aria CFF, told reporters that the two funds are linked - DMCC handles trading and CFF provides financing for the deals. In 2022, Techteryx tried to recover the funds, but the fund was only able to reimburse a small portion. Sun then provided Techteryx with a loan to secure the redemption of the coins. On April 2, in response to a CoinDesk report, the entrepreneur published a tweet where he called FDT unable to ensure the repayment of customer funds. He recommended users to withdraw funds and urged regulators to pay attention to flaws in the licensing and risk management system. The statement led to a wave of sales of First Digital Trust's own stablecoin under the ticker FDUSD and a temporary price sag to $0.88. First Digital denied Sahn's reports and assured FDUSD was fully secured, citing relevant financial statements . The businessman's statements were called a ”smear campaign” and an ”attack on a competing business.” On April 3, Sun held a press conference to ”uncover a major international financial fraud involving traditional financial institutions and Web3 platforms in Hong Kong.” That same day, FDT published an official response to the allegations. According to the report, the company acted ”solely within Techteryx's instructions” and has the records to prove it. Problems with refunds in 2022 were blamed on Techteryx. FDT claims that the Aria fund then raised concerns about compliance with KYC/AML in Techteryx's purchase of TrueUSD and the identity of its beneficiary. The fund allegedly has not yet received the necessary data. ”Through falsely accusing [FDT] of participating in the conspiracy, Justin Sun and Techteryx are attempting to evade responsibility and avoid their responsibilities to properly manage reserves in their role as issuer of stablecoin,” FDT said in a statement. The company also redeemed more than $25 million in FDUSD, noting that it continues to operate as normal. On April 4, Sun offered a $50 million reward for the return of TUSD reserves ”misappropriated by unscrupulous individuals, including First Digital Trust.” On April 5, he promised to ”prosecute the fraudsters to the fullest extent of the law.” ”First Digital Trust (FDT) should not get another chance to defraud the public under the guise of a licensed institution, in Hong Kong or anywhere else.” At the time of writing, the FDUSD exchange rate has recovered and maintains rough parity with the US dollar. Details of the alleged litigation are not yet known. DEX supremacy has returned to Ethereum The Ethereum network has once again taken the first place in terms of total trading volume on decentralized exchanges. Solana had held the lead since last September. According to DeFi Llama , total trading volume on Ethereum exchanges reached $64.6 billion - 22% more than Solana's $52.62 billion. Much of the volume came from DEX Uniswap, which reached a turnover of $30 billion. The second position among Ethereum exchanges was taken by Fluid with $9 billion, indicating growing competition. The decrease in the trading volume on Solana, including on the Raydium and Pump.fun platforms, is explained by the decline in interest in the meme-coin segment; In January, the ”people ecosystem” saw a surge in activity thanks to the launch of the TRUMP token. In March, there was not a single day with trading volume above $1 billion on Raydium. The average daily trading volume of ”funny coins” on Pump.fun dropped from $390 million in January to less than $100 million in March.",News|Reviews,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-07 17:50:34

The funds will be used to build a treasury of digital assets, starting with Solana-based tokens. The offering structure provides equity upside for investors while limiting risk through conversion terms. The initiative marks a shift toward on-balance-sheet token holdings within regulated public market frameworks. Janover has raised approximately $42 million through a private offering of convertible notes and warrants focused on the Solana ecosystem, according to an announcement published on April 7. New: Ex-Kraken employees acquired a majority stake in real estate platform Janover Inc. and will use the company's treasury to buy SOL + Solana validators. The team raised $42M from investors including Pantera and Kraken. New Michael Saylor on Solana? pic.twitter.com/1cC2fB8FBV — Jack Kubinec (@whosknave) April 7, 2025 The notes carry a 2.5% annual interest rate and mature in 2030. They can convert into common stock once the company’s market capitalization reaches $100 million, with the conversion price set at the market close on that day, subject to a floor. Solana Positioned as Core Asset According to the press release, each $1,000 note comes with warrants to purchase shares at fixed prices above current trading levels. Crypto-focused firms including Pantera Capital , Kraken , and Arrington Capital have joined the round, along with other institutional and angel investors. The funds will support Janover’s expansion into digital asset acquisition, beginning with tokens in the Solana ecosystem. The company is positioning this strategy within the structure of U.S. public markets. The structure of the offering allows early backers to gain equity exposure while retaining downside protection. For Janover, the strategy opens a path to grow digital holdings without relying on direct token issuance or offshore structures. “Bitcoin has and always will be the most powerful store of value, but Solana is the foundation for an entirely new, high-performance financial system,” said Janover’s newly appointed chairman and CEO Joseph Onorati. “While bitcoin is optimized for security and scarcity, Solana is optimized for speed, usability, and programmability,” said Onorati. Janover Targets Digital Assets Through U.S. Public Markets Janover’s leadership change coincides with a strategic shift toward holding digital assets on the balance sheet. The CEO described the initiative as a long-term commitment to Solana rather than a short-term trade. Onorati said the company plans to begin acquiring SOL immediately. While he did not disclose specific timing or volume, he emphasized that the approach would be deliberate and aligned with the broader Solana network. The structure will be “transparent, methodical, and deeply aligned with the Solana ecosystem,” he said. Janover’s approach gestures at a broader question facing smaller public companies: how to participate in digital asset markets without stepping outside the bounds of regulatory convention. By structuring exposure through capital markets, rather than direct token issuance or offshore entities, the company is testing how far existing frameworks can stretch. It also puts public-market discipline in conversation with open-source financial infrastructure. As more companies explore token treasuries not just as hedges, but as strategic holdings, the boundary between corporate finance and decentralized networks becomes harder to define.

Looking at the drops, it is currently the biggest loser among the top 4 altcoins with a 20% drop since yesterday. Ethereum has continued to paint serious bearish scenarios every week following a back-to-back deduction since the start of the year. Its bearish market structure has broadened and is now looking extremely overstretched on the daily scale. Signalling a long-term bearish move this month, it broke through a key support level and tested a two-year low of $1,411 during the London session. This low has been rejected to where it is priced at $1,496. The current trading level marks the key retest zone anticipated in the past months. A further recovery above it could bring relief in the market. If not, we may see more drops when the supply level increases. Looking at the daily price action, the bears are strongly in control from a technical perspective. A drop below the current low could set the stage for a bigger fall, positioning the market in a more bearish condition. While the bulls are still in disbelief, they will likely suffer more losses when selling pressure increases. Currently, there are no signs of buying. Even though that happens, ETH must climb back above $3k before we can consider a bullish move. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Below the current daily $1,411 low lies the key $1,300 level. Losing all these price level could drag the price to $1,200 before locating support. There’s nothing much to expect towards the upside as there’s no signs of an increase. The $1,614, $1,755 and $1,957 resistance are higher levels to watch in case of a buy.

Soon after market open, a rumor swirled on the social media platform X that White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that President Trump was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs. The rumor caused a $3 trillion blast in the S&P 500 index from its daily low. Minutes later, CNBC reported that no one at the White House had any knowledge of a so-called 90-day pause, and soon after that, the White House itself posted on X, calling the rumor “fake news.” That’s when the S&P 500 broke down further, erasing the entire move which only took 30 minutes to complete. As reported by The Kobeissi Letter, the move was likely the biggest half-hour swing in market cap ever witnessed. “This single tariff headline attributed to White House advisor Hassett swung $6 TRILLION in S&P 500 market cap. We just witnessed the largest 30-minute swing in market cap in history. You can’t make this up.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X About half an hour after shooting down the rumors, President Trump posted on Truth Social to announce that the US would put an additional 50% on tariffs on China – on top of the 34% tariff already declared – unless China withdrew its retaliatory 34% tariffs. “Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.” In the background, crypto markets are also suffering a bloodbath, with data aggregator platform Coinglass reporting over $1.64 billion in liquidations in the last 24 hours.

This triggered a major price breakdown and is now looking super bearish on the daily chart while losing momentum. The recent monthly buy near the $89k level generated some positive sentiment last week, but it later halted after failing to advance higher. This led to a fake out as millions of dollars of short positions were liquidated on futures, leading to a bull trap. The price later dropped throughout the week and closed highly bearish after losing $80k. Today marks its biggest loss ever since the rejection and is now looking strongly bearish as it dipped to $74.5k today, marking its lowest level in five months. A slight recovery from this level has brought trading back to $77.2k at the time of writing. It currently aims to retest the $80k level that cracked during yesterday’s dump. We can expect more sell-offs as soon as the price retests this key level. This may come into play during the New York session. The daily low is currently serving as support. If it holds, we can expect a brief break in the selling pressure. But from the look of things, Bitcoin will most likely test the $71k – $70k range before calming. Right now, the bulls are off the market. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Bitcoin just rejected the daily $74,500 low and now sits above $76,606. Losing these levels could drive the price lower to $73,620 and mainly the $70,578 support in the next dip. Following a slight recovery from the daily low, it may retest the $81,135 resistance, along with the recently broken rising trendline. Resistance levels above this trendline are $85,800 and $88,765, where it initiated the current leg down.

Dimon warned that these tariffs could exacerbate inflation and impede economic growth, emphasizing the urgency of resolving trade uncertainties swiftly to prevent long-term damage to consumer confidence and corporate profitability. ​ “As for the short-term, we are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products,” Dimon wrote in relation to the tariffs. The newly introduced “reciprocal” tariffs include a baseline 10% tax on all imports, which has already triggered significant market volatility. U.S. stock futures experienced sharp declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping approximately 800 points. This downturn extended globally, affecting markets in Europe and Asia. ​ You might also like: Pi continues to fall below 10% as YETIO presale gains momentum with $3.2m raised Potential recession Dimon highlighted that while the U.S. economy was already showing signs of slowing prior to the announcement of these tariffs, the additional strain could compound existing challenges and potentially push the nation toward a recession. He noted that the negative impacts — such as diminished consumer confidence, reduced investments, lower corporate profits, and a weaker U.S. dollar — can accumulate and become increasingly difficult to reverse. Addressing the broader geopolitical implications, Dimon cautioned against an isolationist stance, stating that “America First” should not devolve into “America alone.” He underscored the importance of maintaining strong military and economic alliances, warning that fragmentation could weaken the U.S. and benefit adversaries. Dimon advocated for consistent, respectful engagement with allies and global partners to effectively compete with nations like China, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology. ​ You might also like: Binance: Trade war erases $1t in crypto, Bitcoin acts like risk asset Crypto’s impact The cryptocurrency market has not been immune to these developments.

43045230,975f03f2-6709-4165-9436-fe3d063bac37,1744053013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/43045230.jpeg,Inside North Korea's Favorite Crypto Laundering Tool: THORChain,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/04/07/the-blockchain-fueling-north-korea-s-massive-crypto-laundering-operation,"John-Paul Thorbjornsen, a former Australian Air Force pilot turned crypto entrepreneur, has spent recent weeks promoting his new crypto wallet, ""Vultisig."" Built on THORChain — a blockchain he founded to allow crypto swaps without intermediaries — the wallet's main selling point is that it's harder to hack than similar apps. Recently, Vultisig — along with the THORChain network itself — has seen a spike in activity , but security experts have traced the growth to a troubling source: North Korea's Lazarus hacking group. Following February's $1.4 billion hack of crypto exchange Bybit — the largest cyber heist in history — THORChain emerged as central to North Korea's laundering operations. Researchers have tracked nearly $1.2 billion — or 85%— of the stolen funds through the network, which has become the Kim regime's primary tool for moving crypto between blockchains. Unlike some other blockchain services, THORChain's operators have refused to block transactions linked to the Bybit heist, despite requests from the FBI and other government agencies. THORChain wallets like Asgardex and Vultisig — tools that most people use to transact on the network — haven't budged, either. According to estimates from blockchain security researchers who spoke to CoinDesk, THORChain's major wallet developers and validators — many publicly identified and based in jurisdictions with strict anti-money-laundering regulations, including the U.S. — have earned over $12 million in fees connected to the heist. Thorbjornsen, known publicly as JP Thor, insists he is no longer involved in THORChain’s daily operations yet remains its most visible advocate. “The protocol keeps running and swapping despite chaos,” he told CoinDesk. “It’s doing great, actually.” The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has previously sanctioned blockchain services used in connection with money laundering, such as the mixer app Tornado Cash (which has since been delisted after a court ruling ) and Bitzlato , an exchange. Prosecutors have also charged operators behind similar platforms. For legal experts and the crypto community, whether THORChain — a layer-1 blockchain — should be treated differently than these other services revives a fundamental debate faced by virtually all crypto platforms: Is the network truly decentralized? Critics argue it isn't — at least in comparison to popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have earned less scrutiny for facilitating illicit transactions. THORChain's supporters ""claim it's decentralized when convenient, yet they're profiting from this [Bybit hack],"" said blockchain security researcher Taylor Monahan. ""It's a really bad look."" THORChain's transaction fees — particularly those earned by its wallet apps, which are maintained by small developer teams — further complicate its defense. According to a former U.S. Treasury Department official, ""Anybody making money on fees related to the movement of hacked funds that have already been publicly attributed to Lazarus and North Korea potentially has an OFAC issue."" Even some of THORChain's most vocal supporters have grown concerned. ""When the huge majority of your flows are stolen funds from North Korea for the biggest money heist in human history, it will become a national security issue,"" cautioned a THORChain developer known as ""TCB"" on X . ""[T]his isn't a game anymore."" Biggest hack in history February's hack of Bybit, a major Dubai-based crypto exchange, was large even by the standards of the Lazarus group — the elite North Korean cyber unit behind most of the largest crypto heists of the past decade. The hack took place after Bybit's founder was tricked into interacting with a website that Lazarus had compromised. The mistake granted the hackers access to some of Bybit's primary Ethereum wallets. They stole $1.4 billion worth of ether (ETH) tokens from the exchange. North Korea's launderers, well-practiced after years of big-money crypto heists, immediately began splitting their record-breaking haul across a series of fresh crypto wallets — the first step in a complex journey designed to convert dirty crypto into clean cash. ""DPRK uses advanced technical capabilities to launder cryptocurrency,"" explained Andrew Fierman, the head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis. After moving the funds ""through an extensive number of intermediary wallets,"" the launderers use ""cross-chain bridges in order to move the stolen funds across various different assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Solana and others."" THORChain proved essential to the bridging stage, serving as a go-between for swapping tokens across blockchains — often repeatedly, to throw investigators off their trail. ""Before ThorChain existed, there was no way to swap from Ethereum to Bitcoin without getting frozen,"" explained Monahan, a security researcher at MetaMask. Centralized swap services — including crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance — require users to register their accounts and risk having illicit funds seized. Most decentralized services, meanwhile, lack the liquidity to support transactions on the scale of the Lazarus group. Put on notice On the day after the Bybit hack, THORChain's daily swap volume exceeded $529 million — its biggest trading day ever, according to data from DeFiLlama. Volumes continued climbing for days afterward, generating millions of dollars in fees for THORChain's validators, liquidity providers and wallet services. On February 27, the FBI circulated a list of DPRK-linked blockchain addresses and urged ""private sector entities including RPC node operators, exchanges, bridges, blockchain analytics firms, DeFi services, and other virtual asset service providers to block transactions with or derived from [them]."" By this point, many of the other crypto tools used by North Korea's launderers had already begun blocking heist-linked activity. Tether, the largest stablecoin operator, eventually froze $9 million linked to the heist, and Mantle, a layer-2 blockchain connected to Ethereum, froze $41 million more . One platform — a decentralized exchange operated by the company OKX — paused its services altogether . For a moment, THORChain seemed like it might follow suit. In response to the FBI's notice, a group of THORChain validators coordinated to halt Ethereum swaps on the protocol — a move intended to slow the outflow of illicit funds. But the pause lasted just 30 minutes before it was rolled back following community pushback. ""There is no proof, nor can there be, that any signed and propagated transaction is from a specific geographical location,"" Thorbjornsen told CoinDesk, arguing that any links between THORChain and North Korea are ""alleged"" since the network's users are not forced to register themselves. The pause reversal proved to be a breaking point for some in the THORChain community. “Effective immediately, I will no longer be contributing to THORChain,” the protocol’s lead developer, known as “Pluto,” wrote in an X post . Decentralization theater? Thorbjornsen and others maintain that THORChain should be treated as a decentralized protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum, neither of which blocked transactions following the Bybit heist. They point to its community of more than 100 validators — computers that verify transactions — as evidence that no single entity controls the system. THORChain's governance model relies on these validators who stake the network's native RUNE token to participate in consensus and earn rewards. In theory, major protocol decisions require approval from a supermajority of these validators, creating a distributed power structure resistant to centralized control. Critics, however, argue the network is not nearly as decentralized as claimed. In January, a single developer paused the network during a liquidity crisis — an action that should have required validator consensus if the system were more decentralized. When THORChain was involved in previous North Korean laundering operations, ""we were told there was nothing they could do about the illicit funds,"" said Monahan. ""The entire time, JP had a single private key that had control over the entire system."" Thorbjornsen concedes the chain was paused by an administrative keyholder at a moment when THORChain was facing an ""existential"" threat. However, Thorbjornsen said the pause was initiated by a keyholder with the pseudonym ""Leena."" Thorbjornsen created the Leena account early in THORChain's development and initially used it to hide his real identity. He now says the Leena account is no longer solely controlled by him, and someone else paused the chain in accordance with acceptable security procedures. For Thorbjornsen, the debate over who controlled the admin key misses the larger point. ""In the first couple years of Bitcoin existing, you could have easily made the case that Bitcoin was completely centralized,"" he told CoinDesk, pointing to an instance in 2010 where Satoshi upgraded the original blockchain to fix a major bug. ""Decentralization is earned, and it's earned by years of being in the arena and proving it,"" Thorbjornsen said. ""All of these things like the pause and the unpause … this is all part of the journey of decentralization."" Business as usual On March 1, THORChain's biggest day of trading following the Bybit heist, the network recorded over $1 billion in swaps, more than it typically processes in an entire month. The activity was a boon for THORChain's infrastructure providers — wallet services and validators who take a cut of each transaction on the network. According to blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, THORChain node operators earned at least $12 million in fees connected to the Bybit heist. Chainalysis called its estimate ""conservative."" According to legal experts, these fees are what could ultimately get THORChain's operators into trouble. A former U.S. Treasury Department official warned in an interview with CoinDesk that ""a lot of this just comes down to the question of who's making money: Is it a concentrated set of people, and is it relatively knowable that [the funds] are from bad actors?"" Wallet apps like Vultisig and Asgardex have earned special scrutiny from legal and security experts, since ""frontend"" applications used to interact with blockchains are generally considered more centralized than blockchains themselves. Asgardex, one of the more popular THORChain wallets, earned $1 million from Bybit-linked transactions, according to Monahan. ""The reason why you use Asgardex"" as opposed to other THORChain wallets ""is because you don't want tracking — you don't want filtering or anything,"" said Thorbjornsen, who helped develop the program. Thorbjornsen says he no longer has an operational or financial stake in Asgardex, which is open-source and can technically be re-programmed by its users to operate without fees. However, he has recently actively promoted VultiSig, his new hack-resistant THORChain wallet. On March 20, Thorbjornsen boasted in an X post that more people than ever were using the app: ""Vultisig swaps have collected $200k in revenue so far!"" ZachXBT, a crypto sleuth known for investigating North Korea's cyber operations, responded by pointing out that ""a good chunk of that revenue is being generated from the Bybit hack."" ""Vultisig is not a chain,"" ZachXBT said. ""[T]hey operate a centralized interface for users to interact with protocols for a fee."" On April 16, Vultisig is launching its official crypto token: VULT. The token will be distributed for free to some of the wallet's most loyal users.",Tech,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 19:10:13

Imagine staking a tokenized money market fund from a traditional financial giant like UBS, all within the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm. Sounds too good to be true? Well, buckle up, because BounceBit is making it a reality! Through a strategic DigiFT Partnership , BounceBit users can now access and stake UBS’s uMINT, opening up a new frontier for yield generation and bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. What is BounceBit and its CeDeFi Infrastructure? Before diving into the exciting details of uMINT staking, let’s understand the foundation: BounceBit . Think of BounceBit as a cutting-edge CeDeFi Infrastructure platform. CeDeFi, short for Centralized Decentralized Finance, represents the best of both worlds. It aims to combine the transparency, security, and accessibility of DeFi with the regulatory compliance and user-friendliness often found in centralized finance (CeFi). BounceBit is engineered to build and power various CeDeFi applications, making it easier for users to navigate and benefit from this evolving financial ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of what makes BounceBit tick: Bridging CeFi and DeFi: BounceBit acts as a crucial link, allowing traditional financial assets to interact with the innovative world of DeFi protocols.

Focus on Security and Compliance: Operating within the CeDeFi space means prioritizing security and regulatory adherence, aiming for a safer and more trustworthy environment for users. The Power of the DigiFT Partnership The magic behind this new uMINT staking opportunity lies in BounceBit’s DigiFT Partnership . DigiFT, based in Singapore, is a pioneering exchange specializing in on-chain Real World Assets (RWAs). This partnership is not just another collaboration; it’s a strategic alliance that unlocks significant potential. DigiFT’s expertise in tokenizing real-world assets, combined with BounceBit’s CeDeFi infrastructure, creates a powerful synergy. Why is this partnership so important? Access to RWAs: DigiFT’s focus on RWAs brings tangible, real-world value into the crypto space. On-Chain Expertise: DigiFT’s proficiency in managing and trading RWAs on-chain is crucial for ensuring seamless and secure integration with platforms like BounceBit. Singaporean Regulatory Environment: Being based in Singapore, DigiFT operates within a relatively progressive and clear regulatory framework for digital assets, adding a layer of trust and compliance. uMINT Staking: A New Frontier for Yield Now, let’s talk about the star of the show: uMINT Staking . uMINT is not just any token; it’s a tokenized money market fund from UBS Asset Management. UBS, a global financial giant, brings decades of experience and credibility to the table. uMINT represents a significant step in bringing institutional-grade financial products onto the blockchain. By enabling uMINT Staking through DigiFT, BounceBit is offering its users unprecedented access to a sophisticated financial instrument previously out of reach for many in the crypto space. Here’s what you need to know about uMINT: Feature Description Issuer UBS Asset Management, a globally recognized financial institution. Type Tokenized Money Market Fund Underlying Assets Investments in high-quality, short-term money market instruments (details of specific holdings would be in uMINT documentation). Benefits Exposure to traditional finance yield within the crypto ecosystem, diversification, potential stability compared to volatile crypto assets. How to Stake uMINT on BounceBit Vaults Ready to dive into uMINT Staking ? BounceBit has made the process straightforward. Users can stake uMINT within BounceBit Vaults to earn additional returns.

The Rise of Real World Assets (RWA) in CeDeFi This integration highlights a broader and increasingly significant trend: the rise of Real World Assets (RWA) in the CeDeFi space. RWAs are essentially traditional assets – think stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities – that are tokenized and brought onto the blockchain. This movement is seen by many as the next major evolution in crypto, offering a bridge to trillions of dollars of value locked in traditional markets. Why are RWAs gaining traction in CeDeFi? Diversification: RWAs offer crypto investors diversification beyond purely crypto-native assets, potentially reducing portfolio volatility. Institutional Adoption: The involvement of institutions like UBS in tokenizing assets signals growing institutional interest and adoption of blockchain technology. New Yield Opportunities: RWAs can unlock new and potentially more stable yield opportunities compared to some high-risk DeFi protocols. Increased Liquidity: Tokenization can fractionalize and increase the liquidity of traditionally illiquid assets. Benefits and Challenges of this Integration Like any innovation, the BounceBit-DigiFT-uMINT integration comes with its set of benefits and challenges. Understanding these can help users make informed decisions. Benefits: Exposure to Institutional Grade Assets: Access to a UBS tokenized money market fund is a significant leap, offering exposure to high-quality traditional financial products. Enhanced Yield Opportunities: Staking uMINT provides an opportunity to earn additional yield on a relatively stable asset compared to volatile cryptocurrencies. CeDeFi Innovation: This partnership pushes the boundaries of CeDeFi, demonstrating the potential for blending traditional finance with decentralized technologies. User-Friendly Access: BounceBit aims to make staking uMINT accessible to a broader range of users through its user-friendly platform. Challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for RWAs and CeDeFi is still evolving, and changes could impact these types of offerings. Complexity: While user-friendly, understanding the nuances of tokenized money market funds and staking mechanisms still requires some learning. Smart Contract Risks: As with any DeFi or CeDeFi activity, smart contract risks are inherent, although platforms like BounceBit aim to mitigate these through security measures. Counterparty Risk: While uMINT is issued by UBS, users are still interacting with multiple platforms (DigiFT and BounceBit), introducing a degree of counterparty risk. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards the Future of Finance BounceBit enabling uMINT Staking through the DigiFT Partnership is more than just news; it’s a powerful signal of where the future of finance is heading. It represents a successful convergence of traditional financial instruments with the innovative and accessible world of CeDeFi. By offering users the ability to stake a UBS tokenized money market fund, BounceBit is not only providing new yield opportunities but also paving the way for greater institutional involvement and the mainstream adoption of Real World Assets within the crypto ecosystem. This move underscores the transformative potential of CeDeFi to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance, creating a more inclusive and efficient financial future.

These trade wars have caused billions of dollars in liquidation in the crypto market, sending leading altcoins like Solana to their yearly lowest prices. As a result, important on-chain metrics have sharply declined, increasing the likelihood that Solana’s price may remain stuck below the $100 mark. Solana’s Active Address Count Declines Solana’s price is facing a critical moment after falling below the important $100 support level, marking its lowest level since February 2024. According to data from Coinglass, there have been significant liquidations of Solana positions in the past 24 hours, totaling about $86.3 million. Out of this, buyers liquidated $67.2 million in long positions, while sellers closed $19.1 million in short positions. Adding to this selling pressure, more than $50 million worth of SOL tokens are scheduled to unlock this week. Meanwhile, the overall altcoin market is experiencing high fear levels, with the crypto fear and greed index now at 22. On-chain activity has also been dropping recently. The number of active addresses on Solana decreased from a peak of 3.52 million to 2.99 million last week. Additionally, new addresses on the network fell from 3.51 million to 2.78 million. This decline in activity suggests weakening demand and interest, indicating sellers currently have the advantage. Also read: Solana Back Above $100 as Bulls Gain Control—Will SOL Price Reclaim $110? Aside from the recent sharp decline in Solana’s price, the protocol has also lost its position as the top decentralized exchange (DEX), falling behind Ethereum. This could negatively impact sentiment. However, there are positive moves worth noting, which might meet SOL buyers’ expectations. One important factor is the push for a Solana ETF in the United States. Although the chances of approval aren’t as strong as those for Litecoin or Dogecoin ETFs, if approved, a Solana ETF would attract long-term support to the ecosystem. What’s Next for SOL Price? Solana (SOL) is currently facing a strong downward pressure as its price dropped sharply after failing to hold at $118. The price initially dropped below the crucial $100 level to form a low near $95. However, it later triggered a rebound and surged above $100. As of writing, SOL price trades at $106, declining over 1.53% in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, buyers have shown interest to accumulate more SOL around the dip below $100, resulting in the recent rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39, indicating that the bearish momentum is strong. If buyers manage to rally and push the price up towards the crucial resistance of $110, SOL could potentially reach a resistance zone at $135-$160. Breaking past this point might restore market confidence and possibly lead to a rise towards $180. Conversely, if SOL fails to stay above the $110 level, it could face a stronger decline, possibly falling to an important support level at around $100. A drop below this could trigger further losses, sending Solana below $80.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-07 19:13:26

Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Over the past 30 days, Ether has underperformed the broader cryptocurrency market by 14%. Despite this, professional traders are not yet ready to turn bearish, as suggested by Ethereum’s derivatives data and onchain metrics. While this data does not guarantee that Ether’s price has reached its bottom, the reduced demand for bearish positions below $1,600 offers some reassurance for bullish investors. Ether 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch On April 7, the Ether monthly futures premium rose to 4% after dipping to 3% earlier in the day. Although still below the neutral threshold of 5%, this marks an improvement from March 31, when the indicator hit a low of 2%. Currently, there is a noticeable lack of demand from long positions (buyers), but this is not unusual following a steep 30% drop in ETH’s price over the past month. Ether is a victim of worsening macroeconomic conditions Investors remain concerned that escalating global trade tensions could lead to an economic recession and reduce interest in risk-on assets. This scenario also weakens the potential positive impact of a possible interest rate cut during the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next meeting on May 6-7. Typically, such a move would benefit the cryptocurrency market by lowering returns on fixed-income investments. Despite US President Donald Trump’s strong push for interest rate cuts, as expressed in his Truth Social post on April 7, Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious about inflation trends. Powell reportedly stated on April 4: ""It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy,"" according to Yahoo Finance. Adding further pressure to Ether’s price was Ethereum developers’ decision to delay the Pectra upgrade , originally scheduled for April. Developers have now set May 7 as the target date for its mainnet launch but provided no specific reason for the delay. This comes even though the Hoodi testnet upgrade was successfully implemented on March 26. Ether derivatives display moderate resilience while Ethereum TVL jumps to an all-time high Given the negative news flow, one might have expected Ether bears to dominate the market entirely. However, derivatives data suggests that bears are not as confident as anticipated. When traders foresee a correction, put (sell) options tend to trade at a premium, pushing the 25% delta skew metric above 6%. Conversely, during bullish periods, this indicator typically falls below -6%. Ether 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the ETH options skew stands at 10%, the same level as March 31, which remains within bearish territory. However, this reading is significantly less extreme compared to May 2024, when it peaked at 20% amid a sharp ETH price drop from $3,700 to $2,860 within five weeks. In essence, while Ether derivatives markets signal bearish sentiment, they do not reflect panic levels. Onchain data for Ethereum shows resilience despite broader market challenges. The total value locked (TVL) on the Ethereum network reached an all-time high of 30.2 million ETH on April 6—a 22% increase compared to the previous month. This growth outpaced Solana’s 12% increase in SOL ( SOL ) terms and BNB Chain’s 16% TVL rise during the same period. Ultimately, macroeconomic conditions remain the primary driver of cryptocurrency demand. However, when analyzing Ether derivatives data and Ethereum’s TVL performance, it appears that ETH’s price downside may be limited.

According to two memorandums from April 3, all government agencies “should invest in the AI marketplace and maximize the use of AI products and services that are developed and produced in the United States.” The memorandums list various deadlines for the adoption of AI, including a 270-day deadline to update policies and procedures. In early 2025, Trump took significant steps to reshape US policy on emerging technologies by repealing former President Joe Biden's 2023 executive order on AI safety — arguing it imposed excessive regulations that stifled innovation — and declaring his intention to make the US the ""world capital""of AI and cryptocurrency. Critics, however, have raised concerns that removing safety frameworks could leave the public vulnerable to AI-related risks. OMB memorandum M-25-21.

In January 2025, Trump announced an AI infrastructure project called “Stargate,” aimed at building AI data centers across the country. The surging demand for AI infrastructure has prompted Bitcoin miners to pivot and expand their operations to support the growing needs of the AI sector. At the same time, the convergence of AI and blockchain fueled a rally in AI-related tokens throughout 2024. However, that momentum has sharply reversed in 2025. Despite continued enthusiasm around AI’s long-term potential, tokens linked to the technology have seen steep losses, shedding over 42% of their market cap over the past 12 months, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

After the Chinese retaliation to the latest US tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening further measures. On April 7, Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that China would face an additional 50% tariff if it didn’t remove countermeasures. Notably, China introduced 34% retaliatory tariffs on all US goods, mirroring the same measure by the United States. Now, Trump has given China an ultimatum to remove its retaliatory tariffs by April 8, or face new measures. “If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.” Donald Trump The combined tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States are currently 54%, taking into account existing tariffs plus Trump’s new measures. If the new tariff takes effect, Chinese goods would face tariffs of 104%. For specific goods, like automobiles and electronics, the tariff rates would be even higher. Trade war escalates with Trump’s latest threat to China Since the April 2nd “Liberation Day” announcement, average US tariffs on foreign goods rose to 18.8%. This is the highest level since the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which caused major concern in both stock and crypto markets.

Namely, traders fear a rise in inflation, a fall in growth, and employment due to the economic effects of tariffs. Still, it is not clear how long these tariffs will last, and what the long-term rates would be. Notably, 59% of the traders on Polymarket expect that Trump will reduce the majority of tariffs by July. Just one day prior, on April 6, these odds were at just 33%. Following the newsof , Bitcoin (B) spiked to a daily high of $81.119, before dropping to $78,321.

The buying is focused on major lending protocols, which have retained a large part of their value despite the market correction. DeFi lending protocols are still in demand, as whales are re-accumulating positions in some of the top DeFi assets. After a turbulent day, whale buyers are back, re-buying the leading tokens at a discount. Tokens were not the main focus, as larger traders also bought the dip on Ethereum (ETH). However, the top DeFi protocols managed to reverse their recent price drop. Based on Alphanomics data, inflows are back to the top performers for each narrative. In the case of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, Aave (AAVE) is the top pick . Aave buyback may boost token price The Aave lending protocol saw buying from 200 whales for a total of $9.15M. After the recent inflows, AAVE bounced from lows of $116.32 to $132.49. The main narrative behind Aave is the implementation of tokenomics that will include buybacks. The platform’s new tokenomics may set aside up to $1M for buying back tokens each week. As of April 7, the buyback is still at the proposal stage, published for discussion by the Aave community. The first mention of a buyback was made in a widely approved Temp Check in the summer of 2024. Since then, Aave DAO increased its available reserves by 115%. Currently, Aave DAO sits on $115M, after achieving growth despite the volatile market conditions. The DAO retains its funds even after financing Aave Labs and paying out the Merit incentives. The fund may provide regular liquidity injections, boosting the presence of Aave. The protocol is also in focus for its ubiquity in the crypto lending space. Despite the market slowdown and volatile ETH prices, Aave and other lending protocols remained key to crypto activity. Aave had higher baseline activity in Q1, surviving the ETH slide without a major outflow of lenders and borrowers. Aave retains over $16.4B in total value locked. However, in the past day, the protocol retired over $11M of its native stablecoin GHO. The supply of GHO fell from over $211M to $200M as the protocol burned tokens due to lowered demand and liquidations. Recently, the supply of GHO reached an all-time high of over $214.38M. Ethereum whales move into RWA tokens Whales also chose assets linked to the RWA tokenization narrative. Around $9.1M flowed into Chainlink (LINK), boosting the asset to $11.52. LINK also bounced from its bottom after crashing into the $10 range. LINK remains a relatively accessible asset and a highly active project, with whales expecting a recovery. Other whales bought up Ondo Finance (ONDO), as well as Maker (MKR), betting on the recovery of DeFi tokens. DeFi marked the biggest losses for the past 30 days, with most assets erasing over 21% on average. Most crypto sectors reversed the losses in the past day, but DeFi posted the biggest short-term gains. | Source: Alphanomics Based on Alphanomics data, all narratives are staging a recovery, as whales are buying back the tokens. In the past 24 hours, DeFi tokens tracked by Alphanomics had the biggest net gains of 1.9% , potentially starting a recovery trend. DeFi tokens as a whole lost 10% of their valuation in the past day. The assets are still valued above $75B, and most are still tied to widely used decentralized ecosystems. During the latest market cycle, DeFi lowered its activity, but avoided panic and contagion by readjusting interest rates and collaterals. DeFi lending remains key for tapping the value of ETH and other assets while freeing up stablecoin liquidity. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

As we delve into the latest developments, four key Bitcoin trends are poised to shape the market narrative. From technical chart patterns to macroeconomic factors and on-chain data, let’s break down what you need to watch closely to navigate the week ahead in the crypto space. Is a Death Cross Looming for Bitcoin? One of the most talked-about technical indicators this week is the dreaded ‘death cross’ on the BTC/USD daily chart. For those unfamiliar, a death cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average (like the 50-day MA) crosses below a longer-term moving average (like the 200-day MA). This pattern is often interpreted by traditional analysts as a bearish signal, suggesting potential further downside. In Bitcoin’s case, this technical formation has indeed materialized, sparking concern among some traders. However, it’s crucial to remember that technical indicators are just one piece of the puzzle. While the death cross might suggest caution, it’s not a guaranteed predictor of a continued downtrend. Crucially, the $69,000 level is being watched as a significant support zone. If Bitcoin can hold above this level despite the death cross, it could signal resilience and potentially invalidate the bearish implications of the pattern. Think of it like this: the death cross is a warning sign, but the $69,000 support is the last line of defense. Key Takeaways on the Death Cross: Bearish Signal: The death cross on the daily chart is traditionally seen as a negative indicator. $69,000 Support: This level is critical for Bitcoin to hold to negate bearish pressure. Not a Guarantee: Technical indicators are not foolproof and should be considered with other factors. Will Rate Cut Expectations Fuel a Bitcoin Price Surge? Beyond technical analysis, macroeconomic factors are playing a significant role in the current crypto market sentiment. All eyes are on the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) releases this week. These economic indicators are vital in shaping expectations around future interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve. The anticipation of a potential rate cut in May is building, and this expectation is heavily influenced by inflation data. If the CPI and PPI figures come in lower than expected, it could strengthen the case for a rate cut. Historically, lower interest rates are often seen as positive for risk assets like Bitcoin. Why? Because lower rates can reduce the attractiveness of traditional fixed-income investments, pushing investors to seek higher returns in assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if inflation data remains stubbornly high, the Fed might be forced to maintain or even increase interest rates, which could dampen enthusiasm for riskier assets and potentially put downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Rate Cut Scenario Breakdown: Scenario CPI/PPI Data Rate Cut Expectations Potential Bitcoin Impact Rate Cut Optimism Lower than expected Increase Positive – Potential price increase Rate Hike Pressure Higher than expected Decrease Negative – Potential price decrease Trump’s Tariffs: Black Monday Redux or Overblown Fear for the Crypto Market? Geopolitical events and policy announcements can inject volatility into any market, and the crypto market is no exception. This week, U.S. President Trump’s tariff policies are adding another layer of complexity and concern. The announcement and potential implementation of new tariffs have sparked fears of a broader economic downturn, with some analysts even drawing comparisons to historical market crashes like Black Monday or the COVID-19 crash. While such comparisons might seem dramatic, they highlight the level of uncertainty and anxiety in the traditional financial markets. When traditional markets experience turbulence, it can often spill over into the cryptocurrency space, at least in the short term. Investors might become risk-averse and reduce their exposure to all asset classes, including Bitcoin. However, it’s also important to consider the counter-argument. Some argue that in times of economic uncertainty and potential currency devaluation due to trade wars, Bitcoin could actually emerge as a safe haven asset. Its decentralized nature and limited supply could make it attractive as an alternative store of value, potentially decoupling from traditional market downturns in the long run. Tariff Policy Impact – Potential Scenarios: Short-Term Panic: Initial tariff announcements could trigger market panic and a temporary sell-off in Bitcoin alongside traditional assets. Safe Haven Appeal: In the medium to long term, economic uncertainty could increase Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized store of value. Uncertainty Prevails: The actual impact will depend on the severity and longevity of the tariff policies and the global economic response. On-Chain Data: Are Short-Term Holders Capitulating? To gain a deeper understanding of the current Bitcoin price action, on-chain data provides invaluable insights. One metric that’s particularly relevant this week is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). SOPR measures the degree of profit or loss realized by Bitcoin holders when they move their coins on-chain. Recent on-chain data indicates that the SOPR metric is currently in a ‘capitulation zone.’ This suggests that short-term holders, who are more sensitive to price fluctuations, are realizing losses and selling their Bitcoin. Capitulation often occurs during periods of market stress and can be a sign that sellers are becoming exhausted. Historically, capitulation phases have sometimes preceded market bottoms. While not a guaranteed signal, it can suggest that the market might be approaching a point where selling pressure starts to subside, potentially paving the way for a recovery. However, it’s crucial to remember that capitulation can also be prolonged, and further downside is always possible. On-Chain Data Insights (SOPR): Capitulation Zone: SOPR indicates short-term holders are realizing losses. Seller Exhaustion: Capitulation can suggest selling pressure might be waning. Potential Bottom Signal: Historically, capitulation phases have sometimes preceded market bottoms, but not always. Navigating the Week Ahead in the Crypto Market This week in the crypto market is shaping up to be a critical period for Bitcoin. The confluence of technical indicators like the death cross, macroeconomic factors tied to inflation and rate cut expectations, geopolitical uncertainties related to tariffs, and on-chain data signaling potential capitulation creates a complex and dynamic environment. Staying informed and understanding these Bitcoin trends is crucial for making informed decisions. While uncertainty prevails, it’s also during such times that opportunities can emerge. By carefully monitoring these key factors and conducting thorough research, investors can better navigate the market swings and position themselves strategically for the weeks and months ahead.

The altcoin left market players in shock after dropping below the $100 price mark on April 7, 2025, for the first time since February 2024. The new development comes not long after the altcoin recorded a mild jump in price, following its addition to leading online payment systems PayPal and Venmo. Factors driving the downtrend might include the impact of President Trump’s political tariffs and negative futures trading. Social sentiments are currently split between traders, with some seeing the decline as a dip-buying opportunity while others fear incoming or extended market volatility. Interestingly, SOL made a quick correction, jumping above the $100 price mark after snagging in mild hourly gains. However, technical signals hint that the asset is still in troubled waters. The RSI is still extremely oversold, while the MACD crossover remains bearish. Open interest rates are also declining at this time. Market participants have collectively reacted in shock, expressing surprise over the new development. “I honestly cannot believe SOL is back under $100. It was nearly $300 a few months ago.” Quinten, a cryptocurrency founder, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Pseudonymous trader Lana Queen, who observed SOL’s continuous decline from the first quarter of the year, is quoted as stating, “SOL is down 65% from ATH in the last 90 days. Is this the golden crypto era?” At the time of this report, Solana (SOL) is trading for $107. Over the past 24 hours, the asset has lost over 6% of its gains and 15% of its price value over the last 7 days.

Murphy has brought action against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit was initiated to compel the release of government records related to the identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. The suit was filed on April 7, 2025, following the department’s failure to respond to Murphy’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated February 12, 2025. DHS Agent Allegedly Confirmed Knowledge Of Satoshi Nakamoto According to court documents , Murphy is seeking records of an interview that DHS allegedly conducted with the person or persons using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This development comes following the Bitcoin creator’s birthday, which took place on April 5. The complaint cites public statements made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at a 2019 conference, where she allegedly confirmed that DHS knows Nakamoto’s identity and had sent agents to California to interview him. The lawsuit comes amid increasing government interest in Bitcoin. The complaint referenced President Trump’s March 6, 2025, Executive Order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” They also noted that nearly 20 states are currently considering legislation to authorize investing public funds in Bitcoin. The lawsuit centers on statements made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud during a presentation at the OffshoreAlert Conference North America on April 29, 2019. Court documents quote Saoud as explaining that a “really smart, forward-leaning agent” had requested to interview Nakamoto. Despite initial skepticism and “push back” from headquarters, agents were sent to California for the meeting. When the agents arrived, they reportedly discovered that Nakamoto “wasn’t alone in creating” Bitcoin and that “there were three other people” involved. The complaint states that Saoud described how the agents “sat down and met with them and talked to them to find out how this actually works and what their reason for it was.” Despite this public disclosure, the identities of these four individuals have never been revealed to the public, according to the lawsuit. FOIA Request History And Government Inaction Murphy’s suit provides a comprehensive timeline of efforts he undertook to get information requested through the lawful FOIA process before being forced to sue. On February 12, he requested records from four categories. The records included whether there was any transcript of Saoud’s statements in 2019 that were made publicly. These include a record of any interview done by DHS with someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, a record of any interviews with others who claimed to be the inventors of Bitcoin, and a record of any information that discussed the identity of the creator(s) of Bitcoin. The complaint indicates that DHS accepted the request for documents on February 13, 2025, and assigned tracking number 2025-HQFO-02468 to the request. DHS also forwarded the request to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is a component of DHS. However, on February 19, ICE informed Murphy that they intended to process the request under a prior tracking number (2025-ICFO-17214) assigned to a similar request made by Murphy earlier. Satoshi’s identity will undoubtedly continue to be of huge interest, especially considering that the Bitcoin creator’s net worth is 1.1 million BTC, worth around $86.9 billion based on the flagship crypto’s current price. Murphy’s Complaint Shows Interest in Bitcoin’s Creator Murphy’s complaint emphasizes the public interest in identifying Bitcoin’s creator. The lawsuit points to President Trump’s recent executive order directing that all Bitcoin held by the federal government be placed in a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. It also authorizes the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin.” The complaint also references pending U.S. Senate legislation to establish a Bitcoin reserve operated by the Treasury Department and notes that nearly 20 states are considering laws to allow public fund investment in Bitcoin. According to the filing, many public and private companies currently hold Bitcoin as treasury assets. Notably, Strategy holds over 500,000 Bitcoin. However, Strategy halted Bitcoin purchases with no acquisitions made in the first week of April. This was following a recent drop in Bitcoin price to as low as $74,000.

Markets reel as Trump blames China and past U.S. leaders for economic abuse. Traders eye Bitcoin as a hedge against political chaos and policy pivots. Bitcoin held relatively steady Monday near key support levels, even as President Donald Trump brought on a fiery rhetoric on social media regarding trade tariffs and Federal Reserve policy, fueling fresh debate about BTC’s role during macroeconomic uncertainty. While Trump accused China of unfair tariff retaliation (citing a 34% hike) and insisted there’s “NO INFLATION” despite recent market turmoil, Bitcoin found its footing. After dipping below $75,000 earlier Monday (hitting lows near $74,434), BTC climbed back to trade around $76,561 at press time.

To read full editions, subscribe . It seems the market was acting up while I was out of office Thursday and Friday. It hasn’t stopped, either. Several industry watchers called out BTC’s resilience at the end of last week (compared to US equities, for example) following Trump’s tariff reveal. Then the asset’s price plummeted. While BTC price stood around $83,000 Friday, Forward Guidance podcast guest Tony Greer called corporate bitcoin buying at every price level “astounding.” He also noted institutions’ ongoing willingness to buy the dip and their apparent long-term belief in the asset. Though Strategy paused its BTC buying last week, the company bought 22,048 BTC at an average price of ~$87,000 per coin the week prior. GameStop recently closed a $1.3 billion private offering of convertible senior notes; a portion of the net proceeds may go toward buying bitcoin . Net outflows from US spot bitcoin ETFs have stayed rather modest since peaking at $1.1 billion on Feb. 25. Roughly $165 million left those products last week, Farside Investors data shows. Still, Forward Guidance’s Quinn Thompson noted: “It feels to me like if this broader risk meltdown drags too far too long, it’s eventually got to puke, I think.” Before BTC's weekend/Monday movement, we had the @ForwardGuidance crew weigh in on the asset's outlook. An update is coming soon in today's newsletter https://t.co/3RoxMCvM0n pic.twitter.com/gw6cWB31L3 — Ben Strack 🟪 (@strack_ben) April 7, 2025 Let’s fast forward from that Friday conversation, as BTC’s price dropped substantially over the weekend — dipping below $75,000. It whipsawed with equities Monday morning and hovered around $78,500 at 1:30 pm ET. David Hernandez, a crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, noted that BTC not always capitulating in line with other risk assets highlights its divergence from traditional markets. “Bitcoin’s behavior [over] the last several days reflects its developing investment thesis as a store of value asset, one that could provide uncorrelated sources of return during moments of macroeconomic uncertainty ,” Hernandez told me. Now, markets eagerly search for any indication that Trump might pause or reverse tariffs ahead of Wednesday. Bitcoin cannot be tariffed, Hernandez added, “offering a potential flight to safety as other assets buckle.” LMAX Group’s Joel Kruger argued that the current price levels present a compelling accumulation opportunity, regardless of the underlying fundamentals. When evaluating where a “higher low” might emerge for equities and bitcoin, Kruger noted two “resistance-turned-support” levels: the S&P’s 2022 high around 4,800, as well as the $74,000 mark for BTC. “The weekend’s market turmoil has finally brought these critical zones into play,” he added. “We’re now looking at medium- and long-term levels that should strongly appeal to both US equity and bitcoin investors.” Hernandez views $72,000 (the breakout start point following the election) as a key support level to watch. Looking ahead, he points to expected Fed rate cuts serving as a tailwind for risk assets — with sidelined capital possibly returning to equities, credit and crypto as borrowing costs fall. The probability of a 25bps cut next month sat at 36% mid-day Monday, according to CME Group data . Hernandez added that BTC could see moderate single-digit percentage bumps from the rate cuts that could help it get back to six figures later this year. Longer term, he told me, a global trade war could spur countries fighting for currency dominance to gravitate toward BTC, given its neutrality and global liquidity.

On-Chain Analytical Indicators Say Yes,https://zycrypto.com/is-the-bitcoin-bull-cycle-over-on-chain-analytical-indicators-say-yes/,"Prominent Cryptocurrency founder and analyst Ki Young Ju believes the Bitcoin bull cycle has ended. Referencing on-chain market metrics, Ju explains his reasoning, citing key occurrences in previous weeks. Ju asserts that if an increase in the realized cap, a metric that tracks the flow of funds into Bitcoin through wallet movements, does not trigger a price surge for Bitcoin, the bears might have taken over. “A classic bearish signal,” he writes. On the flipside, a bullish signal can be observed when stagnation in Realized Cap does not interfere with the upsurge in market capitalization. “It suggests that even a small amount of new capital is driving prices higher.” Ju asstered. “Right now, we’re seeing the former—capital is entering the market, but prices aren’t responding. That’s typical of a bear market.” he noted. According to the analyst, a decrease in selling pressure could allow for small Bitcoin purchases to trigger a price pump, and by extension, an even higher pump in market cap value. The analyst points to MicroStrategy to validate the aforementioned observation, noting that the firm’s move to purchase Bitcoin from the proceeds obtained from the issuing of convertible bonds resulted in a spike in the value of the firm’s fiat holding, which was particularly higher than the capital deployed. His assertion suggests that small capitals are price drivers only in a bull market, while large capitals failing to trigger a price spike signals a bear market in play. Notably, the current on-chain data points to the latter. While selling pressure could be contained at any time, a short-term rally seems unlikely, as historical data shows that reversals typically commence after a six-month period. During this report, Bitcoin, having failed to sustain momentum above the $80,000 price level, is trading at $78,365 after losing more than 5% of its gains.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-07 19:31:16

The crypto asset has since recovered and is currently trading at $1,505. Despite this, its price was still down by 15% over the past 24 hours. This sharp decline comes as the broader cryptocurrency market reacts negatively to the Trump administration’s intensified global tariff approach. Data suggest that the $1,290 support level now marks a critical threshold for Ethereum, with whales’ average cost basis signaling potential recovery or further decline. Ethereum’s Next Major Support CryptoQuant’s analysis indicates that Ethereum’s next major support level is at $1,290, where the average cost basis (realized price) of whales holding over 100,000 ETH sits. With the average cost basis for all Ethereum holders around $2,200, many are currently facing losses. Despite this, the on-chain analytic platform stated that the altcoin has shown resilience in the past, such as during the Terra-Luna crisis in June 2022, when it reached a low of $870 but quickly rebounded. This suggests potential for recovery even in challenging market conditions. Meanwhile, whale activity and market behavior indicate that there may be more challenges ahead. As the asset’s price took a massive hit, Spot On Chain reported that an Ethereum ICO whale had deposited 7,000 ETH, which is worth approximately $10.21 million, to Kraken. Despite the recent deposit, the whale still holds 23,070 ETH, worth around $34.5 million, and has been offloading tokens during sharp price declines. The latest move appears to be bearish for its price in the short term. When a whale deposits a large amount of an asset to a crypto exchange, it often signals that they may be preparing to sell, especially considering that this particular whale has been offloading tokens during price drops. Ethereum Massively Undervalued On a positive note, IntoTheBlock has reported that Ether’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has dropped to 0.87, representing its lowest point since December 2022. This metric indicates that the asset is currently undervalued. A low MVRV suggests potential for a price recovery, as it reflects the possibility of accumulation among investors at discounted levels.

At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $78,568. However, on the Ethereum side, the impact of the decline was more severe. ETH saw below $1,450 for the first time in a long time. So how did crypto whales trade during these declines? Here's what whales did, according to crypto onchain data providers. According to the data, two different crypto whales purchased 15,191 ETH worth $23.94 million during today’s market bottom. The first whale has accumulated a total of $57 million worth of ETH at an average price of $2,343 since February 11, 2024. At the time of writing, the whale’s total loss is $19.36 million.

This whale has currently lost $3.6 million from these purchases. On the other hand, onchain data suggests that one of the early whales that participated in Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) may have panicked in the face of the drop. This crypto whale moved 7,000 ETH worth $10.21 million to crypto exchange Kraken after the ETH price crashed. The whale currently holds 23,070 ETH worth $34.5 million. For Bitcoin, a crypto whale bridged $5 million worth of stablecoins to decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid, where he opened a long position at $77,231 with 20x leverage. The crypto whale with the short address 0xe41 closed his position at $77,100, according to Hyperliquid data, and incurred a loss. *This is not investment advice.

The asset manager led the investment round, with Ethereum ( ETH ) based stablecoin project Cap also attracting the participation of multiple leading web3-focused venture capital firms. In details shared via X, Cap said the investment is a crucial step in its mission to offer a decentralized solution to the problem of yield generation in decentralized finance . This milestone involves the deployment of its protocol across “shared security markets” such as EigenLayer and Symbiotic. “Cap is pioneering a first of its kind implementation of shared security markets like EigenLayer and Symbiotic to regulate the activities of financial operators. This allows traditional finance institutions and crypto-native firms to generate yield for users, while not directly exposing those users to the risks of their activities,” the protocol’s team posted on X.

This means users can benefit from staked assets on Ethereum. However, Cap’s main focus is the adoption on MegaETH, the layer 2 offering for real-time interaction with opportunities across the ecosystem. It suggests safe and sustainable yield generation, something that could mean allowing for fresh innovation that beats the current yield-bearing stablecoins. By being able to outsource yield generation through its stablecoin engine, Cap enables traction across a whole lot of blockchain applications, including DeFi protocols,real-world asset protocols, and liquid funds. The $8 million seed round will help the stablecoin startup navigate the next phase of its adoption, with this adding to the $1.1 million raised via crowdfunding project Echo. Cap raised its latest financing round with the support of VC firms such as Triton Capital, Flow Traders, GSR and Japanese firm Nomura Group’s Laser Digital.

Moreover, the Nasdaq-listed company did not acquire any Bitcoin over the last week amid Bitcoin’s price slump. Strategy Down $6 Billion on Its Bitcoin Bet in Q1 2025 Strategy is under pressure as its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy faces a massive loss. During the first quarter, Strategy purchased 80,715 BTC for $7.66 billion using proceeds from its at-the-market equity offering. While the Tysons, Virginia-based firm bought BTC for an average price of $95,000 in Q1, the price of the alpha crypto closed below $84,000 and dived 12%, as per CoinGlass data , marking its worst quarterly performance since 2018. The lethargic price performance extended Strategy’s unbooked losses for Q4 2024. According to an April 7 filing , the company expects to report a net loss for the first quarter due to a $5.91 billion unrealized loss on its Bitcoin stash. Notably, Strategy did not acquire any new BTC between March 31 and April 4 as it did not sell any class A common stock, MSTR, and STRK, its perpetual strike preferred offering, within that period. The Bitcoin holding company holds over 528,000 BTC as of press time. Since it started buying Bitcoin in August 2020, Strategy has spent around $36 billion adding the largest crypto to its treasury at an average price of $67,458. Its Bitcoin stockpile, worth approximately $43 billion, represents nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million. While Strategy halted Bitcoin buys last week, its co-founder and Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, continued highlighting the crypto’s superiority on X. “Bitcoin is most volatile because it is most useful,” Saylor postulated on April 3, shortly after BTC nosedived from the intra-week high of $87,100 on April 2 to sub-$82,000, following the tariffs announcement by US President Donald Trump. “Today’s market reaction to tariffs is a reminder: inflation is just the tip of the iceberg,” Saylor noted in another X post. “Capital faces dilution from taxes, regulation, competition, obsolescence, and unforeseen events. Bitcoin offers resilience in a world full of hidden risks,” he continued. Bitcoin is currently trading for $77,748, showing a 5.3% fall over the last day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko .

As of mid-day trading on April 7, Bitcoin is up almost 1% to nearly $79,000. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 — an index of large US stocks — is essentially flat and front-month gold futures are down around 1.5%, according to Google Finance. “Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said in an April 7 research report. Notably, Bitcoin’s supply of long-term holders continues to rise, “reflecting conviction and limited capitulation during recent volatility,” Binance said. On April 2, Trump said he was putting tariffs of at least 10% on most imports into the United States and adding additional ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from 57 countries. Since then, major US stock indices — including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — dropped by more than 10% as traders braced for a looming trade war. Bitcoin is still down more than stocks — about 12% — but has held up better than crypto’s overall market capitalization, which is down roughly 25% since April 2. “Now, with reciprocal tariffs emerging and global markets adjusting to the prospect of prolonged trade fragmentation, much could hinge on BTC’s ability to reassert its safe haven narrative,” the report said. Source: Binance Research Related: Crypto stocks down, IPOs punted amid tariff tumult Changing asset correlations Bitcoin’s correlation with gold — historically considered the ultimate safe haven asset during times of extreme macroeconomic uncertainty — has been low, averaging around 0.12 over the past 90 days, Binance said. The cryptocurrency has a closer correlation with equities of 0.32. However, “despite short-term swings, BTC may still have room to reassert a more independent macro identity,” according to the exchange. “The key question is whether BTC can return to its long-term pattern of low correlation with equities,” noted the report. Source: Binance Research For now, gold appears to be the preferred safe haven asset among fund managers, Binance said. It cited a survey in which 58% of respondents said they would prefer to hold gold during a trade war versus only 3% for Bitcoin. “Market participants will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,” Binance said.

Imagine a future where managing your pension is not only more efficient but also radically transparent. This isn’t about jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon; it’s about leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain to overhaul traditional systems. Let’s delve into why this is a noteworthy development and what it could mean for the future of pension fund management . Why is South Korea’s NPS Considering Blockchain? The NPS manages a colossal amount of assets, making efficiency and transparency paramount. Traditional fund management systems, while functional, often grapple with issues like opacity in transactions and cumbersome processes. South Korea NPS recognizes the potential of blockchain to address these pain points. Here’s a breakdown of the key drivers behind this exploration: Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides an auditable and transparent record of all transactions. This drastically reduces the scope for errors and fraud, fostering greater trust among stakeholders. Increased Efficiency: Streamlining processes like deposits, withdrawals, investments, and transactions using blockchain can lead to significant time and cost savings. Smart contracts can automate many of these processes, reducing manual intervention. Improved Security: Blockchain’s decentralized and cryptographic nature offers robust security against cyber threats and data manipulation, crucial for safeguarding vast sums of pension funds. Modernization of Infrastructure: Adopting blockchain technology aligns the NPS with modern technological advancements, positioning it as a forward-thinking institution committed to innovation. What Does ‘Pre-Standardization’ Mean for Blockchain Adoption in Pension Funds? The NPS’s announcement of a ‘pre-standardization process’ is a crucial step. It signifies a methodical and cautious approach to blockchain adoption . This phase is about gathering crucial insights and feedback from industry experts, especially those within the blockchain space. Think of it as a comprehensive fact-finding mission. The NPS isn’t rushing into implementation; instead, it’s laying the groundwork by: Consulting Experts: Engaging with blockchain specialists to understand the technology’s nuances, potential applications within pension management, and best practices for implementation. Assessing Feasibility: Evaluating the technical feasibility of integrating blockchain into existing NPS systems, identifying potential challenges and solutions. Defining Standards: Working towards establishing industry standards for blockchain use in pension fund management, ensuring interoperability and scalability. Risk Assessment: Thoroughly analyzing potential risks associated with blockchain adoption and developing mitigation strategies. Fund Transparency: The Cornerstone of Trust in Pension Systems Fund transparency is not just a buzzword; it’s the bedrock of public trust in pension systems. When individuals entrust their retirement savings to institutions like the NPS, they expect clarity and accountability. Blockchain’s inherent transparency can dramatically enhance this aspect. Consider these benefits: Feature Traditional System Blockchain-Based System Transaction Records Centralized, potentially opaque Decentralized, immutable, and auditable Data Accessibility Limited access, potential delays Real-time access for authorized parties Auditability Complex, time-consuming Simplified, continuous auditing Security Vulnerable to single points of failure Enhanced security through cryptography and decentralization Blockchain and Bitcoin: Clearing the Confusion It’s crucial to understand that while the NPS is exploring blockchain, this initiative is distinct from investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The article explicitly states, “However, this does not mean the NPS intends to invest in blockchain or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).” Blockchain technology is the underlying infrastructure, a digital ledger system. Bitcoin is just one application of blockchain. The NPS’s focus is on leveraging blockchain’s operational benefits, not engaging in the volatile world of crypto asset investments. This distinction is vital for policymakers and the public to grasp. What are the Potential Challenges of Blockchain in Pension Management? While the potential benefits are compelling, adopting blockchain technology in a system as critical as pension management isn’t without challenges. Here are some hurdles the NPS and similar institutions might face: Scalability: Pension funds handle massive transaction volumes. Ensuring the chosen blockchain solution can scale to meet these demands is crucial. Regulatory Landscape: Regulations surrounding blockchain in finance are still evolving. Navigating this landscape and ensuring compliance will be essential. Integration Complexity: Integrating blockchain with existing legacy systems can be technically complex and require significant investment. Data Privacy: Balancing transparency with data privacy requirements, particularly concerning sensitive personal information, needs careful consideration. Skill Gap: Implementing and managing blockchain systems requires specialized expertise, which might necessitate workforce training and development. The Future of Pension Fund Management: A Glimpse into Tomorrow South Korea’s NPS exploring blockchain technology for pension fund management is a powerful indicator of the technology’s growing maturity and mainstream acceptance. It’s not just about theoretical benefits anymore; it’s about real-world applications in critical sectors. This move could pave the way for other major pension funds globally to consider similar initiatives, potentially leading to a more transparent, efficient, and secure future for retirement savings worldwide. The pre-standardization process is a crucial first step, and the world will be watching closely to see how this unfolds and potentially revolutionizes how we think about and manage pensions.

On April 7, 2025, the market’s opening saw dramatic losses, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all dropping sharply, and concerns over the economic fallout intensified. As a result, many are questioning whether Trump will reconsider his tariff policies to prevent further damage to the market and the broader economy. Stock Market Crash Hits Historic Losses Amid Escalating Tariff Tensions The U.S. stock market faced one of its worst days in recent history on April 7, as tariffs imposed by President Trump triggered a sharp sell-off. Over $2.1 trillion got wiped out from the U.S. stock market during the day’s trading session, with major indexes experiencing deep declines. After touching a record high a few months ago, the S&P 500 plummeted by 4%, with the same impact reflected in the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq. At the same time, the market lost all its gains in the previous twelve months, raising investors’ concerns due to economic uncertainty. This stock market decline was triggered by escalating tensions in trade relations between the United States and China, especially Donald Trump’s new tariff increase. Because of China’s reciprocity action through putting a 34% tariff on the American products, concerns of the trade war and global recession persist. Peter Schiff and Bill Ackman Sound the Alarm Peter Schiff an economist and Trader has opined about the current environment warning of the risks that lie ahead. Currently, Schiff continues to be of the opinion that the market has not properly priced the possibility of an upcoming recession, especially if the tariffs persist. He stated that the current values of the markets are over-estimated, or have been for sometime now, including the recent dip in the market. Schiff stated that the U.S is likely to experience the worst recession since the Great Depression and said that a 50% market decline might not adequately capture the scale of the upcoming issues. Concurrently, Peter Schiff has predicted that the Ethereum price may drop to $1,000 under these market tensions. Another voice that echoed such sentiments amid the stock market crash was that of billionaire investor Bill Ackman who expressed his concerns regarding the trade war citing its potential impact on the economy. Ackman categorised this as a ‘self-imposed, economic winter’ saying that the president’s approach would make things worse. However, he accused the administration of provoking the trade war and urged the president to declare a ceasefire because of the negative impact on the economy. Robert Kiyosaki Warns of a Coming Depression Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has been very vocal in his criticism of traditional financial markets. He noted the stock market crash may get worse and there is bigger collapse incoming. Kiyosaki had predicted that the current downturn would lead to a recession, possibly even a depression. In his recent statements, Kiyosaki emphasized that the market is heading toward a “destruction of fake paper assets,” referring to the overvalued stocks, bonds, and other financial products that have been driving the economy. Kiyosaki has continuously encouraged people to invest in assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin which he calls a “safe haven’ , as they will not be as severely affected by another financial crisis. He noted that inflation, and money printing is causing the downfall of the US dollar and adding to the fear of an economic collapse. Kiyosaki proceeded to say that the current bear market is an indication of the fact that the world financial system may be at the precipice of a change. Will Trump Reassess Tariffs to Ease Market Turmoil? As the stock market crash persist and apprehensions over a recession increase, the focus shifts to whether Trump will change his stance on tariffs or not. Losses on the U.S. stock market and global economic instability have prompted some experts to assume that Trump may have to reverse his actions concerning tariffs. Despite the criticism, Trump has remained firm in his stance, stating that the tariffs are necessary to address long-standing trade imbalances and unfair practices. Moreover, Donald Trump warned China that if they do not withdraw their 34% retaliatory tariffs, the U.S. will impose an additional 50% tariff . This hardline approach has raised concerns that the trade war could continue to escalate, further destabilizing the global economy. Some investors, like Ackman and Schiff, have called for Trump to reconsider his strategy. They argue that the tariffs are already causing significant economic damage and that continuing down this path could lead to even worse outcomes. Schiff has been particularly vocal in warning that the market is not properly pricing in the risk of a major recession, and that the current market decline may just be the beginning.

US President Donald Trump Sets the Final Word,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/tariff-confusion-will-they-really-be-suspended-for-90-days-us-president-donald-trump-sets-the-final-word/,"US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he is not considering suspending any tariffs at this time, as international markets react sharply to conflicting signals from the White House. Despite global concerns about the impact of ongoing trade tensions, Trump reiterated his administration's tough stance on tariffs, suggesting they could be permanent even though negotiations are still on the table. “We will reach a fair agreement with all countries,” Trump said at a press briefing, adding: “Trade with the EU must be fair and reciprocal, and the EU will have to buy energy from us.” Trump also noted the maintenance of a strong relationship with Japan, noting that bilateral relations remained positive despite rising global trade tensions. The president’s comments come as he has issued a new ultimatum to China, demanding that it cancel retaliatory tariffs on US goods. Otherwise, Trump warned that new tariffs of up to 50% would go into effect starting Wednesday. The statement has raised concerns about the risk of a serious global economic downturn, especially as Wall Street has come to the end of another turbulent day. Earlier in the day, false news that the tariffs could be suspended briefly boosted market sentiment, but stocks and cryptocurrencies have fallen again following Trump’s renewed threats. Related News: Large Cryptocurrency Whales Made These Trades During Today's Drop - Here's Onchain Data Economic adviser Miran echoed Trump's stance, saying the president welcomes any country willing to remove trade barriers to U.S. exports. Miran also said the administration believes its deregulatory policies will help control inflation in the long run. But Miran admitted that no final decision had been made on whether any trade deal would be reached before bilateral tariffs come into effect on April 9. “That decision rests solely with President Trump,” he said. Fox News reported that the White House has shifted its communications strategy to focus on messages aimed at stabilizing financial markets and said trade negotiations are ongoing. *This is not investment advice.

43046060,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146966,1744055435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Plummeting Norwegian Krone: EUR/NOK Soars to 8-Month High Amid Oil Price Slump,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/norwegian-krone-oil-price-slump/,"In the volatile world of currency exchange, where geopolitical winds and economic tides constantly shift, the Norwegian Krone (NOK) has recently experienced a significant downturn. For those in the cryptocurrency sphere, accustomed to market fluctuations and seeking to understand broader economic trends, the performance of traditional currencies like the NOK offers valuable insights into global market dynamics. The Norwegian Krone has alarmingly tumbled to its lowest level against the Euro in eight months, creating ripples across the Forex market. What’s fueling this dramatic shift, and what does it mean for traders and the Norwegian economy? Let’s dive into the details. Why is the Norwegian Krone Under Pressure? The Oil Price Factor Norway, a nation renowned for its breathtaking fjords and high quality of life, also heavily relies on its oil and gas sector. As a major exporter of crude oil, the Norwegian economy is intrinsically linked to global oil prices . When oil prices slump, as they have been recently, it directly impacts Norway’s revenue streams and overall economic outlook. This, in turn, puts downward pressure on the Norwegian Krone . Think of it like this: if the backbone of your economy takes a hit, your currency is likely to feel the strain. This recent dip in oil prices is a primary catalyst for the Krone’s weakening position against the Euro. EUR/NOK Surges: What Does an Eight-Month Low Mean? The EUR/NOK exchange rate is the metric we use to measure the Krone’s value against the Euro. When you see headlines about the Krone hitting an eight-month low, it signifies that the EUR/NOK rate is climbing. A higher EUR/NOK means you need more Norwegian Krones to buy one Euro. For example, if the EUR/NOK rate was previously 10 and it rises to 11, it means the Krone has become weaker. This recent surge in EUR/NOK to an eight-month high indicates a significant weakening of the Norwegian currency. But why should you, as someone interested in crypto, care about this? Currency Exchange Rate Dynamics: Crypto Parallels Understanding the factors influencing the currency exchange rate between traditional currencies like EUR and NOK can provide a framework for analyzing the volatility and movements within the cryptocurrency market. Both Forex and crypto markets are driven by supply and demand, influenced by factors like economic news, investor sentiment, and global events. While the underlying assets are different, the principles of market dynamics are surprisingly similar. Just as oil price fluctuations impact the NOK, news events, technological advancements, and regulatory changes can trigger significant price swings in Bitcoin or Ethereum. Learning to interpret Forex market signals can sharpen your understanding of broader market behaviors, applicable even in the digital asset space. Decoding the Slump: Key Factors at Play Several interconnected factors contribute to the current weakness of the Norwegian Krone. Let’s break them down: Falling Oil Prices: As discussed, this is a major headwind. Lower oil prices mean reduced export revenue for Norway, impacting its trade balance and currency value. Global Economic Uncertainty: Uncertainty in the global economy often leads investors to seek safe-haven assets. The Euro, being the currency of a major economic bloc, can be perceived as relatively safer compared to currencies of smaller, commodity-dependent economies like Norway. Interest Rate Differentials: While Norway has been raising interest rates, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) monetary policy and future outlook also play a role. Relative interest rate expectations can influence capital flows and currency valuations. Market Sentiment: Market sentiment can be a powerful force. Negative news or outlook for the Norwegian economy can further dampen demand for the Krone, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. Impact and Implications: What Does This Mean for Norway and Beyond? The weakening Norwegian Krone has several implications: Increased Import Costs: A weaker Krone makes imports more expensive for Norwegians. This can lead to inflation, as imported goods become pricier. Boost to Export Competitiveness (Excluding Oil): While oil exports are priced in USD, a weaker Krone can make other Norwegian exports more competitive in international markets, potentially benefiting non-oil sectors. Impact on Tourism: For tourists holding Euros or other stronger currencies, Norway becomes relatively more affordable, potentially boosting the tourism sector. Pressure on Norges Bank: Norway’s central bank, Norges Bank, will be closely monitoring the Krone’s depreciation. They might consider interventions, such as further interest rate hikes, to stabilize the currency if the slump becomes too pronounced. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn From the Krone’s Plunge? While predicting currency movements with certainty is impossible, understanding the underlying drivers can provide valuable insights: Diversification is Key: For Norway, this situation underscores the importance of diversifying its economy beyond oil and gas. For investors, it highlights the risk of over-reliance on commodity-dependent currencies. Global Interconnectedness: The Krone’s slump is a stark reminder of how interconnected global economies are. Events in the oil market, broader global economic trends, and central bank policies all play a role in shaping currency valuations. Risk Management in Forex and Crypto: Whether you are trading Forex or cryptocurrencies, understanding macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on asset values is crucial for effective risk management. Currency fluctuations, like the NOK’s current situation, can create both opportunities and risks. Looking Ahead: Will the Krone Recover? The future trajectory of the Norwegian Krone will depend on a multitude of factors. A rebound in oil prices would certainly provide significant support. Global economic stabilization and any shifts in central bank policies could also influence the EUR/NOK rate. Monitoring these factors closely will be crucial for anyone tracking the Norwegian Krone and the broader Forex market. For crypto enthusiasts, observing how traditional currencies react to economic pressures offers a valuable comparative perspective on the dynamics of different asset classes. Conclusion: Navigating Currency Volatility The recent slide of the Norwegian Krone against the Euro serves as a compelling case study in currency market dynamics. Driven by the slump in oil prices and broader economic uncertainties, the EUR/NOK pair has surged, highlighting the interconnectedness of global markets. For those engaged in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these Forex movements provides a broader context for market analysis and risk management. By observing the factors influencing traditional currencies like the NOK, we can gain deeper insights into the forces that shape all financial markets, including the exciting and ever-evolving world of digital assets.

With interests in Austrian economics and open-source software, he was “captivated” by bitcoin as the intersection of both. He became an early thought leader, co-founding the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute to house foundational writings and cypherpunk philosophy. Across roles at BitPay, Kraken, and most recently Riot Platforms (RIOT), his work has spanned bitcoin infrastructure and advocacy. At Riot, he led responses to environmental criticisms, including a viral parody video that “put the critics on the defensive” and reframed the debate around mining and value creation. Pierre Rochard is a speaker at Consensus 2025, in Toronto, May 14-16. Get your pass here. “Critics think mining is wasteful because they don’t believe bitcoin has value,” Rochard said. “But it’s about monetary sovereignty — the ability to control your own money.” Now, with The Bitcoin Bond Company, he is taking on the next frontier: unlocking bitcoin for fixed-income investors. Unlike Michael Saylor’s long-only strategy, Rochard wants to build “bankruptcy-remote, bitcoin-only structures” with clear life-cycles and risk-tranching. The idea is to make Bitcoin more palatable to traditional credit allocators. His goal? Acquire $1 trillion in bitcoin over the next 21 years — market conditions permitting. On the price cycle, Rochard believes the four-year halving model is losing relevance for price prediction purposes. “Bitcoin’s CAGR is now tied to interest rates,” he said, noting its shift toward becoming a global macro asset. “Higher Fed rates pull capital out of Bitcoin — that’s what slows adoption.” While education remains a major hurdle, he’s optimistic. “Ten years ago, this idea was laughed off. Today, Bitcoin-backed credit products are inevitable.” At Consensus 2025, Pierre is focused on accelerating that education, especially among institutions looking to diversify beyond real estate and equities. Rochard was also clear-eyed about the risks and hurdles in bitcoin adoption. “The biggest challenge is education,” he emphasized. “Most investors have never seen a fixed-income product backed purely by bitcoin. They’re used to real estate or corporate debt — this is a new asset class for them.” When asked about concerns like low transaction fees or empty blocks in 2025, Rochard pushed back. “People worry about low fees, but that assumes a static system. If there’s ever an attack or censorship, fees skyrocket — and miners spin up. It’s anti-fragile by design.” Ultimately, Rochard’s pitch is simple: “Bitcoin is no longer a fringe experiment. It’s a core monetary technology — and it’s time the credit markets caught up.” Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

In a new post to the social media platform X, Pizzino tells his 131,000 followers that, despite being down 20% in the last month, XRP’s skid is not finished. Says Pizzino, “XRP breaking 50% fib pre-US open. My next price target is still ~$1.40” Source: Jason Pizzino/X XRP is worth $1.87 at time of writing, down 12% in the last week. Turning to layer-1 smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ), Pizzino refers to the 3-bar rule – which aims to spot trend reversals or continuations based on the behavior of the previous three closing prices – to suggest a Solana crash to $60. “The first 3-bar rule signaled in November 2024. The second signaled in January 2025. Now SOL is sub $100 for the first time in over 12 months. Next price targets are $80 then sub $60 which would be an 80% decline. Not out of the ordinary for a major altcoin correction.” Source: Jason Pizzino/X SOL is trading for $106 at time of writing, down 16% in the last week. Looking at the Solana rival Ethereum ( ETH ), Pizzino again predicts more pain for the largest altcoin by market cap. “Ethereum ~$1500 target hit and being tested. If this fails, the next price target is ~$1200.” Ethereum is also down 16% in the last week, trading for $1,574 at time of writing.

Bears Have Eyes on $1.20 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In this ongoing market crash, XRP, Ripple Labs’ native token, is poised for a massive price decline despite its recent price recovery. Today, March 7, 2025, the overall crypto market has witnessed a significant downward rally, but it now appears to be recovering. However, some see this as a potential pullback before an upcoming price crash. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP appears to be continuing its downward momentum. The daily chart reveals that XRP is currently retesting its recent breakdown of the key support level at $1.95. Source: Trading View In addition to the support breakdown, XRP has also breached the neckline of a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern and has closed a daily candle below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This is the first time XRP has fallen below its 200 EMA, which now shifts it into a strongly bearish asset. Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, the candle closing below the key level has opened the path for a massive price crash, as the next support is not nearby. Source: Trading View According to CoinPedia’s price analysis, if XRP fails to reclaim the $1.95 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 39% to reach the next support at the $1.20 level in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $1.88 and has recorded a price decline of over 6.50% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, amid the price drop, the asset also hit a low of $1.64. This significant downside move and increased price volatility have attracted notable interest from traders and investors, resulting in a 420% surge in trading volume. $35.40 Million Worth of Bullish Bet However, looking at the ongoing price recovery, trader sentiment seems to be shifting as they are strongly betting on the bullish side, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $1.833 on the lower side (support) and have built $35.40 million worth of long positions.

With Solana’s price fluctuations making it harder for long-term growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available in Phase 4 presale for $0.025 per token during the present phase. Phase 5 price will increase to $0.03 after the phase 4 finishes. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) collected $6.3 million through the investments of more than 7900 holders. Analysts project that Mutuum Finance assets will experience an astonishing growth to $3 after launch. Investors have less time before phase 4 completes. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin that is backed by USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 7900 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity Throughout the Phase 4 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.025. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.025 to $0.06 to create up to 140% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. Investors who are participating in the first phase and purchase MUTM tokens at the $0.025 price point the current MUTM capital now exceeds $6.3 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is set to achieve wider adoption through its prize giveaway of $100,000 for donating ten $10,000 MUTM tokens to users. The site adds more value to users who are capable of attracting new investors as it drives user engagement and community growth rates higher.

With over $6.3 million raised in its Phase 4 presale and more than 7,900 investors already onboard, MUTM is quickly establishing itself as a viable alternative in the DeFi space. Analysts predict that the token could surge to $3 post-launch, making it a prime candidate for those looking to maximize returns in the DeFi sector.

Experts believe the Chainlink (LINK) future is gaining traction, with forecasts suggesting it could climb to $47 by 2025 as DeFi demand increases. At the same time, the Avalanche (AVAX) price outlook is recovering fast—up 35% since its March lows and now eyeing a move toward $48 if current momentum continues. Meanwhile, BlockDAG just raised the bar—shipping 10,000 X30 and X100 physical miners directly to its users. This isn’t talk. It’s action—tangible Web3 infrastructure entering people’s hands. These miners strengthen the network and back BDAG coins with real-world value. With rewards about to go live, early supporters are set to benefit the most, positioning BlockDAG as the best crypto for 2025. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Delivers: Miner Shipments Begin to Drive Decentralization BlockDAG’s latest Keynote 3 update made it clear: the project has entered a new phase by shipping 10,000 physical miners to prepare for its mainnet. These X30 and X100 devices are already reaching global users, making BlockDAG’s decentralization efforts more than just plans—they’re becoming a reality. The X30 model can produce up to 600 BDAG daily, while the X100 supports more powerful setups. Both use the keccak256 algorithm and support the network’s hybrid of Proof-of-Work and DAG systems. With mainnet rewards going live soon, early miners will be first to start earning. Keynote 3 also spotlighted the Beta Testnet V1, which is already processing more than 1.2 million transactions across 100+ community nodes. With strong security checks and new user tools in place, BlockDAG is building one of the most complete ecosystems heading into 2025. The presale numbers reflect growing support—over $212 million has already been raised, and 19.1 billion BDAG coins have been sold. Currently, Batch 27 is available at $0.0248, with a 150% retroactive bonus for purchases before the testnet phase ends. With real hardware, active development, and limited-time offers, BlockDAG continues to stand out as the best crypto for 2025. What to Expect from the Chainlink (LINK) Future: $47 Target Still in Sight The Chainlink (LINK) future is once again under the spotlight, with analysts pointing toward long-term growth. Current predictions show LINK may reach $47 by 2025, thanks to rising demand for secure data solutions across smart contracts and DeFi platforms. Even in a downtrend, LINK is expected to maintain support at around $31, with an average target of $39 for the year. Looking ahead, the Chainlink (LINK) future could stretch to $189 by 2030. Milestones along the way include $61 in 2026, $105 in 2028, and $143 in 2029. This growth will likely come from more real-world projects relying on Chainlink for reliable data feeds and expanding smart contract use across decentralized apps. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Outlook Builds Strength After March Recovery The Avalanche (AVAX) price outlook is becoming more optimistic after a solid 35% recovery from its March 11 low of $15.27. Market watchers suggest the recent correction may be over, especially with AVAX pushing to break past the $22 resistance level. A confirmed move above this line could lead to short-term gains up to $30.73, with longer-term targets at $48 based on pattern analysis and Fibonacci levels. Although weekly indicators like RSI and MACD remain under pressure, the daily charts offer a different view. Bullish divergences appeared before the recent climb, and Elliott Wave theory suggests the downtrend could be ending. If AVAX keeps its pace and breaks the $22 barrier, the Avalanche (AVAX) price outlook may shift strongly upward going into Q2. Final Thoughts The Chainlink (LINK) future remains strong, with targets showing a possible rise to $47 by 2025 and $189 by 2030, backed by increased use in DeFi and smart contracts. The Avalanche (AVAX) price outlook also shows upside potential after bouncing 35% from March lows, with the next target at $48 if it crosses major resistance. But if you’re looking at real progress and decentralization, BlockDAG is setting the standard. With 10,000 miners shipping out, the network is backing its talk with action. Having raised over $212 million and entering Batch 27 at $0.0248, BlockDAG is building value with real mining, real rewards, and capped availability—making it the best crypto for 2025 .

To read full editions, subscribe . Surprise, surprise. Wall Street’s favorite fear index is spiking. The Cboe Volatility Index was hovering around 48 Monday afternoon after spiking to 60 overnight. The index measures projected S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days. The VIX’s 30-day moving average has been on the rise in recent weeks, coming in at 21.4 at the beginning of the month vs. its long-running average of 19.5. We’re now almost four standard deviations above the long-term average, marking a level of volatility most recently seen in 2020 and 2008. You’re going to see a lot of comparisons to 2020 and 2008 in the coming weeks. While the sizes of the selloffs may be similar, I’d argue the sentiment could not be more different. The 2008 crash was characterized by broad mistrust in the financial system and uncertainty around how stability would be restored. Markets eventually recovered thanks to a massive stimulus package, financial bailouts and regulatory reform. In 2020, the recession was caused by global lockdowns, resulting in supply chain disruptions, mass layoffs and slower growth. Relief came alongside another massive stimulus package and government policies to reopen the economy. The situation we’re in today is not the result of a collapsed financial system or a global pandemic. It would take a single tweet from the president (or a misinformed X account , as we saw today) to push stocks into the green. I’m still undecided on if that’s better or worse.

Swissblock says on the social media platform X that it’s keeping a close watch on the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), a metric that combines liquidity and network growth. According to Swissblock, the BFI is strengthening , indicating the steady entry of new market participants who bring fresh liquidity into the BTC network. “Bitcoin is signaling a bottom, not the end of the bull market! The bottoming process is in its final stages, with an explosive move likely next. BFI is telling us what is next.” Source: Swissblock/X Swissblock says Bitcoin’s liquidity conditions need to rise a little higher to confirm a massive bullish reversal. “Once liquidity crosses the 50 threshold, the shift will be abruptly bullish, leaving little room for the bears to react.” Source: Swissblock/X Based on Swissblock’s chart, Bitcoin’s liquidity level is hovering at 44. According to the analytics firm, its bullish outlook on BTC is supported by the surging M2 money supply, which tracks the total amount of money in circulation within an economy. “This aligns with the growth in M2 supply. Bitcoin has been lagging that growth, but it’s catching up, gradually.” But while Swissblock is bullish on BTC, the firm notes that it is still within the realm of possibility for BTC to witness another sell-off event. “Yes, in the short term, the bottoming process is underway and entering its final phase. What comes next is likely an explosive upward move. And yes, another breakdown is still possible in the short term. In terms of price, it would represent an entry point for new participants, and more liquidity into the system.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $75,014, down over 7% on the day.

43046327,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=726321,1744056024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43046327.jpeg,Solana Drops Below $100 For First Time In A Year — Is An 80% Correction Underway?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-drops-below-100-for-first-time-in-a-year-is-an-80-correction-underway/,"Solana is now trading below the $100 mark after intense selling pressure swept through the crypto market over the weekend. Sunday’s drop pushed SOL into its lowest price zone in more than a year, signaling a sharp shift in sentiment as fear grips the market. Since the start of March, Solana has lost more than 45% of its value, and momentum suggests the downtrend may not be over yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Support Level – Will DOGE Hold? The breakdown has sparked concern among investors and analysts alike, with many warning that SOL could be headed for deeper lows if current support fails to hold. Top analyst Jason Pizzino shared a technical analysis pointing out that this is the first time in over 12 months that Solana is trading below the $100 level — a historically significant threshold. According to Pizzino, the next major price targets sit at levels levels that would represent an 80% total decline from Solana’s recent highs. Such moves, while steep, aren’t uncommon during heavy altcoin corrections. With macro uncertainty and broad market weakness driving risk-off behavior, Solana’s path forward will likely depend on whether bulls can reclaim key levels — or if more downside is still to come. Solana Faces Critical Breakdown As Analysts Eye Deeper Correction Solana is now undergoing a crucial test as the price trades below $100 for the first time in over a year. Bulls are under pressure to reclaim key levels quickly in order to prevent further downside. However, the broader macroeconomic landscape paints a grim picture. Global markets remain rattled by escalating trade war tensions and policy uncertainty stemming from the U.S. and China, with financial conditions tightening across the board. For high-risk assets like Solana, the backdrop suggests the decline may still have room to continue. Pizzino has shared a bearish technical outlook that supports this view. He highlights the significance of Solana’s repeated bearish signals using the “3-bar rule.” The first warning appeared in November 2024, followed by another in January 2025. Now, with SOL firmly trading below $100, Pizzino believes the next targets lie at $80 and potentially sub-$60 — a level that would represent an 80% correction from Solana’s recent highs. While that may seem extreme, such pullbacks are not unusual in major altcoin cycles, particularly when driven by broader market panic. Related Reading: Ethereum Lags Behind Bitcoin In Q1 Performance Amid Market Downturn – Details For Solana, the path forward hinges on whether bulls can reclaim momentum soon. A push back above the $110–$120 zone could shift sentiment and delay deeper losses. Until then, the market remains on edge. Solana Bulls Fight to Avoid Further Losses Solana is currently trading at $100 after briefly dipping to $95 — a price level not seen since February 2024. The sharp correction highlights the intense selling pressure that has taken hold of the market in recent weeks. As fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment, SOL remains vulnerable to deeper losses if bulls fail to step in. The $100 level is now a psychological and technical battleground. While bulls are attempting to defend it, the broader market context — shaped by global macroeconomic instability and weakening investor confidence — suggests the recovery may face significant resistance. For Solana to regain momentum and signal a possible trend reversal, it must reclaim the $120 zone, which previously served as a key support level. Related Reading: Massive Chainlink Demand Wall At $6.26 As 90K Investors Buy 376M LINK However, selling pressure remains strong, and if SOL fails to hold the $100 threshold, a move into lower demand zones becomes increasingly likely. Analysts point to the $80 level as the next critical area where buyers may look to step in. Until then, price action remains fragile, and the downtrend could extend if broader market conditions fail to improve. For now, all eyes are on whether $100 can hold — or break.

BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Shifts the Odds in Its Favor—$30 Highly Realistic,https://thecoinrise.com/ada-pepe-price-predictions-risks-in-the-air-blockdags-keynote-3-shifts-the-odds-in-its-favor-30-highly-realistic/,"In crypto, volatility comes with the territory. But structural risk—the kind that hides under price action—is harder to spot and even harder to price in. That’s exactly what separates the current positioning of three very different assets. A $3.74 million whale buy brought some temporary optimism to Pepe’s price prediction, but volume has since dropped hard. Cardano’s price looks steadier—but only on the surface. Repeated failures at $0.70 have pushed ADA back to $0.65, with $0.60 creeping closer. BlockDAG (BDAG) is a different story. The risk here isn’t in the design—it’s in waiting too long. Every presale batch pushes the price higher. The fundamentals behind that curve aren’t speculative—its recently released Keynote 3 laid out a hybrid model built to avoid the scaling mess most chains are still stuck in. Right now, BDAG sits at $0.0248 in Batch 27. By 2030, the target is $30. That gap isn’t theoretical—it’s already shrinking! Pepe Price Prediction: $0.0000077 Holds But Resistance Looms The current Pepe price prediction reflects a chart driven more by volatility than conviction. Trading just above $0.000007, PEPE remains heavily sentiment-based, with little in the way of technical support or structural growth. Its all-time high in May 2023 created massive short-term profit narratives, but since then, the momentum has thinned. RSI levels sit in neutral territory, while volume has been declining across major exchanges. Without a utility layer or deeper integration into DeFi ecosystems, the pepe price prediction leans entirely on speculative capital. ADA Price Below $0.70 Again—Is $0.60 the Next Stop? The Cardano (ADA) price forecast remains fragile as the asset consolidates near $0.650 following a failed attempt to reclaim $0.70. Despite a brief strength above $0.68, ADA’s price broke below its bullish trendline and the 100-hour moving average—both signs of short-term weakness. The next key support sits at $0.6350; a break there puts $0.60 in view. The upside hinges on clearing $0.70, which could open room toward $0.7420, but the current structure leans bearish. Volume remains muted, and without stronger confirmation, any bounce risks are short-lived. BlockDAG Fixes What Legacy Blockchains Can’t—$30 To Follow Soon? Most blockchains are still trying to stretch the limits of sequential structure. It’s a model that was never built for scale—and every attempted workaround, from Layer 2s to sidechains to batching mechanisms, ends up adding complexity without really solving the problem. BlockDAG’s latest Keynote 3 didn’t just acknowledge that issue. It showed what it looks like to build something that doesn’t inherit those constraints, to begin with. “Our hybrid consensus mechanism combines the best of two worlds: the security and proven robustness of Proof-of-Work with the flexibility and speed of a Directed Acyclic Graph,” said CTO Jeremy Harkness. In practice, that means parallelism: a structure where multiple blocks can be confirmed at once without bottlenecking into a single queue. There’s no congestion. No transaction stacking. No race-to-the-block inefficiencies. Just throughput that scales because the system is designed for it. There’s no shortage of networks talking about scale. But when a presale raises $212 million and sells 19.1 billion coins without relying on institutional capital, it’s not just a proof of concept—it’s a real network. That’s why BDAG isn’t being valued like a token—it’s being priced like an entire system coming online. The current entry is $0.0248 in presale batch 27. The long-range projection? $30 by 2030. Most will miss it because they’re still waiting for signs that have already arrived. And when the price moves, they won’t call it obvious. They’ll call it too late. Which Is the Top Crypto to Buy Right Now? Across these three names, the difference isn’t just price—it’s architecture, timing, and what the market chooses to reward. The PEPE price prediction relies heavily on sentiment spikes, but the lack of utility underneath makes every rally feel more like a countdown. Cardano continues to trade on reputation and research, but the ADA price action tells a quieter story: one of shrinking volume and stalled momentum. BlockDAG, by contrast, is already producing the signals most networks can’t engineer—even post-launch. The network’s recently launched Keynote 3 laid out a hybrid model that skips the scaling problems that other chains are still patching. The numbers are already public: $212 million raised in crypto presale , 19.1 billion coins sold, and a $30 projection by 2030. What’s not visible is how few are paying attention while the foundation is still this accessible. That’s how mispriced assets look—until they’re not.

The latest reading of the Altcoin Season Index is creating quite a buzz. If you’re navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding market cycles is crucial. Right now, all signs point towards one thing: we’re firmly in a Bitcoin Season . Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Should You Care? The Altcoin Season Index is your compass in the often-turbulent seas of the crypto market. Think of it as a barometer, gauging whether Bitcoin or altcoins are currently leading the charge. This insightful metric, provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), cuts through the noise and gives you a clear picture of market momentum. Here’s the breakdown of how this index works: Scope: It analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus on genuine market dynamics. Timeframe: The index assesses the performance of these coins over the past 90 days, providing a medium-term perspective on market trends. Benchmark: It compares altcoin performance against Bitcoin. This is the core of the index – are altcoins outshining Bitcoin, or is Bitcoin reigning supreme? Scoring: The index ranges from 1 to 100. A score above 75 signals an “Altcoin Season,” while a score below 25 indicates a “Bitcoin Season.” Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at a mere 17, as of April 7th, 00:46 UTC. This low score emphatically confirms that we are not in altcoin territory; instead, Bitcoin dominance is the prevailing theme. This is a crucial insight for traders and investors as it can inform strategic decisions about asset allocation. Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: Understanding the Market Cycle The crypto market is cyclical, swinging between periods where Bitcoin outperforms altcoins ( Bitcoin Season ) and times when altcoins surge ahead (Altcoin Season). Understanding these cycles is key to maximizing your gains and mitigating risks. Bitcoin Season: The Reign of the King In a Bitcoin Season , Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, takes center stage. This typically happens for several reasons: Flight to Safety: During market uncertainty or downturns, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven compared to more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often begin by investing in Bitcoin due to its established track record and greater liquidity. Narrative Focus: Positive news or developments specifically related to Bitcoin, such as ETF approvals or regulatory clarity, can drive Bitcoin’s price and dominance. Altcoin Season: When Alternatives Shine Conversely, Altcoin Season emerges when a significant portion of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. This phase is often characterized by: Risk-On Sentiment: When the market is bullish and investors are feeling optimistic, they tend to venture into altcoins seeking higher growth potential. Innovation and Narratives: Exciting developments in specific altcoin projects, such as advancements in DeFi, NFTs, or layer-2 solutions, can fuel altcoin rallies. Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong Bitcoin run, profits may rotate into altcoins as traders look for the next big gains. Bitcoin dominance vs Altcoin potential – Navigating the Crypto Seasons Navigating the Crypto Market in a Bitcoin Season With the Altcoin Season Index firmly in Bitcoin territory, what are the actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts? Portfolio Review: Assess your portfolio’s exposure to Bitcoin and altcoins. In a Bitcoin Season , a higher allocation to Bitcoin might be prudent. Risk Management: Altcoins can be more volatile than Bitcoin. Be mindful of risk management, especially if you are heavily invested in altcoins during a Bitcoin dominant phase. Bitcoin Focus: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action, news, and on-chain metrics. Bitcoin’s movements often dictate the broader market direction. Selective Altcoin Opportunities: While it’s a Bitcoin Season overall, some altcoins may still present opportunities. Look for fundamentally strong projects with unique catalysts, but exercise caution. Patience is Key: Market cycles shift. Bitcoin dominance may not last forever. Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the market evolves and the Altcoin Season Index changes. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Crypto Landscape The current crypto market presents both challenges and opportunities. Bitcoin dominance can be seen as a period of consolidation and maturation for the market. While altcoin gains may be subdued for now, it doesn’t negate the long-term potential of many innovative projects. Challenges: Altcoin Underperformance: Lower returns on altcoin investments compared to Bitcoin during this phase. Market Uncertainty: Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate broader market uncertainty or a risk-off environment. Emotional Trading: It can be tempting to chase short-term pumps in altcoins, but disciplined strategy is crucial during Bitcoin Season. Opportunities: Bitcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin, potentially at more favorable prices relative to altcoins. Research and Due Diligence: Use this time to thoroughly research promising altcoin projects and prepare for potential future Altcoin Seasons. Strategic Rebalancing: Rebalance your portfolio to align with the current market conditions and your risk tolerance. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Cycle The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the crypto market. The current reading of 17 underscores the prevailing Bitcoin dominance . By understanding these market cycles, adapting your strategies, and staying informed, you can navigate the crypto landscape more effectively and position yourself for potential success in both Bitcoin Season and the eventual return of Altcoin Season. Remember, the crypto market is dynamic, and informed decisions are your greatest asset.

As other cryptocurrencies remain flat, these digital assets show signs of bouncing back. This article delves into why these particular coins are poised for growth and why now might be the time to consider them as a smart investment. Litecoin Market Update: Navigating Key Level Dynamics Litecoin experienced a sharp decline over the past month with prices falling nearly 38% and a weekly drop close to 26%. Over the past six months, the overall slide of around 2.8% reflects a period marked by volatility and persistent downward swings. The recent moves suggest that bearish pressures have affected the coin, indicating unsettled market behavior without a steady upward momentum. Currently, Litecoin trades in a range between $65 and $116, with key resistance at $148 and support around $48. Bears remain dominant as technical indicators show low values, with an RSI near 22 indicating oversold conditions. Short-term trading strategies may focus on targeting a bounce from support or monitoring for a break toward the higher resistance level. Ondo Token Trends: Short-Term Drop with Stable Long-Term Base Ondo price actions over the last month show a sharp decline of over 30%, while the half-year performance has been milder with a drop of just 2%. Price weakness over the last week of 15% also supports the view that downward pressure has been significant in the short run. The recent drop stands apart from more moderate long-term movements, indicating increased volatility in the short term. Current prices lie between $0.60 and $1.10, with support around $0.41 and resistance at $1.42. Bears currently hold the edge, as momentum and oscillator readings are in the negative. Traders might consider a reversal play near the support zone or short positions if prices remain below the resistance level. Kaspa Faces Bearish Momentum Amid Declining Prices Kaspa experienced a significant downturn over the last month and six months. The coin fell about 23.5% in one month and dropped 61.61% over the past half-year, with a weekly decline of 17.22% underscoring the persistent sell-off. Price indicators, including momentum, oscillators, and overall sentiment, have consistently pointed to a weakening market, marking a clear period of pressure. The coin is currently trading between $0.0485 and $0.0875, with key resistance at $0.11 and a secondary resistance at $0.149, while support holds near $0.03. A low RSI of 28.95, negative moving averages, and downbeat momentum indicators deepen the bearish outlook. Traders might look to enter near support and consider shorting near resistance levels. Conclusion Litecoin , Ondo , and Kaspa show strong potential for investors. Their current low prices present an attractive buying opportunity. Litecoin has a solid reputation and wide acceptance. Ondo offers innovative financial solutions that make it stand out. Kaspa's focus on security and speed gives it a competitive edge. Together, these factors indicate promising growth ahead.

With this collaboration, users can buy crypto through their existing debit and credit cards connected to digital wallets on both desktop and the Binance app. This development comes shortly after Binance secured a record-breaking $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based tech investor MGX , showing renewed institutional confidence in Binance’s long-term vision. MGX plans to advance AI-blockchain integration by building on Binance’s infrastructure. Binance has announced a strategic partnership with global payment technology giant Worldpay.

For many first-time users, crypto adoption begins with a simple transaction that involves converting fiat into digital currency. According to Binance, this integration improves access for both experienced users and underbanked populations globally. As Nabil Manji, Head of FinTech Growth at Worldpay, noted, the partnership allows users to explore crypto with the same ease and assurance they enjoy in e-commerce. The strategy centers on simple access, particularly in regions with low credit card usage but widespread mobile adoption. New users can now be onboarded into the Web3 ecosystem with the tap of a phone; no banking infrastructure is required. The introduction of these two widely used digital wallets also supports Binance’s broader vision for fiat channels. In 2024, the exchange expanded its fiat and P2P infrastructure across 20 new countries, rolled out mobile money integration in nine African nations, and added 18 new fiat channels tailored for both retail and corporate clients. These channels, from local bank transfers to mobile wallets, empowered over 260 million registered users, who transacted more than $100 trillion in cumulative volume. Retention rates tell the story of success, with over 60% of Fiat & P2P users in 2024 engaged in repeat transactions. Binance Joins a Growing Movement of Crypto Payment Innovations Binance’s work with fiat integration follows a wider pattern in crypto, as platforms connect digital assets to everyday use cases. A recent example is Zebec Network’s launch of Zebec Carbon , a crypto debit card developed in collaboration with Mastercard. @Zebec_HQ has launched Zebec Carbon, a Solana-powered crypto debit card in partnership with @Mastercard , allowing seamless digital asset spending anywhere Mastercard is accepted. #mastercard #solana https://t.co/cixo7fywJ8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 27, 2025 The card, launched on March 27, allows seamless spending of stablecoins like USDC wherever Mastercard is accepted and offers features like zero fees, instant activation, and full Apple Pay and Google Pay compatibility. Like Binance’s integration with Worldpay, Zebec’s product caters to users seeking a more intuitive and private way to use digital assets. It even removes traditional onboarding hurdles; U.S. residents don’t need ID verification, and transactions remain private. While Zebec is relatively new in the space, it joins seasoned players like MetaMask, Floki, and Avalanche, all of which have recently launched or expanded crypto debit card offerings. MetaMask’s card , currently available in the EU, UK, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale. MetaMask Crypto Card lets US users to make everyday purchases with crypto anywhere Mastercard is accepted. #MetaMask #CryptoCard #CryptoDebitCard https://t.co/dTZLlFbEht — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 19, 2024 It supports major stablecoins and integrates directly with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Similarly, Floki’s card supports multi-chain assets and offers both digital and physical versions. Avalanche’s Visa-powered card , meanwhile, launched in Latin America and includes features like spending alerts, self-custody controls, and PIN customization. As the barriers between traditional and digital currencies continue to dissolve, these partnerships may ultimately determine whether cryptocurrencies remain largely speculative assets or become embedded in everyday financial transactions.

That would mean an average 53% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), taking the middle ground between the report's conservative scenario of $12 trillion in tokenized assets in the next eight years and a more optimistic $23.4 trillion projection. Tokenization is the process of using blockchain rails to record ownership and move assets—securities, commodities, real estate. It's a red-hot sector in crypto, with several global traditional financial firms pursuing tokenization to achieve efficiency gains, faster and cheaper settlements and around-the-clock transactions. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform has already processed more than $1.5 trillion in tokenized transactions, with over $2 billion in daily volume. BlackRock’s tokenized U.S. dollar money market fund (BUIDL), issued with tokenization firm Securitize, nears $2 billion in assets under management and is increasingly being used in decentralized finance (DeFi). “[The] technology is ready, regulation is evolving, and foundational use cases are in the market,” said Martijn Siebrand, Digital Assets Program Manager at ABN AMRO, in the report. The report highlighted tokenized government bonds, U.S. Treasuries, as an early success, allowing corporate treasurers seamlessly shift idle cash into tokenized short-term government bonds from digital wallets without any intermediaries, managing liquidity in real time and around the clock. Private credit is another sector drawing attention, opening access to traditionally opaque and illiquid markets while offering investors clearer pricing and fractional ownership. Similarly, carbon markets are flagged as fertile ground, where blockchain-based registries could enhance transparency and traceability of emissions credits. Key challenges still linger Despite the growth, the report identified five key barriers for broader adoption: fragmented infrastructure, limited interoperability across platforms, uneven regulatory progress, inconsistent custody frameworks, and lack of smart contract standardization. Most tokenized assets today settle in isolation, with off-chain cash legs limiting efficiency gains. Tokenized asset markets struggle to unlock secondary liquidity without shared delivery-versus-payment (DvP) standards. Regulatory clarity varies significantly by region. Switzerland, the EU, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates have developed comprehensive legal frameworks for tokenized securities and infrastructure, while major markets like India and China remain restrictive or undefined. This uneven progress complicates cross-border operations and forces firms to tailor infrastructure market-by-market. Despite these headwinds, early adopters are expanding fast. The report identifies three phases of tokenization: low-risk adoption of familiar instruments like bonds and funds; expansion into complex products such as private credit and real estate; and full market transformation, including illiquid assets like infrastructure and private equity. Most firms are currently in the first or second phase, with scalability hinging on regulatory alignment and infrastructure maturity. Cost is becoming less of a constraint for firms, the report said. Focused tokenization projects can now launch for under $2 million, while end-to-end integrations—covering issuance, custody, compliance, and trading—can cost up to $100 million for large institutions. Tokenization can unlock meaningful savings for processes such as bond issuances, real estate fund tokenization and collateral management, driving further growth, the report noted. However, without industry-wide coordinated action, the same silos and fragmentation tokenization seeks to eliminate could reemerge in digital form, said in the report Jorgen Ouaknine, global head of innovation and digital assets at Euroclear, a global financial market infrastructure provider.",Markets|Tokenization|Tokenized Assets|Real World Assets|Ripple,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-07 20:09:46
