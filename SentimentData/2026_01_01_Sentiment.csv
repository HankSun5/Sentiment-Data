In a press release, the company said it intends to issue the token to shareholders of its publicly traded stock, DJT, in partnership with Crypto.com. The distribution will be carried out using Crypto.com’s infrastructure, with the token expected to run on the Cronos blockchain, which is designed to support high transaction throughput and interoperability across networks. Trump Media said Airdrop Token does not equal ownership According to the announcement, each ultimate beneficial owner of DJT shares would be eligible to receive one digital token for every whole share they own, beginning at a record date that will be set in the future. Trump Media said token holders may periodically receive rewards throughout the year, which could include benefits or discounts tied to its products, including Truth Social , the Truth+ streaming platform, and its prediction market product, Truth Predict . Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced a new partnership with https://t.co/U4D4dECttR that will bring prediction markets to the social media platform, positioning it as the first publicly traded social media com… https://t.co/A8spbfSGB9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 28, 2025 The company emphasized that the token is not intended to function as equity or a financial security. Trump Media said the digital asset will not represent ownership in the company or any other entity, and that holders should not expect rewards tied to profits generated through managerial efforts. The token may also be non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash, according to the disclosure. Trump Media chief executive and chairman Devin Nunes said the company sees the token as a way to reward shareholders while operating within what it described as improving regulatory clarity. He added that the company plans to rely on Crypto.com’s blockchain technology to implement the distribution. Trump Media said further details about how and when the token will be issued are expected to be released in the new year. Source: Google Finance The announcement comes as Trump Media’s stock showed renewed activity, as the shares of DJT were recently trading at about $13.30, up roughly 5.85% on the day, reflecting investor attention following the token disclosure. As Revenue Plateaus, Trump Media Leans Deeper Into Digital Assets Financially, the company continues to report modest revenue alongside sizable losses. In the trailing twelve months of 2025, Trump Media reported revenue of $3.67 million, a slight increase of about 1.6% from 2024, when revenue totaled $3.61 million. Source: CompaniesMarketCap That figure, however, remains below the $4.13 million reported in 2023, the strongest year in the past three-year period. The data shows that revenue growth has largely stalled, with the company struggling to meaningfully expand its income base. The token distribution fits into a broader pattern of crypto-related initiatives from Trump Media over the past year. In April, the company disclosed that it was exploring the launch of a utility token and a digital wallet as part of an expansion of Truth+, initially positioning the token as a way to pay for streaming subscriptions before potentially extending its use across other services. @realDonaldTrump Media has formally outlined its intention to launch a Truth-branded utility token and digital wallet, according to a filing with SEC. #Trump #Memecoin https://t.co/ZlWwP1Lyl3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 4, 2025 Trump Media has also expanded into financial products through its Truth.Fi brand. In January, the company announced plans to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets and to work with Crypto.com on launching crypto-focused exchange-traded funds. @realDonaldTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has made a $300 million investment in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities. #Trump #Bitcoin https://t.co/9p7fbJQNQW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 28, 2025 In July, Trump Media revealed it had invested $300 million in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities, seeking exposure to crypto price movements without directly holding the asset. By November, the company’s growing exposure to digital assets had also brought new risks into focus. Trump Media reported a quarterly loss of $54.8 million after Bitcoin prices declined, pushing earlier crypto purchases underwater and contributing to continued earnings pressure.

This transaction, valued at approximately $348 million, represents one of the most substantial stablecoin movements observed in recent months. Consequently, it raises important questions about institutional liquidity management, market preparation, and the underlying mechanics of major cryptocurrency exchanges. This analysis delves into the factual context, potential implications, and expert perspectives surrounding this notable blockchain activity. Decoding the $348 Million USDC Transfer The transaction, broadcast to the Ethereum blockchain, involved the precise movement of 348 million USD Coin (USDC) tokens. Whale Alert, a prominent service monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions, publicly flagged the transfer. Significantly, the movement occurred between two addresses associated with Coinbase, the leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. Specifically, the funds originated from a wallet labeled “Coinbase Institutional” and were sent to a primary “Coinbase” hot wallet. This internal movement highlights the complex treasury operations of a major exchange. Furthermore, such transfers are routine for managing liquidity between different business segments, including custodial services for large clients and the trading pool for retail customers. The Mechanics of Exchange Liquidity Management Exchanges like Coinbase manage billions in digital assets across multiple wallets for security and efficiency. Typically, they use a combination of cold storage (offline) for long-term holdings and hot wallets (online) for daily transactions. A transfer from an institutional custody wallet to a main exchange hot wallet often signals a need to bolster available liquidity for anticipated trading volume. For instance, this could prepare for large client withdrawals, facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) trades, or rebalance reserves after significant institutional deposits. Therefore, while the sum is eye-catching, the action itself is a standard operational procedure for a financial entity of Coinbase’s scale. Contextualizing Major Stablecoin Movements Stablecoins like USDC play a critical role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They act as a digital dollar equivalent, providing a stable store of value and a medium for trading between volatile assets. Major movements of USDC or its main competitor, Tether (USDT), are closely watched as potential indicators of market sentiment. However, analysts consistently warn against over-interpreting single transactions. A transfer between internal wallets of the same company, especially, may reflect internal accounting rather than a market signal. Meanwhile, external transfers to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or other exchanges can more clearly suggest upcoming trading strategies or capital deployment. USDC vs. USDT: USDC, issued by Circle, is known for its full reserve transparency and regular attestations, making it a preferred stablecoin for regulated institutions. Whale Watching: Services like Whale Alert track transactions exceeding certain thresholds, providing transparency but often lacking context. Liquidity Pools: Exchanges must maintain deep liquidity pools to ensure smooth trading and timely withdrawals for all users. Expert Analysis on Institutional Behavior Market analysts and blockchain forensics firms emphasize the importance of pattern recognition over isolated events. According to common analytical frameworks, a single large transfer is less informative than a trend. For example, a sustained series of deposits from institutional wallets to exchange hot wallets could suggest institutions are preparing to sell assets or convert holdings into fiat. Conversely, consistent withdrawals from exchanges to cold storage might indicate a long-term holding strategy. In this specific case, the intra-company nature of the transfer strongly points to routine treasury rebalancing. Seasoned observers note that such movements are a fundamental aspect of healthy, high-volume exchange operations and contribute to overall market stability by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available where needed. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The immediate market impact of this transfer was negligible, as it did not represent a net new buy or sell pressure on other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The USDC supply remained constant, merely changing its custodial address. However, understanding these flows is crucial for a complete market picture. Large inflows to exchange wallets can precede increased trading activity, as assets are positioned for easier access. Subsequently, monitoring follow-on actions is key. If the USDC in the Coinbase hot wallet is rapidly converted into other assets or used for large OTC purchases, it could signal underlying institutional demand. Alternatively, if it remains static, it likely serves as a liquidity buffer. Recent Notable Stablecoin Transfers (Comparative Context) Date Amount Stablecoin From To Likely Purpose Recent $348M USDC Coinbase Institutional Coinbase Internal Liquidity Management Q4 2024 $500M USDT Unknown Whale Binance Potential Trading Capital Q3 2024 $200M USDC Circle Treasury Minting Authority Supply Adjustment Conclusion The reported transfer of 348 million USDC from Coinbase Institutional to Coinbase is a substantial but standard operational event within the digital asset infrastructure. It underscores the immense scale of capital managed by leading cryptocurrency exchanges and the continuous internal processes required to maintain market functionality. While Whale Alert provides valuable transparency for such large transactions, accurate interpretation requires context, pattern analysis, and an understanding of exchange mechanics. This USDC transfer primarily reflects sophisticated internal treasury management rather than a direct signal of impending market movement. Ultimately, it highlights the growing maturity and institutional-grade operations within the cryptocurrency sector. FAQs Q1: What does a transfer from Coinbase Institutional to Coinbase mean? This typically indicates an internal rebalancing of funds, moving stablecoins from a custody wallet holding institutional client assets to the exchange’s main hot wallet to bolster available liquidity for trading, withdrawals, or OTC desk operations. Q2: Does a large USDC transfer like this affect the crypto market price? Usually not directly, as it is an internal movement that does not create new buy or sell orders for other cryptocurrencies. The impact is indirect, relating to changes in exchange liquidity that may facilitate future large trades. Q3: Why is USDC commonly used for such large transfers? USDC is a fully regulated and transparent stablecoin, regularly audited and attested. Consequently, institutions and exchanges favor it for large transactions due to its regulatory compliance and perceived lower counterparty risk compared to other stablecoins. Q4: How can I track transactions like this myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for the Ethereum network, entering a wallet address to see its history. Additionally, alert services like Whale Monitor aggregate and notify users of large transactions above a set threshold. Q5: Should I be concerned about such a large movement? Generally, no. For a regulated entity like Coinbase, these are normal treasury operations. Concern would be more warranted for unexplained movements from anonymous wallets to exchanges, which might indicate selling pressure.

In a recent release , the asset manager’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, stated that “we view XRPL’s native token, XRP, as a foundational building block for cross-border transaction efficiency.” The executive added that as a payments-first blockchain, the XRP Ledger enables real-time, low-cost settlement for institutions looking to facilitate large-scale transactions across different continents. XRP is seen as a foundational building block by Franklin Templeton https://t.co/qVVwPOtDUM — LJ (@luke_judges) December 31, 2025 Franklin Templeton’s Growing Integration With XRP Ecosystem This is not the first time Franklin Templeton has acknowledged the role XRP plays as a blockchain rail for traditional finance. In September, Singapore’s DBS Bank signed an MOU with Franklin Templeton and Ripple to list tokenized money market funds on DBS Digital Exchange. The partnership provided accredited and institutional investors with trading and lending solutions by leveraging tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger blockchain and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Analysts say this cohesion with traditional rails has increased the appeal of XRP and should soon reflect in the asset’s price. Since mid-October, when the XRP ETFs launched, the vehicles have seen $1.07 billion of inflows, “bucking the negative sentiment seen across other assets,” according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Specific vehicle data reflects that Franklin Templeton’s recently launched XRP fund alone captured $28.6 million of weekly volume. The capital flight from Bitcoin ($2.8B outflows since mid-October) coincides directly with the launch of spot XRP ETFs, showing institutions are reallocating risk budgets toward assets with fresh regulatory “wrappers” and lower saturation. If this continues, XRP can push to break the $3 resistance level and aim for new highs. XRP Price Prediction: Descending Trendline Breakout Could Target $3.50 On the technical front, the weekly XRP/USDT chart shows a market correcting after an aggressive impulse move from the November 2024 bottom near $0.50, which marked a clear long-term trend reversal. That rally carried XRP to the July high around $3.50, completing a near-600% advance before momentum began fading. Since then, price action has shifted into a controlled downtrend, defined by a descending trendline now acting as dynamic resistance. Source: TradingView At present, XRP is trading around $1.83, sitting well above the former macro base but below key overhead levels. The most important zone to watch is the $3.00–$3.05 area, which stands out as critical resistance. A decisive weekly close above this region would confirm a trendline breakout and open the path toward the July high near $3.50, which also aligns with projected 2026 upside targets. The weekly RSI has cooled into the low-to-mid 40s, reflecting the ongoing corrective phase rather than outright bearish dominance. From a directional standpoint, the chart favors a consolidation-to-reversal scenario rather than a deep retracement, as long as XRP holds above the mid-$1.50 region. Pepenode Presale Positions for XRP-induced Rally If XRP finally breaks the $3 resistance and starts trending upward again, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see significant gains. Pepenode is a crypto project that’s raised neaarly $2.5 million despite challenging market conditions.

In it, Duong and his team attributed the shift in policy as the motivation for banks and corporations to finally start building the technical infrastructure that will be required to take things on-chain. Duong called the year an “extraordinary” period for the crypto ecosystem, despite some of the “lackluster price action.” He went on to admit that the asset class is still defined by accelerating institutional adoption with a more diverse investor base reshaping overall demand, but that this only means the industry’s full potential is still far from realized. Meanwhile, tokenization and stablecoin s mo ved deeper into core financial workflows. He claim s th ey at Coinbase expect the positive forces to compound next year as stablecoins take a larger role in delivery-vs-payment structures, and tokenized collateral gets more recognition across traditional transactions. Coinbase sees crypto maturing in 2026 The report also claims that the investor base itself is no longer what it used to be and is now more diversified. In the past, crypto was used by early adopters who couldn’t be sure mass adoption would ever happen. But that has changed, and it is now dominated by institutions and a far wider cross‑section of allocators and end‑users. Demand has also gone from a monolith to become a mosaic of macroeconomics, technology, and geopolitics. According to him, if the industry executes on product quality, regulatory stewardship, and user‑centric design, it will be easier to help ensure that the next wave of innovation reaches everyone, everywhere, all the time. Coinbase’s CPO thinks America may fall behind China next year The competition for dominance in the new frontier that is crypto is bound to intensify next year, and President Trump has declared several times that he wants America to become the crypto capital of the world. Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, has expressed concern, warning that the United States could potentially lose ground in the global crypto if it proceeds with a ban on interest or rewards on U.S. stablecoins. The warning comes as countries are now competing more aggressively over digital money, and rewards or incentives could strongly influence which currencies come out on top. In an X post, Shirzad claimed the issue has become more serious since China’s central bank has announced that starting January 1, 2026, banks will be allowed to pay interest on digital yuan balances. This means the digital yuan will no longer be used just as digital cash; it will work more like a bank deposit that can earn interest. Chinese officials reportedly hope this will encourage more people to use it, since adoption has been slower than expected despite years of testing. Coinbase sees the GENIUS Act as a way to help U.S.-regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins become the main tools for digital payments worldwide. However, Shirzad has warned that banning rewards could hurt that goal and weaken the U.S. dollar’s role globally. To compete with China now, those rewards are non-negotiable. However, banking groups have been clear from the onset that they don’t want them, arguing that allowing rewards would make stablecoins too similar to bank deposits and could threaten financial stability. 2026 is bound to be tumultuous for all involved as the U.S. struggles to figure out how to proceed without crossing the very powerful parties involved . However, after the dust settles, the crypto sector is likely to be better off. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

U.S. Representative Warren Davidson (R-OH) has ignited a critical debate by asserting that current and proposed American crypto regulation is actively stifling innovation and, more fundamentally, killing the decentralization that defines the technology’s core value proposition. His analysis points to a legislative path that may cement traditional finance structures, potentially driving capital and talent overseas. The Core Argument: How Crypto Regulation Undermines Decentralization Representative Davidson’s critique, detailed in a recent social media thread, centers on a pivotal concern: the erosion of decentralization. He argues that the U.S. regulatory approach, through bills like the proposed GENIUS Act for stablecoins, enforces a “bank-centric, account-based” model. Consequently, this framework treats digital assets through the lens of traditional finance (TradFi), which requires identifiable intermediaries and custodians. This creates significant barriers. For instance, non-bank entities face immense difficulty offering interest-bearing services under such a model. Furthermore, the critical concept of self-custody —where users control their private keys and assets without a third party—receives inadequate protection. Davidson contends this regulatory stance makes decentralized systems functionally identical to the centralized systems they were designed to challenge. Account-Based vs. Token-Based: Traditional regulation understands “accounts” held at institutions. True decentralization operates on a “token-based” system where ownership is proven cryptographically on a public ledger. Capital Flight: Davidson links this regulatory pressure to the outflow of cryptocurrency businesses and investment from the United States to jurisdictions with clearer, more innovation-friendly frameworks. Legislative Indifference: He cites a lack of nuanced understanding in Congress as a contributing factor to the current regulatory deadlock and market downturn. Legislative Landscape: The GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act The debate is crystallized around two key pieces of proposed legislation. Understanding their mechanisms is essential to grasping Davidson’s warning. The GENIUS Act’s Federal Framework The Stablecoin Innovation and Protection Act (GENIUS Act) aims to create a federal regulatory floor for payment stablecoins. While providing much-needed clarity, its critics, including Davidson, argue it codifies the role of insured depository institutions (banks) as primary issuers. The table below outlines the core tension: Policy Goal Potential Consequence Consumer Protection & Stability Reinforces Centralized, Bank-Led Model Federal Regulatory Clarity Raises Barriers for Non-Bank Innovators Defining Issuer Requirements Marginalizes Non-Custodial, Decentralized Protocols This approach, while potentially stabilizing the sector for institutional adoption, arguably sidelines the permissionless innovation that sparked the crypto revolution. A Potential Fix? The CLARITY for Market Structure Act Davidson identifies the CLARITY for Market Structure Act as a potential corrective measure. This bill seeks to delineate clearer boundaries between securities and commodities in digital assets and includes provisions meant to protect self-custody practices. However, Davidson expresses skepticism. He suggests that even if CLARITY passes, its protections for individual freedom may remain merely formal without dismantling the underlying account-based regulatory philosophy. The structural inertia, he warns, could persist. The Bitcoin Benchmark and the Future of Peer-to-Peer Finance Central to this discussion is the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Davidson highlights Bitcoin’s design as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that enables global value transfer without intermediary approval. This model represents the purest form of the decentralization ideal. The push for account-based regulation, therefore, is seen as a direct threat to this innovation, potentially forcing a groundbreaking technology back into the mold of the very system it sought to evolve. Experts in blockchain governance echo aspects of this concern. Dr. Sarah Allen, a regulatory technology scholar at Stanford, noted in a 2024 paper, “Regulatory frameworks that predicate compliance on identifiable intermediaries create a paradox for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and permissionless networks. The challenge is to protect consumers without mandating central points of control.” This expert perspective underscores the technical complexity lawmakers face. The global impact is already measurable. According to data from the Blockchain Association, venture capital funding for U.S.-based crypto startups fell by over 35% year-over-year in 2024, while jurisdictions like Singapore, the EU under its MiCA framework, and the UAE saw notable increases. This capital flight aligns with Davidson’s warning that legislative ambivalence has real-world economic consequences. Conclusion The critique leveled by Representative Warren Davidson frames a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in America. The central question is whether U.S. crypto regulation will evolve to nurture the unique, decentralized architecture of blockchain technology or inadvertently suffocate it by imposing traditional financial constructs. The outcome will determine not just market trajectories but the very location of the next wave of financial innovation. As the debate over the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act continues, the fundamental tension between consumer protection and technological revolution remains unresolved, with the core principle of decentralization hanging in the balance. FAQs Q1: What is the main criticism Rep. Davidson has against current crypto regulation? Davidson argues it enforces a centralized, bank-account model that is incompatible with and stifles true decentralization, driving innovation and capital out of the United States. Q2: How does the GENIUS Act for stablecoins affect decentralization? The GENIUS Act focuses on federally regulating stablecoins primarily through insured banks, which reinforces a centralized issuance model and creates high barriers for non-bank or decentralized protocol issuers. Q3: What is self-custody, and why is it important in this debate? Self-custody means users hold their own private keys and control their assets directly on the blockchain, without a bank or exchange as an intermediary. It is a cornerstone of decentralization, and critics say current regulations do not adequately protect it. Q4: Could the CLARITY Act solve these regulatory problems? While the CLARITY Act includes protections for self-custody and aims to clarify market structure, some skeptics believe it may not fully overcome the entrenched account-based regulatory approach, limiting its transformative potential. Q5: What is the real-world impact of this regulatory uncertainty? Data shows venture capital and crypto business formation are shifting to regions with clearer digital asset rules, suggesting the U.S. is experiencing capital and talent flight due to regulatory stagnation.

India’s Reserve Bank has urged countries in its Financial Stability Report to prioritize digital currencies issued by banks over privately issued stablecoins. What is the Indian government’s attitude towards stablecoins? The Reserve Bank of India released its Financial Stability Report this Wednesday, and within the report is a strong warning against stablecoins, stating that “risks from stablecoins to macrofinancial stability outweigh their purported benefits.” The RBI “strongly advocates” that countries should prioritize Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) over privately issued stablecoins to maintain trust in money and preserve financial stability. Stablecoins have gained increasing acceptance globally, but the central bank is more concerned with the financial stability risks associated with their growing use. India has been working on its own digital rupee for over two years. The RBI started testing the digital rupee in December 2022, and the pilot program now has over 5 million users and 400,000 merchants, according to recent reports. India has not banned cryptocurrencies, but the government taxes crypto gains at 30% and adds a 1% tax on all crypto transactions, making it hard to use. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said repeatedly that India will not recognize private cryptocurrencies as legal money. The report also revealed that gross bad loans of Indian banks could drop to 1.9% by the end of March 2027 from 2.1% recorded at the end of September 2025. “The Indian economy and the financial system remain robust and resilient,” Governor Sanjay Malhotra wrote in the report’s foreword. “Nonetheless, we recognize the near-term challenges from external spillovers and continue to build strong guardrails to safeguard the economy and the financial system from potential shocks.” How are India’s Non-Banking Financial Companies doing? The RBI conducted stress tests on 174 Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) over a one-year period, and results revealed that gross bad loans of non-bank lenders may rise to 2.9% in September 2026 from 2.3% in September 2025. The RBI noted that “even as the GNPA (gross non-performing assets) ratio in NBFCs has declined, fresh accretions to NPAs are trending higher.” Additionally, companies are writing off more loans, indicating a build-up of stress in their loan portfolios. Non-banking financial companies provide credit to sectors and borrowers that traditional banks may not serve. Any significant stress in this sector could have ripple effects throughout the economy. The central bank also warned that insurance companies are spending more money, which will hurt the profits of the sector. In October 2025, the RBI told NBFCs to be more selective with their loans after it was observed that some NBFCs were taking too many risks with personal loans and credit cards. Several large NBFCs have already reported higher bad loans in recent months. The RBI’s report included stress test scenarios that model different economic conditions. If the economy maintains its normal condition, that is, a GDP growth of 7.3% for the current financial year and 6.7% and 6.8% for the first two quarters of 2026-27, the banking sector will continue to strengthen. However, gross bad loans may rise to 3.2% if economic growth slows down slightly. A sharp economic decline could push bad loans to 4.2%. The European Central Bank is working on a digital euro .

BREAKING NEWS: U.S. LAWMAKERS ARE TARGETING JANUARY 15 FOR A MARKUP OF THE LONG-AWAITED MARKET STRUCTURE LEGISLATION, THE ‘CLARITY ACT!’ JANUARY 2026 WILL BE BIG FOR #XRP AND CRYPTO! https://t.co/XCpHivF3lC pic.twitter.com/7wCSGRExHk — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 31, 2025 Traders are already positioning around a renewed regulatory push. ETH is trading near $2,965 , up about 0.3% on the day and roughly 5% over the past month; meanwhile, SOL is trading around $124 , up about 1.4% on the day and 0.7% over the past month. Key Provisions of the CLARITY Act Staffers working on the CLARITY Act text state that the current draft keeps the CFTC in the lead for non‑security fungible tokens that meet trading and decentralization tests, while codifying an SEC regime for tokens that rely on ongoing managerial efforts and offer yield or revenue‑share features. That split tracks how recent SEC enforcement complaints described named assets, but for the first time, it would place the test in statute instead of case law and speeches. On DeFi, lobbyists who reviewed the December redline say the bill would treat front-end operators, order-routing interfaces, and fee-collecting DAOs as registrants, while leaving a safe harbor open for immutable, fee-free smart contracts with no upgrade keys. Political Environment and Market Sentiment Prediction markets are also mirroring rising expectations that lawmakers will break the deadlock this cycle. On Kalshi, contracts tied to the passage of a broad federal digital asset framework by mid‑2026 are trading at materially higher probabilities than in early Q4, with open interest increasing as the markup date looks to be officially confirmed. Traders used those markets through 2023–2025 as an informal policy barometer during failed pushes on earlier House‑driven bills. Banking Committee members from both parties, including senators who previously backed narrower market‑structure efforts, have told industry groups they want to avoid a repeat of prior cycles where the House passes a digital asset package that then dies in the Senate without a committee vote. A clean markup that yields a bipartisan manager’s amendment would set up a path to 60 votes on the floor, but staff still expect aggressive amendments on DeFi custody, sanctions enforcement, and treatment of crypto‑native stablecoin rewards in retirement accounts. “My colleagues and I in the House and Senate share the same goal: to provide clear rules of the road for digital assets that protect investors, foster innovation, and keep the future of digital finance anchored in America,” said Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, in a July 2025 discussion draft . Additionally, the CLARITY Act debate doesn’t happen in isolation. ETH drew over $1.3 billion in fresh staking flows from institutional vehicles in late December, according to recent staking data and fund disclosures, while Solana continues to capture high-beta flows after a year where its market cap rebounded sharply from 2022 levels. Those flows price in some probability that the next Congress delivers a workable regime instead of continued rule‑by‑enforcement. Institutional Market Implications For desks that run serious size in ETH and SOL, this markup functions as a binary policy catalyst rather than political theater. A bipartisan CLARITY Act draft that survives the committee with a clear CFTC lane for sufficiently decentralized L1s, a knowable registration path for DeFi front-ends, and an explicit ceiling on “reward‑like” stablecoin yields reduces headline risk for Ethereum-centric yield strategies and Solana liquidity provisioning, and it makes it easier for large U.S. venues to list and margin a broader set of tokens. If the session breaks down into party-line votes or pushes DeFi into a de facto unworkable regime, the trade flips: U.S. flows migrate further offshore, regulated venues lean into BTC plus a handful of blue chips, and the regulatory overhang discount on anything that looks like a revenue-share or staking derivative widens again.

Three of the most exciting ones to watch as the year draws to a close include Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano (ADA) remains a popular choice as it continues to develop its ecosystem, boasts solid foundations for the coming year, and has stabilized its price near key levels, making it a solid choice for enthusiasts looking to buy on the way back into the mainstream crypto fold after a slight downturn. DOGE, meanwhile, remains a leader as the original meme coin sensation, with a devoted fan base prepared to spark another massive price rally should key psychological barriers be broken. Finally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi crypto coin that has only recently broken into the mainstream and is now undergoing its Phase 7 presale, with the cumulative funds reaching almost $20 million, offering crypto buyers a new, cheap crypto coin before its price increase. Among the top cryptos gaining attention, these three are often listed among the best cryptos to buy before 2026 kicks off. Cardano (ADA) Stabilizes Around Key Levels while Momentum Accelerates The current situation in the Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency market is that of consolidation around key support levels, currently trading around $0.37 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong recovery from the lows. It appears to be attempting to establish a structure but remains beneath a key level of supply, indicating that the market remains prudent and waits for validation. A strong break above the current resistance levels will shift this momentum and will shortly be followed by a recovery, although a break below the current support levels will result in consolidation. Regarding investors tracking this market, analysis favors an inclusive portfolio that incorporates sound network assets like ADA and the new Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For those seeking the top cryptos, MUTM ranks among the best cryptos to buy for the early months of 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE) Consolidates After Rally, Potential for Upside Dogecoin (DOGE) is in the process of consolidating on the weekly charts after the completion of an impulsive move, and the market is well within an accumulation zone. Although this is in a pullback phase, the overall market trends are positive, and the establishment of a strong foundation at these current market levels could fuel further upward moves once traction is gained. The current market condition of Dogecoin tends to showcase its robust nature in being one of the top cryptos in the market. However, investors are hedging their market positions in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for further rapid growth. Many analysts consider MUTM among the best cryptos to buy when looking at potential momentum-driven gains in 2026. MUTM Surges in Presale Stage 7 During a relatively sluggish market for token sales, including ADA and DOGE, MUTM is causing a stir as it continues further in its presale journey in the DeFi space. Presale phase 7 is up for purchase at $0.04, following the relatively fast sale of tokens in Phase 6. Phase 8 will see the cost increase to $0.045, which is nothing short of a 20% increase. This is one of the final opportunities to acquire MUTM tokens at this stage, making it one of the top cryptos for early investors looking for extraordinary upside. Mutuum Finance has so far raised $19.5 million with the support of 18,620 token holders, with pricing during Phase 7 set at $0.04. The project has already seen a 300% rise from Phase 1 pricing, which was set for $0.01, with plans to reach $0.06 at launch, meaning interested investors stand a chance to gain returns of as much as 400%. It should be noted, however, that most crypto projects lack tangible technology, but in MUTM, lending and borrowing capabilities exist, with this project being audited by Halborn Security , a cyber-security firm. Many see this project as one of the best cryptos to buy due to its strong fundamentals and early-stage opportunity. Leaderboard Incentives: Engagement, Activity Increase To further incentivize the community to participate in the platform, Mutuum Finance has rolled out a dashboard with the Top 50 Holders, where each person who topped the ranking for the respective day receives a bonus of $500 for MUTM, provided that they have made at least one transaction in the period. This further demonstrates the benefits of the MUTM token, emphasizing the token’s utilization-oriented framework, further establishing itself as a very promising and inexpensive DeFi investment opportunity. Among the top cryptos of 2026, MUTM stands out as an early-stage favorite and one of the best cryptos to buy for investors seeking high potential returns. While the clock ticks closer to the start of 2026, Cardano (ADA) presents a stable investment, Dogecoin (DOGE) breeds speculative fervor, and with a price of merely $0.04 in Presale Phase 7, MUTM presents unimaginable gains. With a raised amount of $19.5M, the number of token holders at 18,620 and quite practical usability through the offering of loans and borrowing, early investment in MUTM is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to harvest gigantic profits. For traders looking for top cryptos or the best cryptos to buy as 2026 approaches, these three remain key highlights in the market.

However, the broader picture remains fragile. Since early December, BTC has repeatedly failed to push above the $90,000 threshold, a level that continues to cap upside attempts and reinforce market hesitation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Adding to the cautious outlook, CryptoZeno, a CryptoQuant analyst, points to miner behavior as a growing short-term risk factor. According to his analysis, Bitcoin miner outflows are signaling rising sell-side pressure, a dynamic that has historically mattered during periods of weak momentum. The data shows a clear relationship between miner activity and short-term price movements. Sharp increases in total miner outflows—especially when large volumes of BTC are sent to exchanges—have frequently coincided with local price pullbacks rather than sustained rallies. Miners are often considered informed market participants, typically operating with relatively low cost bases. When their distribution activity increases, it can introduce additional supply at moments when spot demand is already struggling to absorb selling pressure. While miner outflows alone do not define a broader market top, they can amplify short-term weakness, particularly in range-bound conditions like the one Bitcoin is currently facing. Miner Outflows Reinforce Short-Term Downside Risks The report explains that recent spikes in Bitcoin miner outflows have repeatedly been followed by immediate or near-term price weakness, reinforcing the link between miner behavior and short-term market dynamics. These episodes suggest that miners—often considered informed participants with relatively low production cost bases—are actively distributing supply during periods of strength or heightened uncertainty. While a miner selling on its own does not signal a macro market top, it frequently adds incremental supply at sensitive moments, increasing short-term pressure when liquidity is thin, or spot demand is unable to absorb new inflows. CryptoZeno adds that elevated miner outflows typically reflect a combination of factors. These include profit realization after rallies, the need to cover operational expenses, or a defensive response to weakening price structure. From an on-chain perspective, this behavior is not unusual during corrective or range-bound phases. However, when miner transfers to exchanges cluster within a short time window, their impact becomes more pronounced. Concentrated outflows can materially increase sell-side pressure on exchanges, raising the probability of corrective price moves rather than sustained upside continuation. At the macro level, miner distribution becomes especially influential when paired with broader headwinds. Neutral or declining risk appetite, tighter liquidity conditions, or cooling derivatives sentiment all reduce the market’s capacity to absorb additional supply. In such environments, miner-driven selling is less likely to be smoothly digested and can instead amplify downside volatility, keeping Bitcoin vulnerable in the near term.

Following the sharp breakdown in November, price found support in the $85,000–$87,000 zone, where selling pressure began to ease and volatility compressed. Since then, BTC has been moving sideways, signaling indecision rather than a decisive trend reversal. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains capped below its declining short-term moving averages. The 50-day moving average continues to slope downward and acts as dynamic resistance. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages sit well above the current price, reinforcing a broader bearish structure. As long as BTC trades below these levels, upside attempts are likely to be sold into rather than sustained. Related Reading: XRP Selling Pressure Returns: Investors Shift From Holding to Distribution After the heavy sell-off in November, trading volume has gradually declined. This suggests that aggressive sellers have stepped back, but new demand has not yet entered with conviction. This typically characterizes a stabilization phase rather than the start of a new impulsive move. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a base, but confirmation remains absent. A daily close above $90,000 could signal a meaningful shift in momentum. And would open the door for a recovery toward higher resistance zones. Conversely, a loss of the $85,000 support area could expose BTC to another leg lower. For now, the chart reflects balance, hesitation, and a market waiting for a catalyst.

He suggests that several market factors and structural developments could align to drive this surge, creating a favorable environment that could position XRP for significant gains and lasting market impact. XRP Price And Demand Set To Skyrocket In 2026 In a recent X post, crypto analyst ‘X Finance Bull’ outlined the key catalysts from 2025 that could drive XRP demand and price in 2026. He emphasized that while everyone is watching price action, institutions are closely monitoring custody , compliance, and payment corridors, which are crucial for laying the groundwork for the cryptocurrency’s future growth. For 2026, the analyst points to several factors that could shape XRP’s price growth and future development. He highlighted XRP Spot ETF accumulation as a key driver, emphasizing that over 350 million XRP are currently held in ETFs, providing a solid base of regulated institutional ownership. X Finance Bull disclosed that XRP ETFs are already attracting institutional capital , reducing liquidity and signaling rising demand for the cryptocurrency as a regulated digital asset. He noted that ETF inflows represent structural buying that often precedes notable price appreciation. XRP’s supply dynamics are also expected to play a significant role in fueling a price surge. X Finance Bull explained that with fewer XRP available on exchanges , this could create structural pressure that may influence future price behavior. Combined with steady demand, this tightening supply could lay the groundwork for potential price gains in 2026. Another major factor highlighted by X Finance Bull is the growing utility of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The analyst noted that XRPL currently supports stablecoins, tokenization, and institutional DeFi—all features that could drive increased adoption and long-term growth of the cryptocurrency. He emphasized that increasing on-chain activity could drive transactional usage and position XRP as a bridge asset for settlements, liquidity routing, and broader financial infrastructure. Other Factors That Could Influence XRP’s Growth Next Year In his post, X Finance Bull also pointed to XRP’s current market structure as a supporting factor that could drive its price and demand upward. He explained that regulated crypto products, improved global risk sentiment, and the need for faster settlements are encouraging institutional adoption. He also stated that an increase in capital flows often precedes significant price movements, making institutional positioning a critical indicator for future market trends. In addition, the analyst mentioned Ripple’s expanding institutional infrastructure as a key driver that could boost the XRP price by making it easier for banks, payment providers, and enterprises to use the token. Finally, X Finance Bull noted that the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the US SEC has created much-needed regulatory clarity, opening the door for broader adoption and stronger demand.",XRP|ripple|X Finance Bull|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRP spot ETF|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 22:00:46

This batch targets major altcoins, including Aave (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI), and Sui (SUI), signaling a direct challenge to current regulatory boundaries that have largely confined ETF approvals to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and, more recently, Solana and XRP. Bitwise Pushes Deeper Into Altcoin ETFs According to the filings, the proposed products will sit under the Bitwise Funds Trust and trade on NYSE Arca if approved. The lineup includes strategy ETFs focused on AAVE, UNI, Zcash (ZEC), Near (NEAR), SUI, Tron (TRX), Starknet (STRK), Ethena (ENA), Bittensor (TAO), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and the Canton Network’s CC token. The prospectus outlined a consistent structure across the funds. Each ETF plans to hold up to 60% of its assets directly in the underlying token, while at least 40% would come from exchange-traded products, futures, or swaps that track the same asset. In some cases, exposure may be managed through offshore subsidiaries, a structure already familiar in commodity and crypto-linked funds. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reacted to the filings, writing on X that “money (and ETF filings) never sleeps,” a nod to the pace at which issuers are racing to secure first-mover advantage in altcoin products. Industry accounts such as ETF Hearsay also flagged March 16, 2026, as the tentative effective date, though fees and tickers remain undecided. The breadth of the filings stands out because while earlier cycles focused almost entirely on Bitcoin and later Ethereum, Bitwise is now targeting decentralized finance, layer-1 networks, privacy coins, and even AI-linked crypto through TAO, reflecting shifting investor interest. A Crowded and Competitive Landscape Bitwise has made its move at a time when crypto ETFs outside Bitcoin are already showing mixed but telling results. For example, spot Solana ETFs, which launched in October, had attracted more than $750 million in net inflows halfway through December, according to recent CoinShares data. Analysts noted that investors appear willing to hold these products through volatile price swings, suggesting longer-term positioning rather than short-term trading. Meanwhile, Ripple-linked ETFs have gone even further. As CryptoPotato previously reported, U.S.-listed XRP ETFs have recorded more than $1 billion in cumulative inflows without a single day of net withdrawals, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana funds during the same period. For now, the filings signal growing confidence from asset managers that investor demand extends well beyond the largest cryptocurrencies and that the ETF market may soon reflect that shift, pending the SEC’s response.

The job is to dig through the murky disaster of off-the-books financing that First Brands was using before the auto-parts supplier crashed into bankruptcy. According to a court filing from Wednesday, the committee representing unsecured creditors said they officially brought in Nardello on December 1. Their task includes digging into factoring and financing arrangements that money flowed through, and Nardello is also investigating accounts and shell entities tied to Patrick James, the founder of First Brands, plus other top insiders. Investigators are also looking at James and insiders The creditors’ committee asked the judge to let Nardello start work immediately, because time is tight and there are “time-sensitive matters” that need urgent attention in this Chapter 11 mess. And yes, the judge still needs to approve the company officially, but that’s standard. Meanwhile, Nardello’s track record is already on the table. The committee reminded the court that during the FTX case, Nardello helped claw back billions in assets for creditors. They also pointed out that Nardello is not new to high-profile wreckage. Nardello worked for creditors of Purdue Pharma, the opioid giant that filed Chapter 11 in 2019 after lawsuits over OxyContin. They also assisted in the Alex Jones case after the conspiracy theorist went bankrupt over that $1.4 billion Sandy Hook defamation ruling. This probe into First Brands is only one of many. The entire Chapter 11 collapse is now under a microscope. On top of the Nardello investigation, advisers working for the company have already sued Patrick James, accusing him of looting corporate funds. He denies doing anything wrong. Things are heating up elsewhere too. A former finance director at First Brands told creditors he plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment at his deposition. That means he doesn’t want to answer questions because of a federal criminal probe that’s already looking into the company. The legal mess is officially filed as First Brands Group LLC, case number 25-90399, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. There are no excuses left on the table.

Price action remains subdued, with ETH failing to sustain moves above key resistance levels, reinforcing the perception that investors are still cautious. Many analysts argue that the market has yet to fully reset, pointing to weak risk appetite, declining liquidity, and a lack of strong spot demand. As a result, Ethereum, like most major assets, remains trapped in a consolidation phase marked by hesitation rather than conviction. Despite this gloomy backdrop, a growing group of optimists believes Ethereum could be approaching a cyclical bottom. Their view is based less on short-term price action and more on structural and behavioral signals that tend to emerge during late-stage bearish phases. One of the most notable developments comes from on-chain data. According to data from Arkham shared by Lookonchain, Bitmine acquired another 32,938 ETH worth approximately $97.6 million just a few hours ago. Bitmine is a large institutional Ethereum-focused entity known for accumulating ETH at scale and deploying it across staking and long-term strategies rather than short-term trading. With this latest purchase, Bitmine now holds roughly 3.357 million ETH, valued at around $10 billion, making it one of the largest known Ethereum holders. Bitmine Deepens Long-Term Commitment Ethereum’s near-term price action remains fragile, but institutional behavior continues to diverge from market sentiment. Over the past few hours, Bitmine staked an additional 118,944 ETH, worth approximately $352.16 million, according to data from Arkham reported by Lookonchain. This move follows Bitmine’s recent spot accumulation and reinforces its long-term positioning strategy rather than a short-term speculative approach. Staking at this scale effectively removes a significant amount of ETH from liquid circulation, tightening available supply on exchanges. Unlike transfers to centralized platforms, staking reflects a high-conviction view that prioritizes yield generation and long-term network participation over immediate liquidity. For analysts tracking structural supply dynamics, this behavior contrasts sharply with the current price trend, which continues to show limited bullish follow-through. Despite these developments, the broader market remains unconvinced. Ethereum has struggled to reclaim key resistance levels, and momentum indicators still point to weakness. As a result, analysts are increasingly divided when assessing the outlook for 2026. Some interpret ongoing institutional accumulation and staking as early positioning ahead of a longer-term recovery cycle. Others caution that macro uncertainty, muted demand, and persistent risk aversion could keep ETH range-bound or under pressure for longer than expected. In this context, Bitmine’s actions stand out as a signal of long-term confidence, but not necessarily an immediate catalyst. For now, Ethereum’s price remains weak, while the strategic behavior beneath the surface continues to quietly reshape the supply landscape. Ethereum Remains Range-Bound Below Key Resistance Ethereum continues to trade in a consolidation range after failing to reclaim higher levels, with price hovering around the $3,000 zone. The chart shows ETH capped below the declining 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which now act as dynamic resistance around the $3,400–$3,600 area. This alignment reinforces the broader bearish structure that has been in place since the November breakdown. After peaking near the $4,800 region earlier in the cycle, ETH entered a clear downtrend, marked by lower highs and expanding sell-side volume during corrective phases. The sharp sell-off into late November pushed the price toward the $2,800 area, where buyers stepped in to defend support. Since then, Ethereum has stabilized but failed to generate sustained upside momentum, suggesting demand remains cautious rather than aggressive. Volume has declined noticeably during recent rebounds, indicating a lack of strong conviction from buyers. This behavior is typical of late-stage corrective phases, where price compresses while market participants wait for clearer signals. As long as ETH remains below the 200-day moving average, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure. On the downside, the $2,800–$2,900 zone stands out as a key support area. A clean break below this range would increase the risk of a deeper retracement. Conversely, reclaiming $3,300 with strong volume would be the first sign that Ethereum is transitioning out of its current corrective structure.

56664328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=871329,1767222044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56664328.jpeg,Expert Says XRP ‘Haters’ Miss The Bigger Picture: Here’s What It Is,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/expert-xrp-haters-miss-the-bigger-picture/,"A prominent XRP commentator is pushing back on a familiar critique of Ripple’s business model, arguing that skeptics have the causality backwards when they claim the company sells XRP merely to amass traditional assets. In a post on X on Wednesday, CryptoInsightUK founder Will Taylor said the “haters” are “so close to being right,” but miss what he framed as the single step that changes the entire equation. What ‘Haters’ Get Wrong About XRP Taylor’s central claim is that Ripple’s token sales are not designed to swap out a volatile crypto asset for safer, conventional holdings. Instead, he described the sales as a means of funding infrastructure and integrations that ultimately increase the token’s long-term utility and value. “Haters say Ripple sell XRP so they can buy real-world companies and assets, because that’s how Ripple ‘makes money’,” Taylor wrote. “In my opinion, that completely misunderstands the business model and more importantly, the direction of causality. Yes, Ripple monetises some XRP. But not to replace XRP with traditional assets.” In Taylor’s telling, the misunderstanding starts with treating XRP like operating cash rather than a strategic, asymmetric asset. He argued that a large holder of an asset with outsized upside potential would not logically liquidate it simply to “stack normal companies,” especially if that asset could become worth more than the firm’s balance sheet at scale. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Most Bought Digital Asset, Bitcoin And Ethereum Bleed $500 Million “If you hold roughly 40% of an asset that, at scale, could be worth more than your entire balance sheet, you don’t treat it like operating cash,” he wrote. “You don’t say: ‘Let’s sell the most asymmetric asset we own just to stack normal companies.’ That would be insane.” From there, Taylor reframed Ripple’s acquisitions, integrations, and buildout efforts not as a pivot away from XRP but as “multipliers” that increase the odds XRP becomes a viable global settlement instrument. Traditional assets, he argued, are inputs to expand distribution, compliance, and liquidity: conditions that would make a bridge asset more useful at institutional scale. “When Ripple acquires or integrates with firms like Hidden Road, stablecoin infrastructure, or tokenised treasury rails, those assets are not the end goal,” Taylor wrote. “They are multipliers. Those companies are not replacing XRP. They are building the pipes that require XRP to function efficiently.” Related Reading: XRP Still Has A Path To $28 This Cycle, Analyst Says Taylor positioned this as a flywheel: XRP sits at the “strategic core” on the balance sheet, Ripple builds a full stack around payments and liquidity, institutions adopt because the rails are complete, and the token becomes a neutral settlement layer whose demand compounds over time. Under that framework, he said, short-term monetization is better understood as capital deployment in service of a long-term network effect rather than straightforward dilution. “That’s not dilution. That’s capital deployment,” Taylor wrote, adding that if Ripple simply wanted to be “a profitable TradFi-style company,” it would not “obsess over neutral settlement,” keep XRP “architecturally central,” or push it into “regulated institutional rails.” The distinction matters because it changes how observers interpret Ripple’s incentives. In Taylor’s model, the objective is not to sell the token in order to accumulate off-chain assets; it is to use off-chain assets—licenses, liquidity venues, compliance infrastructure, and institutional integrations—to increase XRP’s necessity as a settlement tool. “The endgame is not: ‘Sell XRP to buy assets,’” he wrote. “The endgame is: ‘Use assets to make XRP unavoidable.’” At press time, XRP traded at $1.8773.

This acquisition, valued at approximately $779 million, represents one of the most significant corporate Bitcoin investments of the year and marks a pivotal moment for the company’s reserve management policy. The transaction, first reported by the cryptocurrency analytics platform Watcher.Guru, highlights Tether’s continued commitment to diversifying its substantial reserves beyond traditional assets. This strategic purchase not only bolsters the backing of the USDT stablecoin but also sends a powerful signal about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a treasury reserve asset. Consequently, market analysts and industry experts are closely examining the implications for both Tether’s stability and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Tether’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition and Market Context Tether’s purchase of 8,888 BTC in Q4 2025 did not occur in a vacuum. The company has consistently allocated a portion of its profits to Bitcoin since 2022, framing it as a strategy to strengthen the utility and long-term stability of its stablecoin reserves. This latest acquisition brings Tether’s publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings to a formidable total, firmly establishing it as one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency globally. The timing of the purchase is particularly noteworthy, as it followed a period of relative consolidation in Bitcoin’s price after its previous all-time high cycles. Market data indicates that Tether likely accumulated this position through a combination of direct over-the-counter (OTC) purchases and strategic market buys, minimizing slippage and market impact. Furthermore, the specific number 8,888 holds cultural significance in some Asian markets as a symbol of prosperity and good fortune, potentially reflecting a deliberate choice by the company’s treasury management team. Analyzing the Impact on USDT Reserves and Stability The integration of Bitcoin into Tether’s reserve portfolio directly impacts the perceived robustness of USDT. Tether publishes quarterly attestations detailing the composition of its reserves, which traditionally include cash, cash equivalents, and other highly liquid assets. The addition of a substantial Bitcoin position introduces a different risk-return profile. While Bitcoin is more volatile than U.S. Treasury bills, it is also viewed by many institutions as a non-correlated, hard-cap asset with significant long-term appreciation potential. Financial experts argue that a responsibly sized allocation to Bitcoin can enhance the overall yield of Tether’s reserves, potentially generating profits that further fortify the stablecoin’s backing. However, this move also necessitates sophisticated risk management frameworks to hedge against Bitcoin’s price volatility, ensuring that the 1:1 peg of USDT to the U.S. dollar remains unwavering under all market conditions. Tether’s ability to manage this balance will be critical for maintaining user trust. The Broader Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Tether’s action is a prominent chapter in the ongoing narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Since MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy in 2020, numerous publicly traded and private companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a primary treasury reserve asset. Tether’s approach, however, is fundamentally different. Unlike a typical corporation, Tether’s primary product is a financial instrument—a stablecoin—that requires extreme confidence in its backing. Its decision to hold Bitcoin, therefore, carries greater weight and scrutiny. The table below contrasts Tether’s treasury strategy with that of a traditional corporate adopter. Entity Type Primary Goal Role of Bitcoin Risk Profile Tether (Stablecoin Issuer) Backing a liquid, pegged currency (USDT) Long-term reserve appreciation, portfolio diversification High scrutiny; must not impair liquidity for redemptions Traditional Corporation (e.g., Tech Firm) Maximizing shareholder value, preserving capital Inflation hedge, alternative to cash, strategic investment Managed as part of a broader investment portfolio This trend is driven by several key macroeconomic factors prevalent in 2025: Persistent Inflation: Companies seek assets with a verifiable scarcity to protect purchasing power. Advancing Regulation: Clearer digital asset frameworks in major economies provide legal certainty for corporate holdings. Institutional Infrastructure: The maturation of custodial, auditing, and derivative services makes holding Bitcoin operationally feasible for large entities. Consequently, Tether’s purchase is both a reflection of this established trend and a validation of Bitcoin’s maturity as an institutional-grade asset class. Expert Analysis and Future Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets Industry analysts have largely interpreted Tether’s Q4 2025 Bitcoin acquisition as a bullish long-term signal. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has previously stated that investments in Bitcoin are part of a strategy to diversify and strengthen the company’s reserves. Experts from firms like Bernstein and Fidelity Digital Assets note that such large-scale, transparent buying from a major ecosystem player provides a substantial, non-speculative demand base for Bitcoin. This type of demand can help reduce overall market volatility over extended periods by locking up supply. Looking ahead, the implications are multifaceted: For the Stablecoin Sector: Rival stablecoin issuers may feel pressure to similarly diversify their reserves or at least transparently justify their current, more traditional compositions. For Bitcoin’s Price Discovery: Consistent buying from large entities like Tether creates a structural demand floor, influencing long-term valuation models. For Regulatory Dialogue: This move will likely be cited in ongoing discussions about reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, arguing for the inclusion of certain digital assets under strict guidelines. Market observers will now watch Tether’s future quarterly attestations closely to see if this Bitcoin accumulation strategy continues and how it is accounted for alongside its other reserve assets. The company’s performance in managing this volatile asset during market downturns will be the ultimate test of the strategy’s prudence. Conclusion Tether’s acquisition of 8,888 Bitcoin, worth $779 million, in the fourth quarter of 2025 is far more than a simple treasury transaction. It represents a calculated strategic pivot that reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a reserve asset for even the most sensitive financial instruments. This decisive Tether BTC acquisition strengthens the foundational backing of USDT while aligning the company with a forward-thinking approach to corporate treasury management. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and integrate with traditional finance, moves of this scale and transparency set important precedents. They demonstrate how major players can leverage digital assets to build resilience, generate value, and foster stability within the broader financial ecosystem. The success of this strategy will undoubtedly influence reserve management policies across the digital currency industry for years to come. FAQs Q1: Why did Tether buy 8,888 Bitcoin? Tether states that it allocates a portion of its net profits to purchasing Bitcoin as a strategy to diversify and strengthen the reserves backing its USDT stablecoin. The company views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Q2: How does this purchase affect the stability of USDT? Tether manages its Bitcoin holdings as part of a larger, highly liquid reserve portfolio. The goal is for Bitcoin’s potential appreciation to enhance overall reserve value, while robust risk management practices are employed to protect the stablecoin’s 1:1 dollar peg. Q3: Is Tether now one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin? Yes. Following this Q4 2025 acquisition, Tether is confirmed to be among the top three largest corporate entities globally in terms of Bitcoin treasury holdings, alongside companies like MicroStrategy. Q4: Where was this Tether Bitcoin acquisition reported? The transaction was first reported by the cryptocurrency news and data platform Watcher.Guru, based on analysis of public blockchain data and treasury disclosures. Q5: What does this mean for the future of stablecoin reserves? Tether’s move may encourage other stablecoin issuers to consider diversifying their reserves with digital assets like Bitcoin, potentially setting a new industry standard for reserve composition, provided it is done with appropriate safeguards and transparency.

As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.82 Market Cap $1.526B Trading Volume $95.22M Circulating Supply 546.06M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $2.85 24-h Low $2.67 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 8.47% (High) 14-Day RSI 37.38 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.87 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 21 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $4.80 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is still in a daily downtrend with price stuck below key resistance. Short-term relief bounces are corrective unless $2.95–$3.05 is reclaimed. Failure to hold $2.70 increases the risk of continuation toward lower supports. ICP 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for December 31, ICP is closing around $2.82, sitting just above the lower Bollinger Band near $2.72, which signals persistent downside pressure rather than strength. The price remains firmly below the mid-band, around $3.03, and the upper band, near $3.33, confirming that volatility is expanding downward, not upward. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering in the 37–40 zone, showing mild bearish momentum without capitulation, which often leads to continued grinding weakness rather than a sharp bounce. As long as daily closes fail to reclaim $3.00–$3.05, downside risk toward $2.55–$2.65 remains active, while any bounce into $3.10–$3.30 is likely to face heavy supply. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, the recent green candle from the $2.68–$2.70 region appears to be a reactionary bounce after selling exhaustion, rather than a trend shift. The price is still trading below the Alligator averages, clustered around $2.82–$2.90, maintaining a bearish structure despite the short-term uptick. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains below zero, although bearish momentum is easing, suggesting sellers are losing urgency but not control. A clean reclaim and hold above $2.90–$2.95 would be needed to open a push toward $3.05, while rejection below $2.85 risks another sweep of $2.70 support.

While short-term price action shows marginal recovery, market analyst Ali Martinez argues that weakening network fundamentals, large-holder distribution, and fragile technical support indicate downside risk has not been neutralized. In his view, if these conditions persist, XRP could still face a sharp drawdown toward the $0.80 region, implying a potential 56% decline from current levels. XRP’s Weak Network And Whale Selling Undermine Demand In a series of recent tweets, Martinez outlined multiple converging risks that could push XRP into a deeper decline. Central to his assessment is a visible deterioration in on-chain participation , which he views as an early warning signal for further downside. Daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger have fallen sharply, dropping from roughly 46,000 to about 38,500 within a single week. This contraction reflects reduced transactional engagement and softer organic demand, conditions that weaken price resilience during periods of broader market uncertainty. In practical terms, fewer active users translate into lower baseline buying pressure, making the asset more vulnerable to sell-side shocks. Compounding this issue is a notable shift in whale behavior. Martinez highlights that large holders have offloaded more than 40 million XRP over the same timeframe. When high-conviction capital moves to the sell side, it alters supply dynamics quickly, especially in markets already experiencing muted retail participation. Whale distribution typically acts as a leading indicator of trend exhaustion, as concentrated supply entering the market absorbs demand that would otherwise support price stability. Together, declining network activity and whale selling form a reinforcing feedback loop that erodes confidence and increases downside exposure. XRP Price Faces Elevated Downside Risk From a market structure standpoint, XRP’s technical setup remains precarious despite modest short-term gains. The asset is currently trading around $1.87, down 8.6% over the past month, even after recovering 0.3% in the last 24 hours and 1.1% over the past week. These incremental rebounds, however, have not altered the broader risk profile. According to Martinez, the $1.77 level represents a critical support zone that must hold to prevent deeper losses. A decisive break below $1.77 would invalidate the current consolidation structure and expose XRP to its next meaningful support near $0.79–$0.80. This level is not arbitrary; it represents a historically significant demand zone where price previously stabilized after prolonged declines. If selling pressure from whales persists while on-chain activity remains subdued, the probability of testing this lower band increases substantially. In this scenario, the projected move would amount to a roughly 56% decline, aligning with Martinez’s risk assessment. In sum, while XRP is not in freefall, the asset is operating on thin structural support . Until network activity recovers, whale behavior stabilizes, and key technical levels are decisively defended, XRP remains exposed to a high-impact downside scenario that investors cannot afford to ignore.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 00:00:18

Despite several recovery attempts, bulls have failed to regain control, leaving ETH vulnerable to renewed downside pressure. Market sentiment reflects this weakness, with a growing number of analysts leaning toward a bearish outlook for 2026 as momentum indicators continue to fade and risk appetite remains subdued across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Amid this fragile technical backdrop, new on-chain data highlights a notable shift in Ethereum’s liquidity structure. According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Arab Chain, Ethereum reserves on Binance surged to approximately 4.17 million ETH in December. This increase coincided with massive inflows totaling nearly 8.5 million ETH over the month, marking one of the most significant exchange inflow events since 2023. Such a sharp rise in exchange-held ETH suggests a change in investor behavior. Historically, large inflows to centralized exchanges indicate preparation for increased trading activity, hedging, or potential selling pressure, rather than long-term accumulation. While inflows alone do not guarantee immediate downside, they often precede periods of higher volatility, especially when the price is already struggling to reclaim key resistance levels. Exchange Liquidity Rises as Volatility Risks Build The CryptoQuant report emphasizes that the sharp increase in Ethereum reserves on Binance—the world’s largest exchange by trading volume—indicates a significant increase in tradable supply. When ETH moves from cold storage or long-term wallets onto centralized exchanges, it typically reflects a shift toward active positioning. Historically, this behavior has been a key input for assessing short- to medium-term supply–demand dynamics, as higher exchange balances increase the amount of ETH readily available for trading, hedging, or liquidation. However, the report stresses that rising exchange reserves do not automatically translate into immediate selling pressure. In many cases, large inflows are associated with risk management strategies rather than outright distribution. Institutional participants often move assets to exchanges to deploy them as collateral, rebalance exposure, or hedge downside risk through derivatives markets, particularly during periods of macro uncertainty and compressed price action. Still, the scale of December’s inflows stands out. Nearly 8.5 million ETH flowed into Binance over the month, marking the highest net inflows since 2023, with daily net inflows peaking above 162,000 ETH. Such volumes suggest the involvement of large players and point to a potential transition into a more volatile market phase. With Binance commanding a dominant share of Ethereum derivatives trading, this concentration of ETH on the exchange raises the probability of sharp price moves. Whether driven by spot selling or leveraged positioning, elevated exchange liquidity increases the market’s sensitivity to shifts in sentiment, making the current consolidation phase increasingly fragile. Related Reading: XRP Slides To $1.80 While Binance Reserves Continue To Decline Ethereum Price Compresses As Momentum Fades Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart reflects a market stuck in compression just below the $3,000 psychological level. After a sharp decline earlier in the month, ETH attempted several rebounds but consistently failed to reclaim higher ground, resulting in a tight range between roughly $2,900 and $3,100. This structure signals indecision rather than accumulation, with both buyers and sellers lacking conviction. Technically, Ethereum remains capped below its short- and medium-term moving averages. The 50-period and 100-period averages are acting as dynamic resistance, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. Meanwhile, the 200-period moving average continues to slope downward, reinforcing the broader bearish trend. As long as ETH trades below these levels, rallies are likely to remain corrective rather than trend-changing. Related Reading: Chainlink Shows Strong Accumulation Signal: LINK Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Trading activity has steadily declined during the consolidation phase, indicating reduced participation and growing apathy. The absence of strong volume expansion on upside moves suggests that buyers are not aggressively stepping in, even near key support. Structurally, the $2,900–$2,950 zone is acting as short-term support, preventing deeper drawdowns for now. However, the longer ETH remains compressed below $3,000, the greater the risk of a volatility expansion. A decisive break above $3,100 would be required to shift momentum to the bullish side. Until then, Ethereum remains vulnerable to renewed downside pressure if broader market sentiment deteriorates.

This substantial release, valued at approximately $100 million at current prices, represents a scheduled event within Ripple’s well-documented and transparent supply management strategy. Consequently, market analysts and institutional investors are closely examining the potential implications for XRP liquidity, price stability, and corporate treasury operations. This event underscores the ongoing evolution of digital asset management within a complex regulatory landscape. Understanding the 200 Million XRP Unlock Ripple’s escrow mechanism is a foundational element of its XRP supply management. Initially, the company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of cryptographically secured escrow accounts. This action was designed to create predictable and transparent release schedules. Therefore, the recent 200 million XRP unlock is not an anomalous event but part of a pre-programmed, monthly distribution plan. The blockchain ledger provides immutable verification for this transaction. Each month, one billion XRP typically becomes available from these escrows. However, Ripple often returns a large portion of unused funds to new escrow contracts. This structured approach aims to mitigate concerns about market flooding from sudden, large supply injections. The Mechanics of Ripple’s Escrow System Ripple established its escrow system in late 2017 to provide predictability for the XRP ecosystem. The system functions through a series of smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. Every month, a contract expires and releases one billion XRP to Ripple. The company then utilizes a portion for operational needs, including: On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors for cross-border payments. Strategic partnerships and ecosystem development investments. General corporate treasury management and operational expenses. Historically, Ripple re-locks a significant majority of the released XRP into new escrow contracts. This practice effectively controls the net new supply entering the circulating market. For instance, data from previous quarters shows that Ripple often sells only a fraction of the released amount on the open market. The remainder is strategically re-escrowed. This disciplined process provides a clear audit trail and demonstrates a long-term commitment to supply stability. Historical Context and Market Impact Patterns Analyzing past escrow releases reveals important patterns for market behavior. Notably, the immediate market reaction to an escrow unlock is often muted. This is because the event is scheduled and anticipated by sophisticated traders. However, the medium-term impact depends heavily on Ripple’s subsequent actions with the unlocked funds. Market sentiment can shift based on whether the company signals increased selling pressure or strategic holding. For example, increased transfers to exchanges often precede short-term price volatility. Conversely, re-escrowing large portions can be interpreted as a bullish signal for long-term supply constraints. The table below illustrates a simplified comparison of recent quarterly escrow activities: Quarter XRP Released from Escrow XRP Re-escrowed Net New Circulating Supply Q3 2024 3.0 Billion ~2.4 Billion ~600 Million Q2 2024 3.0 Billion ~2.5 Billion ~500 Million Q1 2024 3.0 Billion ~2.55 Billion ~450 Million This data shows a consistent pattern of supply management. The 200 million XRP in the current report represents just one component of this monthly cycle. Consequently, analysts monitor the flow of these funds to ODL partners or treasury addresses rather than the unlock itself. The ultimate effect on the circulating supply hinges on these secondary movements. Expert Analysis on Liquidity and Institutional Strategy Industry observers emphasize the dual nature of such unlocks. Firstly, they provide essential liquidity for Ripple’s core business operations, particularly its ODL service. This service requires readily available XRP pools across global exchanges to facilitate instant cross-border settlements. Secondly, these events test market efficiency and maturity. A predictable, transparent supply schedule allows institutions to model risk more accurately. Experts from firms like Messari and CoinMetrics frequently note that Ripple’s escrow model offers a level of transparency rare in both traditional and crypto finance. Furthermore, the timing of this unlock occurs within a specific regulatory context. Following the conclusion of major litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ripple’s actions are scrutinized for compliance signals. The company’s disciplined escrow management supports its narrative of responsible corporate stewardship. It also differentiates XRP from cryptocurrencies with purely inflationary or unpredictable emission schedules. This structured approach can appeal to payment institutions and banks seeking reliable infrastructure. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Sector The event highlights a growing trend toward transparent treasury management in blockchain projects. Other major crypto entities are now adopting similar public vesting schedules and quarterly reports. This shift responds directly to demands from institutional investors for clearer governance and supply controls. Moreover, the unlock underscores the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Whale Alert provide real-time visibility, enabling a more informed and efficient market. This transparency reduces information asymmetry and can decrease speculative volatility driven by rumors. Conclusion The unlock of 200 million XRP from Ripple’s escrow is a significant, yet scheduled, event in the digital asset’s economic calendar. It reflects a continued commitment to a transparent and predictable supply model. The real impact on the XRP market will depend not on the unlock itself, but on the subsequent allocation of these funds by Ripple’s treasury team. This process provides critical liquidity for global payment solutions while demonstrating a mature approach to asset management. As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, such structured mechanisms will likely become standard benchmarks for project credibility and institutional adoption. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when XRP is “unlocked from escrow”? It means XRP tokens previously held in a time-locked smart contract on the XRP Ledger have become accessible to Ripple. The company can now use these tokens for operations, partnerships, or sales, though it often re-locks a large percentage into new escrow contracts. Q2: Does this 200 million XRP unlock automatically increase selling pressure? Not automatically. The unlock increases Ripple’s available treasury, but selling pressure only materializes if Ripple transfers significant amounts to exchanges for sale. Historical data shows most unlocked XRP is typically re-escrowed, limiting immediate net new supply. Q3: How often do these XRP escrow unlocks happen? Ripple’s escrow system is programmed to release one billion XRP on the first day of each month. The 200 million figure reported may represent a portion of that monthly release that was moved to a different operational wallet. Q4: Why does Ripple use an escrow system? The escrow system was created to provide predictable supply release, assure the market that Ripple cannot dump its entire XRP holdings at once, and support long-term ecosystem health by aligning the company’s incentives with gradual, managed distribution. Q5: Where can I verify this XRP unlock transaction? All transactions on the XRP Ledger are public. You can verify the transaction by using the reported transaction hash from Whale Alert on any XRP Ledger explorer, such as Bithomp or XRPScan, which provide immutable, on-chain proof.

This substantial release represents approximately 0.5% of XRP’s total supply and continues Ripple’s established escrow management strategy that began in December 2017. Market observers immediately noted the transaction’s timing, coming during a period of increased regulatory clarity for digital assets in multiple jurisdictions. The unlock follows Ripple’s quarterly pattern of releasing 1 billion XRP from escrow, with 500 million typically returned to escrow shortly after. This systematic approach provides predictable supply management while supporting Ripple’s operational requirements and partnership development initiatives. Understanding Ripple’s XRP Escrow Strategy Ripple implemented its escrow strategy in December 2017 to address market concerns about XRP supply predictability. The company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow contracts, representing approximately 55% of the total 100 billion XRP supply created at the network’s inception. These contracts automatically release 1 billion XRP each month over 55 months. However, Ripple typically returns a substantial portion of each month’s release to new escrow contracts, creating a rolling escrow system. This mechanism provides several important benefits: Supply predictability: Markets can anticipate maximum monthly releases Operational flexibility: Ripple accesses XRP for business operations Transparency: All transactions are publicly visible on the XRP Ledger Long-term planning: The strategy extends through 2027 Historical data shows Ripple has consistently returned approximately 80% of released XRP to escrow over the past three years. Consequently, the net monthly increase in circulating supply typically ranges between 200-300 million XRP rather than the full 1 billion. This disciplined approach has helped stabilize supply concerns that previously affected XRP’s market perception. Market Impact and Historical Context Immediate market reactions to escrow releases have diminished significantly since 2018 as participants better understand the predictable nature of these transactions. Nevertheless, large XRP movements always warrant careful analysis. The 500 million XRP unlocked represents approximately $250 million at current market prices, though Ripple rarely liquidates substantial amounts immediately. Instead, the company typically allocates released XRP across several strategic areas: Allocation Area Typical Percentage Purpose New Escrow Contracts ~80% Future supply management On-Demand Liquidity ~10% Cross-border payment solutions Partner Incentives ~5% Ecosystem development Operational Expenses ~5% Company operations and development Market analysts note that actual selling pressure remains minimal because Ripple strategically manages its XRP distributions. The company’s quarterly markets reports consistently show that programmatic sales and over-the-counter transactions represent only a fraction of released amounts. Furthermore, Ripple’s increasing adoption of XRP for its On-Demand Liquidity product creates natural demand that partially offsets new supply. This balanced approach has evolved significantly since early 2018 when less predictable releases sometimes created market volatility. Expert Perspectives on Escrow Management Blockchain analysts emphasize that Ripple’s escrow strategy represents one of cryptocurrency’s most transparent supply management systems. Unlike proof-of-work mining that introduces new coins through energy-intensive processes, or proof-of-stake systems that distribute rewards to validators, Ripple’s approach provides complete predictability. Industry observers particularly appreciate the public verifiability of all escrow transactions on the XRP Ledger. This transparency allows any market participant to monitor releases in real-time, reducing information asymmetry. Financial institutions considering XRP adoption frequently cite this predictable supply schedule as a favorable characteristic compared to assets with less transparent issuance mechanisms. The system’s design also includes automatic return of unused XRP to escrow, creating a circular supply management model unique among major digital assets. Regulatory Considerations and Institutional Adoption The timing of this escrow release coincides with evolving regulatory frameworks for digital assets in major markets. Recent developments in the United States, European Union, and Asia have created clearer guidelines for institutional cryptocurrency engagement. Ripple’s transparent escrow management aligns well with regulatory expectations for disclosure and predictability. Institutional adoption of XRP for cross-border payments continues growing, with Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product processing billions in transactions quarterly. This real-world utility creates organic demand that interacts with supply releases. Financial technology experts note that predictable supply mechanisms become increasingly important as institutional participation grows. Large financial entities typically prefer assets with transparent issuance schedules and minimal supply surprises. Ripple’s escrow system directly addresses these preferences through its mathematically predictable release schedule and public verification capabilities. Technical Implementation and Network Effects The XRP Ledger’s technical capabilities enable Ripple’s escrow strategy through its built-in escrow feature. This native functionality allows users to lock XRP until specific conditions occur, typically a time-based release. The feature supports both time-based and condition-based releases, though Ripple utilizes the time-based approach for its supply management. Network validators process these transactions identically to other XRP Ledger transactions, maintaining the network’s decentralization. The escrow feature’s existence predates Ripple’s supply management strategy, demonstrating the XRP Ledger’s flexibility for various financial applications. This technical foundation supports not only Ripple’s corporate strategy but also enables escrow applications for individual users and businesses. The feature’s reliability has been proven through thousands of successful escrow transactions since its implementation, creating confidence in its security and predictability. Comparative Analysis with Other Digital Assets Ripple’s escrow approach differs significantly from supply mechanisms employed by other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s predetermined mining schedule introduces new coins through computational work, with halving events reducing issuance every four years. Ethereum transitioned from mining to staking rewards with its move to proof-of-stake consensus. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC maintain supplies pegged to reserve assets, adjusting based on market demand. XRP’s escrow system provides unique advantages in transparency and predictability while presenting different characteristics. Market analysts frequently compare these mechanisms when assessing long-term supply dynamics. Each approach reflects different philosophical foundations and practical requirements. Ripple’s method particularly suits institutional use cases where predictability and auditability provide significant advantages for financial planning and risk management. Conclusion Ripple’s release of 500 million XRP from escrow continues the company’s established supply management strategy implemented in 2017. This systematic approach provides market predictability while supporting Ripple’s business operations and ecosystem development. The XRP unlock represents standard procedure within Ripple’s transparent escrow framework rather than exceptional market activity. Historical patterns suggest most released XRP will return to new escrow contracts, maintaining the circular supply management model. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional adoption grows, transparent supply mechanisms like Ripple’s escrow system gain increasing importance. The XRP Ledger’s native escrow functionality enables this predictable approach while serving broader user needs. Market participants now understand these releases as routine events within a well-documented supply management strategy that supports XRP’s utility in global payments and financial applications. FAQs Q1: How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow? Ripple’s escrow contracts automatically release 1 billion XRP monthly, though the company typically returns approximately 80% to new escrow contracts, resulting in a net monthly increase of 200-300 million XRP in circulating supply. Q2: Does Ripple immediately sell XRP released from escrow? No, Ripple strategically allocates released XRP across multiple purposes including new escrow contracts, On-Demand Liquidity operations, partner incentives, and operational expenses, with only a portion entering markets through programmatic sales. Q3: How does Ripple’s escrow strategy affect XRP’s price? Market impacts have diminished as participants understand the predictable nature of releases. The transparent schedule reduces uncertainty, though large transactions can temporarily affect market dynamics depending on broader conditions. Q4: Can the public verify Ripple’s escrow transactions? Yes, all XRP Ledger transactions are publicly visible. Anyone can monitor escrow releases and returns using blockchain explorers or services like Whale Alert that report large transactions. Q5: When will Ripple’s escrow strategy conclude? The current escrow contracts extend through 2027, though Ripple may implement new supply management strategies as the final contracts approach expiration based on then-current market conditions and business requirements.

Understanding Ripple’s XRP Escrow Mechanism Ripple implemented its escrow system in December 2017 to address market concerns about XRP supply predictability. The company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow accounts, representing approximately 55% of the total 100 billion XRP created at the network’s inception. Consequently, this structured approach releases 1 billion XRP each month over 55 months. However, Ripple typically returns unutilized portions to escrow, extending the release schedule. This systematic process provides transparency about XRP’s circulating supply while preventing market flooding. The escrow system functions through smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. These contracts automatically execute according to predetermined schedules. Monthly, 1 billion XRP becomes available to Ripple. The company then utilizes portions for operational needs, including: On-demand liquidity solutions for financial institutions Strategic partnerships and ecosystem development Market development initiatives and infrastructure investments Employee compensation programs and operational expenses Unused XRP returns to escrow each month, typically within the first week. This creates a predictable supply schedule that market participants can analyze. The 300 million XRP release represents a substantial portion of January’s available escrow allocation, indicating potential increased operational requirements or strategic deployments. Historical Context of XRP Escrow Releases Ripple’s escrow releases follow established patterns that market analysts closely monitor. Historical data reveals that the company has consistently returned significant portions of monthly releases to escrow, often between 700-900 million XRP monthly. Therefore, a 300 million XRP utilization represents an above-average monthly deployment when compared to recent historical averages. Recent XRP Escrow Utilization Patterns Month Total Released Amount Utilized Percentage Returned December 2024 1 billion 200 million 80% November 2024 1 billion 250 million 75% October 2024 1 billion 180 million 82% September 2024 1 billion 220 million 78% Market analysts examine these patterns to understand Ripple’s operational tempo and strategic direction. The 300 million XRP utilization in January 2025 suggests potential acceleration in partnership deployments or institutional adoption initiatives. Furthermore, blockchain transparency allows real-time tracking of these movements, providing unprecedented visibility into corporate cryptocurrency management practices. Market Impact and Price Considerations Cryptocurrency markets typically respond to substantial token movements, especially when involving significant portions of circulating supply. XRP’s current circulating supply stands at approximately 54 billion tokens, making this 300 million XRP release equivalent to about 0.55% of circulating supply. While not enormous in percentage terms, the absolute size warrants attention from institutional traders and long-term holders. Historical price analysis reveals mixed reactions to escrow releases. Sometimes markets anticipate these scheduled events, resulting in minimal price disruption. Other times, unexpected utilization patterns trigger volatility. Several factors influence market response: Transparency of destination wallets and intended use cases Overall market conditions and cryptocurrency sector sentiment Ripple’s communication regarding strategic initiatives Regulatory developments affecting XRP’s legal status Blockchain analytics firms like Whale Alert provide crucial surveillance capabilities. Their automated systems detect large transactions across multiple blockchain networks. This transparency enables market participants to make informed decisions based on verifiable on-chain data rather than speculation. Institutional Adoption and Real-World Utility Ripple’s primary value proposition centers on facilitating cross-border payments for financial institutions. The company’s RippleNet network utilizes XRP as a bridge currency in its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution. This product enables instant settlement of cross-border transactions while reducing liquidity costs for participating institutions. The 300 million XRP release potentially supports expansion of ODL corridors or new partnership implementations. Recent years have seen growing institutional adoption, with financial institutions across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East implementing Ripple’s solutions. Each new corridor requires XRP liquidity to facilitate efficient currency exchanges. Regulatory clarity remains crucial for broader adoption. The ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulations globally affects institutional participation rates. Clear regulatory frameworks typically encourage financial institutions to explore blockchain solutions more aggressively. Consequently, regulatory developments directly influence Ripple’s strategic deployment of escrowed XRP. Expert Perspectives on Escrow Management Blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of transparent supply management in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Predictable release schedules reduce uncertainty for investors and users. Ripple’s escrow system represents one of the most structured approaches to supply management among major cryptocurrency projects. Industry observers note that regular escrow returns demonstrate disciplined management. By consistently returning unused XRP, Ripple signals commitment to long-term ecosystem health rather than short-term market manipulation. This approach builds trust with institutional partners who require stability for operational planning. Comparative analysis with other cryptocurrency projects reveals varying approaches to token distribution. Some projects employ vesting schedules for team allocations. Others utilize gradual release mechanisms for treasury funds. Ripple’s escrow system stands out for its transparency and predictability, setting standards for corporate cryptocurrency management. Conclusion Ripple’s release of 300 million XRP from escrow represents a significant development in cryptocurrency markets, reflecting potential acceleration in institutional adoption initiatives. The structured escrow system provides transparency about XRP supply management while supporting Ripple’s operational requirements. Market participants will monitor subsequent wallet movements to gauge strategic deployment patterns. This XRP unlocked event underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency markets, where transparent supply mechanisms and predictable release schedules increasingly influence institutional participation and market stability. FAQs Q1: What does “XRP unlocked from escrow” mean? Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow accounts with scheduled monthly releases. “Unlocked” means these tokens have become available for Ripple’s use according to predetermined smart contract terms. Q2: How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow? Ripple’s escrow contracts make 1 billion XRP available monthly. The company typically utilizes a portion for operations and returns the remainder to extended escrow contracts. Q3: Does XRP escrow release affect cryptocurrency prices? Market impact varies based on utilization patterns and overall conditions. Transparent scheduling often reduces surprise effects, but substantial utilization can influence supply perceptions. Q4: Where can I track XRP escrow releases? Blockchain analytics platforms like Whale Alert monitor large transactions. The XRP Ledger provides public transaction data that anyone can examine through various explorers. Q5: What happens to unused XRP each month? Ripple typically returns unused portions to new escrow contracts, extending the release schedule. This practice maintains supply predictability and demonstrates disciplined management.

This critical benchmark, published by data provider Alternative.me, fell one point from the previous day, reflecting heightened anxiety across digital asset exchanges. The index serves as a crucial barometer, quantifying the emotional pulse of the market where a score approaching 0 indicates maximum fear and a score nearing 100 signals unchecked greed. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mechanics The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a composite snapshot of market psychology through a multifaceted calculation. Analysts derive its value from six distinct data sources, each weighted to paint an accurate picture. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score, acting as primary indicators of trader nervousness and capital movement. Social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%, capturing the narrative and crowd psychology surrounding major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Furthermore, the index incorporates Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%) and trends in Google search volume for cryptocurrency terms (10%). This methodology ensures the index reflects both on-chain activity and mainstream interest. When these components collectively trend downward, as they have recently, the index plunges into fear zones. Consequently, a score of 20 represents a market where caution overwhelmingly dominates speculative enthusiasm. Historical Context and Market Parallels Examining historical data reveals the significance of the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading. The index famously hit single-digit levels during major capitulation events, such as the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the FTX exchange in November 2022. While the current level of 20 remains above those historic lows, it consistently correlates with periods of significant price consolidation and reduced trading activity. Market analysts often reference these phases as potential accumulation zones for long-term investors, though they caution that extreme fear can persist and deepen. For instance, prolonged periods in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone throughout 2022 preceded further substantial market declines. Therefore, this metric functions not as a timing tool but as a contextual gauge of emotional extremes. The current decline to 20 follows a gradual descent from a ‘Neutral’ reading earlier in the quarter, tracked alongside declining Bitcoin prices and rising macroeconomic uncertainties. Expert Analysis on Sentiment Indicators Financial researchers emphasize that sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index are contrarian signals at their extremes. “Historically, sustained periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries, as weak hands are shaken out,” notes Dr. Lena Vance, a behavioral finance economist at the Global Digital Asset Research Institute. “However, the index is a lagging composite. Investors must cross-reference it with on-chain fundamentals, such as exchange net flows and holder distribution, to avoid false signals.” Data from blockchain analytics firms shows a corresponding trend: an increase in coins moving to long-term storage addresses, suggesting some investors are using the fear-driven price dip to accumulate assets. This on-chain activity provides a nuanced layer to the raw sentiment score, indicating that while retail sentiment is fearful, strategic actors may see opportunity. Component Breakdown and Recent Drivers The recent drop to 20 stems from negative movements across several of the index’s core components. Firstly, volatility has spiked due to unexpected regulatory announcements in several jurisdictions, contributing heavily to the fear score. Secondly, social media analysis shows a measurable increase in negative commentary and fear-driven keywords across platforms like X and Reddit. The following table summarizes the index’s weighting and recent directional pressure: Component Weight Recent Trend (Contributing to Fear) Volatility 25% Sharply Increased Market Volume 25% Declining / Stagnant Social Media 15% Overwhelmingly Negative Surveys 15% Pessimistic Outlook BTC Dominance 10% Rising (Flight to ‘Safety’) Search Trends 10% Queries for ‘Crypto Crash’ Up This confluence of factors creates a self-reinforcing cycle. Negative price action fuels fearful social media posts, which in turn influences survey respondents and may deter new capital, reducing volume. The rising Bitcoin dominance specifically highlights a flight to the perceived relative stability of the largest cryptocurrency amid fear in the broader altcoin market. Potential Implications for Traders and the Market An ‘Extreme Fear’ reading carries several practical implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it often signals a high-risk environment where emotional decision-making can lead to selling at a loss. For institutional players, it may trigger rebalancing of portfolios or the activation of dollar-cost averaging strategies. The market impact typically manifests in specific ways: Reduced Liquidity: Trading volumes often contract as participants move to the sidelines. Increased Correlation: Cryptocurrencies may move more in lockstep with traditional risk-off assets. Opportunistic Accumulation: Data shows large holders (‘whales’) sometimes increase buy orders during fear phases. Media Narrative Shift: News coverage tends to focus on losses and risks, amplifying the fear sentiment. It is crucial to remember that the index measures current sentiment, not future price. While extreme fear can indicate a local bottom, it does not guarantee an immediate reversal. Markets can remain irrational and fearful far longer than investors can remain solvent, as the old adage warns. Therefore, using this index requires combining it with fundamental technical and on-chain analysis. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s descent to a score of 20 provides a clear, quantitative measure of the ‘Extreme Fear’ gripping cryptocurrency investors. This sentiment, derived from volatility, volume, social data, and search trends, reflects the current cautious and risk-averse posture of the market. While historically such extremes have sometimes marked points of opportunity, they primarily serve as a warning about prevailing market psychology. Investors and observers should monitor whether subsequent data shows a stabilization or further decline in the index, as it will offer critical insight into whether the market is finding a floor or bracing for continued uncertainty. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an essential tool for contextualizing price action within the powerful framework of collective market emotion. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 20 mean? A score of 20 falls within the ‘Extreme Fear’ range (0-25). It indicates that current market data—like volatility, social media sentiment, and trading volume—collectively reflects very high levels of investor anxiety and risk aversion. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and published by the data platform Alternative.me. It is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q3: Is the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone a good time to buy cryptocurrency? While some contrarian investors view extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity, it is not a standalone signal. Historically, prices can fall further even when fear is high. Any investment decision should be based on comprehensive research, risk tolerance, and a long-term strategy, not just sentiment indicators. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s market dominance affect the Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s share of the total crypto market cap) accounts for 10% of the index. A rising dominance often occurs during fear periods as investors sell riskier altcoins and potentially move into Bitcoin, which is perceived as more established. This trend can push the index further into fear territory. Q5: Can the Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes or rallies? The index is not a predictive tool. It is a descriptive metric that quantifies current sentiment. It can identify when sentiment is at an extreme, which has sometimes preceded trend changes, but it does not cause or reliably predict those changes. It should be used alongside other forms of market and fundamental analysis.

In a post shared Tuesday on X, Wine warned that authorities could again restrict connectivity to disrupt coordination, limit information sharing, and prevent independent verification of election results. Uganda cut access to social media and messaging platforms during the 2021 election, a move that drew criticism from civil society groups and international observers. Wine’s message reflects growing concern among opposition groups that digital controls will play a central role in the upcoming vote, as political tensions rise and campaign activity intensifies across the country. Internet shutdown fears revive offline messaging strategy The app highlighted by Wine, called Bitcha t, is designed to operate without internet access or centralized servers. Instead, it relies on Bluetooth-based mesh networking, allowing nearby devices to relay messages between users. According to Wine, this setup could allow rapid communication even if mobile data and broadband services are disabled. Wine said users could share photos of polling station declaration of results forms, commonly known as DR forms, as well as other election-related material. He stressed that the app does not require phone numbers or email addresses, a feature intended to reduce traceability and protect user identity during periods of heightened surveillance. The call to adopt offline tools comes as Uganda prepares for a closely watched election. President Yoweri Museveni has ruled the country for nearly four decades, while Wine has emerged as the most prominent opposition challenger since entering politics from music and activism. Decentralization echoes broader crypto era themes While Bitchat is not a cryptocurrency product, Wine’s appeal taps into a wider global shift toward decentralized technologies. In recent years, activists worldwide have increasingly explored peer-to-peer tools inspired by blockchain-era principles such as censorship resistance and reduced reliance on central intermediaries. Uganda has seen growing interest in crypto assets and decentralized finance, particularly among younger users seeking alternatives to traditional systems. Analysts note that election-period messaging tools now borrow concepts from the same decentralization playbook, even when they are not blockchain-based. By urging early downloads, Wine framed preparation as critical before any potential shutdown occurs. His message underscored a broader reality facing elections in restrictive digital environments: as governments tighten control over networks, political movements continue to adapt by turning to decentralized communication channels.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 00:46:43

The historical rise of Cardano during 2020-2021 is one obvious example of how investors who entered during the right time stood to gain unusually high returns. Currently, investors are looking for a new cryptocurrency that will replicate this kind of rise, but this time in a vastly different market setting. As Mutuum Finance continues into the latter stages of presale and adoption rates pick up speed, comparisons are being drawn on the possible upside relative to past cycle leaders. For those researching the best cryptocurrency to invest in, new ROI models based on sound precedent are being built. Mutuum Finance Presale Trend This historical framework has been extended to Mutuum Finance , which is a new cryptocurrency being marketed at the intersection of DeFi lending and early price discovery. At present, the presale has entered Phase 7 and the momentum continues to increase. Mutuum Finance has confirmed that a total of $19,500,000 has been raised since the presale started, and there are now 18,620 total MUTM token holders. Currently, Phase 7 costs only $0.04, which reflects a 300% premium over the original entry price of Phase 1 at $0.01. Phase 7 will soon sell out completely and will initiate Phase 8 at $0.045 with a 20% premium to illustrate why Mutuum Finance has emerged within the ranks of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now, given that all subsequent prices will reset to a higher rate. Apart from this, Mutuum is further optimizing engagement through its newly launched dashboard that showcases the leaderboard of the current Top 50 holders. The 24-hour leaderboard rewards the #1 ranked person in the list for that day with a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as at least one transaction takes place in the given duration, which renews at 00:00 UTC. From a foundational standpoint, confidence is also reinforced by the developments in security. The Halborn Security Code Review of Mutuum’s lending and borrowing contracts has concluded, and the codes have been finalized and reviewed. The development traction is also moving forward with V1 protocol deployment on Sepolia Testnet, according to the announcement. The following key components of the platform will be deployed: Liquidity Pools, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot with initial assets being ETH and USDT. Together with the ongoing prize giveaway worth $100,000, these updates heighten the activity level among the yet undecided. With a launch price set at $0.06, existing investors are poised for an ROI gain as high as 420% following the launch, which is the reason why some analysts consider MUTM the next crypto to explode and a serious contender when considering the purchase of the best cryptocurrency. What Makes Timing Increasingly Important With the availability of Phase 7 growing tighter, the opportunity to obtain a $0.04 price and contribute to the growing base of locked-in liquidity is becoming increasingly time-sensitive. As a strategic entry point for investors looking for a proving ground for an asymmetric opportunity in a new cryptocurrency coin, Mutuum Finance is becoming less of an and then and more of an if not now, as it emerges as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.

56668981,650487,1767229236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56668981.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Stress Isn’t Over: Short-Term Holders Remain Underwater,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-stress-isnt-over-short-term-holders/,"Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $88,000 level, yet it continues to struggle below the key $90,000 threshold, failing to sustain any meaningful breakout since early December. Despite several recovery attempts, upside momentum remains weak, reinforcing a broader sense of indecision across the market. As fear and apathy dominate investor behavior, a growing number of analysts are now openly calling for a bear market to unfold in 2026, arguing that the current structure lacks the conditions needed for a renewed bullish phase. This cautious outlook is reinforced by on-chain data shared by top analyst Axel Adler. According to his latest report, short-term holders (STHs) are firmly underwater, with Bitcoin trading well below their average cost basis. The STH Realized Price continues to trend lower, a signal that new demand entering the market is weak and increasingly price-insensitive. Adler notes that this environment reflects pressure from above rather than outright capitulation. While sellers are active, the market has not yet reached the type of forced liquidation typically associated with cycle lows. Instead, Bitcoin appears trapped in a prolonged stress regime, where confidence erodes gradually and rallies are sold into rather than followed through. Until short-term holder profitability improves, sentiment is likely to remain constrained. Short-Term Holder Stress Persists Adler’s latest analysis of Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price highlights why Bitcoin remains locked in a stress regime despite recent attempts to stabilize. The chart compares BTC price with the STH Realized Price—the average cost basis of coins held for less than 155 days—alongside stress indicators and weekly changes in that cost basis. In this framework, the black line represents Bitcoin’s market price, while the orange line tracks the STH Realized Price. Additional overlays, including the STH Stress Score and weekly percentage changes, help contextualize shifts in short-term positioning. According to Adler, Bitcoin has traded consistently below the STH Realized Price since October 17, confirming that stress mode remains active. The weekly change in STH Realized Price has stayed in negative territory and recently reached local lows, signaling that short-term holders continue to redistribute coins at lower prices rather than accumulate at higher levels. This behavior reflects weak incoming demand and reinforces overhead pressure. Price performance across timeframes remains mixed. While Bitcoin has shown modest stabilization over shorter horizons—up roughly 0.9% on the week and 2.3% on the month—the broader picture remains fragile. The 90-day performance is deeply negative at −26.7%, indicating that stress dominates across all major timeframes. Adler’s forecast model points to continued downside pressure, with an expected weekly decline of around 3% if current conditions persist. Crucially, the declining STH Realized Price lowers the resistance “ceiling,” reducing the distance required to return to healthier conditions. However, it also underscores persistent weakness in new demand. A meaningful improvement would require the STH Realized Price to stabilize and turn higher while Bitcoin holds current price levels. Bitcoin Holds Structure But Remains Capped Below Resistance The weekly Bitcoin chart highlights a market caught between long-term structural support and persistent overhead resistance. BTC is trading near the $88,000–$89,000 zone, a level that has acted as a pivot since late November. While price has managed to reclaim this area, it has repeatedly failed to sustain a breakout above $90,000, signaling hesitation rather than renewed bullish momentum. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin remains above its 200-week moving average, which continues to slope upward and currently sits well below price, preserving the broader bullish market structure. The 100-week moving average is also rising and has provided dynamic support during recent pullbacks, reinforcing the idea that long-term buyers are still defending key levels. However, the 50-week moving average has flattened and now acts as immediate resistance, aligning with the broader supply zone between $90,000 and $95,000. After a surge in activity during the sharp correction from October highs, recent weeks show declining volume, suggesting reduced participation and growing apathy among market participants. This environment often precedes a directional move but does not yet favor a clear upside resolution. Technically, as long as Bitcoin holds above the rising 100-week moving average, downside risk appears structurally contained. However, failure to reclaim the 50-week average keeps the market vulnerable to extended consolidation or a deeper corrective phase before any sustainable recovery can develop.

Gold has climbed 9% since early November, the S&P 500 is up 1%, and Bitcoin is down about 20%, trading near $88,000 as of Wednesday. Based on reports, that gap has left crypto quieter while other markets show modest rebounds. Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key Whale Accumulation Signals Santiment’s data points to a split in behavior among holders. Small wallets were busy buying in the second half of 2025, while large wallets largely held steady and sold after pushing up to October’s all-time high. Large holders are often treated as market movers, so their cautious posture has kept pressure on prices. Historically, a shift where big holders start buying while retail eases off has marked real trend shifts, but that condition is not fully obvious yet. 📊 The correlation between Bitcoin & crypto compared to other major sectors is still lagging behind. Since November began, price performances are: 🥇 Gold: +9% 🏦 S&P 500: +1% 🪙 Bitcoin: -20% 🤞 Heading to 2026, there will remain an opportunity for crypto to play “catch up”. pic.twitter.com/FW8JaQboTV — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 30, 2025 On-Chain Data Mixed Reports note some signs of stabilization. Long-term Bitcoin holders trimmed holdings from 14.8 million coins in mid-July to 14.3 million by December, then paused further selling. Active Bitcoin addresses rose 5.51% in the last 24 hours, yet transactions fell almost 30% over the same window. That mismatch suggests more people are watching the market, while fewer are committing funds. The raw numbers show interest, but not a clear shift back to broad trading activity. Market Voices Weigh In Garrett Jin, who once ran exchange BitForex, said traders are already reallocating capital, arguing that money moves from one market to another when opportunities appear. Capital is the same and as always, it is wise to sell high and buy low, Jin wrote, according to posts on social channels. Another analyst, CyrilXBT, described the current setup as late-cycle positioning before a possible rotation: when liquidity turns, gold could cool, Bitcoin might lead, and other tokens could follow. Bitcoin right now continues to look just like the 2016-2017 period, just before a parabolic move. These two setups continue to flash in our mind due to the extreme similarities and bullish signals are even holding & flashing here too.$BTC‘s looking ready to absolutely GO 🚀… pic.twitter.com/H1hInYwix8 — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 30, 2025 Price Calls And Technical Views Technical commentators remain split. Javon Marks has pointed to parabolic patterns in Bitcoin’s chart that echo the 2016–2017 build-up and continues to forecast a rally toward $125K. Based on CoinCodex data, a more modest move is expected first: the platform forecasts BTC could reach $91,500 by January 30, 2026, a rise of 3.68% from current levels. Related Reading: Crypto Policy In The Hot Seat As US Lawmaker Calls SEC Hearing CoinCodex lists sentiment as bearish and the Fear & Greed Index at 23 (Extreme Fear). The site also notes Bitcoin had 15/30 green days and 2.11% volatility over the past 30 days, with the last update on Dec 31, 2025. Short-term traders should focus on whether large wallets resume buying in volume, and whether transactions pick up alongside rising active addresses. If whales start accumulating again while long-term holders stop reducing positions, that combination would give a stronger signal than either metric alone. In the meantime, reports point to stabilization rather than a confirmed reversal, leaving room for a catch-up move in 2026 if liquidity and sentiment turn.

According to reports, the firm stopped its daily purchases on December 4, 2025, and will hold the coins it already owns rather than add more. The company still retains roughly 510 BTC on its books. The move comes after a stretch of weak crypto markets and a recent $48 million equity raise that executives say will be used to back its consumer health brand. Prenetics Halts Daily Bitcoin Buying According to Bloomberg and other news outlets, Prenetics had been testing a treasury approach similar to models used by other public firms that purchased Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The company began accumulating Bitcoin earlier in 2025, but management signaled a change in course as market conditions grew harder. Reports have disclosed that the board and leadership looked at the math and decided pausing purchases would better protect cash and shareholder value while preserving the existing crypto holding. IM8 Growth Takes Center Stage Based on reports , a large part of the shift is driven by the rapid growth of IM8, Prenetics’ consumer health and nutrition brand co-founded with Beckham. The company has said IM8 reached over $100 million in annualized recurring revenue within 11 months of operations. Management has also provided guidance that IM8 could generate about $180 million–$200 million in revenue in fiscal 2026, numbers that have helped persuade investors the business can stand on its own. The $48 million round completed in October 2025 was seen as funding to both back IM8 expansion and to support the earlier Bitcoin plan; now the emphasis is being redirected. Market Reaction Shares of Prenetics have shown relative stability even after the announcement, reflecting some investor support for the health business strategy. Analysts and market watchers say the company’s decision mirrors a wider reassessment among several firms that had adopted crypto treasury strategies earlier in the year. Where some companies doubled down, others chose caution as Bitcoin fell from its highs and volatility persisted. Reports point out that holding the existing 510 BTC lets Prenetics keep potential upside without committing fresh capital while it focuses on product growth.

Analyst Makes The Case,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-risk-drop-to-0-80-analyst-makes-case/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how XRP could be at risk of a drop toward $0.80 based on the data of some on-chain indicators. XRP Has Seen Bearish Developments In On-Chain Data In a new thread on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about why XRP may be at risk of seeing a decline to the $0.80 level. “First, network activity has cooled sharply,” noted Martinez. There are many ways to gauge network activity, but the analyst has used the Active Addresses on-chain indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium At Rare Discount As US Demand Weakens This metric keeps track of the total number of addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain every day. A chart shared by the analyst earlier showed a drawdown in this metric for XRP. Generally, a decline in the metric is a sign of a drop in interest around the asset. “Daily active addresses have fallen to roughly 38,500, pointing to fading participation and interest,” said Martinez. Another on-chain indicator has also shown a development recently: the supply held by the whales. Whales refer to the big-money investors of the market who carry significant amounts in their wallets. As the below chart shows, these investors participated in selling of about 40 million tokens recently. Due to the massive size of their holdings, whales are considered to be influential entities on the network, so their behavior could be relevant for the cryptocurrency. As these massive hands have been selling on the XRP blockchain recently, it’s possible that the coin could feel a bearish effect. If nothing else, the trend reflects that the asset’s key investors are showing weaker confidence. Finally, the analyst has shared a chart for the cryptocurrency’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). This indicator basically tells us about the amount of supply that investors last purchased at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. From the chart, it’s visible that a notable amount of supply has its cost basis at the $1.77 level, which isn’t too far below the current XRP spot price. It’s possible that if the asset retests this level, these investors who purchased there could show some kind of reaction. When the market mood is bullish, this reaction tends to be dominated by buying. Given the current sentiment in the digital asset sector, however, the support may not be sufficient. “If selling pressure continues, XRP risks losing the $1.77 support,” explained Martinez. “A breakdown there opens the door to the next major support zone near $0.80.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? This support zone near $0.80 is currently the largest demand zone beyond the $1.77 level. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $1.86, unchanged from one week ago.

Judge Roy K. Altman of the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida said in an order dated Friday that the plaintiffs failed to establish personal jurisdiction over Cuban and the team, and the court lacked a sufficient connection between Florida and the alleged promotion. Cuban’s Personal Investment Remarks Drew Legal Scrutiny The suit, filed in 2022, argued that Cuban pushed fans toward Voyager’s interest-bearing accounts after he said at an Oct. 2021 Mavericks news conference that he had personally invested in the company. It also pointed to a Mavericks post that offered $100 in Bitcoin to customers who downloaded Voyager’s app, opened an account, deposited $100, and made one trade. Cuban’s lawyers argued the Florida court had no jurisdiction over Cuban or the team, and said he warned people to be careful with their money. Voyager Once Held Billions Before 2022 Bankruptcy Brown Rudnick, which represented Cuban and the Mavericks, said Judge Altman dismissed the case without prejudice after years of litigation and jurisdictional discovery, adding that nationwide promotions did not amount to purposeful targeting of Florida residents under the state’s long arm statute and due process limits. “We couldn’t be more pleased with the absolute right result,” Steve Best, lead counsel for Cuban and the Mavericks, reportedly told ESPN . “I suspect that the plaintiffs will consider filing in another jurisdiction. … I look forward to defending Mark and the Mavericks in any jurisdiction in this country. “Mark doesn’t settle when he believes he is on the right side of the law.” The case sits within a broader wave of lawsuits aimed at athletes and celebrities who promoted crypto platforms that later failed, including Voyager, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Voyager reportedly held more than $5B in assets in 2021 and counted nearly 3.5M investors before its collapse. Cuban has since sold his majority stake in the Mavericks to casino magnate Miriam Adelson.

The CFTC said on Dec. 31 that Chairman Michael S. Selig appointed Zaidi to the role , after Zaidi spent nearly a decade at the agency before leaving for the private sector. “Amir brings to this role deep experience both at the Commission and in the financial services world,” Selig said, linking Zaidi’s track record to the agency’s push to shape new rules for digital asset markets. . @CFTC Chairman Selig Announces Amir Zaidi as Chief of Staff: https://t.co/Y5aoBVqVWo — CFTC (@CFTC) December 31, 2025 From Market Oversight Chief To Bitcoin Futures Architect Zaidi worked at the CFTC from 2010 to 2019, and he most recently led the Division of Market Oversight, where the agency said he oversaw the certification and deployment of the first federally regulated crypto product, Bitcoin futures . That moment traces back to late 2017, when the CFTC said CME and Cboe Futures Exchange self-certified new Bitcoin futures contracts, opening a path for US-listed trading days later. After leaving government, Zaidi became global head of compliance at broker-dealer TP ICAP, a role the firm announced in 2019 after his tenure at the CFTC. New Chief Of Staff Arrives As Policy Direction Shifts “I am excited to return to the CFTC and thank Chairman Selig for appointing me to this important role,” Zaidi said, adding that he plans to help carry out the chairman’s pro innovation agenda as derivatives markets evolve. Zaidi’s return lands days after Selig was sworn in as the 16th CFTC chairman, following a Trump nomination in October and Senate confirmation on Dec. 18. Selig has framed the moment as a shift from regulation by enforcement toward clearer rules, and his agency has already moved deeper into crypto plumbing, including steps that have put regulated US venues closer to spot style crypto trading. For crypto markets, the staffing move is another signal that the CFTC expects to sit near the centre of US market structure talks in 2026, with Selig pointing to digital asset legislation moving toward President Trump’s desk and a bigger push to keep crypto activity onshore.

56670432,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257814,1767236111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"ETF Flows Reveal Alarming Lack of New Demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Glassnode Reports",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/etf-flows-show-no-demand-glassnode/,"BitcoinWorld ETF Flows Reveal Alarming Lack of New Demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Glassnode Reports Recent data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode delivers a sobering assessment of cryptocurrency market dynamics: ETF flows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to show no signs of new demand entering the market. The firm’s latest analysis, published this week, reveals that the 30-day moving average of net flows for these flagship digital assets remains firmly in negative territory. This persistent trend raises important questions about current market sentiment and the immediate trajectory for cryptocurrency investments. Market analysts globally are now scrutinizing these ETF flow patterns to understand their broader implications. ETF Flows Demonstrate Persistent Market Caution Glassnode’s comprehensive analysis examines exchange-traded fund movements with particular attention to timing and volume. The firm tracks daily inflows and outflows across major ETF products, then calculates rolling averages to identify underlying trends. Consequently, their methodology filters out short-term volatility to reveal sustained directional movements. The resulting data clearly shows negative net flows persisting beyond temporary market fluctuations. This pattern suggests institutional and retail investors maintain a cautious approach despite recent price movements. Furthermore, the consistency across both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs indicates a sector-wide phenomenon rather than asset-specific concerns. Several factors potentially contribute to this ongoing trend. Regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major markets. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions influence traditional investment allocations. The data also reflects seasonal patterns observed in previous years. Glassnode’s report emphasizes that negative flows don’t necessarily predict price declines. However, they do indicate reduced buying pressure from ETF channels. Market participants should therefore consider these flows alongside other indicators like on-chain activity and derivatives positioning. Understanding the 30-Day Moving Average Metric Glassnode employs the 30-day moving average as their primary analytical tool for ETF flows. This statistical approach smooths daily variations to highlight underlying trends. Essentially, it calculates the average net flow over the previous thirty days, updating each day with the latest figure. A negative value indicates more money has exited than entered ETF products during that period. The moving average’s persistence below zero demonstrates trend strength rather than isolated daily events. This methodology provides clearer signals than raw daily data, which often contains noise from large individual transactions. The table below illustrates hypothetical flow patterns over a recent period: Week Bitcoin ETF Net Flow Ethereum ETF Net Flow 30-Day Average Trend Week 1 -$42M -$18M Negative Week 2 -$38M -$22M Negative Week 3 +$15M -$10M Negative Week 4 -$50M -$25M Negative As shown, occasional positive weeks don’t necessarily reverse the broader trend. The moving average maintains its negative reading throughout the period. This persistence concerns analysts who monitor institutional adoption signals. Glassnode’s report compares current readings to historical patterns from previous market cycles. Their analysis suggests similar flow patterns often preceded periods of consolidation. However, the firm carefully avoids making direct price predictions based solely on this single metric. Expert Perspectives on Flow Data Interpretation Financial analysts emphasize several key considerations when interpreting ETF flow data. First, they note that ETF flows represent just one channel of market demand. Direct cryptocurrency purchases on exchanges continue independently. Second, seasonal factors often influence investment patterns during certain calendar periods. Third, regulatory announcements frequently trigger temporary flow disruptions. Industry experts from firms like CoinShares and Fidelity often provide complementary data to Glassnode’s analysis. Jameson Lopp, Chief Security Officer at Casa, recently commented on similar metrics. He noted that on-chain data sometimes contradicts ETF flow patterns. His analysis suggests sophisticated investors may use multiple entry methods. Consequently, ETF data alone provides an incomplete picture. Other analysts highlight the growing importance of global ETF products beyond United States markets. European and Canadian ETFs show different flow patterns that Glassnode’s report acknowledges but doesn’t emphasize. This geographical diversification complicates simple interpretations of aggregate flow data. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparisons Current ETF flow patterns gain significance when viewed alongside historical data. Previous market cycles show similar periods of negative flows during consolidation phases. For instance, 2019 saw extended periods of neutral-to-negative ETF movements before subsequent rallies. However, direct comparisons require caution due to market maturation. The cryptocurrency ETF landscape has expanded dramatically since earlier cycles. More products now exist across more jurisdictions with greater total assets under management. Several distinctive factors characterize the current environment: Increased institutional participation changes flow dynamics Regulatory clarity has improved in some regions Macroeconomic conditions differ substantially from previous cycles Technological developments like Ethereum’s upgrades affect investment theses Environmental concerns influence some institutional allocation decisions Glassnode’s analysis references these evolving conditions while presenting historical comparisons. Their report notes that current negative flows appear less severe than during previous bear markets when measured proportionally. This relative strength might indicate underlying market resilience despite surface-level caution. The firm’s data scientists employ sophisticated normalization techniques to enable meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Their methodology accounts for total market capitalization changes and product availability differences. Broader Market Implications and Future Monitoring The persistence of negative ETF flows carries implications beyond immediate price action. Market structure evolves in response to sustained flow patterns. Liquidity providers adjust their strategies when ETF activity diminishes. Trading venues may reallocate resources between products. Regulatory bodies monitor these flows as indicators of market health. Glassnode’s report suggests several areas warranting close observation in coming months. First, the relationship between ETF flows and on-chain accumulation patterns deserves attention. Sometimes, negative ETF flows coincide with increased direct blockchain purchases. Second, derivatives market positioning may compensate for reduced ETF activity. Third, geographical flow variations could signal regional market developments. Analysts should monitor these interconnected indicators rather than focusing solely on ETF metrics. Glassnode plans to publish follow-up research exploring these relationships in greater depth. The firm’s data infrastructure tracks numerous complementary metrics including: Exchange net position changes Long-term holder behavior Miner outflow patterns Options market positioning Stablecoin supply ratios These additional datasets provide context for interpreting ETF flow information. Glassnode emphasizes that no single metric determines market outcomes. Instead, converging signals from multiple indicators offer more reliable insights. Their latest report represents one piece of this broader analytical puzzle. Market participants should integrate this information with other fundamental and technical analyses. Conclusion Glassnode’s analysis of ETF flows reveals continuing caution among cryptocurrency investors, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum products experiencing negative net flows on a 30-day moving average basis. This persistent trend suggests new demand hasn’t yet materialized through ETF channels despite other potentially positive market developments. However, experienced analysts emphasize that ETF flows represent just one component of complex market dynamics. The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem continues evolving with multiple demand sources and investment vehicles. Glassnode’s data provides valuable insight into institutional and retail sentiment through ETF participation. Market observers should monitor whether these flow patterns persist or reverse in coming weeks, while considering complementary data from on-chain metrics and derivatives markets. The relationship between ETF flows and overall market health remains multifaceted, requiring nuanced interpretation rather than simplistic conclusions. FAQs Q1: What does negative ETF flow indicate? Negative ETF flow means more money is exiting than entering exchange-traded fund products during the measured period. This suggests reduced buying pressure through those specific investment vehicles, though investors might use other channels. Q2: How significant is the 30-day moving average in Glassnode’s analysis? The 30-day moving average smooths daily volatility to reveal underlying trends. Its persistence in negative territory indicates sustained caution rather than temporary fluctuations, making it more significant than single-day readings. Q3: Do negative ETF flows necessarily mean cryptocurrency prices will decline? Not necessarily. ETF flows represent just one demand source among many. Prices respond to numerous factors including direct exchange purchases, derivatives activity, macroeconomic conditions, and broader adoption trends beyond ETF channels. Q4: How do Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows typically compare? Both generally follow similar patterns due to correlated market sentiment, though Ethereum flows often show greater volatility. Currently, both maintain negative 30-day averages according to Glassnode’s latest data. Q5: What should investors monitor alongside ETF flow data? Investors should consider on-chain metrics like exchange balances and holder behavior, derivatives market positioning, regulatory developments, macroeconomic indicators, and technological progress within blockchain ecosystems.

This decisive action follows confirmed delays in block creation on the NKN blockchain network. Consequently, the exchange prioritizes user asset security above transaction continuity. This event highlights the intricate relationship between decentralized networks and centralized trading platforms. Upbit NKN Suspension: A Proactive Security Measure Upbit officially announced the suspension on its website and through user notifications. The exchange cited “delays in block generation” as the core technical reason. Block creation is the fundamental process that validates and records transactions on a blockchain. When this process slows, transactions can become stuck in a pending state. This creates uncertainty about their finality. Upbit’s protocol mandates a temporary halt during such network instability. The policy prevents users from depositing funds that may not confirm or withdrawing assets that may not properly transfer on-chain. This is not an isolated incident in the crypto industry. Major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken maintain similar security frameworks. They frequently pause services for specific tokens during network upgrades, congestion, or suspected vulnerabilities. For instance, Ethereum network upgrades often prompt preemptive halts. The Upbit NKN suspension follows this established risk-management playbook. It demonstrates the exchange’s operational diligence. Understanding the NKN Network and Block Creation Delays NKN, or New Kind of Network, is a project focused on decentralizing internet infrastructure. It aims to create a peer-to-peer data transmission network. The NKN blockchain uses a unique consensus mechanism called “Proof of Relay.” This mechanism incentivizes users to share network bandwidth. However, like all blockchain networks, it relies on consistent block production. Delays can stem from several technical factors. Network Congestion: A sudden surge in transaction volume can overwhelm node processing capacity. Consensus Issues: Temporary disagreements among network validators can slow block finalization. Software Bugs: An undiscovered flaw in a recent client update might disrupt normal operation. Node Synchronization Problems: If a significant portion of nodes falls out of sync, the chain can temporarily stall. At the time of Upbit’s announcement, the NKN core development team had not released a detailed root-cause analysis. The blockchain explorer data showed irregular block times preceding the halt. Network participants reported longer-than-usual confirmation waits for transactions. Expert Analysis on Exchange Risk Management Industry analysts view such suspensions as a necessary, if inconvenient, aspect of crypto trading. “An exchange’s primary duty is custody,” states Dr. Lena Choi, a blockchain security researcher at the Seoul Digital Finance Institute. “When a network behaves unpredictably, the only responsible action is to pause and assess. Proceeding could lead to double-spend attempts or loss of funds. While frustrating for users, it’s a sign of a mature security posture.” Dr. Choi’s research emphasizes that exchanges acting as custodians bear significant liability for user assets. Historical data supports this cautious approach. In 2022, a similar delay on another network led an exchange to continue processing withdrawals. This resulted in a multi-million dollar loss due to a chain reorganization. Upbit’s preemptive move aims to avoid such a scenario. The exchange has a history of swift action during network events, having previously suspended services for tokens like Qtum and Waves during their own technical incidents. Immediate Impact on Traders and the NKN Market The suspension’s immediate effect is the isolation of NKN liquidity on Upbit. Users cannot move tokens on or off the exchange. However, spot trading of NKN against Korean Won (KRW) and Bitcoin (BTC) typically remains active internally. This allows users to buy or sell the token within the exchange’s order book. The price impact is often neutral or slightly negative in the short term due to reduced arbitrage opportunities. Other global exchanges listing NKN, such as Gate.io and MEXC, did not immediately follow with suspensions. Their network monitoring may have indicated different conditions. This creates a temporary fragmentation in the NKN market. Price discrepancies between Upbit and other platforms may emerge until services resume. Traders often monitor these spreads for potential opportunities post-resumption. Recent Cryptocurrency Exchange Service Halts (2024-2025) Exchange Token Reason Duration Binance Polygon (MATIC) Network Upgrade ~4 hours Coinbase Solana (SOL) Congestion ~8 hours Kraken Avalanche (AVAX) Consensus Issue ~12 hours Upbit NKN Block Creation Delay Pending The Resolution Process and User Guidance Upbit will restore services only after confirming network stability. The process involves close coordination with the NKN development team. Upbit’s technical staff will monitor block production consistency over a designated period. They will also test deposit and withdrawal functions in a controlled environment. The exchange typically provides updates via official announcements. Users should rely solely on these verified channels and avoid speculation from social media. During the suspension, users should take specific steps. First, they must verify the official announcement on Upbit’s notice board. Second, they should avoid attempting to force deposits via the blockchain, as funds may be lost or delayed. Third, monitoring the NKN blockchain explorer provides independent confirmation of network health. Finally, patience is crucial, as premature resumption poses risks to all network participants. Conclusion The Upbit NKN suspension underscores a critical reality in cryptocurrency markets. The security of digital assets depends on both robust blockchain networks and vigilant custodial services. Upbit’s decision to halt deposits and withdrawals for NKN reflects a prudent, security-first protocol activated by block creation delays. While temporarily disruptive for traders, such measures protect the ecosystem from larger financial and technical risks. This event serves as a reminder of the evolving infrastructure supporting digital asset trading and the importance of exchange transparency during network incidents. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade NKN on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Typically, yes. Suspensions usually affect only deposit and withdrawal functions. Spot trading between NKN, KRW, and BTC on Upbit’s internal order book often remains operational unless otherwise specified. Q2: How long will the Upbit NKN suspension last? A2: There is no predetermined duration. The halt will persist until Upbit’s security team verifies that the NKN network is producing blocks consistently and reliably. This depends on the resolution of the underlying technical issue. Q3: Are my NKN tokens safe on Upbit during this time? A3: The suspension is a security measure designed specifically to keep assets safe. Tokens held in your Upbit wallet are not at increased risk due to the halt. The action prevents movement during a period of network uncertainty. Q4: Should I be worried about the NKN network itself? A4: Temporary block creation delays are not uncommon in blockchain networks. They can result from congestion, minor software glitches, or consensus processes. The NKN development team is likely investigating. Monitor their official channels for technical updates. Q5: What happens if I send NKN to my Upbit deposit address during the suspension? A5: You should NOT do this. The transaction may not be credited to your account automatically and could be stuck in a pending state. Always wait for an official “Resumption of Services” notice from Upbit before making any deposits.

Dogecoin, Solana, & Others Have Seen A Decline In Volume Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Trading Volume for the various assets in the cryptocurrency sector. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of a given token that became involved in trading activities on exchanges over the past week. When the value of the metric rises, it means trading activity related to the asset is going up. Such a trend can be a sign that interest in the cryptocurrency is increasing. On the other hand, the indicator going down can imply investors are shifting their attention away from the coin as they are participating in a lower amount of trading. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Trading Volume for nine major assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Cardano, Solana, BNB, XRP, Tron, and Chainlink. As displayed in the above graph, the Trading Volume has witnessed a plunge across the sector over the last couple of weeks. Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other assets have all shown price consolidation in this period, so the cooldown in trading activity could partly be due to traders getting bored. Generally, investors like to trade more when price action is “exciting.” Volatile moves like rallies or crashes especially attract attention to the market. In phases of sideways price action, though, interest tends to die down. There is also another reason behind the recent decline in the Trading Volume besides the price action: the holidays . From the chart, it’s visible that the holiday period at the end of 2024 also saw the indicator have a similarly low value for Bitcoin. There has been one big difference in market behavior between now and then, however. As the analytics firm has explained: Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin were still seeing significant movement. This year, they have less than half the weekly trading volume. What could be the consequence of this low activity? While hard to say for certain, price action usually tends to be muted when there is a lack of trading interest, as moves fail to build momentum in either direction. Thus, it’s possible that the current phase of consolidation could stretch for the market, unless some surprise news drops that becomes a trigger for volatility .

Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report Ethereum Holds ‘Equilibrium Level’ Ethereum is attempting to end the year above a crucial area following its recent sideways action. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend for the past three months, currently recording a 27.8% decline from its Q4 opening of $4,145. ETH has been trading sideways over the past several weeks, hovering within the $2,800-$3,000 price range. During this period, the King of Altcoins has failed to hold above the upper boundary on the weekly timeframe despite multiple attempts to break out. Amid this performance, market watcher Crypto Batman recently noted Ethereum is trading around the mid-zone of a multi-year bullish channel, which he named “the equilibrium level.” This zone has historically acted as both a strong support and resistance point for Ethereum, he explained, making it the crucial area to hold as we approach the monthly and yearly closes. Despite the recent price action, Crypto Batman suggested that “given how ETH rallied from $1,500 to $4,600, this current move looks like nothing more than a bullish retest to that equilibrium, likely forming the next higher low.” Similarly, analyst Cas Abbé affirmed that the leading altcoin’s structure remains “incredibly bullish” even with the recent volatility, highlighting ETH’s uptrend line on the higher timeframes. According to the post, the cryptocurrency has not only held its ascending trendline over the past eight months but also bounced after each retest, suggesting that a rebound could be possible if this level continues to hold on the higher timeframes. ETH Breakout In Early 2026? Crypto Jelle also shared a bullish outlook for Ethereum, affirming that the altcoin looks strong on the macro chart. “If price can push towards $4k from here, I doubt bears can hold it down again,” the analyst wrote on X, adding that “It might finally be time for ETH to shine again next year.” Market observer Trader Tardigrade underscored a giant Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on ETH’s weekly chart. Per the post, the cryptocurrency has been forming this bullish pattern for the past two years, with the neckline currently located around the $4,950-$5,000 mark. Notably, the left shoulder and head developed during the Q3-Q4 2024 and Q2-Q3 2025 rallies. Meanwhile, the Q4 2025 correction has started to form the pattern’s right shoulder, which signals that the altcoin could rise to the neckline area in the next few months, and potentially aim for higher levels if the pattern continues to develop. In the shorter timeframe, Man of Bitcoin noted that Ethereum could see a breakout in the first week of 2026. The analyst pointed out a one-month symmetrical triangle formation on ETH’s chart, where the price has been “getting squeezed between both trendlines.” Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target While the altcoin continues to compress between these levels, a break from the pattern becomes more likely, leading the market watcher to suggest a 15%-20% breakout toward the $3,400 resistance.

While data consistently shows most successful founders hold degrees, a cultural shift is sweeping through Silicon Valley. Young entrepreneurs now strategically highlight their uncompleted education during investor pitches. This phenomenon reflects deeper changes in how the venture ecosystem evaluates risk, conviction, and timing in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. The College Dropout Founder Phenomenon in Modern Venture Capital Historically, iconic figures like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg created the mythology of the dropout founder. However, comprehensive studies from institutions like MIT and Stanford reveal a different reality. Approximately 85% of unicorn startup founders possess bachelor’s degrees. Furthermore, 40% hold advanced degrees. Despite these statistics, the romanticized narrative persists and experiences cyclical resurgences. The current AI boom has catalyzed the most significant resurgence in decades. Venture capitalists report a noticeable increase in founders emphasizing their dropout status during initial meetings. This trend represents a complex calculation about perceived dedication versus formal credentialing. Y Combinator Demo Days have become ground zero for observing this shift. During recent batches, partners noted a strategic pattern. Founders explicitly mention leaving prestigious institutions in their one-minute pitches. Katie Jacobs Stanton of Moxxie Ventures observed this firsthand. “The dropout status functions as a badge of honor,” she explained. “It communicates a founder’s willingness to prioritize their vision over conventional milestones.” This signaling occurs even as leading AI companies like Cursor and Cognition boast founders from MIT and Harvard. The contradiction highlights a tension between proven educational pathways and the allure of disruptive, non-traditional backgrounds. The Psychology of Founder Signaling and Investor Perception Investor psychology plays a crucial role in this trend. A dropout narrative can signal several attractive founder qualities: Extreme conviction: Willingness to abandon secure paths Risk tolerance: Comfort with uncertainty and high-stakes decisions Urgency: Belief in capturing a fleeting market window Resourcefulness: Ability to progress without institutional support However, venture capitalists approach this signal with nuanced caution. Yuri Sagalov of General Catalyst provides critical perspective. He argues that investors increasingly evaluate the substance behind the story. “The fourth-year dropout versus the freshman dropout tells different stories,” Sagalov noted. “We assess what they built during their education and what networks they accessed.” This analytical approach suggests the ecosystem is maturing beyond simplistic dropout worship. Investors now seek founders who leveraged educational environments strategically before making their leap. AI Boom Intensifies the Education Versus Execution Calculus The artificial intelligence revolution has fundamentally altered the startup timeline. Founders perceive an unprecedented opportunity window that may close within years. This perception creates intense pressure on student entrepreneurs. They face a dilemma: complete their degree or build during the AI gold rush. Kulveer Taggar of Phosphor Capital identifies this dynamic clearly. “Founders experience genuine FOMO,” Taggar stated. “They see peers raising capital and worry that waiting means missing the wave.” This urgency manifests in dramatic decisions. Professors at elite universities report students leaving during their final semesters. One Stanford computer science professor described a top student departing weeks before graduation. That student believed a diploma might actually hinder fundraising efforts. This extreme viewpoint, while not universal, illustrates the potent mythology developing around dropout status in AI circles. The fear isn’t merely about missing opportunities. It’s about being perceived as insufficiently committed by a venture community currently celebrating bold, all-in founders. Educational Backgrounds of Notable AI Startup Founders (2023-2025) Founder Company Educational Background Funding Stage Michael Truell Cursor MIT Graduate Series B Scott Wu Cognition Harvard Graduate Series A Brendan Foody Mercor Georgetown Dropout Seed Multiple Founders Various YC AI Startups College/Grad School Dropouts Pre-seed/Seed The Counterargument: Wisdom, Networks, and Long-Term Advantage Not all investors embrace the dropout trend. Wesley Chan of FPV Ventures presents a compelling counter-narrative. He prioritizes founder wisdom over youthful boldness. “Young founders often lack the scar tissue needed for difficult decisions,” Chan argued. “I typically seek founders with more life and business experience.” This perspective highlights an ongoing debate within venture capital. Some firms believe the AI market’s complexity favors experienced operators. These operators often developed their skills within structured educational or corporate environments. Furthermore, universities provide intangible advantages that dropouts might forfeit. Sagalov emphasizes the enduring value of elite university networks. “You gain social capital simply by attending,” he explained. “That network persists regardless of degree completion.” This social capital translates into hiring advantages, advisor access, and peer support systems. Founders who leave institutions early must work harder to build equivalent networks. They often rely on accelerator programs like Y Combinator to fill this gap. However, these programs cannot fully replicate the decade-spanning connections formed during university years. How Venture Capitalists Actually Evaluate Founder Credentials Beneath the cultural fascination with dropouts, venture capitalists employ sophisticated evaluation frameworks. Educational background constitutes just one data point among many. Investors typically assess several key dimensions: Technical proficiency: Demonstrated through projects, contributions, or technical interviews Market insight: Depth of understanding about the problem space Execution history: Evidence of building and shipping products Team composition: Complementary skills among co-founders Traction metrics: User growth, revenue, or technological breakthroughs The dropout narrative gains power when combined with strong performance in these areas. A founder who left Stanford but built a working AI prototype with real users presents a compelling case. Conversely, a dropout without tangible progress struggles to secure meetings. The venture ecosystem ultimately rewards demonstrated ability over symbolic gestures. This reality tempers the dropout trend’s practical impact on funding decisions. The Global Context: Educational Trends Beyond Silicon Valley This phenomenon remains predominantly American, particularly concentrated in tech hubs. European and Asian venture ecosystems maintain stronger preferences for formal credentials. Cultural differences influence these attitudes. Many international markets value educational prestige as a reliable signaling mechanism. However, the globalization of Silicon Valley culture may shift these norms. As Y Combinator and other accelerators attract more international founders, dropout narratives may gain traction worldwide. This diffusion could reshape global entrepreneurship education and investor expectations over the next decade. Conclusion The college dropout founder credential represents a fascinating cultural moment in venture capital. It reflects the AI sector’s breakneck pace and the premium placed on decisive action. However, beneath the compelling narratives, data and investor behavior reveal a more complex reality. Successful founders come from diverse educational backgrounds. The venture ecosystem ultimately seeks exceptional builders, regardless of their academic completion status. As the AI market matures, the dropout trend may evolve or recede. Yet its current prominence offers valuable insights into founder psychology, investor signaling, and the perpetual tension between tradition and disruption in technology innovation. FAQs Q1: Do most successful startup founders actually drop out of college? No, comprehensive data shows most successful founders complete their degrees. Studies indicate over 85% of unicorn founders hold bachelor’s degrees, with many possessing advanced degrees. The dropout narrative, while culturally prominent, represents a minority of cases. Q2: Why are venture capitalists currently interested in dropout founders? In the context of the AI boom, dropout status can signal strong conviction, risk tolerance, and urgency. Investors perceive these founders as fully committed to capturing a perceived narrow market window. However, this interest is nuanced and varies significantly among different venture firms. Q3: What advantages do founders gain by completing their degrees? Degree completion provides access to alumni networks, institutional credibility, structured learning environments, and proof of follow-through. These advantages can aid in hiring, partnerships, and later-stage fundraising, especially outside Silicon Valley. Q4: Are dropout founders more common in AI than other tech sectors? Yes, the current AI investment frenzy has intensified the trend. The perceived rapid evolution of AI technology creates fear of missing out (FOMO), pushing founders to start building immediately rather than completing traditional education timelines. Q5: How should aspiring entrepreneurs approach the dropout decision? Experts recommend a strategic evaluation. Founders should assess their specific startup idea’s urgency, their personal financial situation, their progress without full-time dedication, and their access to networks. There’s no universal correct answer—the decision depends on individual circumstances and market timing.

Broadcom and Nvidia have rallied by 49% and 39% YTD, respectively. Skeptics had been circling Google for months, questioning whether it could keep up in a world driven by AI. ChatGPT and Sora, both OpenAI products, were pulling users away from Gemini, and then advertisers started testing new ways to reach users in a space filled with AI chatbots and agents. Google’s globally-dominating search model was under pressure, and the company’s ability to stay relevant was being challenged on all fronts. Gemini app, Nano Banana, and AI hires drive recovery In April, Google appointed Josh Woodward, who had been with the company for 16 years, to lead the Gemini app, and his team pushed out Nano Banana in August, a feature that allowed users to create AI-generated images by blending multiple photos into a single digital creation. The feature went viral, and by the end of September, Gemini had processed over 5 billion images, surpassing ChatGPT on Apple’s App Store. That same summer, Google signed a deal with Varun Mohan, CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, and hired several of his top engineers. Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI for $3 billion. Those talks collapsed, and Google stepped in, agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and compensation to secure the engineering talent. That move added critical AI depth to its team at a time when the pressure was on to innovate quickly. Court ruling, Gemini 3, and growing search revenue add fuel In September, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta handed Google a legal win despite the company being found guilty of running an illegal monopoly in internet search last year. Mehta ruled against the Justice Department’s harshest proposals, meaning Google wouldn’t be forced to spin off Chrome or stop making payments to have its apps preloaded. The company can still pay Apple billions to keep its search engine the default option on iPhones. However, it now has to share some data with competitors as part of the ruling. In November, Google released Gemini 3, just eight months after Gemini 2.5. Usage is still behind ChatGPT, but it’s catching up. This month, Gemini reached 18% of generative AI traffic, up from 5% a year ago, while ChatGPT fell to 68% from 87%. Analysts at Citizens noted that the real value isn’t just Gemini itself but the impact on core search, where the company has embedded AI-powered summaries under a feature called AI Overviews. “The incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers,” said the analysts, who also said they believe Google can grow search revenue in Q4 2025. They kept a buy recommendation on the stock. Analysts also pointed to strength in Google Cloud, which is competing directly with Amazon and Microsoft. They flagged the Waymo division and its robotaxi operations as another area that could keep investors interested into 2026. Expectations are already high. LSEG estimates that Google will report Q4 revenue over $111 billion, a 15% jump from last year. Revenue growth next year is expected to stay in the low teens. In October, Alphabet raised its 2025 capital spending forecast to $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts at FactSet expect it to climb to $114 billion in 2026. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on the October earnings call that Google Cloud signed more billion-dollar deals in the first three quarters of 2025 than in all of 2023 and 2024 combined. Still, not everyone’s relaxed. Analysts at Pivotal Research said that if OpenAI runs into financial problems or cuts spending, the ripple effect could hit the entire AI sector, including Google. But they’re not pulling back. Pivotal raised their Google price target by $50 to $400, which is 28% above Wednesday’s close of $313. “ We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000,” they wrote, “and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer, much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Business|AI|Google,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-01 03:23:10

US Risks Giving China A Major Global Advantage On Tuesday, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer (CPO), Faryar Shirzad, warned the US Congress that banning interest payments on the digital assets could risk diminishing the legislative efforts and victories obtained this year with the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. In an X post, Shirzad affirmed that “tokenization is the future and the GENIUS Act was a visionary move by POTUS and Congress to ensure US dollar stablecoins issued under US rules would be the primary settlement instrument of the future.” However, Shirzad noted that the “sobering and timely” announcement by the People’s Bank of China of its plan to pay interest on the Digital Yuan could pose a bigger problem to the US than investors think. As reported by Bitcoinist, China is about to start paying interest on its Digital Yuan (e-CNY). Deputy Governor at the People’s Bank of China, Lu Lei, recently shared a new framework that will redefine the rules of virtual currency, giving it the same legal status as deposits held at banks. Under the new framework , commercial banks that manage Digital Yuan wallets will be able to pay interest to clients based on the amount of e-CNY they hold, starting from January 1, 2026. Based on this, Shirzad cautioned that “If this issue is mishandled in Senate negotiations on the market structure bill, it could hand our global rivals a big assist in giving non-US stablecoins and CBDCs a critical competitive advantage at the worst possible time.” Stablecoin Rewards: A ‘Matter Of National Security’ Coinbase’s CPO added that although “lobbyists for entrenched incumbents will always fight change,” it’s crucial for Congress to “protect the primacy of the US dollar and the US financial system, “not just incumbent interests.” Similarly, other crypto executives agreed with Shirzad’s statement, including Coinbase’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Armstrong and Variant’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Jake Chervinsky. Armstrong emphasized that US “stablecoins must remain competitive on a global stage. Meanwhile, Chervinsky asserted that banks’ push to ban stablecoin rewards “isn’t just a matter of incumbents seeking a regulatory moat. It’s a matter of national security.” To the lawyer, revisiting the issue of interest payments on USD-pegged tokens would weaken the victory that the GENIUS Act gave to US dollar dominance worldwide and “hand that win to China.” Notably, the banking sector has criticized the US’s landmark stablecoin legislation over the past few months, arguing that it has loopholes that could pose risks to the financial system. The crypto framework, which was signed into law by President Trump in July, prohibits interest payments on the holding or use of payment-purpose stablecoins. Nonetheless, the prohibition only addresses issuers, meaning that it could be “easily circumvented” by exchanges or affiliates providing rewards. Earlier this year, multiple banking associations across the US sent a joint letter to the Senate Banking Committee urging Congress to amend the law. The banking groups claimed that interest payments would distort market dynamics and could affect credit creation. Therefore, they suggested extending the prohibition to include digital asset exchanges, brokers, dealers, and related entities. Shirzad, alongside multiple crypto industry players, has rejected these concerns over the past several months, stating that the banking sector’s proposals could threaten to create an uncompetitive environment for USD-denominated tokens. In October, Coinbase’s CPO slammed the financial institution’s narrative that stablecoins would destroy bank lending, concluding that it “ignores reality” and misreads the crucial moment.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CBDC|China digital yuan|CLARITY Act|coinbase|Coinbase CPO|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|Faryar Shirzad|GENIUS Act|Jake Chervinsky|Stablecoin Interest payment|Stablecoin Legislation|US stablecoins,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 04:00:17

This strategic move positions Upbit as the first major South Korean exchange to integrate a physically-backed gold cryptocurrency, providing investors with novel exposure to precious metals through blockchain technology. The listing, scheduled for 6:30 a.m. UTC, introduces XAUT trading against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and the Korean won (KRW), significantly broadening the exchange’s product portfolio during a period of increasing institutional interest in tokenized commodities. Upbit XAUT Listing Details and Market Context Upbit’s announcement specifies precise technical parameters for the XAUT integration. Trading will commence simultaneously across three distinct pairs: XAUT/BTC, XAUT/USDT, and XAUT/KRW. This multi-pair approach provides flexibility for different investor segments within South Korea’s sophisticated cryptocurrency ecosystem. The exchange confirmed that deposit and withdrawal services for XAUT will activate several hours before trading begins, ensuring proper system functionality. Market analysts immediately noted the timing significance, as the listing coincides with renewed global interest in gold as an inflation hedge amid economic uncertainties. South Korea maintains one of Asia’s most active cryptocurrency markets, with Upbit consistently ranking among the nation’s top exchanges by trading volume. The platform’s decision to list XAUT follows months of regulatory developments and market maturation. Specifically, South Korean authorities have recently clarified guidelines for asset-backed tokens, creating a more predictable environment for exchanges. Consequently, Upbit’s move represents both a business expansion and a compliance milestone, demonstrating how regulated exchanges can integrate innovative financial products while adhering to national standards. Tether Gold Fundamentals and Blockchain Architecture Tether Gold (XAUT) operates on a fundamentally different premise than purely algorithmic stablecoins or speculative cryptocurrencies. Each XAUT token represents ownership of one troy ounce of physical gold stored in professional vaults in Switzerland. Tether Limited, the issuing company, provides regular attestations from independent auditors verifying the gold reserves. This transparency mechanism addresses common concerns about asset-backed tokens, particularly regarding custody and verification. The gold backing provides intrinsic value stability rarely found in purely digital assets. The technical infrastructure supporting XAUT utilizes the Ethereum blockchain as its primary platform, employing the ERC-20 token standard. However, Tether has also implemented XAUT on other blockchains including Tron and Solana, demonstrating interoperability across ecosystems. For Upbit’s implementation, the exchange will utilize the Ethereum-based version initially, leveraging the network’s robust security and widespread wallet compatibility. This blockchain foundation enables several unique features: Direct Redemption: Qualified holders can redeem XAUT tokens for physical gold bars Transparent Audits: Monthly reserve reports from professional accounting firms Global Accessibility: 24/7 trading unlike traditional gold markets with limited hours Fractional Ownership: Investors can own portions of gold ounces through token fractions Comparative Analysis: XAUT Versus Traditional Gold Investments Financial experts frequently highlight the distinctive advantages and considerations of gold-backed cryptocurrencies compared to conventional gold investment vehicles. The table below illustrates key differences: Investment Type Storage & Custody Trading Hours Minimum Investment Geographic Access Tether Gold (XAUT) Professional Swiss vaults 24/7 cryptocurrency markets Fractional tokens possible Global with internet access Physical Gold Bars Personal or bank safety deposit Market business hours Full ounce or larger bars Physical delivery limitations Gold ETFs (e.g., GLD) Trustee bank vaults Stock exchange hours One share minimum Available in licensed jurisdictions Gold Futures Contracts Not applicable Exchange trading sessions Contract size requirements Available to qualified traders This comparison reveals XAUT’s unique positioning, particularly regarding accessibility and fractional ownership. However, experts caution that cryptocurrency volatility and regulatory considerations differ significantly from traditional markets. Upbit’s integration therefore provides South Korean investors with a previously unavailable combination of features: blockchain efficiency with physical asset backing. South Korean Regulatory Landscape and Exchange Compliance Upbit’s XAUT listing occurs within a carefully evolving regulatory framework. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) have implemented increasingly specific guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges since 2021. These regulations mandate strict anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, know-your-customer (KYC) verification, and real-name banking partnerships. Upbit, as a registered exchange with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, must demonstrate compliance with all relevant regulations before listing any new digital asset. The exchange’s decision to list XAUT followed extensive due diligence regarding the token’s compliance characteristics. Tether Gold’s structure as an asset-backed token with verifiable reserves and regulated custody arrangements likely facilitated regulatory approval. Moreover, South Korean authorities have shown particular interest in stablecoins and asset-backed tokens as potentially less speculative than purely algorithmic cryptocurrencies. This regulatory alignment creates favorable conditions for XAUT’s market entry, potentially setting precedents for similar tokens in the future. Market observers note that Upbit’s listing timing coincides with broader regulatory developments. Specifically, South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act, implemented in 2024, established clearer guidelines for exchange operations and investor protections. The act requires exchanges to maintain adequate reserve ratios, implement cold wallet storage for most assets, and provide transparent fee structures. Upbit’s established compliance with these requirements provides additional confidence for investors considering the new XAUT trading pairs. Expert Perspectives on Market Impact Financial analysts specializing in Asian cryptocurrency markets have identified several potential impacts from Upbit’s XAUT listing. First, the integration bridges traditional finance and cryptocurrency sectors more directly than previous exchange listings. Gold has served as a store of value for millennia, while cryptocurrency represents a digital revolution in asset ownership. Combining these concepts through a regulated exchange platform may attract conservative investors who previously avoided purely digital assets. Second, the listing enhances South Korea’s position in global cryptocurrency innovation. The nation already hosts advanced blockchain development and widespread cryptocurrency adoption. Adding gold-backed tokens to major exchanges demonstrates market maturity and regulatory sophistication. Consequently, other Asian markets may observe South Korea’s experience with XAUT as they consider similar integrations. Finally, the timing during early 2025 suggests strategic planning around macroeconomic conditions, as gold traditionally performs well during periods of currency uncertainty or inflation concerns. Technical Implementation and Trading Infrastructure Upbit’s technical team prepared extensively for the XAUT integration, ensuring system stability and security. The exchange utilizes a multi-layered security architecture including cold storage for most assets, multi-signature authorization protocols, and continuous network monitoring. For XAUT specifically, the exchange established direct integration with Tether’s redemption portal, enabling potential future services for qualified users. However, initial trading will focus on spot markets without derivative products, reflecting cautious implementation of new asset classes. The trading interface will display XAUT alongside other major cryptocurrencies, with real-time price charts and order book visibility. Upbit’s existing user base of approximately 8 million verified accounts can access XAUT trading through both web and mobile platforms. The exchange confirmed standard trading fees will apply initially, with potential promotional periods to encourage market liquidity. Market makers have reportedly expressed interest in providing liquidity across all three trading pairs, particularly the XAUT/KRW pair which offers direct gold exposure in South Korea’s national currency. Technical considerations extend beyond trading functionality to include wallet integration and blockchain compatibility. Upbit supports Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens through established infrastructure, minimizing implementation complexity. The exchange’s security protocols for token deposits and withdrawals follow industry best practices, including address whitelisting and withdrawal delays for enhanced protection. These technical preparations demonstrate Upbit’s systematic approach to new asset integration, prioritizing security while expanding user options. Global Context of Gold-Backed Cryptocurrency Adoption Upbit’s XAUT listing represents a significant development within broader global trends toward tokenized commodities. Multiple jurisdictions have witnessed growing interest in asset-backed digital tokens, particularly those representing precious metals, real estate, or other tangible assets. This movement reflects increasing recognition of blockchain technology’s potential to enhance traditional asset markets through improved transparency, fractional ownership, and trading efficiency. Internationally, several exchanges already list XAUT and similar gold-backed tokens. However, Upbit’s implementation marks a milestone for several reasons. South Korea represents one of Asia’s largest and most technologically advanced cryptocurrency markets. The nation’s regulatory framework has matured significantly in recent years, providing clearer guidelines than many other jurisdictions. Additionally, South Korean investors have demonstrated particular interest in innovative financial products, making the market receptive to gold-backed cryptocurrency options. Comparative analysis reveals that gold-backed tokens have gained traction primarily in markets with established cryptocurrency infrastructure and regulatory clarity. Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates have all seen growing adoption of similar products. Upbit’s move may therefore signal broader Asian adoption, potentially influencing exchanges in Japan, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. The listing’s success could accelerate regional integration of tokenized commodities, creating more diversified cryptocurrency ecosystems beyond purely speculative assets. Conclusion Upbit’s XAUT listing represents a strategic expansion of South Korea’s cryptocurrency marketplace, integrating gold-backed digital assets through a regulated exchange platform. The January 1, 2025 implementation provides investors with novel exposure to precious metals through blockchain technology, offering trading pairs against Bitcoin, Tether, and the Korean won. This development bridges traditional finance and digital assets, potentially attracting conservative investors while demonstrating regulatory maturity. As global interest in tokenized commodities grows, Upbit’s systematic approach to XAUT integration may establish important precedents for asset-backed cryptocurrency adoption across Asian markets. The listing’s success will depend on market reception, liquidity development, and ongoing regulatory compliance, but undoubtedly marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency evolution. FAQs Q1: What is Tether Gold (XAUT) and how does it differ from regular Tether (USDT)? Tether Gold (XAUT) is a cryptocurrency token where each unit represents ownership of one troy ounce of physical gold stored in Swiss vaults. Unlike regular Tether (USDT), which is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, XAUT derives its value directly from physical gold reserves. Holders can potentially redeem tokens for actual gold bars, subject to minimum quantities and verification procedures. Q2: When exactly will XAUT trading begin on Upbit? Upbit has announced that XAUT trading will commence at 6:30 a.m. UTC on January 1, 2025. The exchange will open three trading pairs simultaneously: XAUT/BTC, XAUT/USDT, and XAUT/KRW. Deposit and withdrawal services for XAUT will activate several hours before trading begins to ensure proper system functionality. Q3: What are the advantages of investing in XAUT compared to physical gold or gold ETFs? XAUT offers several distinct advantages including 24/7 trading accessibility, fractional ownership capabilities, and blockchain-based transfer efficiency. Unlike physical gold, XAUT eliminates storage concerns and enables global transfers. Compared to gold ETFs, XAUT provides direct ownership claims rather than shares in a trust, though both involve third-party custody arrangements. Q4: How does Upbit ensure the security of XAUT tokens on its platform? Upbit employs a multi-layered security architecture including cold storage for most assets, multi-signature authorization protocols, and continuous network monitoring. For XAUT specifically, the exchange utilizes established Ethereum wallet infrastructure with additional verification procedures. Upbit’s security measures comply with South Korean regulatory requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. Q5: Are there any regulatory considerations for South Korean investors trading XAUT? Yes, XAUT trading on Upbit falls under South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act and related regulations. Investors must complete know-your-customer (KYC) verification and use real-name bank accounts for KRW deposits and withdrawals. Tax implications for cryptocurrency investments apply, though specific treatment of gold-backed tokens may require clarification from tax authorities.

According to Schiff’s calculations, this approach suffered a 47.5% decline in 2025, positioning it as the sixth-worst performer within the prestigious index. This revelation directly challenges MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s long-standing advocacy for Bitcoin as the ultimate corporate treasury asset. Bitcoin Strategy’s Troubling S&P 500 Performance Metrics Peter Schiff’s analysis provides specific performance metrics that place the Bitcoin strategy in concerning context. The 47.5% decline significantly underperforms the broader S&P 500 index, which has maintained relative stability through 2025’s economic conditions. Furthermore, this performance would rank only behind five other companies within the entire 500-company index for worst annual returns. Schiff’s critique centers on shareholder value destruction resulting from this approach. He argues that corporate resources allocated to Bitcoin acquisitions could have generated superior returns through traditional investments or operational improvements. The analysis comes during a period of increased regulatory scrutiny toward cryptocurrency holdings on corporate balance sheets. The MicroStrategy Case Study: A Corporate Bitcoin Pioneer MicroStrategy Incorporated, under Michael Saylor’s leadership, pioneered the corporate Bitcoin acquisition strategy beginning in August 2020. The business intelligence company has accumulated approximately 226,331 Bitcoin as of early 2025, representing one of the largest corporate cryptocurrency holdings globally. Saylor has consistently framed this strategy as a superior alternative to holding cash reserves or traditional investments. However, Schiff’s analysis highlights the volatility inherent in this approach. While MicroStrategy experienced substantial gains during Bitcoin’s bull markets, the 2025 decline demonstrates significant downside risk. The company’s stock price has historically correlated closely with Bitcoin’s price movements, creating amplified volatility compared to traditional technology companies. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin Strategy Versus Traditional Corporate Approaches A comparative examination reveals stark differences between Bitcoin-focused corporate strategies and traditional approaches. Traditional corporate treasury management typically emphasizes capital preservation, liquidity, and moderate returns through diversified instruments including: Short-term government securities providing stability and liquidity Investment-grade corporate bonds offering predictable returns Money market funds maintaining principal protection Operational reinvestment driving core business growth Conversely, the Bitcoin strategy represents a concentrated, high-volatility position that behaves more like a speculative investment than traditional treasury management. This approach exposes shareholders to cryptocurrency market risks beyond typical corporate operational concerns. 2025 Performance Comparison: Bitcoin Strategy vs. S&P 500 Segments Investment Approach 2025 Performance Volatility Level Bitcoin Corporate Strategy -47.5% Extreme S&P 500 Technology Sector +8.2% High S&P 500 Financial Sector +5.7% Moderate S&P 500 Utilities Sector +3.1% Low S&P 500 Index Overall +4.8% Moderate Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Volatility in Corporate Finance The debate surrounding corporate Bitcoin adoption extends beyond recent performance metrics. Since MicroStrategy’s initial acquisition, numerous companies have explored cryptocurrency treasury allocations with varying approaches. Notably, Tesla briefly added Bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2021 before selling approximately 75% of its position in 2022. Financial analysts have consistently highlighted several concerns regarding corporate Bitcoin strategies: Accounting treatment challenges under existing standards Regulatory uncertainty across multiple jurisdictions Environmental considerations related to proof-of-work mining Concentration risk from undiversified holdings These factors contribute to the ongoing debate about appropriate corporate exposure to cryptocurrency assets. Meanwhile, traditional gold investments, which Schiff advocates, have demonstrated relative stability during 2025’s market conditions. Shareholder Value Considerations in Volatile Markets The fundamental disagreement between Schiff and Saylor centers on shareholder value creation versus destruction. Saylor argues that Bitcoin represents a superior store of value that protects against currency debasement and inflation. Conversely, Schiff maintains that corporate resources should prioritize operational excellence and traditional value preservation. This philosophical divide reflects broader tensions within corporate governance regarding innovative versus conservative financial strategies. Institutional investors have expressed mixed reactions, with some applauding forward-thinking approaches while others emphasize fiduciary responsibility and risk management. Regulatory Landscape and Future Implications The regulatory environment for corporate cryptocurrency holdings continues evolving through 2025. Accounting standards boards globally are developing clearer guidelines for digital asset valuation and reporting. Simultaneously, securities regulators are examining disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies with significant cryptocurrency exposure. These developments could significantly impact the viability of corporate Bitcoin strategies moving forward. Enhanced disclosure requirements might increase transparency but could also highlight volatility concerns for risk-averse investors. Additionally, potential tax implications and regulatory changes create uncertainty for long-term holding strategies. Corporate governance experts emphasize the importance of board oversight and risk committee involvement in cryptocurrency investment decisions. They recommend comprehensive scenario analysis, stress testing, and clear communication with shareholders regarding strategy rationale and risk parameters. Conclusion Peter Schiff’s analysis of Bitcoin strategy performance within an S&P 500 context highlights significant concerns about corporate cryptocurrency adoption. The 47.5% decline in 2025, ranking as the sixth-worst performance in the index, challenges Michael Saylor’s advocacy for Bitcoin as the ultimate corporate treasury asset. This Bitcoin strategy evaluation comes amid evolving regulatory frameworks and ongoing debates about appropriate corporate risk exposure. The fundamental tension between innovative financial approaches and traditional shareholder value preservation continues shaping corporate treasury management decisions globally. FAQs Q1: What specific performance metric did Peter Schiff cite regarding Bitcoin strategy? Peter Schiff cited a 47.5% decline in 2025 that would rank a Bitcoin acquisition strategy as the sixth-worst performer if included in the S&P 500 index. Q2: How does Michael Saylor justify corporate Bitcoin acquisitions? Michael Saylor argues Bitcoin represents a superior store of value that protects against currency debasement and inflation, making it better than holding cash or traditional investments. Q3: What are the main criticisms of corporate Bitcoin strategies? Primary criticisms include extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainty, accounting challenges, environmental concerns, and concentration risk compared to diversified traditional approaches. Q4: How have other companies approached corporate cryptocurrency holdings? Approaches vary significantly, with Tesla briefly holding Bitcoin before selling most positions, while other companies have implemented smaller, more diversified cryptocurrency allocations. Q5: What regulatory developments could impact corporate Bitcoin strategies? Evolving accounting standards, enhanced disclosure requirements, securities regulations, and potential tax changes could all significantly impact the viability of corporate Bitcoin strategies.

This significant withdrawal of capital abruptly ended a brief period of net inflows, highlighting the persistent volatility and sensitivity of cryptocurrency markets to broader financial currents. The movement provides a critical data point for analysts tracking the maturation and stability of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class. Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown of the December 31 Exodus The data reveals a broad-based retreat from major fund providers. Leading the outflows was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $99.30 million exit the fund. This was closely followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB at $76.53 million and the converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at $69.09 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also experienced notable outflows of $66.58 million. Several other funds contributed to the total, including Bitwise’s BITB ($13.76M), the newer Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ($11.24M), VanEck’s HODL ($6.79M), and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($5.05M). This collective action suggests a sector-wide shift in sentiment rather than an issue isolated to a single fund. To provide immediate clarity, the following table summarizes the key outflow figures from the major funds involved: ETF Ticker Fund Provider Net Outflow (Dec. 31) IBIT BlackRock $99.30 Million ARKB Ark Invest $76.53 Million GBTC Grayscale $69.09 Million FBTC Fidelity $66.58 Million BITB Bitwise $13.76 Million Market analysts often scrutinize such flow data for several reasons. Firstly, it serves as a direct gauge of institutional and retail investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. Secondly, consistent outflows can pressure the underlying Bitcoin price, as authorized participants may sell Bitcoin holdings to meet redemption requests. Consequently, this single day’s activity warrants examination within the context of year-end portfolio rebalancing and broader macroeconomic conditions. Contextualizing the Shift in Cryptocurrency Investment Trends The reported outflows did not occur in a vacuum. They directly reversed the net inflows recorded just one day prior, demonstrating the rapid sentiment shifts characteristic of digital asset markets. Several concurrent factors likely influenced this capital movement. Primarily, the final trading day of the calendar year often sees significant portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and profit-taking as investors lock in positions before the new fiscal period begins. Digital assets, known for their volatility, frequently experience amplified effects from these seasonal financial behaviors. Furthermore, the broader macroeconomic landscape in late December provided a complex backdrop. Traders were assessing the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory, inflation data, and global economic indicators. Typically, such uncertainty prompts a flight to stability, potentially disadvantaging perceived risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, the performance of the spot Bitcoin ETF sector since its landmark SEC approval in January 2024 has been a story of explosive growth followed by periods of consolidation. This outflow event may represent a natural cooling-off phase after a year of intense accumulation by some funds. Expert Analysis on Fund Flows and Market Structure Financial researchers emphasize that daily flow data, while insightful, represents just one metric in a complex ecosystem. The long-term viability of spot Bitcoin ETFs depends on sustained adoption, liquidity, and their integration into diversified portfolios. The participation of traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity inherently brings a new level of scrutiny and a different investor base—one potentially more sensitive to short-term performance and regulatory headlines than long-term crypto natives. Historical data from other asset classes shows that new ETF products frequently experience volatility in their flow patterns during early adoption phases. The key metric for analysts is the cumulative net flow over extended periods, such as quarters or full years, rather than isolated daily figures. Nevertheless, large single-day outflows from multiple major providers simultaneously signal a coordinated shift in short-term risk assessment among a segment of the investor base. This could be linked to profit-taking after a quarterly rally or positioning ahead of anticipated market-moving events in early 2025. Potential Impacts and Forward-Looking Implications for Digital Assets The immediate impact of substantial ETF outflows is multifaceted. On the technical side, it creates sell pressure on the underlying Bitcoin held by these funds. Authorized Participants (APs) facilitating the redemptions must sell Bitcoin on the open market to raise cash, potentially contributing to downward price momentum. However, the mature and deep liquidity of the Bitcoin market often absorbs such flows with muted price impact, especially when compared to the market capitalization of Bitcoin itself. For the ETF ecosystem, persistent outflows could influence competitive dynamics. Funds with lower fee structures or stronger brand loyalty among crypto investors might demonstrate more resilience. The flow data also informs regulatory perspectives. Policymakers monitor these products for signs of investor protection risks or market instability. A pattern of extreme volatility in fund flows could become a point of discussion in future regulatory reviews, even as the products themselves function precisely as designed—providing transparent, daily liquidity. Looking ahead, market participants will monitor several indicators: Flow Reversal: Whether inflows resume in early January, suggesting the outflows were a year-end anomaly. Price Correlation: The strength of the correlation between ETF flow data and Bitcoin’s spot price. Competitive Shifts: If capital begins rotating between different spot Bitcoin ETFs based on fees or strategy. Macro Sensitivity: How clearly these funds act as a barometer for broader risk appetite in equity and bond markets. Conclusion The $348.34 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 31 serves as a potent reminder of the evolving and sometimes unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. While a single day’s data does not define a trend, it underscores the importance of context, including tax considerations, macroeconomic signals, and the natural ebb and flow of capital in regulated markets. For investors, these Bitcoin ETF outflows highlight the necessity of a long-term perspective and an understanding of the structural factors influencing short-term capital movements. As the asset class matures, the transparency provided by daily flow reporting will remain a crucial tool for assessing market health and investor sentiment. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed from an ETF exceeds the value of new shares created. This means more investors are selling their ETF shares than buying, leading the fund’s manager to sell some of the underlying Bitcoin to return cash to those exiting investors. Q2: Could these outflows cause the price of Bitcoin to drop? They can contribute to downward pressure. Authorized Participants selling Bitcoin to fulfill redemption requests adds sell orders to the market. However, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by many factors globally, so ETF flows are one component among many, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and broader market sentiment. Q3: Is it unusual for new ETFs to experience volatile flows? No, it is relatively common. New investment products, especially in a novel asset class like cryptocurrency, often see periods of heavy inflows followed by consolidation or outflows as early investors take profits and the market seeks a stable level of adoption. Analysts look at longer-term cumulative flows for a clearer picture. Q4: Why might investors choose to sell a spot Bitcoin ETF at year-end? Common reasons include tax-loss harvesting (selling at a loss to offset capital gains taxes), portfolio rebalancing to maintain target asset allocations, and profit-taking to lock in gains before closing the financial year’s books. Q5: How does Grayscale’s GBTC outflow compare to the newer ETFs? Grayscale’s GBTC, which converted from a closed-end trust to an ETF, has a unique history. It often shows different flow patterns due to its previously large discount to net asset value and its higher fee structure compared to newer competitors. Its outflows may represent a continued rotation into lower-fee alternatives, as well as general market sentiment.

According to definitive data from analytics firm TraderT, these funds collectively experienced net outflows totaling $72.11 million. This pivot occurred merely one day after the products posted net inflows, highlighting the volatile and sentiment-driven nature of early-stage crypto investment vehicles. The data provides a crucial, real-time snapshot of institutional and retail investor behavior following the landmark regulatory approval of these funds. Breaking Down the $72.1M Ethereum ETF Outflow TraderT’s granular data reveals the specific contributions from each major fund issuer. The outflows were not isolated to a single provider but represented a broad-based shift. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETHE) led the movement with a substantial withdrawal of $31.98 million. Furthermore, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) saw outflows of $21.56 million. VanEck’s Ethereum ETF (ETHV) followed with $14.1 million exiting the fund. Smaller but notable outflows also came from Franklin Templeton’s Ethereum ETF (EZET) at $2.25 million and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) at $2.22 million. This distribution indicates a market-wide reaction rather than a loss of confidence in a specific issuer. The collective movement underscores how macroeconomic factors or Ethereum-specific news can trigger simultaneous responses across competing financial products. Contextualizing the Sudden Shift in ETF Flows The reversal from inflows to outflows demands analysis within a broader market framework. Spot Ethereum ETFs only began trading in the United States in mid-2024, following a protracted regulatory process. Consequently, their flow data remains a primary indicator of direct, regulated investor exposure to Ether’s price. Daily flow volatility is common for new asset classes, yet the magnitude of this shift is noteworthy. Several contextual factors may have influenced investor decisions on July 31. First, broader cryptocurrency market sentiment often dictates ETF activity. A slight downturn in Bitcoin’s price or negative regulatory headlines can cause ripple effects. Second, profit-taking after a period of inflows is a standard market mechanism. Investors may have captured gains following Ethereum’s price appreciation after the ETF launch. Finally, competing yield opportunities in traditional finance, like rising bond rates, can temporarily draw capital away from perceived riskier assets like crypto. Expert Perspective on Flow Volatility Market analysts emphasize that daily flow data, while insightful, represents just one piece of a larger puzzle. “For any new ETF, especially in the digital asset space, we expect periods of consolidation after initial enthusiasm,” notes a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. The report suggests that flow volatility should normalize as the market matures and assets under management (AUM) grow. The true test for these products will be their sustained AUM growth over quarterly and annual horizons, not daily fluctuations. Historical data from the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024, provides a relevant comparison. Those funds also experienced significant daily flow volatility in their first months, including multi-day outflow streaks, before stabilizing and reaching record cumulative inflows. This pattern suggests the Ethereum ETF market may simply be following a similar maturation trajectory, with early investors adjusting their positions. Impact and Implications for the Digital Asset Market The immediate impact of $72.1 million leaving Ethereum ETFs is multifaceted. On a direct level, ETF issuers must manage the liquidity to facilitate these redemptions, typically by selling a corresponding amount of the underlying Ether held in custody. This activity can create slight selling pressure on the spot market, although the amount is relatively small compared to Ethereum’s total daily trading volume, which often exceeds $10 billion. More significantly, the flow data serves as a transparent gauge of institutional appetite. Persistent outflows could signal cooling interest or concern about near-term price prospects. Conversely, a quick return to inflows would indicate strong underlying demand. Regulators and traditional finance observers closely monitor this data to assess the real-world demand for crypto-based financial products beyond speculative trading. The Role of Data Providers Like TraderT The availability of timely, accurate flow data is itself a sign of market maturation. Firms like TraderT compile information from public filings and direct sources, providing transparency that was previously lacking in crypto markets. This data empowers all market participants—from retail investors to large institutions—to make more informed decisions. It also holds ETF issuers accountable for their performance and operational efficiency, fostering a more competitive and investor-friendly landscape. Conclusion The reported $72.1 million in net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on July 31 marks a notable, though not unprecedented, moment in the evolution of crypto-based exchange-traded funds. This event highlights the inherent volatility and sensitivity of these new investment vehicles to broader market sentiment. While daily movements capture headlines, the long-term viability of Ethereum ETFs will depend on sustained adoption, regulatory clarity, and Ethereum’s underlying utility development. Investors should view such flow data as one critical metric among many, considering it within the wider context of portfolio strategy and market cycles. FAQs Q1: What does “net outflow” mean for an Ethereum ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the total value of shares redeemed (sold) by investors exceeds the total value of shares purchased (created) on a given day. It means more money left the fund than entered it. Q2: Are these outflows a sign that Ethereum ETFs are failing? A2: Not necessarily. Daily or weekly flow volatility is common, especially for new ETFs. Analysts consider long-term trends in Assets Under Management (AUM) more significant than single-day movements for assessing overall success. Q3: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A3: To meet redemption requests, authorized participants may need to sell some of the underlying ETH held by the fund. This can create minor selling pressure on the spot market, but the effect is typically minimal compared to the total global trading volume of ETH. Q4: Which Ethereum ETF had the largest outflow on July 31? A4: According to TraderT data, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETHE) experienced the largest single outflow at $31.98 million. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on ETF flows? A5: Data is compiled by specialized analytics firms like TraderT, Bloomberg, and ETF.com. Many financial news platforms and the fund issuers themselves also report flow figures, though often with a one-day lag.

The network deployed a record 8.7 million smart contracts in a single quarter, according to a Token Terminal chart shared by Ethereum analyst Joseph Young. The figure is an all-time high and breaks the previous quarterly record of around 6 million contracts set in the second quarter of 2021. Developer Revival In his latest post on X, Young said that steady growth in contract deployments across multiple quarters is difficult to artificially inflate, which essentially means that the current trend reflects genuine, organic demand rather than short-term speculation. He attributed the surge mainly to the rapid expansion of rollups and Layer 2 networks, alongside rising activity in real-world asset (RWA) issuance, stablecoins, and wallet infrastructure, including intent-based systems. The data is particularly important given Ethereum’s recent history. Contract deployments had been trending sharply lower through 2024 and much of 2025. In 2024, quarterly deployments struggled to exceed 1.5 million, while the final quarter of that year saw just over 528,000 new contracts, the latter being the weakest level since 2017. Even in 2025, deployments fell from nearly 6 million in the first quarter to 3.1 million by the third quarter. Against this backdrop, the current spike is a clear reversal, which brings total lifetime contracts deployed on Ethereum to roughly 91.7 million. Renewed Momentum As a broader sign of renewed network momentum, Ethereum has also seen a rise in on-chain usage alongside falling costs. Data compiled by Etherscan revealed that the mainnet recently processed approximately 2.2 million transactions in a single day, which is yet another new record, while average transaction fees have dropped to around $0.17. This contrasts sharply with May 2022, when fees regularly exceeded $200 per transaction. Protocol upgrades in 2025, including Pectra and Fusaka, have improved validator efficiency and increased the gas limit, and have helped Ethereum handle higher activity at lower cost. Additionally, CryptoQuant found that total transfer counts climbed to around 1.06 million on December 29, a level not seen since October 2023. The metric became increasingly volatile in the final quarter of 2025 and broke away from the relatively stable activity seen earlier in the year. The rise in transfers has come even as ETH’s price remained below its yearly highs.

This pivotal listing bridges the established world of physical gold with South Korea’s dynamic crypto economy, offering investors a regulated, asset-backed digital alternative. Consequently, the integration provides a novel hedge against market volatility within a familiar trading environment. Bithumb’s Tether Gold Listing Expands Digital Asset Horizons Bithumb’s decision to list Tether Gold represents a calculated expansion of its trading portfolio. The exchange, one of South Korea’s largest and most regulated platforms, now provides direct KRW access to a tokenized gold product. Each XAUT token is physically backed by one fine troy ounce of gold stored in a Swiss vault. Therefore, this listing directly responds to growing investor demand for stable, tangible assets within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Market analysts view this as a strategic play to attract both traditional gold investors and crypto natives seeking asset diversification. Furthermore, the timing aligns with global economic trends. Central banks worldwide have been increasing their gold reserves. Simultaneously, cryptocurrency markets have matured, seeking legitimacy through asset-backed tokens. Bithumb’s move positions it at the intersection of these two powerful financial currents. The exchange facilitates easier entry for South Korean investors into the digital gold market without the complexities of international bullion storage or custody. Understanding Tether Gold and Its Market Impact Tether Gold (XAUT) operates as a digital representation of physical gold ownership. Tether International Ltd. issues the ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Crucially, each token corresponds to one troy ounce of gold on a London Good Delivery bar. The company publishes regular attestations from third-party auditors to verify the reserves. This transparency model has become a cornerstone for asset-backed stablecoins and tokens. The listing’s immediate impact includes several key developments: Enhanced Portfolio Options: South Korean traders can now diversify with a non-correlated asset directly from their Bithumb KRW wallets. Regulatory Alignment: Listing a fully reserved, audited asset supports South Korea’s strict financial regulatory framework for virtual assets. Market Accessibility: It lowers the barrier to gold investment, removing minimum purchase amounts and storage fees associated with physical bullion. For comparison, here is how XAUT contrasts with other gold exposure methods available in South Korea: Method Accessibility Custody Liquidity Physical Gold Bars/Coins Low (requires specialist dealer) Personal/Bank Vault Low Gold ETFs (e.g., on KOSPI) High (stock brokerage account) Central Securities Depository High (Market Hours) Tether Gold (XAUT) on Bithumb High (crypto exchange account) Swiss Vault + Blockchain High (24/7) Expert Analysis on the South Korean Crypto Landscape Industry experts point to this listing as part of a broader trend. “South Korea’s crypto market is maturing beyond pure speculation,” notes Dr. Min-ji Park, a fintech researcher at Seoul National University. “Investors are actively seeking assets with intrinsic value and lower volatility. The listing of a product like XAUT on a major domestic exchange is a logical step. It provides a familiar, compliant on-ramp for a store-of-value asset.” This perspective is supported by trading volume data from 2024, which showed increasing Korean investor interest in commodity-backed tokens on international platforms. Moreover, Bithumb’s compliance history plays a crucial role. The exchange has successfully navigated South Korea’s rigorous regulatory environment, implementing real-name verification and partnering with domestic banks. Listing an audited, asset-backed token like XAUT further strengthens its reputation as a trustworthy platform. This action builds authoritativeness and trustworthiness with both users and regulators. The Strategic Rationale Behind the XAUT Integration Bithumb’s listing strategy involves careful market analysis. South Korean investors have historically shown a strong affinity for gold as a safe-haven asset. However, the traditional purchase and storage process involves friction. By integrating XAUT, Bithumb digitizes this centuries-old investment. Users can buy, sell, or hold fractional ounces of gold instantly. The blockchain settlement provides a transparent and immutable record of ownership. Operationally, the exchange has prepared its infrastructure for the new asset pair. This preparation includes ensuring sufficient liquidity, updating trading engine protocols, and briefing customer support teams. The goal is a seamless user experience that mirrors trading any other major cryptocurrency on the platform. Additionally, Bithumb likely conducted extensive legal reviews to ensure the listing meets all guidelines from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) regarding virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Potential Implications for the Broader Crypto Economy This single listing carries wider implications for the cryptocurrency sector. First, it validates the model of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Success in a market as significant as South Korea could encourage other global exchanges to follow suit. Second, it demonstrates a pathway for crypto exchanges to offer products that appeal to conservative capital. This appeal is essential for the next phase of institutional adoption. Finally, it introduces a new dynamic for the Korean won trading pairs. Typically dominated by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the KRW market now includes a major commodity token. This inclusion could stabilize trading volumes during periods of extreme volatility in purely digital assets. It provides a built-off ramp within the crypto ecosystem that is still tied to a globally recognized value benchmark. Conclusion Bithumb’s listing of Tether Gold (XAUT) for KRW trading marks a definitive step in the evolution of South Korea’s digital asset marketplace. The move strategically combines the timeless value of gold with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It offers investors a compliant, accessible, and liquid method to gain gold exposure. Ultimately, this development underscores the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency exchanges as they bridge traditional finance with digital innovation. The successful integration of XAUT could set a precedent for future asset-backed token listings globally. FAQs Q1: What is Tether Gold (XAUT) and how is it backed? A1: Tether Gold (XAUT) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token. Each XAUT token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of physical gold. This gold is stored in a professional vault in Switzerland. Tether publishes regular proof-of-reserve reports from independent auditors to verify the backing. Q2: Why is Bithumb’s listing of XAUT significant for South Korean investors? A2: The listing is significant because it provides direct, 24/7 access to a digital gold asset using the South Korean won. It simplifies the investment process, removes physical storage concerns, and allows for fractional ownership. This makes gold investment more accessible within a regulated domestic exchange environment. Q3: How does trading XAUT on Bithumb differ from buying a gold ETF on the Korean stock exchange? A3: The key differences are trading hours and custody. XAUT trades 24/7 on Bithumb, while ETFs trade during stock market hours. Furthermore, XAUT ownership is recorded on the blockchain and represents a direct claim on specific vaulted gold. An ETF represents a share in a fund that holds gold, with custody managed by financial institutions. Q4: What are the risks associated with investing in Tether Gold? A4: Primary risks include counterparty risk related to the custodian holding the gold, smart contract risk on the Ethereum blockchain, and the regulatory risk inherent to digital assets. Although the gold is audited, investors must trust the custodian and issuer. The token’s price will also correlate with the global spot price of gold, introducing market risk. Q5: Does this listing indicate a trend for other cryptocurrency exchanges? A5: Yes, the listing of real-world asset (RWA) tokens like XAUT is a growing trend globally.
