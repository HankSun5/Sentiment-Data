In a press release, the company said it intends to issue the token to shareholders of its publicly traded stock, DJT, in partnership with Crypto.com. The distribution will be carried out using Crypto.com’s infrastructure, with the token expected to run on the Cronos blockchain, which is designed to support high transaction throughput and interoperability across networks. Trump Media said Airdrop Token does not equal ownership According to the announcement, each ultimate beneficial owner of DJT shares would be eligible to receive one digital token for every whole share they own, beginning at a record date that will be set in the future. Trump Media said token holders may periodically receive rewards throughout the year, which could include benefits or discounts tied to its products, including Truth Social , the Truth+ streaming platform, and its prediction market product, Truth Predict . Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced a new partnership with https://t.co/U4D4dECttR that will bring prediction markets to the social media platform, positioning it as the first publicly traded social media com… https://t.co/A8spbfSGB9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 28, 2025 The company emphasized that the token is not intended to function as equity or a financial security. Trump Media said the digital asset will not represent ownership in the company or any other entity, and that holders should not expect rewards tied to profits generated through managerial efforts. The token may also be non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash, according to the disclosure. Trump Media chief executive and chairman Devin Nunes said the company sees the token as a way to reward shareholders while operating within what it described as improving regulatory clarity. He added that the company plans to rely on Crypto.com’s blockchain technology to implement the distribution. Trump Media said further details about how and when the token will be issued are expected to be released in the new year. Source: Google Finance The announcement comes as Trump Media’s stock showed renewed activity, as the shares of DJT were recently trading at about $13.30, up roughly 5.85% on the day, reflecting investor attention following the token disclosure. As Revenue Plateaus, Trump Media Leans Deeper Into Digital Assets Financially, the company continues to report modest revenue alongside sizable losses. In the trailing twelve months of 2025, Trump Media reported revenue of $3.67 million, a slight increase of about 1.6% from 2024, when revenue totaled $3.61 million. Source: CompaniesMarketCap That figure, however, remains below the $4.13 million reported in 2023, the strongest year in the past three-year period. The data shows that revenue growth has largely stalled, with the company struggling to meaningfully expand its income base. The token distribution fits into a broader pattern of crypto-related initiatives from Trump Media over the past year. In April, the company disclosed that it was exploring the launch of a utility token and a digital wallet as part of an expansion of Truth+, initially positioning the token as a way to pay for streaming subscriptions before potentially extending its use across other services. @realDonaldTrump Media has formally outlined its intention to launch a Truth-branded utility token and digital wallet, according to a filing with SEC. #Trump #Memecoin https://t.co/ZlWwP1Lyl3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 4, 2025 Trump Media has also expanded into financial products through its Truth.Fi brand. In January, the company announced plans to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets and to work with Crypto.com on launching crypto-focused exchange-traded funds. @realDonaldTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has made a $300 million investment in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities. #Trump #Bitcoin https://t.co/9p7fbJQNQW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 28, 2025 In July, Trump Media revealed it had invested $300 million in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities, seeking exposure to crypto price movements without directly holding the asset. By November, the company’s growing exposure to digital assets had also brought new risks into focus. Trump Media reported a quarterly loss of $54.8 million after Bitcoin prices declined, pushing earlier crypto purchases underwater and contributing to continued earnings pressure.

This transaction, valued at approximately $348 million, represents one of the most substantial stablecoin movements observed in recent months. Consequently, it raises important questions about institutional liquidity management, market preparation, and the underlying mechanics of major cryptocurrency exchanges. This analysis delves into the factual context, potential implications, and expert perspectives surrounding this notable blockchain activity. Decoding the $348 Million USDC Transfer The transaction, broadcast to the Ethereum blockchain, involved the precise movement of 348 million USD Coin (USDC) tokens. Whale Alert, a prominent service monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions, publicly flagged the transfer. Significantly, the movement occurred between two addresses associated with Coinbase, the leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. Specifically, the funds originated from a wallet labeled “Coinbase Institutional” and were sent to a primary “Coinbase” hot wallet. This internal movement highlights the complex treasury operations of a major exchange. Furthermore, such transfers are routine for managing liquidity between different business segments, including custodial services for large clients and the trading pool for retail customers. The Mechanics of Exchange Liquidity Management Exchanges like Coinbase manage billions in digital assets across multiple wallets for security and efficiency. Typically, they use a combination of cold storage (offline) for long-term holdings and hot wallets (online) for daily transactions. A transfer from an institutional custody wallet to a main exchange hot wallet often signals a need to bolster available liquidity for anticipated trading volume. For instance, this could prepare for large client withdrawals, facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) trades, or rebalance reserves after significant institutional deposits. Therefore, while the sum is eye-catching, the action itself is a standard operational procedure for a financial entity of Coinbase’s scale. Contextualizing Major Stablecoin Movements Stablecoins like USDC play a critical role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They act as a digital dollar equivalent, providing a stable store of value and a medium for trading between volatile assets. Major movements of USDC or its main competitor, Tether (USDT), are closely watched as potential indicators of market sentiment. However, analysts consistently warn against over-interpreting single transactions. A transfer between internal wallets of the same company, especially, may reflect internal accounting rather than a market signal. Meanwhile, external transfers to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or other exchanges can more clearly suggest upcoming trading strategies or capital deployment. USDC vs. USDT: USDC, issued by Circle, is known for its full reserve transparency and regular attestations, making it a preferred stablecoin for regulated institutions. Whale Watching: Services like Whale Alert track transactions exceeding certain thresholds, providing transparency but often lacking context. Liquidity Pools: Exchanges must maintain deep liquidity pools to ensure smooth trading and timely withdrawals for all users. Expert Analysis on Institutional Behavior Market analysts and blockchain forensics firms emphasize the importance of pattern recognition over isolated events. According to common analytical frameworks, a single large transfer is less informative than a trend. For example, a sustained series of deposits from institutional wallets to exchange hot wallets could suggest institutions are preparing to sell assets or convert holdings into fiat. Conversely, consistent withdrawals from exchanges to cold storage might indicate a long-term holding strategy. In this specific case, the intra-company nature of the transfer strongly points to routine treasury rebalancing. Seasoned observers note that such movements are a fundamental aspect of healthy, high-volume exchange operations and contribute to overall market stability by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available where needed. Potential Impacts and Market Implications The immediate market impact of this transfer was negligible, as it did not represent a net new buy or sell pressure on other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The USDC supply remained constant, merely changing its custodial address. However, understanding these flows is crucial for a complete market picture. Large inflows to exchange wallets can precede increased trading activity, as assets are positioned for easier access. Subsequently, monitoring follow-on actions is key. If the USDC in the Coinbase hot wallet is rapidly converted into other assets or used for large OTC purchases, it could signal underlying institutional demand. Alternatively, if it remains static, it likely serves as a liquidity buffer. Recent Notable Stablecoin Transfers (Comparative Context) Date Amount Stablecoin From To Likely Purpose Recent $348M USDC Coinbase Institutional Coinbase Internal Liquidity Management Q4 2024 $500M USDT Unknown Whale Binance Potential Trading Capital Q3 2024 $200M USDC Circle Treasury Minting Authority Supply Adjustment Conclusion The reported transfer of 348 million USDC from Coinbase Institutional to Coinbase is a substantial but standard operational event within the digital asset infrastructure. It underscores the immense scale of capital managed by leading cryptocurrency exchanges and the continuous internal processes required to maintain market functionality. While Whale Alert provides valuable transparency for such large transactions, accurate interpretation requires context, pattern analysis, and an understanding of exchange mechanics. This USDC transfer primarily reflects sophisticated internal treasury management rather than a direct signal of impending market movement. Ultimately, it highlights the growing maturity and institutional-grade operations within the cryptocurrency sector. FAQs Q1: What does a transfer from Coinbase Institutional to Coinbase mean? This typically indicates an internal rebalancing of funds, moving stablecoins from a custody wallet holding institutional client assets to the exchange’s main hot wallet to bolster available liquidity for trading, withdrawals, or OTC desk operations. Q2: Does a large USDC transfer like this affect the crypto market price? Usually not directly, as it is an internal movement that does not create new buy or sell orders for other cryptocurrencies. The impact is indirect, relating to changes in exchange liquidity that may facilitate future large trades. Q3: Why is USDC commonly used for such large transfers? USDC is a fully regulated and transparent stablecoin, regularly audited and attested. Consequently, institutions and exchanges favor it for large transactions due to its regulatory compliance and perceived lower counterparty risk compared to other stablecoins. Q4: How can I track transactions like this myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for the Ethereum network, entering a wallet address to see its history. Additionally, alert services like Whale Monitor aggregate and notify users of large transactions above a set threshold. Q5: Should I be concerned about such a large movement? Generally, no. For a regulated entity like Coinbase, these are normal treasury operations. Concern would be more warranted for unexplained movements from anonymous wallets to exchanges, which might indicate selling pressure.

In a recent release , the asset manager’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, stated that “we view XRPL’s native token, XRP, as a foundational building block for cross-border transaction efficiency.” The executive added that as a payments-first blockchain, the XRP Ledger enables real-time, low-cost settlement for institutions looking to facilitate large-scale transactions across different continents. XRP is seen as a foundational building block by Franklin Templeton https://t.co/qVVwPOtDUM — LJ (@luke_judges) December 31, 2025 Franklin Templeton’s Growing Integration With XRP Ecosystem This is not the first time Franklin Templeton has acknowledged the role XRP plays as a blockchain rail for traditional finance. In September, Singapore’s DBS Bank signed an MOU with Franklin Templeton and Ripple to list tokenized money market funds on DBS Digital Exchange. The partnership provided accredited and institutional investors with trading and lending solutions by leveraging tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger blockchain and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Analysts say this cohesion with traditional rails has increased the appeal of XRP and should soon reflect in the asset’s price. Since mid-October, when the XRP ETFs launched, the vehicles have seen $1.07 billion of inflows, “bucking the negative sentiment seen across other assets,” according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Specific vehicle data reflects that Franklin Templeton’s recently launched XRP fund alone captured $28.6 million of weekly volume. The capital flight from Bitcoin ($2.8B outflows since mid-October) coincides directly with the launch of spot XRP ETFs, showing institutions are reallocating risk budgets toward assets with fresh regulatory “wrappers” and lower saturation. If this continues, XRP can push to break the $3 resistance level and aim for new highs. XRP Price Prediction: Descending Trendline Breakout Could Target $3.50 On the technical front, the weekly XRP/USDT chart shows a market correcting after an aggressive impulse move from the November 2024 bottom near $0.50, which marked a clear long-term trend reversal. That rally carried XRP to the July high around $3.50, completing a near-600% advance before momentum began fading. Since then, price action has shifted into a controlled downtrend, defined by a descending trendline now acting as dynamic resistance. Source: TradingView At present, XRP is trading around $1.83, sitting well above the former macro base but below key overhead levels. The most important zone to watch is the $3.00–$3.05 area, which stands out as critical resistance. A decisive weekly close above this region would confirm a trendline breakout and open the path toward the July high near $3.50, which also aligns with projected 2026 upside targets. The weekly RSI has cooled into the low-to-mid 40s, reflecting the ongoing corrective phase rather than outright bearish dominance. From a directional standpoint, the chart favors a consolidation-to-reversal scenario rather than a deep retracement, as long as XRP holds above the mid-$1.50 region. Pepenode Presale Positions for XRP-induced Rally If XRP finally breaks the $3 resistance and starts trending upward again, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see significant gains. Pepenode is a crypto project that’s raised neaarly $2.5 million despite challenging market conditions.

In it, Duong and his team attributed the shift in policy as the motivation for banks and corporations to finally start building the technical infrastructure that will be required to take things on-chain. Duong called the year an “extraordinary” period for the crypto ecosystem, despite some of the “lackluster price action.” He went on to admit that the asset class is still defined by accelerating institutional adoption with a more diverse investor base reshaping overall demand, but that this only means the industry’s full potential is still far from realized. Meanwhile, tokenization and stablecoin s mo ved deeper into core financial workflows. He claim s th ey at Coinbase expect the positive forces to compound next year as stablecoins take a larger role in delivery-vs-payment structures, and tokenized collateral gets more recognition across traditional transactions. Coinbase sees crypto maturing in 2026 The report also claims that the investor base itself is no longer what it used to be and is now more diversified. In the past, crypto was used by early adopters who couldn’t be sure mass adoption would ever happen. But that has changed, and it is now dominated by institutions and a far wider cross‑section of allocators and end‑users. Demand has also gone from a monolith to become a mosaic of macroeconomics, technology, and geopolitics. According to him, if the industry executes on product quality, regulatory stewardship, and user‑centric design, it will be easier to help ensure that the next wave of innovation reaches everyone, everywhere, all the time. Coinbase’s CPO thinks America may fall behind China next year The competition for dominance in the new frontier that is crypto is bound to intensify next year, and President Trump has declared several times that he wants America to become the crypto capital of the world. Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, has expressed concern, warning that the United States could potentially lose ground in the global crypto if it proceeds with a ban on interest or rewards on U.S. stablecoins. The warning comes as countries are now competing more aggressively over digital money, and rewards or incentives could strongly influence which currencies come out on top. In an X post, Shirzad claimed the issue has become more serious since China’s central bank has announced that starting January 1, 2026, banks will be allowed to pay interest on digital yuan balances. This means the digital yuan will no longer be used just as digital cash; it will work more like a bank deposit that can earn interest. Chinese officials reportedly hope this will encourage more people to use it, since adoption has been slower than expected despite years of testing. Coinbase sees the GENIUS Act as a way to help U.S.-regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins become the main tools for digital payments worldwide. However, Shirzad has warned that banning rewards could hurt that goal and weaken the U.S. dollar’s role globally. To compete with China now, those rewards are non-negotiable. However, banking groups have been clear from the onset that they don’t want them, arguing that allowing rewards would make stablecoins too similar to bank deposits and could threaten financial stability. 2026 is bound to be tumultuous for all involved as the U.S. struggles to figure out how to proceed without crossing the very powerful parties involved . However, after the dust settles, the crypto sector is likely to be better off. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

U.S. Representative Warren Davidson (R-OH) has ignited a critical debate by asserting that current and proposed American crypto regulation is actively stifling innovation and, more fundamentally, killing the decentralization that defines the technology’s core value proposition. His analysis points to a legislative path that may cement traditional finance structures, potentially driving capital and talent overseas. The Core Argument: How Crypto Regulation Undermines Decentralization Representative Davidson’s critique, detailed in a recent social media thread, centers on a pivotal concern: the erosion of decentralization. He argues that the U.S. regulatory approach, through bills like the proposed GENIUS Act for stablecoins, enforces a “bank-centric, account-based” model. Consequently, this framework treats digital assets through the lens of traditional finance (TradFi), which requires identifiable intermediaries and custodians. This creates significant barriers. For instance, non-bank entities face immense difficulty offering interest-bearing services under such a model. Furthermore, the critical concept of self-custody —where users control their private keys and assets without a third party—receives inadequate protection. Davidson contends this regulatory stance makes decentralized systems functionally identical to the centralized systems they were designed to challenge. Account-Based vs. Token-Based: Traditional regulation understands “accounts” held at institutions. True decentralization operates on a “token-based” system where ownership is proven cryptographically on a public ledger. Capital Flight: Davidson links this regulatory pressure to the outflow of cryptocurrency businesses and investment from the United States to jurisdictions with clearer, more innovation-friendly frameworks. Legislative Indifference: He cites a lack of nuanced understanding in Congress as a contributing factor to the current regulatory deadlock and market downturn. Legislative Landscape: The GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act The debate is crystallized around two key pieces of proposed legislation. Understanding their mechanisms is essential to grasping Davidson’s warning. The GENIUS Act’s Federal Framework The Stablecoin Innovation and Protection Act (GENIUS Act) aims to create a federal regulatory floor for payment stablecoins. While providing much-needed clarity, its critics, including Davidson, argue it codifies the role of insured depository institutions (banks) as primary issuers. The table below outlines the core tension: Policy Goal Potential Consequence Consumer Protection & Stability Reinforces Centralized, Bank-Led Model Federal Regulatory Clarity Raises Barriers for Non-Bank Innovators Defining Issuer Requirements Marginalizes Non-Custodial, Decentralized Protocols This approach, while potentially stabilizing the sector for institutional adoption, arguably sidelines the permissionless innovation that sparked the crypto revolution. A Potential Fix? The CLARITY for Market Structure Act Davidson identifies the CLARITY for Market Structure Act as a potential corrective measure. This bill seeks to delineate clearer boundaries between securities and commodities in digital assets and includes provisions meant to protect self-custody practices. However, Davidson expresses skepticism. He suggests that even if CLARITY passes, its protections for individual freedom may remain merely formal without dismantling the underlying account-based regulatory philosophy. The structural inertia, he warns, could persist. The Bitcoin Benchmark and the Future of Peer-to-Peer Finance Central to this discussion is the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Davidson highlights Bitcoin’s design as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that enables global value transfer without intermediary approval. This model represents the purest form of the decentralization ideal. The push for account-based regulation, therefore, is seen as a direct threat to this innovation, potentially forcing a groundbreaking technology back into the mold of the very system it sought to evolve. Experts in blockchain governance echo aspects of this concern. Dr. Sarah Allen, a regulatory technology scholar at Stanford, noted in a 2024 paper, “Regulatory frameworks that predicate compliance on identifiable intermediaries create a paradox for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and permissionless networks. The challenge is to protect consumers without mandating central points of control.” This expert perspective underscores the technical complexity lawmakers face. The global impact is already measurable. According to data from the Blockchain Association, venture capital funding for U.S.-based crypto startups fell by over 35% year-over-year in 2024, while jurisdictions like Singapore, the EU under its MiCA framework, and the UAE saw notable increases. This capital flight aligns with Davidson’s warning that legislative ambivalence has real-world economic consequences. Conclusion The critique leveled by Representative Warren Davidson frames a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in America. The central question is whether U.S. crypto regulation will evolve to nurture the unique, decentralized architecture of blockchain technology or inadvertently suffocate it by imposing traditional financial constructs. The outcome will determine not just market trajectories but the very location of the next wave of financial innovation. As the debate over the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act continues, the fundamental tension between consumer protection and technological revolution remains unresolved, with the core principle of decentralization hanging in the balance. FAQs Q1: What is the main criticism Rep. Davidson has against current crypto regulation? Davidson argues it enforces a centralized, bank-account model that is incompatible with and stifles true decentralization, driving innovation and capital out of the United States. Q2: How does the GENIUS Act for stablecoins affect decentralization? The GENIUS Act focuses on federally regulating stablecoins primarily through insured banks, which reinforces a centralized issuance model and creates high barriers for non-bank or decentralized protocol issuers. Q3: What is self-custody, and why is it important in this debate? Self-custody means users hold their own private keys and control their assets directly on the blockchain, without a bank or exchange as an intermediary. It is a cornerstone of decentralization, and critics say current regulations do not adequately protect it. Q4: Could the CLARITY Act solve these regulatory problems? While the CLARITY Act includes protections for self-custody and aims to clarify market structure, some skeptics believe it may not fully overcome the entrenched account-based regulatory approach, limiting its transformative potential. Q5: What is the real-world impact of this regulatory uncertainty? Data shows venture capital and crypto business formation are shifting to regions with clearer digital asset rules, suggesting the U.S. is experiencing capital and talent flight due to regulatory stagnation.

India’s Reserve Bank has urged countries in its Financial Stability Report to prioritize digital currencies issued by banks over privately issued stablecoins. What is the Indian government’s attitude towards stablecoins? The Reserve Bank of India released its Financial Stability Report this Wednesday, and within the report is a strong warning against stablecoins, stating that “risks from stablecoins to macrofinancial stability outweigh their purported benefits.” The RBI “strongly advocates” that countries should prioritize Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) over privately issued stablecoins to maintain trust in money and preserve financial stability. Stablecoins have gained increasing acceptance globally, but the central bank is more concerned with the financial stability risks associated with their growing use. India has been working on its own digital rupee for over two years. The RBI started testing the digital rupee in December 2022, and the pilot program now has over 5 million users and 400,000 merchants, according to recent reports. India has not banned cryptocurrencies, but the government taxes crypto gains at 30% and adds a 1% tax on all crypto transactions, making it hard to use. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said repeatedly that India will not recognize private cryptocurrencies as legal money. The report also revealed that gross bad loans of Indian banks could drop to 1.9% by the end of March 2027 from 2.1% recorded at the end of September 2025. “The Indian economy and the financial system remain robust and resilient,” Governor Sanjay Malhotra wrote in the report’s foreword. “Nonetheless, we recognize the near-term challenges from external spillovers and continue to build strong guardrails to safeguard the economy and the financial system from potential shocks.” How are India’s Non-Banking Financial Companies doing? The RBI conducted stress tests on 174 Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) over a one-year period, and results revealed that gross bad loans of non-bank lenders may rise to 2.9% in September 2026 from 2.3% in September 2025. The RBI noted that “even as the GNPA (gross non-performing assets) ratio in NBFCs has declined, fresh accretions to NPAs are trending higher.” Additionally, companies are writing off more loans, indicating a build-up of stress in their loan portfolios. Non-banking financial companies provide credit to sectors and borrowers that traditional banks may not serve. Any significant stress in this sector could have ripple effects throughout the economy. The central bank also warned that insurance companies are spending more money, which will hurt the profits of the sector. In October 2025, the RBI told NBFCs to be more selective with their loans after it was observed that some NBFCs were taking too many risks with personal loans and credit cards. Several large NBFCs have already reported higher bad loans in recent months. The RBI’s report included stress test scenarios that model different economic conditions. If the economy maintains its normal condition, that is, a GDP growth of 7.3% for the current financial year and 6.7% and 6.8% for the first two quarters of 2026-27, the banking sector will continue to strengthen. However, gross bad loans may rise to 3.2% if economic growth slows down slightly. A sharp economic decline could push bad loans to 4.2%. The European Central Bank is working on a digital euro .

BREAKING NEWS: U.S. LAWMAKERS ARE TARGETING JANUARY 15 FOR A MARKUP OF THE LONG-AWAITED MARKET STRUCTURE LEGISLATION, THE ‘CLARITY ACT!’ JANUARY 2026 WILL BE BIG FOR #XRP AND CRYPTO! https://t.co/XCpHivF3lC pic.twitter.com/7wCSGRExHk — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 31, 2025 Traders are already positioning around a renewed regulatory push. ETH is trading near $2,965 , up about 0.3% on the day and roughly 5% over the past month; meanwhile, SOL is trading around $124 , up about 1.4% on the day and 0.7% over the past month. Key Provisions of the CLARITY Act Staffers working on the CLARITY Act text state that the current draft keeps the CFTC in the lead for non‑security fungible tokens that meet trading and decentralization tests, while codifying an SEC regime for tokens that rely on ongoing managerial efforts and offer yield or revenue‑share features. That split tracks how recent SEC enforcement complaints described named assets, but for the first time, it would place the test in statute instead of case law and speeches. On DeFi, lobbyists who reviewed the December redline say the bill would treat front-end operators, order-routing interfaces, and fee-collecting DAOs as registrants, while leaving a safe harbor open for immutable, fee-free smart contracts with no upgrade keys. Political Environment and Market Sentiment Prediction markets are also mirroring rising expectations that lawmakers will break the deadlock this cycle. On Kalshi, contracts tied to the passage of a broad federal digital asset framework by mid‑2026 are trading at materially higher probabilities than in early Q4, with open interest increasing as the markup date looks to be officially confirmed. Traders used those markets through 2023–2025 as an informal policy barometer during failed pushes on earlier House‑driven bills. Banking Committee members from both parties, including senators who previously backed narrower market‑structure efforts, have told industry groups they want to avoid a repeat of prior cycles where the House passes a digital asset package that then dies in the Senate without a committee vote. A clean markup that yields a bipartisan manager’s amendment would set up a path to 60 votes on the floor, but staff still expect aggressive amendments on DeFi custody, sanctions enforcement, and treatment of crypto‑native stablecoin rewards in retirement accounts. “My colleagues and I in the House and Senate share the same goal: to provide clear rules of the road for digital assets that protect investors, foster innovation, and keep the future of digital finance anchored in America,” said Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, in a July 2025 discussion draft . Additionally, the CLARITY Act debate doesn’t happen in isolation. ETH drew over $1.3 billion in fresh staking flows from institutional vehicles in late December, according to recent staking data and fund disclosures, while Solana continues to capture high-beta flows after a year where its market cap rebounded sharply from 2022 levels. Those flows price in some probability that the next Congress delivers a workable regime instead of continued rule‑by‑enforcement. Institutional Market Implications For desks that run serious size in ETH and SOL, this markup functions as a binary policy catalyst rather than political theater. A bipartisan CLARITY Act draft that survives the committee with a clear CFTC lane for sufficiently decentralized L1s, a knowable registration path for DeFi front-ends, and an explicit ceiling on “reward‑like” stablecoin yields reduces headline risk for Ethereum-centric yield strategies and Solana liquidity provisioning, and it makes it easier for large U.S. venues to list and margin a broader set of tokens. If the session breaks down into party-line votes or pushes DeFi into a de facto unworkable regime, the trade flips: U.S. flows migrate further offshore, regulated venues lean into BTC plus a handful of blue chips, and the regulatory overhang discount on anything that looks like a revenue-share or staking derivative widens again.

Three of the most exciting ones to watch as the year draws to a close include Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano (ADA) remains a popular choice as it continues to develop its ecosystem, boasts solid foundations for the coming year, and has stabilized its price near key levels, making it a solid choice for enthusiasts looking to buy on the way back into the mainstream crypto fold after a slight downturn. DOGE, meanwhile, remains a leader as the original meme coin sensation, with a devoted fan base prepared to spark another massive price rally should key psychological barriers be broken. Finally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi crypto coin that has only recently broken into the mainstream and is now undergoing its Phase 7 presale, with the cumulative funds reaching almost $20 million, offering crypto buyers a new, cheap crypto coin before its price increase. Among the top cryptos gaining attention, these three are often listed among the best cryptos to buy before 2026 kicks off. Cardano (ADA) Stabilizes Around Key Levels while Momentum Accelerates The current situation in the Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency market is that of consolidation around key support levels, currently trading around $0.37 on the 4-hour chart, after a strong recovery from the lows. It appears to be attempting to establish a structure but remains beneath a key level of supply, indicating that the market remains prudent and waits for validation. A strong break above the current resistance levels will shift this momentum and will shortly be followed by a recovery, although a break below the current support levels will result in consolidation. Regarding investors tracking this market, analysis favors an inclusive portfolio that incorporates sound network assets like ADA and the new Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For those seeking the top cryptos, MUTM ranks among the best cryptos to buy for the early months of 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE) Consolidates After Rally, Potential for Upside Dogecoin (DOGE) is in the process of consolidating on the weekly charts after the completion of an impulsive move, and the market is well within an accumulation zone. Although this is in a pullback phase, the overall market trends are positive, and the establishment of a strong foundation at these current market levels could fuel further upward moves once traction is gained. The current market condition of Dogecoin tends to showcase its robust nature in being one of the top cryptos in the market. However, investors are hedging their market positions in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for further rapid growth. Many analysts consider MUTM among the best cryptos to buy when looking at potential momentum-driven gains in 2026. MUTM Surges in Presale Stage 7 During a relatively sluggish market for token sales, including ADA and DOGE, MUTM is causing a stir as it continues further in its presale journey in the DeFi space. Presale phase 7 is up for purchase at $0.04, following the relatively fast sale of tokens in Phase 6. Phase 8 will see the cost increase to $0.045, which is nothing short of a 20% increase. This is one of the final opportunities to acquire MUTM tokens at this stage, making it one of the top cryptos for early investors looking for extraordinary upside. Mutuum Finance has so far raised $19.5 million with the support of 18,620 token holders, with pricing during Phase 7 set at $0.04. The project has already seen a 300% rise from Phase 1 pricing, which was set for $0.01, with plans to reach $0.06 at launch, meaning interested investors stand a chance to gain returns of as much as 400%. It should be noted, however, that most crypto projects lack tangible technology, but in MUTM, lending and borrowing capabilities exist, with this project being audited by Halborn Security , a cyber-security firm. Many see this project as one of the best cryptos to buy due to its strong fundamentals and early-stage opportunity. Leaderboard Incentives: Engagement, Activity Increase To further incentivize the community to participate in the platform, Mutuum Finance has rolled out a dashboard with the Top 50 Holders, where each person who topped the ranking for the respective day receives a bonus of $500 for MUTM, provided that they have made at least one transaction in the period. This further demonstrates the benefits of the MUTM token, emphasizing the token’s utilization-oriented framework, further establishing itself as a very promising and inexpensive DeFi investment opportunity. Among the top cryptos of 2026, MUTM stands out as an early-stage favorite and one of the best cryptos to buy for investors seeking high potential returns. While the clock ticks closer to the start of 2026, Cardano (ADA) presents a stable investment, Dogecoin (DOGE) breeds speculative fervor, and with a price of merely $0.04 in Presale Phase 7, MUTM presents unimaginable gains. With a raised amount of $19.5M, the number of token holders at 18,620 and quite practical usability through the offering of loans and borrowing, early investment in MUTM is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to harvest gigantic profits. For traders looking for top cryptos or the best cryptos to buy as 2026 approaches, these three remain key highlights in the market.

However, the broader picture remains fragile. Since early December, BTC has repeatedly failed to push above the $90,000 threshold, a level that continues to cap upside attempts and reinforce market hesitation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Adding to the cautious outlook, CryptoZeno, a CryptoQuant analyst, points to miner behavior as a growing short-term risk factor. According to his analysis, Bitcoin miner outflows are signaling rising sell-side pressure, a dynamic that has historically mattered during periods of weak momentum. The data shows a clear relationship between miner activity and short-term price movements. Sharp increases in total miner outflows—especially when large volumes of BTC are sent to exchanges—have frequently coincided with local price pullbacks rather than sustained rallies. Miners are often considered informed market participants, typically operating with relatively low cost bases. When their distribution activity increases, it can introduce additional supply at moments when spot demand is already struggling to absorb selling pressure. While miner outflows alone do not define a broader market top, they can amplify short-term weakness, particularly in range-bound conditions like the one Bitcoin is currently facing. Miner Outflows Reinforce Short-Term Downside Risks The report explains that recent spikes in Bitcoin miner outflows have repeatedly been followed by immediate or near-term price weakness, reinforcing the link between miner behavior and short-term market dynamics. These episodes suggest that miners—often considered informed participants with relatively low production cost bases—are actively distributing supply during periods of strength or heightened uncertainty. While a miner selling on its own does not signal a macro market top, it frequently adds incremental supply at sensitive moments, increasing short-term pressure when liquidity is thin, or spot demand is unable to absorb new inflows. CryptoZeno adds that elevated miner outflows typically reflect a combination of factors. These include profit realization after rallies, the need to cover operational expenses, or a defensive response to weakening price structure. From an on-chain perspective, this behavior is not unusual during corrective or range-bound phases. However, when miner transfers to exchanges cluster within a short time window, their impact becomes more pronounced. Concentrated outflows can materially increase sell-side pressure on exchanges, raising the probability of corrective price moves rather than sustained upside continuation. At the macro level, miner distribution becomes especially influential when paired with broader headwinds. Neutral or declining risk appetite, tighter liquidity conditions, or cooling derivatives sentiment all reduce the market’s capacity to absorb additional supply. In such environments, miner-driven selling is less likely to be smoothly digested and can instead amplify downside volatility, keeping Bitcoin vulnerable in the near term.

Following the sharp breakdown in November, price found support in the $85,000–$87,000 zone, where selling pressure began to ease and volatility compressed. Since then, BTC has been moving sideways, signaling indecision rather than a decisive trend reversal. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains capped below its declining short-term moving averages. The 50-day moving average continues to slope downward and acts as dynamic resistance. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages sit well above the current price, reinforcing a broader bearish structure. As long as BTC trades below these levels, upside attempts are likely to be sold into rather than sustained. Related Reading: XRP Selling Pressure Returns: Investors Shift From Holding to Distribution After the heavy sell-off in November, trading volume has gradually declined. This suggests that aggressive sellers have stepped back, but new demand has not yet entered with conviction. This typically characterizes a stabilization phase rather than the start of a new impulsive move. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a base, but confirmation remains absent. A daily close above $90,000 could signal a meaningful shift in momentum. And would open the door for a recovery toward higher resistance zones. Conversely, a loss of the $85,000 support area could expose BTC to another leg lower. For now, the chart reflects balance, hesitation, and a market waiting for a catalyst.

He suggests that several market factors and structural developments could align to drive this surge, creating a favorable environment that could position XRP for significant gains and lasting market impact. XRP Price And Demand Set To Skyrocket In 2026 In a recent X post, crypto analyst ‘X Finance Bull’ outlined the key catalysts from 2025 that could drive XRP demand and price in 2026. He emphasized that while everyone is watching price action, institutions are closely monitoring custody , compliance, and payment corridors, which are crucial for laying the groundwork for the cryptocurrency’s future growth. For 2026, the analyst points to several factors that could shape XRP’s price growth and future development. He highlighted XRP Spot ETF accumulation as a key driver, emphasizing that over 350 million XRP are currently held in ETFs, providing a solid base of regulated institutional ownership. X Finance Bull disclosed that XRP ETFs are already attracting institutional capital , reducing liquidity and signaling rising demand for the cryptocurrency as a regulated digital asset. He noted that ETF inflows represent structural buying that often precedes notable price appreciation. XRP’s supply dynamics are also expected to play a significant role in fueling a price surge. X Finance Bull explained that with fewer XRP available on exchanges , this could create structural pressure that may influence future price behavior. Combined with steady demand, this tightening supply could lay the groundwork for potential price gains in 2026. Another major factor highlighted by X Finance Bull is the growing utility of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The analyst noted that XRPL currently supports stablecoins, tokenization, and institutional DeFi—all features that could drive increased adoption and long-term growth of the cryptocurrency. He emphasized that increasing on-chain activity could drive transactional usage and position XRP as a bridge asset for settlements, liquidity routing, and broader financial infrastructure. Other Factors That Could Influence XRP’s Growth Next Year In his post, X Finance Bull also pointed to XRP’s current market structure as a supporting factor that could drive its price and demand upward. He explained that regulated crypto products, improved global risk sentiment, and the need for faster settlements are encouraging institutional adoption. He also stated that an increase in capital flows often precedes significant price movements, making institutional positioning a critical indicator for future market trends. In addition, the analyst mentioned Ripple’s expanding institutional infrastructure as a key driver that could boost the XRP price by making it easier for banks, payment providers, and enterprises to use the token. Finally, X Finance Bull noted that the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the US SEC has created much-needed regulatory clarity, opening the door for broader adoption and stronger demand.",XRP|ripple|X Finance Bull|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRP spot ETF|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 22:00:46

This batch targets major altcoins, including Aave (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI), and Sui (SUI), signaling a direct challenge to current regulatory boundaries that have largely confined ETF approvals to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and, more recently, Solana and XRP. Bitwise Pushes Deeper Into Altcoin ETFs According to the filings, the proposed products will sit under the Bitwise Funds Trust and trade on NYSE Arca if approved. The lineup includes strategy ETFs focused on AAVE, UNI, Zcash (ZEC), Near (NEAR), SUI, Tron (TRX), Starknet (STRK), Ethena (ENA), Bittensor (TAO), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and the Canton Network’s CC token. The prospectus outlined a consistent structure across the funds. Each ETF plans to hold up to 60% of its assets directly in the underlying token, while at least 40% would come from exchange-traded products, futures, or swaps that track the same asset. In some cases, exposure may be managed through offshore subsidiaries, a structure already familiar in commodity and crypto-linked funds. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reacted to the filings, writing on X that “money (and ETF filings) never sleeps,” a nod to the pace at which issuers are racing to secure first-mover advantage in altcoin products. Industry accounts such as ETF Hearsay also flagged March 16, 2026, as the tentative effective date, though fees and tickers remain undecided. The breadth of the filings stands out because while earlier cycles focused almost entirely on Bitcoin and later Ethereum, Bitwise is now targeting decentralized finance, layer-1 networks, privacy coins, and even AI-linked crypto through TAO, reflecting shifting investor interest. A Crowded and Competitive Landscape Bitwise has made its move at a time when crypto ETFs outside Bitcoin are already showing mixed but telling results. For example, spot Solana ETFs, which launched in October, had attracted more than $750 million in net inflows halfway through December, according to recent CoinShares data. Analysts noted that investors appear willing to hold these products through volatile price swings, suggesting longer-term positioning rather than short-term trading. Meanwhile, Ripple-linked ETFs have gone even further. As CryptoPotato previously reported, U.S.-listed XRP ETFs have recorded more than $1 billion in cumulative inflows without a single day of net withdrawals, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana funds during the same period. For now, the filings signal growing confidence from asset managers that investor demand extends well beyond the largest cryptocurrencies and that the ETF market may soon reflect that shift, pending the SEC’s response.

The job is to dig through the murky disaster of off-the-books financing that First Brands was using before the auto-parts supplier crashed into bankruptcy. According to a court filing from Wednesday, the committee representing unsecured creditors said they officially brought in Nardello on December 1. Their task includes digging into factoring and financing arrangements that money flowed through, and Nardello is also investigating accounts and shell entities tied to Patrick James, the founder of First Brands, plus other top insiders. Investigators are also looking at James and insiders The creditors’ committee asked the judge to let Nardello start work immediately, because time is tight and there are “time-sensitive matters” that need urgent attention in this Chapter 11 mess. And yes, the judge still needs to approve the company officially, but that’s standard. Meanwhile, Nardello’s track record is already on the table. The committee reminded the court that during the FTX case, Nardello helped claw back billions in assets for creditors. They also pointed out that Nardello is not new to high-profile wreckage. Nardello worked for creditors of Purdue Pharma, the opioid giant that filed Chapter 11 in 2019 after lawsuits over OxyContin. They also assisted in the Alex Jones case after the conspiracy theorist went bankrupt over that $1.4 billion Sandy Hook defamation ruling. This probe into First Brands is only one of many. The entire Chapter 11 collapse is now under a microscope. On top of the Nardello investigation, advisers working for the company have already sued Patrick James, accusing him of looting corporate funds. He denies doing anything wrong. Things are heating up elsewhere too. A former finance director at First Brands told creditors he plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment at his deposition. That means he doesn’t want to answer questions because of a federal criminal probe that’s already looking into the company. The legal mess is officially filed as First Brands Group LLC, case number 25-90399, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. There are no excuses left on the table.

Price action remains subdued, with ETH failing to sustain moves above key resistance levels, reinforcing the perception that investors are still cautious. Many analysts argue that the market has yet to fully reset, pointing to weak risk appetite, declining liquidity, and a lack of strong spot demand. As a result, Ethereum, like most major assets, remains trapped in a consolidation phase marked by hesitation rather than conviction. Despite this gloomy backdrop, a growing group of optimists believes Ethereum could be approaching a cyclical bottom. Their view is based less on short-term price action and more on structural and behavioral signals that tend to emerge during late-stage bearish phases. One of the most notable developments comes from on-chain data. According to data from Arkham shared by Lookonchain, Bitmine acquired another 32,938 ETH worth approximately $97.6 million just a few hours ago. Bitmine is a large institutional Ethereum-focused entity known for accumulating ETH at scale and deploying it across staking and long-term strategies rather than short-term trading. With this latest purchase, Bitmine now holds roughly 3.357 million ETH, valued at around $10 billion, making it one of the largest known Ethereum holders. Bitmine Deepens Long-Term Commitment Ethereum’s near-term price action remains fragile, but institutional behavior continues to diverge from market sentiment. Over the past few hours, Bitmine staked an additional 118,944 ETH, worth approximately $352.16 million, according to data from Arkham reported by Lookonchain. This move follows Bitmine’s recent spot accumulation and reinforces its long-term positioning strategy rather than a short-term speculative approach. Staking at this scale effectively removes a significant amount of ETH from liquid circulation, tightening available supply on exchanges. Unlike transfers to centralized platforms, staking reflects a high-conviction view that prioritizes yield generation and long-term network participation over immediate liquidity. For analysts tracking structural supply dynamics, this behavior contrasts sharply with the current price trend, which continues to show limited bullish follow-through. Despite these developments, the broader market remains unconvinced. Ethereum has struggled to reclaim key resistance levels, and momentum indicators still point to weakness. As a result, analysts are increasingly divided when assessing the outlook for 2026. Some interpret ongoing institutional accumulation and staking as early positioning ahead of a longer-term recovery cycle. Others caution that macro uncertainty, muted demand, and persistent risk aversion could keep ETH range-bound or under pressure for longer than expected. In this context, Bitmine’s actions stand out as a signal of long-term confidence, but not necessarily an immediate catalyst. For now, Ethereum’s price remains weak, while the strategic behavior beneath the surface continues to quietly reshape the supply landscape. Ethereum Remains Range-Bound Below Key Resistance Ethereum continues to trade in a consolidation range after failing to reclaim higher levels, with price hovering around the $3,000 zone. The chart shows ETH capped below the declining 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which now act as dynamic resistance around the $3,400–$3,600 area. This alignment reinforces the broader bearish structure that has been in place since the November breakdown. After peaking near the $4,800 region earlier in the cycle, ETH entered a clear downtrend, marked by lower highs and expanding sell-side volume during corrective phases. The sharp sell-off into late November pushed the price toward the $2,800 area, where buyers stepped in to defend support. Since then, Ethereum has stabilized but failed to generate sustained upside momentum, suggesting demand remains cautious rather than aggressive. Volume has declined noticeably during recent rebounds, indicating a lack of strong conviction from buyers. This behavior is typical of late-stage corrective phases, where price compresses while market participants wait for clearer signals. As long as ETH remains below the 200-day moving average, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure. On the downside, the $2,800–$2,900 zone stands out as a key support area. A clean break below this range would increase the risk of a deeper retracement. Conversely, reclaiming $3,300 with strong volume would be the first sign that Ethereum is transitioning out of its current corrective structure.

56664328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=871329,1767222044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56664328.jpeg,Expert Says XRP ‘Haters’ Miss The Bigger Picture: Here’s What It Is,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/expert-xrp-haters-miss-the-bigger-picture/,"A prominent XRP commentator is pushing back on a familiar critique of Ripple’s business model, arguing that skeptics have the causality backwards when they claim the company sells XRP merely to amass traditional assets. In a post on X on Wednesday, CryptoInsightUK founder Will Taylor said the “haters” are “so close to being right,” but miss what he framed as the single step that changes the entire equation. What ‘Haters’ Get Wrong About XRP Taylor’s central claim is that Ripple’s token sales are not designed to swap out a volatile crypto asset for safer, conventional holdings. Instead, he described the sales as a means of funding infrastructure and integrations that ultimately increase the token’s long-term utility and value. “Haters say Ripple sell XRP so they can buy real-world companies and assets, because that’s how Ripple ‘makes money’,” Taylor wrote. “In my opinion, that completely misunderstands the business model and more importantly, the direction of causality. Yes, Ripple monetises some XRP. But not to replace XRP with traditional assets.” In Taylor’s telling, the misunderstanding starts with treating XRP like operating cash rather than a strategic, asymmetric asset. He argued that a large holder of an asset with outsized upside potential would not logically liquidate it simply to “stack normal companies,” especially if that asset could become worth more than the firm’s balance sheet at scale. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Most Bought Digital Asset, Bitcoin And Ethereum Bleed $500 Million “If you hold roughly 40% of an asset that, at scale, could be worth more than your entire balance sheet, you don’t treat it like operating cash,” he wrote. “You don’t say: ‘Let’s sell the most asymmetric asset we own just to stack normal companies.’ That would be insane.” From there, Taylor reframed Ripple’s acquisitions, integrations, and buildout efforts not as a pivot away from XRP but as “multipliers” that increase the odds XRP becomes a viable global settlement instrument. Traditional assets, he argued, are inputs to expand distribution, compliance, and liquidity: conditions that would make a bridge asset more useful at institutional scale. “When Ripple acquires or integrates with firms like Hidden Road, stablecoin infrastructure, or tokenised treasury rails, those assets are not the end goal,” Taylor wrote. “They are multipliers. Those companies are not replacing XRP. They are building the pipes that require XRP to function efficiently.” Related Reading: XRP Still Has A Path To $28 This Cycle, Analyst Says Taylor positioned this as a flywheel: XRP sits at the “strategic core” on the balance sheet, Ripple builds a full stack around payments and liquidity, institutions adopt because the rails are complete, and the token becomes a neutral settlement layer whose demand compounds over time. Under that framework, he said, short-term monetization is better understood as capital deployment in service of a long-term network effect rather than straightforward dilution. “That’s not dilution. That’s capital deployment,” Taylor wrote, adding that if Ripple simply wanted to be “a profitable TradFi-style company,” it would not “obsess over neutral settlement,” keep XRP “architecturally central,” or push it into “regulated institutional rails.” The distinction matters because it changes how observers interpret Ripple’s incentives. In Taylor’s model, the objective is not to sell the token in order to accumulate off-chain assets; it is to use off-chain assets—licenses, liquidity venues, compliance infrastructure, and institutional integrations—to increase XRP’s necessity as a settlement tool. “The endgame is not: ‘Sell XRP to buy assets,’” he wrote. “The endgame is: ‘Use assets to make XRP unavoidable.’” At press time, XRP traded at $1.8773.

This acquisition, valued at approximately $779 million, represents one of the most significant corporate Bitcoin investments of the year and marks a pivotal moment for the company’s reserve management policy. The transaction, first reported by the cryptocurrency analytics platform Watcher.Guru, highlights Tether’s continued commitment to diversifying its substantial reserves beyond traditional assets. This strategic purchase not only bolsters the backing of the USDT stablecoin but also sends a powerful signal about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a treasury reserve asset. Consequently, market analysts and industry experts are closely examining the implications for both Tether’s stability and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Tether’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition and Market Context Tether’s purchase of 8,888 BTC in Q4 2025 did not occur in a vacuum. The company has consistently allocated a portion of its profits to Bitcoin since 2022, framing it as a strategy to strengthen the utility and long-term stability of its stablecoin reserves. This latest acquisition brings Tether’s publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings to a formidable total, firmly establishing it as one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency globally. The timing of the purchase is particularly noteworthy, as it followed a period of relative consolidation in Bitcoin’s price after its previous all-time high cycles. Market data indicates that Tether likely accumulated this position through a combination of direct over-the-counter (OTC) purchases and strategic market buys, minimizing slippage and market impact. Furthermore, the specific number 8,888 holds cultural significance in some Asian markets as a symbol of prosperity and good fortune, potentially reflecting a deliberate choice by the company’s treasury management team. Analyzing the Impact on USDT Reserves and Stability The integration of Bitcoin into Tether’s reserve portfolio directly impacts the perceived robustness of USDT. Tether publishes quarterly attestations detailing the composition of its reserves, which traditionally include cash, cash equivalents, and other highly liquid assets. The addition of a substantial Bitcoin position introduces a different risk-return profile. While Bitcoin is more volatile than U.S. Treasury bills, it is also viewed by many institutions as a non-correlated, hard-cap asset with significant long-term appreciation potential. Financial experts argue that a responsibly sized allocation to Bitcoin can enhance the overall yield of Tether’s reserves, potentially generating profits that further fortify the stablecoin’s backing. However, this move also necessitates sophisticated risk management frameworks to hedge against Bitcoin’s price volatility, ensuring that the 1:1 peg of USDT to the U.S. dollar remains unwavering under all market conditions. Tether’s ability to manage this balance will be critical for maintaining user trust. The Broader Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Tether’s action is a prominent chapter in the ongoing narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Since MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy in 2020, numerous publicly traded and private companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a primary treasury reserve asset. Tether’s approach, however, is fundamentally different. Unlike a typical corporation, Tether’s primary product is a financial instrument—a stablecoin—that requires extreme confidence in its backing. Its decision to hold Bitcoin, therefore, carries greater weight and scrutiny. The table below contrasts Tether’s treasury strategy with that of a traditional corporate adopter. Entity Type Primary Goal Role of Bitcoin Risk Profile Tether (Stablecoin Issuer) Backing a liquid, pegged currency (USDT) Long-term reserve appreciation, portfolio diversification High scrutiny; must not impair liquidity for redemptions Traditional Corporation (e.g., Tech Firm) Maximizing shareholder value, preserving capital Inflation hedge, alternative to cash, strategic investment Managed as part of a broader investment portfolio This trend is driven by several key macroeconomic factors prevalent in 2025: Persistent Inflation: Companies seek assets with a verifiable scarcity to protect purchasing power. Advancing Regulation: Clearer digital asset frameworks in major economies provide legal certainty for corporate holdings. Institutional Infrastructure: The maturation of custodial, auditing, and derivative services makes holding Bitcoin operationally feasible for large entities. Consequently, Tether’s purchase is both a reflection of this established trend and a validation of Bitcoin’s maturity as an institutional-grade asset class. Expert Analysis and Future Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets Industry analysts have largely interpreted Tether’s Q4 2025 Bitcoin acquisition as a bullish long-term signal. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has previously stated that investments in Bitcoin are part of a strategy to diversify and strengthen the company’s reserves. Experts from firms like Bernstein and Fidelity Digital Assets note that such large-scale, transparent buying from a major ecosystem player provides a substantial, non-speculative demand base for Bitcoin. This type of demand can help reduce overall market volatility over extended periods by locking up supply. Looking ahead, the implications are multifaceted: For the Stablecoin Sector: Rival stablecoin issuers may feel pressure to similarly diversify their reserves or at least transparently justify their current, more traditional compositions. For Bitcoin’s Price Discovery: Consistent buying from large entities like Tether creates a structural demand floor, influencing long-term valuation models. For Regulatory Dialogue: This move will likely be cited in ongoing discussions about reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, arguing for the inclusion of certain digital assets under strict guidelines. Market observers will now watch Tether’s future quarterly attestations closely to see if this Bitcoin accumulation strategy continues and how it is accounted for alongside its other reserve assets. The company’s performance in managing this volatile asset during market downturns will be the ultimate test of the strategy’s prudence. Conclusion Tether’s acquisition of 8,888 Bitcoin, worth $779 million, in the fourth quarter of 2025 is far more than a simple treasury transaction. It represents a calculated strategic pivot that reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a reserve asset for even the most sensitive financial instruments. This decisive Tether BTC acquisition strengthens the foundational backing of USDT while aligning the company with a forward-thinking approach to corporate treasury management. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and integrate with traditional finance, moves of this scale and transparency set important precedents. They demonstrate how major players can leverage digital assets to build resilience, generate value, and foster stability within the broader financial ecosystem. The success of this strategy will undoubtedly influence reserve management policies across the digital currency industry for years to come. FAQs Q1: Why did Tether buy 8,888 Bitcoin? Tether states that it allocates a portion of its net profits to purchasing Bitcoin as a strategy to diversify and strengthen the reserves backing its USDT stablecoin. The company views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Q2: How does this purchase affect the stability of USDT? Tether manages its Bitcoin holdings as part of a larger, highly liquid reserve portfolio. The goal is for Bitcoin’s potential appreciation to enhance overall reserve value, while robust risk management practices are employed to protect the stablecoin’s 1:1 dollar peg. Q3: Is Tether now one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin? Yes. Following this Q4 2025 acquisition, Tether is confirmed to be among the top three largest corporate entities globally in terms of Bitcoin treasury holdings, alongside companies like MicroStrategy. Q4: Where was this Tether Bitcoin acquisition reported? The transaction was first reported by the cryptocurrency news and data platform Watcher.Guru, based on analysis of public blockchain data and treasury disclosures. Q5: What does this mean for the future of stablecoin reserves? Tether’s move may encourage other stablecoin issuers to consider diversifying their reserves with digital assets like Bitcoin, potentially setting a new industry standard for reserve composition, provided it is done with appropriate safeguards and transparency.

As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.82 Market Cap $1.526B Trading Volume $95.22M Circulating Supply 546.06M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $2.85 24-h Low $2.67 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 8.47% (High) 14-Day RSI 37.38 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $3.87 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 21 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $4.80 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is still in a daily downtrend with price stuck below key resistance. Short-term relief bounces are corrective unless $2.95–$3.05 is reclaimed. Failure to hold $2.70 increases the risk of continuation toward lower supports. ICP 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for December 31, ICP is closing around $2.82, sitting just above the lower Bollinger Band near $2.72, which signals persistent downside pressure rather than strength. The price remains firmly below the mid-band, around $3.03, and the upper band, near $3.33, confirming that volatility is expanding downward, not upward. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering in the 37–40 zone, showing mild bearish momentum without capitulation, which often leads to continued grinding weakness rather than a sharp bounce. As long as daily closes fail to reclaim $3.00–$3.05, downside risk toward $2.55–$2.65 remains active, while any bounce into $3.10–$3.30 is likely to face heavy supply. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, the recent green candle from the $2.68–$2.70 region appears to be a reactionary bounce after selling exhaustion, rather than a trend shift. The price is still trading below the Alligator averages, clustered around $2.82–$2.90, maintaining a bearish structure despite the short-term uptick. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains below zero, although bearish momentum is easing, suggesting sellers are losing urgency but not control. A clean reclaim and hold above $2.90–$2.95 would be needed to open a push toward $3.05, while rejection below $2.85 risks another sweep of $2.70 support.

While short-term price action shows marginal recovery, market analyst Ali Martinez argues that weakening network fundamentals, large-holder distribution, and fragile technical support indicate downside risk has not been neutralized. In his view, if these conditions persist, XRP could still face a sharp drawdown toward the $0.80 region, implying a potential 56% decline from current levels. XRP’s Weak Network And Whale Selling Undermine Demand In a series of recent tweets, Martinez outlined multiple converging risks that could push XRP into a deeper decline. Central to his assessment is a visible deterioration in on-chain participation , which he views as an early warning signal for further downside. Daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger have fallen sharply, dropping from roughly 46,000 to about 38,500 within a single week. This contraction reflects reduced transactional engagement and softer organic demand, conditions that weaken price resilience during periods of broader market uncertainty. In practical terms, fewer active users translate into lower baseline buying pressure, making the asset more vulnerable to sell-side shocks. Compounding this issue is a notable shift in whale behavior. Martinez highlights that large holders have offloaded more than 40 million XRP over the same timeframe. When high-conviction capital moves to the sell side, it alters supply dynamics quickly, especially in markets already experiencing muted retail participation. Whale distribution typically acts as a leading indicator of trend exhaustion, as concentrated supply entering the market absorbs demand that would otherwise support price stability. Together, declining network activity and whale selling form a reinforcing feedback loop that erodes confidence and increases downside exposure. XRP Price Faces Elevated Downside Risk From a market structure standpoint, XRP’s technical setup remains precarious despite modest short-term gains. The asset is currently trading around $1.87, down 8.6% over the past month, even after recovering 0.3% in the last 24 hours and 1.1% over the past week. These incremental rebounds, however, have not altered the broader risk profile. According to Martinez, the $1.77 level represents a critical support zone that must hold to prevent deeper losses. A decisive break below $1.77 would invalidate the current consolidation structure and expose XRP to its next meaningful support near $0.79–$0.80. This level is not arbitrary; it represents a historically significant demand zone where price previously stabilized after prolonged declines. If selling pressure from whales persists while on-chain activity remains subdued, the probability of testing this lower band increases substantially. In this scenario, the projected move would amount to a roughly 56% decline, aligning with Martinez’s risk assessment. In sum, while XRP is not in freefall, the asset is operating on thin structural support . Until network activity recovers, whale behavior stabilizes, and key technical levels are decisively defended, XRP remains exposed to a high-impact downside scenario that investors cannot afford to ignore.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 00:00:18

Despite several recovery attempts, bulls have failed to regain control, leaving ETH vulnerable to renewed downside pressure. Market sentiment reflects this weakness, with a growing number of analysts leaning toward a bearish outlook for 2026 as momentum indicators continue to fade and risk appetite remains subdued across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 Amid this fragile technical backdrop, new on-chain data highlights a notable shift in Ethereum’s liquidity structure. According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Arab Chain, Ethereum reserves on Binance surged to approximately 4.17 million ETH in December. This increase coincided with massive inflows totaling nearly 8.5 million ETH over the month, marking one of the most significant exchange inflow events since 2023. Such a sharp rise in exchange-held ETH suggests a change in investor behavior. Historically, large inflows to centralized exchanges indicate preparation for increased trading activity, hedging, or potential selling pressure, rather than long-term accumulation. While inflows alone do not guarantee immediate downside, they often precede periods of higher volatility, especially when the price is already struggling to reclaim key resistance levels. Exchange Liquidity Rises as Volatility Risks Build The CryptoQuant report emphasizes that the sharp increase in Ethereum reserves on Binance—the world’s largest exchange by trading volume—indicates a significant increase in tradable supply. When ETH moves from cold storage or long-term wallets onto centralized exchanges, it typically reflects a shift toward active positioning. Historically, this behavior has been a key input for assessing short- to medium-term supply–demand dynamics, as higher exchange balances increase the amount of ETH readily available for trading, hedging, or liquidation. However, the report stresses that rising exchange reserves do not automatically translate into immediate selling pressure. In many cases, large inflows are associated with risk management strategies rather than outright distribution. Institutional participants often move assets to exchanges to deploy them as collateral, rebalance exposure, or hedge downside risk through derivatives markets, particularly during periods of macro uncertainty and compressed price action. Still, the scale of December’s inflows stands out. Nearly 8.5 million ETH flowed into Binance over the month, marking the highest net inflows since 2023, with daily net inflows peaking above 162,000 ETH. Such volumes suggest the involvement of large players and point to a potential transition into a more volatile market phase. With Binance commanding a dominant share of Ethereum derivatives trading, this concentration of ETH on the exchange raises the probability of sharp price moves. Whether driven by spot selling or leveraged positioning, elevated exchange liquidity increases the market’s sensitivity to shifts in sentiment, making the current consolidation phase increasingly fragile. Related Reading: XRP Slides To $1.80 While Binance Reserves Continue To Decline Ethereum Price Compresses As Momentum Fades Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart reflects a market stuck in compression just below the $3,000 psychological level. After a sharp decline earlier in the month, ETH attempted several rebounds but consistently failed to reclaim higher ground, resulting in a tight range between roughly $2,900 and $3,100. This structure signals indecision rather than accumulation, with both buyers and sellers lacking conviction. Technically, Ethereum remains capped below its short- and medium-term moving averages. The 50-period and 100-period averages are acting as dynamic resistance, repeatedly rejecting upside attempts. Meanwhile, the 200-period moving average continues to slope downward, reinforcing the broader bearish trend. As long as ETH trades below these levels, rallies are likely to remain corrective rather than trend-changing. Related Reading: Chainlink Shows Strong Accumulation Signal: LINK Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Trading activity has steadily declined during the consolidation phase, indicating reduced participation and growing apathy. The absence of strong volume expansion on upside moves suggests that buyers are not aggressively stepping in, even near key support. Structurally, the $2,900–$2,950 zone is acting as short-term support, preventing deeper drawdowns for now. However, the longer ETH remains compressed below $3,000, the greater the risk of a volatility expansion. A decisive break above $3,100 would be required to shift momentum to the bullish side. Until then, Ethereum remains vulnerable to renewed downside pressure if broader market sentiment deteriorates.

This substantial release, valued at approximately $100 million at current prices, represents a scheduled event within Ripple’s well-documented and transparent supply management strategy. Consequently, market analysts and institutional investors are closely examining the potential implications for XRP liquidity, price stability, and corporate treasury operations. This event underscores the ongoing evolution of digital asset management within a complex regulatory landscape. Understanding the 200 Million XRP Unlock Ripple’s escrow mechanism is a foundational element of its XRP supply management. Initially, the company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of cryptographically secured escrow accounts. This action was designed to create predictable and transparent release schedules. Therefore, the recent 200 million XRP unlock is not an anomalous event but part of a pre-programmed, monthly distribution plan. The blockchain ledger provides immutable verification for this transaction. Each month, one billion XRP typically becomes available from these escrows. However, Ripple often returns a large portion of unused funds to new escrow contracts. This structured approach aims to mitigate concerns about market flooding from sudden, large supply injections. The Mechanics of Ripple’s Escrow System Ripple established its escrow system in late 2017 to provide predictability for the XRP ecosystem. The system functions through a series of smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. Every month, a contract expires and releases one billion XRP to Ripple. The company then utilizes a portion for operational needs, including: On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors for cross-border payments. Strategic partnerships and ecosystem development investments. General corporate treasury management and operational expenses. Historically, Ripple re-locks a significant majority of the released XRP into new escrow contracts. This practice effectively controls the net new supply entering the circulating market. For instance, data from previous quarters shows that Ripple often sells only a fraction of the released amount on the open market. The remainder is strategically re-escrowed. This disciplined process provides a clear audit trail and demonstrates a long-term commitment to supply stability. Historical Context and Market Impact Patterns Analyzing past escrow releases reveals important patterns for market behavior. Notably, the immediate market reaction to an escrow unlock is often muted. This is because the event is scheduled and anticipated by sophisticated traders. However, the medium-term impact depends heavily on Ripple’s subsequent actions with the unlocked funds. Market sentiment can shift based on whether the company signals increased selling pressure or strategic holding. For example, increased transfers to exchanges often precede short-term price volatility. Conversely, re-escrowing large portions can be interpreted as a bullish signal for long-term supply constraints. The table below illustrates a simplified comparison of recent quarterly escrow activities: Quarter XRP Released from Escrow XRP Re-escrowed Net New Circulating Supply Q3 2024 3.0 Billion ~2.4 Billion ~600 Million Q2 2024 3.0 Billion ~2.5 Billion ~500 Million Q1 2024 3.0 Billion ~2.55 Billion ~450 Million This data shows a consistent pattern of supply management. The 200 million XRP in the current report represents just one component of this monthly cycle. Consequently, analysts monitor the flow of these funds to ODL partners or treasury addresses rather than the unlock itself. The ultimate effect on the circulating supply hinges on these secondary movements. Expert Analysis on Liquidity and Institutional Strategy Industry observers emphasize the dual nature of such unlocks. Firstly, they provide essential liquidity for Ripple’s core business operations, particularly its ODL service. This service requires readily available XRP pools across global exchanges to facilitate instant cross-border settlements. Secondly, these events test market efficiency and maturity. A predictable, transparent supply schedule allows institutions to model risk more accurately. Experts from firms like Messari and CoinMetrics frequently note that Ripple’s escrow model offers a level of transparency rare in both traditional and crypto finance. Furthermore, the timing of this unlock occurs within a specific regulatory context. Following the conclusion of major litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ripple’s actions are scrutinized for compliance signals. The company’s disciplined escrow management supports its narrative of responsible corporate stewardship. It also differentiates XRP from cryptocurrencies with purely inflationary or unpredictable emission schedules. This structured approach can appeal to payment institutions and banks seeking reliable infrastructure. Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Sector The event highlights a growing trend toward transparent treasury management in blockchain projects. Other major crypto entities are now adopting similar public vesting schedules and quarterly reports. This shift responds directly to demands from institutional investors for clearer governance and supply controls. Moreover, the unlock underscores the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Whale Alert provide real-time visibility, enabling a more informed and efficient market. This transparency reduces information asymmetry and can decrease speculative volatility driven by rumors. Conclusion The unlock of 200 million XRP from Ripple’s escrow is a significant, yet scheduled, event in the digital asset’s economic calendar. It reflects a continued commitment to a transparent and predictable supply model. The real impact on the XRP market will depend not on the unlock itself, but on the subsequent allocation of these funds by Ripple’s treasury team. This process provides critical liquidity for global payment solutions while demonstrating a mature approach to asset management. As the cryptocurrency industry evolves, such structured mechanisms will likely become standard benchmarks for project credibility and institutional adoption. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when XRP is “unlocked from escrow”? It means XRP tokens previously held in a time-locked smart contract on the XRP Ledger have become accessible to Ripple. The company can now use these tokens for operations, partnerships, or sales, though it often re-locks a large percentage into new escrow contracts. Q2: Does this 200 million XRP unlock automatically increase selling pressure? Not automatically. The unlock increases Ripple’s available treasury, but selling pressure only materializes if Ripple transfers significant amounts to exchanges for sale. Historical data shows most unlocked XRP is typically re-escrowed, limiting immediate net new supply. Q3: How often do these XRP escrow unlocks happen? Ripple’s escrow system is programmed to release one billion XRP on the first day of each month. The 200 million figure reported may represent a portion of that monthly release that was moved to a different operational wallet. Q4: Why does Ripple use an escrow system? The escrow system was created to provide predictable supply release, assure the market that Ripple cannot dump its entire XRP holdings at once, and support long-term ecosystem health by aligning the company’s incentives with gradual, managed distribution. Q5: Where can I verify this XRP unlock transaction? All transactions on the XRP Ledger are public. You can verify the transaction by using the reported transaction hash from Whale Alert on any XRP Ledger explorer, such as Bithomp or XRPScan, which provide immutable, on-chain proof.

This substantial release represents approximately 0.5% of XRP’s total supply and continues Ripple’s established escrow management strategy that began in December 2017. Market observers immediately noted the transaction’s timing, coming during a period of increased regulatory clarity for digital assets in multiple jurisdictions. The unlock follows Ripple’s quarterly pattern of releasing 1 billion XRP from escrow, with 500 million typically returned to escrow shortly after. This systematic approach provides predictable supply management while supporting Ripple’s operational requirements and partnership development initiatives. Understanding Ripple’s XRP Escrow Strategy Ripple implemented its escrow strategy in December 2017 to address market concerns about XRP supply predictability. The company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow contracts, representing approximately 55% of the total 100 billion XRP supply created at the network’s inception. These contracts automatically release 1 billion XRP each month over 55 months. However, Ripple typically returns a substantial portion of each month’s release to new escrow contracts, creating a rolling escrow system. This mechanism provides several important benefits: Supply predictability: Markets can anticipate maximum monthly releases Operational flexibility: Ripple accesses XRP for business operations Transparency: All transactions are publicly visible on the XRP Ledger Long-term planning: The strategy extends through 2027 Historical data shows Ripple has consistently returned approximately 80% of released XRP to escrow over the past three years. Consequently, the net monthly increase in circulating supply typically ranges between 200-300 million XRP rather than the full 1 billion. This disciplined approach has helped stabilize supply concerns that previously affected XRP’s market perception. Market Impact and Historical Context Immediate market reactions to escrow releases have diminished significantly since 2018 as participants better understand the predictable nature of these transactions. Nevertheless, large XRP movements always warrant careful analysis. The 500 million XRP unlocked represents approximately $250 million at current market prices, though Ripple rarely liquidates substantial amounts immediately. Instead, the company typically allocates released XRP across several strategic areas: Allocation Area Typical Percentage Purpose New Escrow Contracts ~80% Future supply management On-Demand Liquidity ~10% Cross-border payment solutions Partner Incentives ~5% Ecosystem development Operational Expenses ~5% Company operations and development Market analysts note that actual selling pressure remains minimal because Ripple strategically manages its XRP distributions. The company’s quarterly markets reports consistently show that programmatic sales and over-the-counter transactions represent only a fraction of released amounts. Furthermore, Ripple’s increasing adoption of XRP for its On-Demand Liquidity product creates natural demand that partially offsets new supply. This balanced approach has evolved significantly since early 2018 when less predictable releases sometimes created market volatility. Expert Perspectives on Escrow Management Blockchain analysts emphasize that Ripple’s escrow strategy represents one of cryptocurrency’s most transparent supply management systems. Unlike proof-of-work mining that introduces new coins through energy-intensive processes, or proof-of-stake systems that distribute rewards to validators, Ripple’s approach provides complete predictability. Industry observers particularly appreciate the public verifiability of all escrow transactions on the XRP Ledger. This transparency allows any market participant to monitor releases in real-time, reducing information asymmetry. Financial institutions considering XRP adoption frequently cite this predictable supply schedule as a favorable characteristic compared to assets with less transparent issuance mechanisms. The system’s design also includes automatic return of unused XRP to escrow, creating a circular supply management model unique among major digital assets. Regulatory Considerations and Institutional Adoption The timing of this escrow release coincides with evolving regulatory frameworks for digital assets in major markets. Recent developments in the United States, European Union, and Asia have created clearer guidelines for institutional cryptocurrency engagement. Ripple’s transparent escrow management aligns well with regulatory expectations for disclosure and predictability. Institutional adoption of XRP for cross-border payments continues growing, with Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product processing billions in transactions quarterly. This real-world utility creates organic demand that interacts with supply releases. Financial technology experts note that predictable supply mechanisms become increasingly important as institutional participation grows. Large financial entities typically prefer assets with transparent issuance schedules and minimal supply surprises. Ripple’s escrow system directly addresses these preferences through its mathematically predictable release schedule and public verification capabilities. Technical Implementation and Network Effects The XRP Ledger’s technical capabilities enable Ripple’s escrow strategy through its built-in escrow feature. This native functionality allows users to lock XRP until specific conditions occur, typically a time-based release. The feature supports both time-based and condition-based releases, though Ripple utilizes the time-based approach for its supply management. Network validators process these transactions identically to other XRP Ledger transactions, maintaining the network’s decentralization. The escrow feature’s existence predates Ripple’s supply management strategy, demonstrating the XRP Ledger’s flexibility for various financial applications. This technical foundation supports not only Ripple’s corporate strategy but also enables escrow applications for individual users and businesses. The feature’s reliability has been proven through thousands of successful escrow transactions since its implementation, creating confidence in its security and predictability. Comparative Analysis with Other Digital Assets Ripple’s escrow approach differs significantly from supply mechanisms employed by other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s predetermined mining schedule introduces new coins through computational work, with halving events reducing issuance every four years. Ethereum transitioned from mining to staking rewards with its move to proof-of-stake consensus. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC maintain supplies pegged to reserve assets, adjusting based on market demand. XRP’s escrow system provides unique advantages in transparency and predictability while presenting different characteristics. Market analysts frequently compare these mechanisms when assessing long-term supply dynamics. Each approach reflects different philosophical foundations and practical requirements. Ripple’s method particularly suits institutional use cases where predictability and auditability provide significant advantages for financial planning and risk management. Conclusion Ripple’s release of 500 million XRP from escrow continues the company’s established supply management strategy implemented in 2017. This systematic approach provides market predictability while supporting Ripple’s business operations and ecosystem development. The XRP unlock represents standard procedure within Ripple’s transparent escrow framework rather than exceptional market activity. Historical patterns suggest most released XRP will return to new escrow contracts, maintaining the circular supply management model. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional adoption grows, transparent supply mechanisms like Ripple’s escrow system gain increasing importance. The XRP Ledger’s native escrow functionality enables this predictable approach while serving broader user needs. Market participants now understand these releases as routine events within a well-documented supply management strategy that supports XRP’s utility in global payments and financial applications. FAQs Q1: How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow? Ripple’s escrow contracts automatically release 1 billion XRP monthly, though the company typically returns approximately 80% to new escrow contracts, resulting in a net monthly increase of 200-300 million XRP in circulating supply. Q2: Does Ripple immediately sell XRP released from escrow? No, Ripple strategically allocates released XRP across multiple purposes including new escrow contracts, On-Demand Liquidity operations, partner incentives, and operational expenses, with only a portion entering markets through programmatic sales. Q3: How does Ripple’s escrow strategy affect XRP’s price? Market impacts have diminished as participants understand the predictable nature of releases. The transparent schedule reduces uncertainty, though large transactions can temporarily affect market dynamics depending on broader conditions. Q4: Can the public verify Ripple’s escrow transactions? Yes, all XRP Ledger transactions are publicly visible. Anyone can monitor escrow releases and returns using blockchain explorers or services like Whale Alert that report large transactions. Q5: When will Ripple’s escrow strategy conclude? The current escrow contracts extend through 2027, though Ripple may implement new supply management strategies as the final contracts approach expiration based on then-current market conditions and business requirements.

Understanding Ripple’s XRP Escrow Mechanism Ripple implemented its escrow system in December 2017 to address market concerns about XRP supply predictability. The company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow accounts, representing approximately 55% of the total 100 billion XRP created at the network’s inception. Consequently, this structured approach releases 1 billion XRP each month over 55 months. However, Ripple typically returns unutilized portions to escrow, extending the release schedule. This systematic process provides transparency about XRP’s circulating supply while preventing market flooding. The escrow system functions through smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. These contracts automatically execute according to predetermined schedules. Monthly, 1 billion XRP becomes available to Ripple. The company then utilizes portions for operational needs, including: On-demand liquidity solutions for financial institutions Strategic partnerships and ecosystem development Market development initiatives and infrastructure investments Employee compensation programs and operational expenses Unused XRP returns to escrow each month, typically within the first week. This creates a predictable supply schedule that market participants can analyze. The 300 million XRP release represents a substantial portion of January’s available escrow allocation, indicating potential increased operational requirements or strategic deployments. Historical Context of XRP Escrow Releases Ripple’s escrow releases follow established patterns that market analysts closely monitor. Historical data reveals that the company has consistently returned significant portions of monthly releases to escrow, often between 700-900 million XRP monthly. Therefore, a 300 million XRP utilization represents an above-average monthly deployment when compared to recent historical averages. Recent XRP Escrow Utilization Patterns Month Total Released Amount Utilized Percentage Returned December 2024 1 billion 200 million 80% November 2024 1 billion 250 million 75% October 2024 1 billion 180 million 82% September 2024 1 billion 220 million 78% Market analysts examine these patterns to understand Ripple’s operational tempo and strategic direction. The 300 million XRP utilization in January 2025 suggests potential acceleration in partnership deployments or institutional adoption initiatives. Furthermore, blockchain transparency allows real-time tracking of these movements, providing unprecedented visibility into corporate cryptocurrency management practices. Market Impact and Price Considerations Cryptocurrency markets typically respond to substantial token movements, especially when involving significant portions of circulating supply. XRP’s current circulating supply stands at approximately 54 billion tokens, making this 300 million XRP release equivalent to about 0.55% of circulating supply. While not enormous in percentage terms, the absolute size warrants attention from institutional traders and long-term holders. Historical price analysis reveals mixed reactions to escrow releases. Sometimes markets anticipate these scheduled events, resulting in minimal price disruption. Other times, unexpected utilization patterns trigger volatility. Several factors influence market response: Transparency of destination wallets and intended use cases Overall market conditions and cryptocurrency sector sentiment Ripple’s communication regarding strategic initiatives Regulatory developments affecting XRP’s legal status Blockchain analytics firms like Whale Alert provide crucial surveillance capabilities. Their automated systems detect large transactions across multiple blockchain networks. This transparency enables market participants to make informed decisions based on verifiable on-chain data rather than speculation. Institutional Adoption and Real-World Utility Ripple’s primary value proposition centers on facilitating cross-border payments for financial institutions. The company’s RippleNet network utilizes XRP as a bridge currency in its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution. This product enables instant settlement of cross-border transactions while reducing liquidity costs for participating institutions. The 300 million XRP release potentially supports expansion of ODL corridors or new partnership implementations. Recent years have seen growing institutional adoption, with financial institutions across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East implementing Ripple’s solutions. Each new corridor requires XRP liquidity to facilitate efficient currency exchanges. Regulatory clarity remains crucial for broader adoption. The ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulations globally affects institutional participation rates. Clear regulatory frameworks typically encourage financial institutions to explore blockchain solutions more aggressively. Consequently, regulatory developments directly influence Ripple’s strategic deployment of escrowed XRP. Expert Perspectives on Escrow Management Blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of transparent supply management in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Predictable release schedules reduce uncertainty for investors and users. Ripple’s escrow system represents one of the most structured approaches to supply management among major cryptocurrency projects. Industry observers note that regular escrow returns demonstrate disciplined management. By consistently returning unused XRP, Ripple signals commitment to long-term ecosystem health rather than short-term market manipulation. This approach builds trust with institutional partners who require stability for operational planning. Comparative analysis with other cryptocurrency projects reveals varying approaches to token distribution. Some projects employ vesting schedules for team allocations. Others utilize gradual release mechanisms for treasury funds. Ripple’s escrow system stands out for its transparency and predictability, setting standards for corporate cryptocurrency management. Conclusion Ripple’s release of 300 million XRP from escrow represents a significant development in cryptocurrency markets, reflecting potential acceleration in institutional adoption initiatives. The structured escrow system provides transparency about XRP supply management while supporting Ripple’s operational requirements. Market participants will monitor subsequent wallet movements to gauge strategic deployment patterns. This XRP unlocked event underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency markets, where transparent supply mechanisms and predictable release schedules increasingly influence institutional participation and market stability. FAQs Q1: What does “XRP unlocked from escrow” mean? Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow accounts with scheduled monthly releases. “Unlocked” means these tokens have become available for Ripple’s use according to predetermined smart contract terms. Q2: How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow? Ripple’s escrow contracts make 1 billion XRP available monthly. The company typically utilizes a portion for operations and returns the remainder to extended escrow contracts. Q3: Does XRP escrow release affect cryptocurrency prices? Market impact varies based on utilization patterns and overall conditions. Transparent scheduling often reduces surprise effects, but substantial utilization can influence supply perceptions. Q4: Where can I track XRP escrow releases? Blockchain analytics platforms like Whale Alert monitor large transactions. The XRP Ledger provides public transaction data that anyone can examine through various explorers. Q5: What happens to unused XRP each month? Ripple typically returns unused portions to new escrow contracts, extending the release schedule. This practice maintains supply predictability and demonstrates disciplined management.

This critical benchmark, published by data provider Alternative.me, fell one point from the previous day, reflecting heightened anxiety across digital asset exchanges. The index serves as a crucial barometer, quantifying the emotional pulse of the market where a score approaching 0 indicates maximum fear and a score nearing 100 signals unchecked greed. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mechanics The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a composite snapshot of market psychology through a multifaceted calculation. Analysts derive its value from six distinct data sources, each weighted to paint an accurate picture. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score, acting as primary indicators of trader nervousness and capital movement. Social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%, capturing the narrative and crowd psychology surrounding major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Furthermore, the index incorporates Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%) and trends in Google search volume for cryptocurrency terms (10%). This methodology ensures the index reflects both on-chain activity and mainstream interest. When these components collectively trend downward, as they have recently, the index plunges into fear zones. Consequently, a score of 20 represents a market where caution overwhelmingly dominates speculative enthusiasm. Historical Context and Market Parallels Examining historical data reveals the significance of the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading. The index famously hit single-digit levels during major capitulation events, such as the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020 and the collapse of the FTX exchange in November 2022. While the current level of 20 remains above those historic lows, it consistently correlates with periods of significant price consolidation and reduced trading activity. Market analysts often reference these phases as potential accumulation zones for long-term investors, though they caution that extreme fear can persist and deepen. For instance, prolonged periods in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone throughout 2022 preceded further substantial market declines. Therefore, this metric functions not as a timing tool but as a contextual gauge of emotional extremes. The current decline to 20 follows a gradual descent from a ‘Neutral’ reading earlier in the quarter, tracked alongside declining Bitcoin prices and rising macroeconomic uncertainties. Expert Analysis on Sentiment Indicators Financial researchers emphasize that sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index are contrarian signals at their extremes. “Historically, sustained periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries, as weak hands are shaken out,” notes Dr. Lena Vance, a behavioral finance economist at the Global Digital Asset Research Institute. “However, the index is a lagging composite. Investors must cross-reference it with on-chain fundamentals, such as exchange net flows and holder distribution, to avoid false signals.” Data from blockchain analytics firms shows a corresponding trend: an increase in coins moving to long-term storage addresses, suggesting some investors are using the fear-driven price dip to accumulate assets. This on-chain activity provides a nuanced layer to the raw sentiment score, indicating that while retail sentiment is fearful, strategic actors may see opportunity. Component Breakdown and Recent Drivers The recent drop to 20 stems from negative movements across several of the index’s core components. Firstly, volatility has spiked due to unexpected regulatory announcements in several jurisdictions, contributing heavily to the fear score. Secondly, social media analysis shows a measurable increase in negative commentary and fear-driven keywords across platforms like X and Reddit. The following table summarizes the index’s weighting and recent directional pressure: Component Weight Recent Trend (Contributing to Fear) Volatility 25% Sharply Increased Market Volume 25% Declining / Stagnant Social Media 15% Overwhelmingly Negative Surveys 15% Pessimistic Outlook BTC Dominance 10% Rising (Flight to ‘Safety’) Search Trends 10% Queries for ‘Crypto Crash’ Up This confluence of factors creates a self-reinforcing cycle. Negative price action fuels fearful social media posts, which in turn influences survey respondents and may deter new capital, reducing volume. The rising Bitcoin dominance specifically highlights a flight to the perceived relative stability of the largest cryptocurrency amid fear in the broader altcoin market. Potential Implications for Traders and the Market An ‘Extreme Fear’ reading carries several practical implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it often signals a high-risk environment where emotional decision-making can lead to selling at a loss. For institutional players, it may trigger rebalancing of portfolios or the activation of dollar-cost averaging strategies. The market impact typically manifests in specific ways: Reduced Liquidity: Trading volumes often contract as participants move to the sidelines. Increased Correlation: Cryptocurrencies may move more in lockstep with traditional risk-off assets. Opportunistic Accumulation: Data shows large holders (‘whales’) sometimes increase buy orders during fear phases. Media Narrative Shift: News coverage tends to focus on losses and risks, amplifying the fear sentiment. It is crucial to remember that the index measures current sentiment, not future price. While extreme fear can indicate a local bottom, it does not guarantee an immediate reversal. Markets can remain irrational and fearful far longer than investors can remain solvent, as the old adage warns. Therefore, using this index requires combining it with fundamental technical and on-chain analysis. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s descent to a score of 20 provides a clear, quantitative measure of the ‘Extreme Fear’ gripping cryptocurrency investors. This sentiment, derived from volatility, volume, social data, and search trends, reflects the current cautious and risk-averse posture of the market. While historically such extremes have sometimes marked points of opportunity, they primarily serve as a warning about prevailing market psychology. Investors and observers should monitor whether subsequent data shows a stabilization or further decline in the index, as it will offer critical insight into whether the market is finding a floor or bracing for continued uncertainty. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an essential tool for contextualizing price action within the powerful framework of collective market emotion. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 20 mean? A score of 20 falls within the ‘Extreme Fear’ range (0-25). It indicates that current market data—like volatility, social media sentiment, and trading volume—collectively reflects very high levels of investor anxiety and risk aversion. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and published by the data platform Alternative.me. It is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q3: Is the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone a good time to buy cryptocurrency? While some contrarian investors view extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity, it is not a standalone signal. Historically, prices can fall further even when fear is high. Any investment decision should be based on comprehensive research, risk tolerance, and a long-term strategy, not just sentiment indicators. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s market dominance affect the Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s share of the total crypto market cap) accounts for 10% of the index. A rising dominance often occurs during fear periods as investors sell riskier altcoins and potentially move into Bitcoin, which is perceived as more established. This trend can push the index further into fear territory. Q5: Can the Fear & Greed Index predict market crashes or rallies? The index is not a predictive tool. It is a descriptive metric that quantifies current sentiment. It can identify when sentiment is at an extreme, which has sometimes preceded trend changes, but it does not cause or reliably predict those changes. It should be used alongside other forms of market and fundamental analysis.

In a post shared Tuesday on X, Wine warned that authorities could again restrict connectivity to disrupt coordination, limit information sharing, and prevent independent verification of election results. Uganda cut access to social media and messaging platforms during the 2021 election, a move that drew criticism from civil society groups and international observers. Wine’s message reflects growing concern among opposition groups that digital controls will play a central role in the upcoming vote, as political tensions rise and campaign activity intensifies across the country. Internet shutdown fears revive offline messaging strategy The app highlighted by Wine, called Bitcha t, is designed to operate without internet access or centralized servers. Instead, it relies on Bluetooth-based mesh networking, allowing nearby devices to relay messages between users. According to Wine, this setup could allow rapid communication even if mobile data and broadband services are disabled. Wine said users could share photos of polling station declaration of results forms, commonly known as DR forms, as well as other election-related material. He stressed that the app does not require phone numbers or email addresses, a feature intended to reduce traceability and protect user identity during periods of heightened surveillance. The call to adopt offline tools comes as Uganda prepares for a closely watched election. President Yoweri Museveni has ruled the country for nearly four decades, while Wine has emerged as the most prominent opposition challenger since entering politics from music and activism. Decentralization echoes broader crypto era themes While Bitchat is not a cryptocurrency product, Wine’s appeal taps into a wider global shift toward decentralized technologies. In recent years, activists worldwide have increasingly explored peer-to-peer tools inspired by blockchain-era principles such as censorship resistance and reduced reliance on central intermediaries. Uganda has seen growing interest in crypto assets and decentralized finance, particularly among younger users seeking alternatives to traditional systems. Analysts note that election-period messaging tools now borrow concepts from the same decentralization playbook, even when they are not blockchain-based. By urging early downloads, Wine framed preparation as critical before any potential shutdown occurs. His message underscored a broader reality facing elections in restrictive digital environments: as governments tighten control over networks, political movements continue to adapt by turning to decentralized communication channels.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 00:46:43

The historical rise of Cardano during 2020-2021 is one obvious example of how investors who entered during the right time stood to gain unusually high returns. Currently, investors are looking for a new cryptocurrency that will replicate this kind of rise, but this time in a vastly different market setting. As Mutuum Finance continues into the latter stages of presale and adoption rates pick up speed, comparisons are being drawn on the possible upside relative to past cycle leaders. For those researching the best cryptocurrency to invest in, new ROI models based on sound precedent are being built. Mutuum Finance Presale Trend This historical framework has been extended to Mutuum Finance , which is a new cryptocurrency being marketed at the intersection of DeFi lending and early price discovery. At present, the presale has entered Phase 7 and the momentum continues to increase. Mutuum Finance has confirmed that a total of $19,500,000 has been raised since the presale started, and there are now 18,620 total MUTM token holders. Currently, Phase 7 costs only $0.04, which reflects a 300% premium over the original entry price of Phase 1 at $0.01. Phase 7 will soon sell out completely and will initiate Phase 8 at $0.045 with a 20% premium to illustrate why Mutuum Finance has emerged within the ranks of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now, given that all subsequent prices will reset to a higher rate. Apart from this, Mutuum is further optimizing engagement through its newly launched dashboard that showcases the leaderboard of the current Top 50 holders. The 24-hour leaderboard rewards the #1 ranked person in the list for that day with a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as at least one transaction takes place in the given duration, which renews at 00:00 UTC. From a foundational standpoint, confidence is also reinforced by the developments in security. The Halborn Security Code Review of Mutuum’s lending and borrowing contracts has concluded, and the codes have been finalized and reviewed. The development traction is also moving forward with V1 protocol deployment on Sepolia Testnet, according to the announcement. The following key components of the platform will be deployed: Liquidity Pools, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot with initial assets being ETH and USDT. Together with the ongoing prize giveaway worth $100,000, these updates heighten the activity level among the yet undecided. With a launch price set at $0.06, existing investors are poised for an ROI gain as high as 420% following the launch, which is the reason why some analysts consider MUTM the next crypto to explode and a serious contender when considering the purchase of the best cryptocurrency. What Makes Timing Increasingly Important With the availability of Phase 7 growing tighter, the opportunity to obtain a $0.04 price and contribute to the growing base of locked-in liquidity is becoming increasingly time-sensitive. As a strategic entry point for investors looking for a proving ground for an asymmetric opportunity in a new cryptocurrency coin, Mutuum Finance is becoming less of an and then and more of an if not now, as it emerges as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.

56668981,650487,1767229236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56668981.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Stress Isn’t Over: Short-Term Holders Remain Underwater,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-stress-isnt-over-short-term-holders/,"Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $88,000 level, yet it continues to struggle below the key $90,000 threshold, failing to sustain any meaningful breakout since early December. Despite several recovery attempts, upside momentum remains weak, reinforcing a broader sense of indecision across the market. As fear and apathy dominate investor behavior, a growing number of analysts are now openly calling for a bear market to unfold in 2026, arguing that the current structure lacks the conditions needed for a renewed bullish phase. This cautious outlook is reinforced by on-chain data shared by top analyst Axel Adler. According to his latest report, short-term holders (STHs) are firmly underwater, with Bitcoin trading well below their average cost basis. The STH Realized Price continues to trend lower, a signal that new demand entering the market is weak and increasingly price-insensitive. Adler notes that this environment reflects pressure from above rather than outright capitulation. While sellers are active, the market has not yet reached the type of forced liquidation typically associated with cycle lows. Instead, Bitcoin appears trapped in a prolonged stress regime, where confidence erodes gradually and rallies are sold into rather than followed through. Until short-term holder profitability improves, sentiment is likely to remain constrained. Short-Term Holder Stress Persists Adler’s latest analysis of Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price highlights why Bitcoin remains locked in a stress regime despite recent attempts to stabilize. The chart compares BTC price with the STH Realized Price—the average cost basis of coins held for less than 155 days—alongside stress indicators and weekly changes in that cost basis. In this framework, the black line represents Bitcoin’s market price, while the orange line tracks the STH Realized Price. Additional overlays, including the STH Stress Score and weekly percentage changes, help contextualize shifts in short-term positioning. According to Adler, Bitcoin has traded consistently below the STH Realized Price since October 17, confirming that stress mode remains active. The weekly change in STH Realized Price has stayed in negative territory and recently reached local lows, signaling that short-term holders continue to redistribute coins at lower prices rather than accumulate at higher levels. This behavior reflects weak incoming demand and reinforces overhead pressure. Price performance across timeframes remains mixed. While Bitcoin has shown modest stabilization over shorter horizons—up roughly 0.9% on the week and 2.3% on the month—the broader picture remains fragile. The 90-day performance is deeply negative at −26.7%, indicating that stress dominates across all major timeframes. Adler’s forecast model points to continued downside pressure, with an expected weekly decline of around 3% if current conditions persist. Crucially, the declining STH Realized Price lowers the resistance “ceiling,” reducing the distance required to return to healthier conditions. However, it also underscores persistent weakness in new demand. A meaningful improvement would require the STH Realized Price to stabilize and turn higher while Bitcoin holds current price levels. Bitcoin Holds Structure But Remains Capped Below Resistance The weekly Bitcoin chart highlights a market caught between long-term structural support and persistent overhead resistance. BTC is trading near the $88,000–$89,000 zone, a level that has acted as a pivot since late November. While price has managed to reclaim this area, it has repeatedly failed to sustain a breakout above $90,000, signaling hesitation rather than renewed bullish momentum. From a trend perspective, Bitcoin remains above its 200-week moving average, which continues to slope upward and currently sits well below price, preserving the broader bullish market structure. The 100-week moving average is also rising and has provided dynamic support during recent pullbacks, reinforcing the idea that long-term buyers are still defending key levels. However, the 50-week moving average has flattened and now acts as immediate resistance, aligning with the broader supply zone between $90,000 and $95,000. After a surge in activity during the sharp correction from October highs, recent weeks show declining volume, suggesting reduced participation and growing apathy among market participants. This environment often precedes a directional move but does not yet favor a clear upside resolution. Technically, as long as Bitcoin holds above the rising 100-week moving average, downside risk appears structurally contained. However, failure to reclaim the 50-week average keeps the market vulnerable to extended consolidation or a deeper corrective phase before any sustainable recovery can develop.

Gold has climbed 9% since early November, the S&P 500 is up 1%, and Bitcoin is down about 20%, trading near $88,000 as of Wednesday. Based on reports, that gap has left crypto quieter while other markets show modest rebounds. Related Reading: Crypto Headed For A $10 Trillion Future? Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key Whale Accumulation Signals Santiment’s data points to a split in behavior among holders. Small wallets were busy buying in the second half of 2025, while large wallets largely held steady and sold after pushing up to October’s all-time high. Large holders are often treated as market movers, so their cautious posture has kept pressure on prices. Historically, a shift where big holders start buying while retail eases off has marked real trend shifts, but that condition is not fully obvious yet. 📊 The correlation between Bitcoin & crypto compared to other major sectors is still lagging behind. Since November began, price performances are: 🥇 Gold: +9% 🏦 S&P 500: +1% 🪙 Bitcoin: -20% 🤞 Heading to 2026, there will remain an opportunity for crypto to play “catch up”. pic.twitter.com/FW8JaQboTV — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 30, 2025 On-Chain Data Mixed Reports note some signs of stabilization. Long-term Bitcoin holders trimmed holdings from 14.8 million coins in mid-July to 14.3 million by December, then paused further selling. Active Bitcoin addresses rose 5.51% in the last 24 hours, yet transactions fell almost 30% over the same window. That mismatch suggests more people are watching the market, while fewer are committing funds. The raw numbers show interest, but not a clear shift back to broad trading activity. Market Voices Weigh In Garrett Jin, who once ran exchange BitForex, said traders are already reallocating capital, arguing that money moves from one market to another when opportunities appear. Capital is the same and as always, it is wise to sell high and buy low, Jin wrote, according to posts on social channels. Another analyst, CyrilXBT, described the current setup as late-cycle positioning before a possible rotation: when liquidity turns, gold could cool, Bitcoin might lead, and other tokens could follow. Bitcoin right now continues to look just like the 2016-2017 period, just before a parabolic move. These two setups continue to flash in our mind due to the extreme similarities and bullish signals are even holding & flashing here too.$BTC‘s looking ready to absolutely GO 🚀… pic.twitter.com/H1hInYwix8 — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 30, 2025 Price Calls And Technical Views Technical commentators remain split. Javon Marks has pointed to parabolic patterns in Bitcoin’s chart that echo the 2016–2017 build-up and continues to forecast a rally toward $125K. Based on CoinCodex data, a more modest move is expected first: the platform forecasts BTC could reach $91,500 by January 30, 2026, a rise of 3.68% from current levels. Related Reading: Crypto Policy In The Hot Seat As US Lawmaker Calls SEC Hearing CoinCodex lists sentiment as bearish and the Fear & Greed Index at 23 (Extreme Fear). The site also notes Bitcoin had 15/30 green days and 2.11% volatility over the past 30 days, with the last update on Dec 31, 2025. Short-term traders should focus on whether large wallets resume buying in volume, and whether transactions pick up alongside rising active addresses. If whales start accumulating again while long-term holders stop reducing positions, that combination would give a stronger signal than either metric alone. In the meantime, reports point to stabilization rather than a confirmed reversal, leaving room for a catch-up move in 2026 if liquidity and sentiment turn.

According to reports, the firm stopped its daily purchases on December 4, 2025, and will hold the coins it already owns rather than add more. The company still retains roughly 510 BTC on its books. The move comes after a stretch of weak crypto markets and a recent $48 million equity raise that executives say will be used to back its consumer health brand. Prenetics Halts Daily Bitcoin Buying According to Bloomberg and other news outlets, Prenetics had been testing a treasury approach similar to models used by other public firms that purchased Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The company began accumulating Bitcoin earlier in 2025, but management signaled a change in course as market conditions grew harder. Reports have disclosed that the board and leadership looked at the math and decided pausing purchases would better protect cash and shareholder value while preserving the existing crypto holding. IM8 Growth Takes Center Stage Based on reports , a large part of the shift is driven by the rapid growth of IM8, Prenetics’ consumer health and nutrition brand co-founded with Beckham. The company has said IM8 reached over $100 million in annualized recurring revenue within 11 months of operations. Management has also provided guidance that IM8 could generate about $180 million–$200 million in revenue in fiscal 2026, numbers that have helped persuade investors the business can stand on its own. The $48 million round completed in October 2025 was seen as funding to both back IM8 expansion and to support the earlier Bitcoin plan; now the emphasis is being redirected. Market Reaction Shares of Prenetics have shown relative stability even after the announcement, reflecting some investor support for the health business strategy. Analysts and market watchers say the company’s decision mirrors a wider reassessment among several firms that had adopted crypto treasury strategies earlier in the year. Where some companies doubled down, others chose caution as Bitcoin fell from its highs and volatility persisted. Reports point out that holding the existing 510 BTC lets Prenetics keep potential upside without committing fresh capital while it focuses on product growth.

Analyst Makes The Case,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-risk-drop-to-0-80-analyst-makes-case/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how XRP could be at risk of a drop toward $0.80 based on the data of some on-chain indicators. XRP Has Seen Bearish Developments In On-Chain Data In a new thread on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about why XRP may be at risk of seeing a decline to the $0.80 level. “First, network activity has cooled sharply,” noted Martinez. There are many ways to gauge network activity, but the analyst has used the Active Addresses on-chain indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium At Rare Discount As US Demand Weakens This metric keeps track of the total number of addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain every day. A chart shared by the analyst earlier showed a drawdown in this metric for XRP. Generally, a decline in the metric is a sign of a drop in interest around the asset. “Daily active addresses have fallen to roughly 38,500, pointing to fading participation and interest,” said Martinez. Another on-chain indicator has also shown a development recently: the supply held by the whales. Whales refer to the big-money investors of the market who carry significant amounts in their wallets. As the below chart shows, these investors participated in selling of about 40 million tokens recently. Due to the massive size of their holdings, whales are considered to be influential entities on the network, so their behavior could be relevant for the cryptocurrency. As these massive hands have been selling on the XRP blockchain recently, it’s possible that the coin could feel a bearish effect. If nothing else, the trend reflects that the asset’s key investors are showing weaker confidence. Finally, the analyst has shared a chart for the cryptocurrency’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). This indicator basically tells us about the amount of supply that investors last purchased at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. From the chart, it’s visible that a notable amount of supply has its cost basis at the $1.77 level, which isn’t too far below the current XRP spot price. It’s possible that if the asset retests this level, these investors who purchased there could show some kind of reaction. When the market mood is bullish, this reaction tends to be dominated by buying. Given the current sentiment in the digital asset sector, however, the support may not be sufficient. “If selling pressure continues, XRP risks losing the $1.77 support,” explained Martinez. “A breakdown there opens the door to the next major support zone near $0.80.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? This support zone near $0.80 is currently the largest demand zone beyond the $1.77 level. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $1.86, unchanged from one week ago.

Judge Roy K. Altman of the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida said in an order dated Friday that the plaintiffs failed to establish personal jurisdiction over Cuban and the team, and the court lacked a sufficient connection between Florida and the alleged promotion. Cuban’s Personal Investment Remarks Drew Legal Scrutiny The suit, filed in 2022, argued that Cuban pushed fans toward Voyager’s interest-bearing accounts after he said at an Oct. 2021 Mavericks news conference that he had personally invested in the company. It also pointed to a Mavericks post that offered $100 in Bitcoin to customers who downloaded Voyager’s app, opened an account, deposited $100, and made one trade. Cuban’s lawyers argued the Florida court had no jurisdiction over Cuban or the team, and said he warned people to be careful with their money. Voyager Once Held Billions Before 2022 Bankruptcy Brown Rudnick, which represented Cuban and the Mavericks, said Judge Altman dismissed the case without prejudice after years of litigation and jurisdictional discovery, adding that nationwide promotions did not amount to purposeful targeting of Florida residents under the state’s long arm statute and due process limits. “We couldn’t be more pleased with the absolute right result,” Steve Best, lead counsel for Cuban and the Mavericks, reportedly told ESPN . “I suspect that the plaintiffs will consider filing in another jurisdiction. … I look forward to defending Mark and the Mavericks in any jurisdiction in this country. “Mark doesn’t settle when he believes he is on the right side of the law.” The case sits within a broader wave of lawsuits aimed at athletes and celebrities who promoted crypto platforms that later failed, including Voyager, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Voyager reportedly held more than $5B in assets in 2021 and counted nearly 3.5M investors before its collapse. Cuban has since sold his majority stake in the Mavericks to casino magnate Miriam Adelson.

The CFTC said on Dec. 31 that Chairman Michael S. Selig appointed Zaidi to the role , after Zaidi spent nearly a decade at the agency before leaving for the private sector. “Amir brings to this role deep experience both at the Commission and in the financial services world,” Selig said, linking Zaidi’s track record to the agency’s push to shape new rules for digital asset markets. . @CFTC Chairman Selig Announces Amir Zaidi as Chief of Staff: https://t.co/Y5aoBVqVWo — CFTC (@CFTC) December 31, 2025 From Market Oversight Chief To Bitcoin Futures Architect Zaidi worked at the CFTC from 2010 to 2019, and he most recently led the Division of Market Oversight, where the agency said he oversaw the certification and deployment of the first federally regulated crypto product, Bitcoin futures . That moment traces back to late 2017, when the CFTC said CME and Cboe Futures Exchange self-certified new Bitcoin futures contracts, opening a path for US-listed trading days later. After leaving government, Zaidi became global head of compliance at broker-dealer TP ICAP, a role the firm announced in 2019 after his tenure at the CFTC. New Chief Of Staff Arrives As Policy Direction Shifts “I am excited to return to the CFTC and thank Chairman Selig for appointing me to this important role,” Zaidi said, adding that he plans to help carry out the chairman’s pro innovation agenda as derivatives markets evolve. Zaidi’s return lands days after Selig was sworn in as the 16th CFTC chairman, following a Trump nomination in October and Senate confirmation on Dec. 18. Selig has framed the moment as a shift from regulation by enforcement toward clearer rules, and his agency has already moved deeper into crypto plumbing, including steps that have put regulated US venues closer to spot style crypto trading. For crypto markets, the staffing move is another signal that the CFTC expects to sit near the centre of US market structure talks in 2026, with Selig pointing to digital asset legislation moving toward President Trump’s desk and a bigger push to keep crypto activity onshore.

56670432,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257814,1767236111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"ETF Flows Reveal Alarming Lack of New Demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Glassnode Reports",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/etf-flows-show-no-demand-glassnode/,"BitcoinWorld ETF Flows Reveal Alarming Lack of New Demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Glassnode Reports Recent data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode delivers a sobering assessment of cryptocurrency market dynamics: ETF flows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to show no signs of new demand entering the market. The firm’s latest analysis, published this week, reveals that the 30-day moving average of net flows for these flagship digital assets remains firmly in negative territory. This persistent trend raises important questions about current market sentiment and the immediate trajectory for cryptocurrency investments. Market analysts globally are now scrutinizing these ETF flow patterns to understand their broader implications. ETF Flows Demonstrate Persistent Market Caution Glassnode’s comprehensive analysis examines exchange-traded fund movements with particular attention to timing and volume. The firm tracks daily inflows and outflows across major ETF products, then calculates rolling averages to identify underlying trends. Consequently, their methodology filters out short-term volatility to reveal sustained directional movements. The resulting data clearly shows negative net flows persisting beyond temporary market fluctuations. This pattern suggests institutional and retail investors maintain a cautious approach despite recent price movements. Furthermore, the consistency across both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs indicates a sector-wide phenomenon rather than asset-specific concerns. Several factors potentially contribute to this ongoing trend. Regulatory developments continue to create uncertainty in major markets. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions influence traditional investment allocations. The data also reflects seasonal patterns observed in previous years. Glassnode’s report emphasizes that negative flows don’t necessarily predict price declines. However, they do indicate reduced buying pressure from ETF channels. Market participants should therefore consider these flows alongside other indicators like on-chain activity and derivatives positioning. Understanding the 30-Day Moving Average Metric Glassnode employs the 30-day moving average as their primary analytical tool for ETF flows. This statistical approach smooths daily variations to highlight underlying trends. Essentially, it calculates the average net flow over the previous thirty days, updating each day with the latest figure. A negative value indicates more money has exited than entered ETF products during that period. The moving average’s persistence below zero demonstrates trend strength rather than isolated daily events. This methodology provides clearer signals than raw daily data, which often contains noise from large individual transactions. The table below illustrates hypothetical flow patterns over a recent period: Week Bitcoin ETF Net Flow Ethereum ETF Net Flow 30-Day Average Trend Week 1 -$42M -$18M Negative Week 2 -$38M -$22M Negative Week 3 +$15M -$10M Negative Week 4 -$50M -$25M Negative As shown, occasional positive weeks don’t necessarily reverse the broader trend. The moving average maintains its negative reading throughout the period. This persistence concerns analysts who monitor institutional adoption signals. Glassnode’s report compares current readings to historical patterns from previous market cycles. Their analysis suggests similar flow patterns often preceded periods of consolidation. However, the firm carefully avoids making direct price predictions based solely on this single metric. Expert Perspectives on Flow Data Interpretation Financial analysts emphasize several key considerations when interpreting ETF flow data. First, they note that ETF flows represent just one channel of market demand. Direct cryptocurrency purchases on exchanges continue independently. Second, seasonal factors often influence investment patterns during certain calendar periods. Third, regulatory announcements frequently trigger temporary flow disruptions. Industry experts from firms like CoinShares and Fidelity often provide complementary data to Glassnode’s analysis. Jameson Lopp, Chief Security Officer at Casa, recently commented on similar metrics. He noted that on-chain data sometimes contradicts ETF flow patterns. His analysis suggests sophisticated investors may use multiple entry methods. Consequently, ETF data alone provides an incomplete picture. Other analysts highlight the growing importance of global ETF products beyond United States markets. European and Canadian ETFs show different flow patterns that Glassnode’s report acknowledges but doesn’t emphasize. This geographical diversification complicates simple interpretations of aggregate flow data. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparisons Current ETF flow patterns gain significance when viewed alongside historical data. Previous market cycles show similar periods of negative flows during consolidation phases. For instance, 2019 saw extended periods of neutral-to-negative ETF movements before subsequent rallies. However, direct comparisons require caution due to market maturation. The cryptocurrency ETF landscape has expanded dramatically since earlier cycles. More products now exist across more jurisdictions with greater total assets under management. Several distinctive factors characterize the current environment: Increased institutional participation changes flow dynamics Regulatory clarity has improved in some regions Macroeconomic conditions differ substantially from previous cycles Technological developments like Ethereum’s upgrades affect investment theses Environmental concerns influence some institutional allocation decisions Glassnode’s analysis references these evolving conditions while presenting historical comparisons. Their report notes that current negative flows appear less severe than during previous bear markets when measured proportionally. This relative strength might indicate underlying market resilience despite surface-level caution. The firm’s data scientists employ sophisticated normalization techniques to enable meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Their methodology accounts for total market capitalization changes and product availability differences. Broader Market Implications and Future Monitoring The persistence of negative ETF flows carries implications beyond immediate price action. Market structure evolves in response to sustained flow patterns. Liquidity providers adjust their strategies when ETF activity diminishes. Trading venues may reallocate resources between products. Regulatory bodies monitor these flows as indicators of market health. Glassnode’s report suggests several areas warranting close observation in coming months. First, the relationship between ETF flows and on-chain accumulation patterns deserves attention. Sometimes, negative ETF flows coincide with increased direct blockchain purchases. Second, derivatives market positioning may compensate for reduced ETF activity. Third, geographical flow variations could signal regional market developments. Analysts should monitor these interconnected indicators rather than focusing solely on ETF metrics. Glassnode plans to publish follow-up research exploring these relationships in greater depth. The firm’s data infrastructure tracks numerous complementary metrics including: Exchange net position changes Long-term holder behavior Miner outflow patterns Options market positioning Stablecoin supply ratios These additional datasets provide context for interpreting ETF flow information. Glassnode emphasizes that no single metric determines market outcomes. Instead, converging signals from multiple indicators offer more reliable insights. Their latest report represents one piece of this broader analytical puzzle. Market participants should integrate this information with other fundamental and technical analyses. Conclusion Glassnode’s analysis of ETF flows reveals continuing caution among cryptocurrency investors, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum products experiencing negative net flows on a 30-day moving average basis. This persistent trend suggests new demand hasn’t yet materialized through ETF channels despite other potentially positive market developments. However, experienced analysts emphasize that ETF flows represent just one component of complex market dynamics. The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem continues evolving with multiple demand sources and investment vehicles. Glassnode’s data provides valuable insight into institutional and retail sentiment through ETF participation. Market observers should monitor whether these flow patterns persist or reverse in coming weeks, while considering complementary data from on-chain metrics and derivatives markets. The relationship between ETF flows and overall market health remains multifaceted, requiring nuanced interpretation rather than simplistic conclusions. FAQs Q1: What does negative ETF flow indicate? Negative ETF flow means more money is exiting than entering exchange-traded fund products during the measured period. This suggests reduced buying pressure through those specific investment vehicles, though investors might use other channels. Q2: How significant is the 30-day moving average in Glassnode’s analysis? The 30-day moving average smooths daily volatility to reveal underlying trends. Its persistence in negative territory indicates sustained caution rather than temporary fluctuations, making it more significant than single-day readings. Q3: Do negative ETF flows necessarily mean cryptocurrency prices will decline? Not necessarily. ETF flows represent just one demand source among many. Prices respond to numerous factors including direct exchange purchases, derivatives activity, macroeconomic conditions, and broader adoption trends beyond ETF channels. Q4: How do Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows typically compare? Both generally follow similar patterns due to correlated market sentiment, though Ethereum flows often show greater volatility. Currently, both maintain negative 30-day averages according to Glassnode’s latest data. Q5: What should investors monitor alongside ETF flow data? Investors should consider on-chain metrics like exchange balances and holder behavior, derivatives market positioning, regulatory developments, macroeconomic indicators, and technological progress within blockchain ecosystems.

This decisive action follows confirmed delays in block creation on the NKN blockchain network. Consequently, the exchange prioritizes user asset security above transaction continuity. This event highlights the intricate relationship between decentralized networks and centralized trading platforms. Upbit NKN Suspension: A Proactive Security Measure Upbit officially announced the suspension on its website and through user notifications. The exchange cited “delays in block generation” as the core technical reason. Block creation is the fundamental process that validates and records transactions on a blockchain. When this process slows, transactions can become stuck in a pending state. This creates uncertainty about their finality. Upbit’s protocol mandates a temporary halt during such network instability. The policy prevents users from depositing funds that may not confirm or withdrawing assets that may not properly transfer on-chain. This is not an isolated incident in the crypto industry. Major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken maintain similar security frameworks. They frequently pause services for specific tokens during network upgrades, congestion, or suspected vulnerabilities. For instance, Ethereum network upgrades often prompt preemptive halts. The Upbit NKN suspension follows this established risk-management playbook. It demonstrates the exchange’s operational diligence. Understanding the NKN Network and Block Creation Delays NKN, or New Kind of Network, is a project focused on decentralizing internet infrastructure. It aims to create a peer-to-peer data transmission network. The NKN blockchain uses a unique consensus mechanism called “Proof of Relay.” This mechanism incentivizes users to share network bandwidth. However, like all blockchain networks, it relies on consistent block production. Delays can stem from several technical factors. Network Congestion: A sudden surge in transaction volume can overwhelm node processing capacity. Consensus Issues: Temporary disagreements among network validators can slow block finalization. Software Bugs: An undiscovered flaw in a recent client update might disrupt normal operation. Node Synchronization Problems: If a significant portion of nodes falls out of sync, the chain can temporarily stall. At the time of Upbit’s announcement, the NKN core development team had not released a detailed root-cause analysis. The blockchain explorer data showed irregular block times preceding the halt. Network participants reported longer-than-usual confirmation waits for transactions. Expert Analysis on Exchange Risk Management Industry analysts view such suspensions as a necessary, if inconvenient, aspect of crypto trading. “An exchange’s primary duty is custody,” states Dr. Lena Choi, a blockchain security researcher at the Seoul Digital Finance Institute. “When a network behaves unpredictably, the only responsible action is to pause and assess. Proceeding could lead to double-spend attempts or loss of funds. While frustrating for users, it’s a sign of a mature security posture.” Dr. Choi’s research emphasizes that exchanges acting as custodians bear significant liability for user assets. Historical data supports this cautious approach. In 2022, a similar delay on another network led an exchange to continue processing withdrawals. This resulted in a multi-million dollar loss due to a chain reorganization. Upbit’s preemptive move aims to avoid such a scenario. The exchange has a history of swift action during network events, having previously suspended services for tokens like Qtum and Waves during their own technical incidents. Immediate Impact on Traders and the NKN Market The suspension’s immediate effect is the isolation of NKN liquidity on Upbit. Users cannot move tokens on or off the exchange. However, spot trading of NKN against Korean Won (KRW) and Bitcoin (BTC) typically remains active internally. This allows users to buy or sell the token within the exchange’s order book. The price impact is often neutral or slightly negative in the short term due to reduced arbitrage opportunities. Other global exchanges listing NKN, such as Gate.io and MEXC, did not immediately follow with suspensions. Their network monitoring may have indicated different conditions. This creates a temporary fragmentation in the NKN market. Price discrepancies between Upbit and other platforms may emerge until services resume. Traders often monitor these spreads for potential opportunities post-resumption. Recent Cryptocurrency Exchange Service Halts (2024-2025) Exchange Token Reason Duration Binance Polygon (MATIC) Network Upgrade ~4 hours Coinbase Solana (SOL) Congestion ~8 hours Kraken Avalanche (AVAX) Consensus Issue ~12 hours Upbit NKN Block Creation Delay Pending The Resolution Process and User Guidance Upbit will restore services only after confirming network stability. The process involves close coordination with the NKN development team. Upbit’s technical staff will monitor block production consistency over a designated period. They will also test deposit and withdrawal functions in a controlled environment. The exchange typically provides updates via official announcements. Users should rely solely on these verified channels and avoid speculation from social media. During the suspension, users should take specific steps. First, they must verify the official announcement on Upbit’s notice board. Second, they should avoid attempting to force deposits via the blockchain, as funds may be lost or delayed. Third, monitoring the NKN blockchain explorer provides independent confirmation of network health. Finally, patience is crucial, as premature resumption poses risks to all network participants. Conclusion The Upbit NKN suspension underscores a critical reality in cryptocurrency markets. The security of digital assets depends on both robust blockchain networks and vigilant custodial services. Upbit’s decision to halt deposits and withdrawals for NKN reflects a prudent, security-first protocol activated by block creation delays. While temporarily disruptive for traders, such measures protect the ecosystem from larger financial and technical risks. This event serves as a reminder of the evolving infrastructure supporting digital asset trading and the importance of exchange transparency during network incidents. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade NKN on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Typically, yes. Suspensions usually affect only deposit and withdrawal functions. Spot trading between NKN, KRW, and BTC on Upbit’s internal order book often remains operational unless otherwise specified. Q2: How long will the Upbit NKN suspension last? A2: There is no predetermined duration. The halt will persist until Upbit’s security team verifies that the NKN network is producing blocks consistently and reliably. This depends on the resolution of the underlying technical issue. Q3: Are my NKN tokens safe on Upbit during this time? A3: The suspension is a security measure designed specifically to keep assets safe. Tokens held in your Upbit wallet are not at increased risk due to the halt. The action prevents movement during a period of network uncertainty. Q4: Should I be worried about the NKN network itself? A4: Temporary block creation delays are not uncommon in blockchain networks. They can result from congestion, minor software glitches, or consensus processes. The NKN development team is likely investigating. Monitor their official channels for technical updates. Q5: What happens if I send NKN to my Upbit deposit address during the suspension? A5: You should NOT do this. The transaction may not be credited to your account automatically and could be stuck in a pending state. Always wait for an official “Resumption of Services” notice from Upbit before making any deposits.

Dogecoin, Solana, & Others Have Seen A Decline In Volume Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Trading Volume for the various assets in the cryptocurrency sector. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of a given token that became involved in trading activities on exchanges over the past week. When the value of the metric rises, it means trading activity related to the asset is going up. Such a trend can be a sign that interest in the cryptocurrency is increasing. On the other hand, the indicator going down can imply investors are shifting their attention away from the coin as they are participating in a lower amount of trading. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Trading Volume for nine major assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Cardano, Solana, BNB, XRP, Tron, and Chainlink. As displayed in the above graph, the Trading Volume has witnessed a plunge across the sector over the last couple of weeks. Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other assets have all shown price consolidation in this period, so the cooldown in trading activity could partly be due to traders getting bored. Generally, investors like to trade more when price action is “exciting.” Volatile moves like rallies or crashes especially attract attention to the market. In phases of sideways price action, though, interest tends to die down. There is also another reason behind the recent decline in the Trading Volume besides the price action: the holidays . From the chart, it’s visible that the holiday period at the end of 2024 also saw the indicator have a similarly low value for Bitcoin. There has been one big difference in market behavior between now and then, however. As the analytics firm has explained: Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin were still seeing significant movement. This year, they have less than half the weekly trading volume. What could be the consequence of this low activity? While hard to say for certain, price action usually tends to be muted when there is a lack of trading interest, as moves fail to build momentum in either direction. Thus, it’s possible that the current phase of consolidation could stretch for the market, unless some surprise news drops that becomes a trigger for volatility .

Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report Ethereum Holds ‘Equilibrium Level’ Ethereum is attempting to end the year above a crucial area following its recent sideways action. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend for the past three months, currently recording a 27.8% decline from its Q4 opening of $4,145. ETH has been trading sideways over the past several weeks, hovering within the $2,800-$3,000 price range. During this period, the King of Altcoins has failed to hold above the upper boundary on the weekly timeframe despite multiple attempts to break out. Amid this performance, market watcher Crypto Batman recently noted Ethereum is trading around the mid-zone of a multi-year bullish channel, which he named “the equilibrium level.” This zone has historically acted as both a strong support and resistance point for Ethereum, he explained, making it the crucial area to hold as we approach the monthly and yearly closes. Despite the recent price action, Crypto Batman suggested that “given how ETH rallied from $1,500 to $4,600, this current move looks like nothing more than a bullish retest to that equilibrium, likely forming the next higher low.” Similarly, analyst Cas Abbé affirmed that the leading altcoin’s structure remains “incredibly bullish” even with the recent volatility, highlighting ETH’s uptrend line on the higher timeframes. According to the post, the cryptocurrency has not only held its ascending trendline over the past eight months but also bounced after each retest, suggesting that a rebound could be possible if this level continues to hold on the higher timeframes. ETH Breakout In Early 2026? Crypto Jelle also shared a bullish outlook for Ethereum, affirming that the altcoin looks strong on the macro chart. “If price can push towards $4k from here, I doubt bears can hold it down again,” the analyst wrote on X, adding that “It might finally be time for ETH to shine again next year.” Market observer Trader Tardigrade underscored a giant Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on ETH’s weekly chart. Per the post, the cryptocurrency has been forming this bullish pattern for the past two years, with the neckline currently located around the $4,950-$5,000 mark. Notably, the left shoulder and head developed during the Q3-Q4 2024 and Q2-Q3 2025 rallies. Meanwhile, the Q4 2025 correction has started to form the pattern’s right shoulder, which signals that the altcoin could rise to the neckline area in the next few months, and potentially aim for higher levels if the pattern continues to develop. In the shorter timeframe, Man of Bitcoin noted that Ethereum could see a breakout in the first week of 2026. The analyst pointed out a one-month symmetrical triangle formation on ETH’s chart, where the price has been “getting squeezed between both trendlines.” Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target While the altcoin continues to compress between these levels, a break from the pattern becomes more likely, leading the market watcher to suggest a 15%-20% breakout toward the $3,400 resistance.

While data consistently shows most successful founders hold degrees, a cultural shift is sweeping through Silicon Valley. Young entrepreneurs now strategically highlight their uncompleted education during investor pitches. This phenomenon reflects deeper changes in how the venture ecosystem evaluates risk, conviction, and timing in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. The College Dropout Founder Phenomenon in Modern Venture Capital Historically, iconic figures like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg created the mythology of the dropout founder. However, comprehensive studies from institutions like MIT and Stanford reveal a different reality. Approximately 85% of unicorn startup founders possess bachelor’s degrees. Furthermore, 40% hold advanced degrees. Despite these statistics, the romanticized narrative persists and experiences cyclical resurgences. The current AI boom has catalyzed the most significant resurgence in decades. Venture capitalists report a noticeable increase in founders emphasizing their dropout status during initial meetings. This trend represents a complex calculation about perceived dedication versus formal credentialing. Y Combinator Demo Days have become ground zero for observing this shift. During recent batches, partners noted a strategic pattern. Founders explicitly mention leaving prestigious institutions in their one-minute pitches. Katie Jacobs Stanton of Moxxie Ventures observed this firsthand. “The dropout status functions as a badge of honor,” she explained. “It communicates a founder’s willingness to prioritize their vision over conventional milestones.” This signaling occurs even as leading AI companies like Cursor and Cognition boast founders from MIT and Harvard. The contradiction highlights a tension between proven educational pathways and the allure of disruptive, non-traditional backgrounds. The Psychology of Founder Signaling and Investor Perception Investor psychology plays a crucial role in this trend. A dropout narrative can signal several attractive founder qualities: Extreme conviction: Willingness to abandon secure paths Risk tolerance: Comfort with uncertainty and high-stakes decisions Urgency: Belief in capturing a fleeting market window Resourcefulness: Ability to progress without institutional support However, venture capitalists approach this signal with nuanced caution. Yuri Sagalov of General Catalyst provides critical perspective. He argues that investors increasingly evaluate the substance behind the story. “The fourth-year dropout versus the freshman dropout tells different stories,” Sagalov noted. “We assess what they built during their education and what networks they accessed.” This analytical approach suggests the ecosystem is maturing beyond simplistic dropout worship. Investors now seek founders who leveraged educational environments strategically before making their leap. AI Boom Intensifies the Education Versus Execution Calculus The artificial intelligence revolution has fundamentally altered the startup timeline. Founders perceive an unprecedented opportunity window that may close within years. This perception creates intense pressure on student entrepreneurs. They face a dilemma: complete their degree or build during the AI gold rush. Kulveer Taggar of Phosphor Capital identifies this dynamic clearly. “Founders experience genuine FOMO,” Taggar stated. “They see peers raising capital and worry that waiting means missing the wave.” This urgency manifests in dramatic decisions. Professors at elite universities report students leaving during their final semesters. One Stanford computer science professor described a top student departing weeks before graduation. That student believed a diploma might actually hinder fundraising efforts. This extreme viewpoint, while not universal, illustrates the potent mythology developing around dropout status in AI circles. The fear isn’t merely about missing opportunities. It’s about being perceived as insufficiently committed by a venture community currently celebrating bold, all-in founders. Educational Backgrounds of Notable AI Startup Founders (2023-2025) Founder Company Educational Background Funding Stage Michael Truell Cursor MIT Graduate Series B Scott Wu Cognition Harvard Graduate Series A Brendan Foody Mercor Georgetown Dropout Seed Multiple Founders Various YC AI Startups College/Grad School Dropouts Pre-seed/Seed The Counterargument: Wisdom, Networks, and Long-Term Advantage Not all investors embrace the dropout trend. Wesley Chan of FPV Ventures presents a compelling counter-narrative. He prioritizes founder wisdom over youthful boldness. “Young founders often lack the scar tissue needed for difficult decisions,” Chan argued. “I typically seek founders with more life and business experience.” This perspective highlights an ongoing debate within venture capital. Some firms believe the AI market’s complexity favors experienced operators. These operators often developed their skills within structured educational or corporate environments. Furthermore, universities provide intangible advantages that dropouts might forfeit. Sagalov emphasizes the enduring value of elite university networks. “You gain social capital simply by attending,” he explained. “That network persists regardless of degree completion.” This social capital translates into hiring advantages, advisor access, and peer support systems. Founders who leave institutions early must work harder to build equivalent networks. They often rely on accelerator programs like Y Combinator to fill this gap. However, these programs cannot fully replicate the decade-spanning connections formed during university years. How Venture Capitalists Actually Evaluate Founder Credentials Beneath the cultural fascination with dropouts, venture capitalists employ sophisticated evaluation frameworks. Educational background constitutes just one data point among many. Investors typically assess several key dimensions: Technical proficiency: Demonstrated through projects, contributions, or technical interviews Market insight: Depth of understanding about the problem space Execution history: Evidence of building and shipping products Team composition: Complementary skills among co-founders Traction metrics: User growth, revenue, or technological breakthroughs The dropout narrative gains power when combined with strong performance in these areas. A founder who left Stanford but built a working AI prototype with real users presents a compelling case. Conversely, a dropout without tangible progress struggles to secure meetings. The venture ecosystem ultimately rewards demonstrated ability over symbolic gestures. This reality tempers the dropout trend’s practical impact on funding decisions. The Global Context: Educational Trends Beyond Silicon Valley This phenomenon remains predominantly American, particularly concentrated in tech hubs. European and Asian venture ecosystems maintain stronger preferences for formal credentials. Cultural differences influence these attitudes. Many international markets value educational prestige as a reliable signaling mechanism. However, the globalization of Silicon Valley culture may shift these norms. As Y Combinator and other accelerators attract more international founders, dropout narratives may gain traction worldwide. This diffusion could reshape global entrepreneurship education and investor expectations over the next decade. Conclusion The college dropout founder credential represents a fascinating cultural moment in venture capital. It reflects the AI sector’s breakneck pace and the premium placed on decisive action. However, beneath the compelling narratives, data and investor behavior reveal a more complex reality. Successful founders come from diverse educational backgrounds. The venture ecosystem ultimately seeks exceptional builders, regardless of their academic completion status. As the AI market matures, the dropout trend may evolve or recede. Yet its current prominence offers valuable insights into founder psychology, investor signaling, and the perpetual tension between tradition and disruption in technology innovation. FAQs Q1: Do most successful startup founders actually drop out of college? No, comprehensive data shows most successful founders complete their degrees. Studies indicate over 85% of unicorn founders hold bachelor’s degrees, with many possessing advanced degrees. The dropout narrative, while culturally prominent, represents a minority of cases. Q2: Why are venture capitalists currently interested in dropout founders? In the context of the AI boom, dropout status can signal strong conviction, risk tolerance, and urgency. Investors perceive these founders as fully committed to capturing a perceived narrow market window. However, this interest is nuanced and varies significantly among different venture firms. Q3: What advantages do founders gain by completing their degrees? Degree completion provides access to alumni networks, institutional credibility, structured learning environments, and proof of follow-through. These advantages can aid in hiring, partnerships, and later-stage fundraising, especially outside Silicon Valley. Q4: Are dropout founders more common in AI than other tech sectors? Yes, the current AI investment frenzy has intensified the trend. The perceived rapid evolution of AI technology creates fear of missing out (FOMO), pushing founders to start building immediately rather than completing traditional education timelines. Q5: How should aspiring entrepreneurs approach the dropout decision? Experts recommend a strategic evaluation. Founders should assess their specific startup idea’s urgency, their personal financial situation, their progress without full-time dedication, and their access to networks. There’s no universal correct answer—the decision depends on individual circumstances and market timing.

Broadcom and Nvidia have rallied by 49% and 39% YTD, respectively. Skeptics had been circling Google for months, questioning whether it could keep up in a world driven by AI. ChatGPT and Sora, both OpenAI products, were pulling users away from Gemini, and then advertisers started testing new ways to reach users in a space filled with AI chatbots and agents. Google’s globally-dominating search model was under pressure, and the company’s ability to stay relevant was being challenged on all fronts. Gemini app, Nano Banana, and AI hires drive recovery In April, Google appointed Josh Woodward, who had been with the company for 16 years, to lead the Gemini app, and his team pushed out Nano Banana in August, a feature that allowed users to create AI-generated images by blending multiple photos into a single digital creation. The feature went viral, and by the end of September, Gemini had processed over 5 billion images, surpassing ChatGPT on Apple’s App Store. That same summer, Google signed a deal with Varun Mohan, CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, and hired several of his top engineers. Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI for $3 billion. Those talks collapsed, and Google stepped in, agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and compensation to secure the engineering talent. That move added critical AI depth to its team at a time when the pressure was on to innovate quickly. Court ruling, Gemini 3, and growing search revenue add fuel In September, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta handed Google a legal win despite the company being found guilty of running an illegal monopoly in internet search last year. Mehta ruled against the Justice Department’s harshest proposals, meaning Google wouldn’t be forced to spin off Chrome or stop making payments to have its apps preloaded. The company can still pay Apple billions to keep its search engine the default option on iPhones. However, it now has to share some data with competitors as part of the ruling. In November, Google released Gemini 3, just eight months after Gemini 2.5. Usage is still behind ChatGPT, but it’s catching up. This month, Gemini reached 18% of generative AI traffic, up from 5% a year ago, while ChatGPT fell to 68% from 87%. Analysts at Citizens noted that the real value isn’t just Gemini itself but the impact on core search, where the company has embedded AI-powered summaries under a feature called AI Overviews. “The incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers,” said the analysts, who also said they believe Google can grow search revenue in Q4 2025. They kept a buy recommendation on the stock. Analysts also pointed to strength in Google Cloud, which is competing directly with Amazon and Microsoft. They flagged the Waymo division and its robotaxi operations as another area that could keep investors interested into 2026. Expectations are already high. LSEG estimates that Google will report Q4 revenue over $111 billion, a 15% jump from last year. Revenue growth next year is expected to stay in the low teens. In October, Alphabet raised its 2025 capital spending forecast to $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts at FactSet expect it to climb to $114 billion in 2026. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on the October earnings call that Google Cloud signed more billion-dollar deals in the first three quarters of 2025 than in all of 2023 and 2024 combined. Still, not everyone’s relaxed. Analysts at Pivotal Research said that if OpenAI runs into financial problems or cuts spending, the ripple effect could hit the entire AI sector, including Google. But they’re not pulling back. Pivotal raised their Google price target by $50 to $400, which is 28% above Wednesday’s close of $313. “ We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000,” they wrote, “and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer, much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

US Risks Giving China A Major Global Advantage On Tuesday, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer (CPO), Faryar Shirzad, warned the US Congress that banning interest payments on the digital assets could risk diminishing the legislative efforts and victories obtained this year with the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. In an X post, Shirzad affirmed that “tokenization is the future and the GENIUS Act was a visionary move by POTUS and Congress to ensure US dollar stablecoins issued under US rules would be the primary settlement instrument of the future.” However, Shirzad noted that the “sobering and timely” announcement by the People’s Bank of China of its plan to pay interest on the Digital Yuan could pose a bigger problem to the US than investors think. As reported by Bitcoinist, China is about to start paying interest on its Digital Yuan (e-CNY). Deputy Governor at the People’s Bank of China, Lu Lei, recently shared a new framework that will redefine the rules of virtual currency, giving it the same legal status as deposits held at banks. Under the new framework , commercial banks that manage Digital Yuan wallets will be able to pay interest to clients based on the amount of e-CNY they hold, starting from January 1, 2026. Based on this, Shirzad cautioned that “If this issue is mishandled in Senate negotiations on the market structure bill, it could hand our global rivals a big assist in giving non-US stablecoins and CBDCs a critical competitive advantage at the worst possible time.” Stablecoin Rewards: A ‘Matter Of National Security’ Coinbase’s CPO added that although “lobbyists for entrenched incumbents will always fight change,” it’s crucial for Congress to “protect the primacy of the US dollar and the US financial system, “not just incumbent interests.” Similarly, other crypto executives agreed with Shirzad’s statement, including Coinbase’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Armstrong and Variant’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Jake Chervinsky. Armstrong emphasized that US “stablecoins must remain competitive on a global stage. Meanwhile, Chervinsky asserted that banks’ push to ban stablecoin rewards “isn’t just a matter of incumbents seeking a regulatory moat. It’s a matter of national security.” To the lawyer, revisiting the issue of interest payments on USD-pegged tokens would weaken the victory that the GENIUS Act gave to US dollar dominance worldwide and “hand that win to China.” Notably, the banking sector has criticized the US’s landmark stablecoin legislation over the past few months, arguing that it has loopholes that could pose risks to the financial system. The crypto framework, which was signed into law by President Trump in July, prohibits interest payments on the holding or use of payment-purpose stablecoins. Nonetheless, the prohibition only addresses issuers, meaning that it could be “easily circumvented” by exchanges or affiliates providing rewards. Earlier this year, multiple banking associations across the US sent a joint letter to the Senate Banking Committee urging Congress to amend the law. The banking groups claimed that interest payments would distort market dynamics and could affect credit creation. Therefore, they suggested extending the prohibition to include digital asset exchanges, brokers, dealers, and related entities. Shirzad, alongside multiple crypto industry players, has rejected these concerns over the past several months, stating that the banking sector’s proposals could threaten to create an uncompetitive environment for USD-denominated tokens. In October, Coinbase’s CPO slammed the financial institution’s narrative that stablecoins would destroy bank lending, concluding that it “ignores reality” and misreads the crucial moment.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CBDC|China digital yuan|CLARITY Act|coinbase|Coinbase CPO|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|Faryar Shirzad|GENIUS Act|Jake Chervinsky|Stablecoin Interest payment|Stablecoin Legislation|US stablecoins,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-01 04:00:17

This strategic move positions Upbit as the first major South Korean exchange to integrate a physically-backed gold cryptocurrency, providing investors with novel exposure to precious metals through blockchain technology. The listing, scheduled for 6:30 a.m. UTC, introduces XAUT trading against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and the Korean won (KRW), significantly broadening the exchange’s product portfolio during a period of increasing institutional interest in tokenized commodities. Upbit XAUT Listing Details and Market Context Upbit’s announcement specifies precise technical parameters for the XAUT integration. Trading will commence simultaneously across three distinct pairs: XAUT/BTC, XAUT/USDT, and XAUT/KRW. This multi-pair approach provides flexibility for different investor segments within South Korea’s sophisticated cryptocurrency ecosystem. The exchange confirmed that deposit and withdrawal services for XAUT will activate several hours before trading begins, ensuring proper system functionality. Market analysts immediately noted the timing significance, as the listing coincides with renewed global interest in gold as an inflation hedge amid economic uncertainties. South Korea maintains one of Asia’s most active cryptocurrency markets, with Upbit consistently ranking among the nation’s top exchanges by trading volume. The platform’s decision to list XAUT follows months of regulatory developments and market maturation. Specifically, South Korean authorities have recently clarified guidelines for asset-backed tokens, creating a more predictable environment for exchanges. Consequently, Upbit’s move represents both a business expansion and a compliance milestone, demonstrating how regulated exchanges can integrate innovative financial products while adhering to national standards. Tether Gold Fundamentals and Blockchain Architecture Tether Gold (XAUT) operates on a fundamentally different premise than purely algorithmic stablecoins or speculative cryptocurrencies. Each XAUT token represents ownership of one troy ounce of physical gold stored in professional vaults in Switzerland. Tether Limited, the issuing company, provides regular attestations from independent auditors verifying the gold reserves. This transparency mechanism addresses common concerns about asset-backed tokens, particularly regarding custody and verification. The gold backing provides intrinsic value stability rarely found in purely digital assets. The technical infrastructure supporting XAUT utilizes the Ethereum blockchain as its primary platform, employing the ERC-20 token standard. However, Tether has also implemented XAUT on other blockchains including Tron and Solana, demonstrating interoperability across ecosystems. For Upbit’s implementation, the exchange will utilize the Ethereum-based version initially, leveraging the network’s robust security and widespread wallet compatibility. This blockchain foundation enables several unique features: Direct Redemption: Qualified holders can redeem XAUT tokens for physical gold bars Transparent Audits: Monthly reserve reports from professional accounting firms Global Accessibility: 24/7 trading unlike traditional gold markets with limited hours Fractional Ownership: Investors can own portions of gold ounces through token fractions Comparative Analysis: XAUT Versus Traditional Gold Investments Financial experts frequently highlight the distinctive advantages and considerations of gold-backed cryptocurrencies compared to conventional gold investment vehicles. The table below illustrates key differences: Investment Type Storage & Custody Trading Hours Minimum Investment Geographic Access Tether Gold (XAUT) Professional Swiss vaults 24/7 cryptocurrency markets Fractional tokens possible Global with internet access Physical Gold Bars Personal or bank safety deposit Market business hours Full ounce or larger bars Physical delivery limitations Gold ETFs (e.g., GLD) Trustee bank vaults Stock exchange hours One share minimum Available in licensed jurisdictions Gold Futures Contracts Not applicable Exchange trading sessions Contract size requirements Available to qualified traders This comparison reveals XAUT’s unique positioning, particularly regarding accessibility and fractional ownership. However, experts caution that cryptocurrency volatility and regulatory considerations differ significantly from traditional markets. Upbit’s integration therefore provides South Korean investors with a previously unavailable combination of features: blockchain efficiency with physical asset backing. South Korean Regulatory Landscape and Exchange Compliance Upbit’s XAUT listing occurs within a carefully evolving regulatory framework. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) have implemented increasingly specific guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges since 2021. These regulations mandate strict anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, know-your-customer (KYC) verification, and real-name banking partnerships. Upbit, as a registered exchange with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, must demonstrate compliance with all relevant regulations before listing any new digital asset. The exchange’s decision to list XAUT followed extensive due diligence regarding the token’s compliance characteristics. Tether Gold’s structure as an asset-backed token with verifiable reserves and regulated custody arrangements likely facilitated regulatory approval. Moreover, South Korean authorities have shown particular interest in stablecoins and asset-backed tokens as potentially less speculative than purely algorithmic cryptocurrencies. This regulatory alignment creates favorable conditions for XAUT’s market entry, potentially setting precedents for similar tokens in the future. Market observers note that Upbit’s listing timing coincides with broader regulatory developments. Specifically, South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act, implemented in 2024, established clearer guidelines for exchange operations and investor protections. The act requires exchanges to maintain adequate reserve ratios, implement cold wallet storage for most assets, and provide transparent fee structures. Upbit’s established compliance with these requirements provides additional confidence for investors considering the new XAUT trading pairs. Expert Perspectives on Market Impact Financial analysts specializing in Asian cryptocurrency markets have identified several potential impacts from Upbit’s XAUT listing. First, the integration bridges traditional finance and cryptocurrency sectors more directly than previous exchange listings. Gold has served as a store of value for millennia, while cryptocurrency represents a digital revolution in asset ownership. Combining these concepts through a regulated exchange platform may attract conservative investors who previously avoided purely digital assets. Second, the listing enhances South Korea’s position in global cryptocurrency innovation. The nation already hosts advanced blockchain development and widespread cryptocurrency adoption. Adding gold-backed tokens to major exchanges demonstrates market maturity and regulatory sophistication. Consequently, other Asian markets may observe South Korea’s experience with XAUT as they consider similar integrations. Finally, the timing during early 2025 suggests strategic planning around macroeconomic conditions, as gold traditionally performs well during periods of currency uncertainty or inflation concerns. Technical Implementation and Trading Infrastructure Upbit’s technical team prepared extensively for the XAUT integration, ensuring system stability and security. The exchange utilizes a multi-layered security architecture including cold storage for most assets, multi-signature authorization protocols, and continuous network monitoring. For XAUT specifically, the exchange established direct integration with Tether’s redemption portal, enabling potential future services for qualified users. However, initial trading will focus on spot markets without derivative products, reflecting cautious implementation of new asset classes. The trading interface will display XAUT alongside other major cryptocurrencies, with real-time price charts and order book visibility. Upbit’s existing user base of approximately 8 million verified accounts can access XAUT trading through both web and mobile platforms. The exchange confirmed standard trading fees will apply initially, with potential promotional periods to encourage market liquidity. Market makers have reportedly expressed interest in providing liquidity across all three trading pairs, particularly the XAUT/KRW pair which offers direct gold exposure in South Korea’s national currency. Technical considerations extend beyond trading functionality to include wallet integration and blockchain compatibility. Upbit supports Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens through established infrastructure, minimizing implementation complexity. The exchange’s security protocols for token deposits and withdrawals follow industry best practices, including address whitelisting and withdrawal delays for enhanced protection. These technical preparations demonstrate Upbit’s systematic approach to new asset integration, prioritizing security while expanding user options. Global Context of Gold-Backed Cryptocurrency Adoption Upbit’s XAUT listing represents a significant development within broader global trends toward tokenized commodities. Multiple jurisdictions have witnessed growing interest in asset-backed digital tokens, particularly those representing precious metals, real estate, or other tangible assets. This movement reflects increasing recognition of blockchain technology’s potential to enhance traditional asset markets through improved transparency, fractional ownership, and trading efficiency. Internationally, several exchanges already list XAUT and similar gold-backed tokens. However, Upbit’s implementation marks a milestone for several reasons. South Korea represents one of Asia’s largest and most technologically advanced cryptocurrency markets. The nation’s regulatory framework has matured significantly in recent years, providing clearer guidelines than many other jurisdictions. Additionally, South Korean investors have demonstrated particular interest in innovative financial products, making the market receptive to gold-backed cryptocurrency options. Comparative analysis reveals that gold-backed tokens have gained traction primarily in markets with established cryptocurrency infrastructure and regulatory clarity. Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates have all seen growing adoption of similar products. Upbit’s move may therefore signal broader Asian adoption, potentially influencing exchanges in Japan, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. The listing’s success could accelerate regional integration of tokenized commodities, creating more diversified cryptocurrency ecosystems beyond purely speculative assets. Conclusion Upbit’s XAUT listing represents a strategic expansion of South Korea’s cryptocurrency marketplace, integrating gold-backed digital assets through a regulated exchange platform. The January 1, 2025 implementation provides investors with novel exposure to precious metals through blockchain technology, offering trading pairs against Bitcoin, Tether, and the Korean won. This development bridges traditional finance and digital assets, potentially attracting conservative investors while demonstrating regulatory maturity. As global interest in tokenized commodities grows, Upbit’s systematic approach to XAUT integration may establish important precedents for asset-backed cryptocurrency adoption across Asian markets. The listing’s success will depend on market reception, liquidity development, and ongoing regulatory compliance, but undoubtedly marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency evolution. FAQs Q1: What is Tether Gold (XAUT) and how does it differ from regular Tether (USDT)? Tether Gold (XAUT) is a cryptocurrency token where each unit represents ownership of one troy ounce of physical gold stored in Swiss vaults. Unlike regular Tether (USDT), which is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, XAUT derives its value directly from physical gold reserves. Holders can potentially redeem tokens for actual gold bars, subject to minimum quantities and verification procedures. Q2: When exactly will XAUT trading begin on Upbit? Upbit has announced that XAUT trading will commence at 6:30 a.m. UTC on January 1, 2025. The exchange will open three trading pairs simultaneously: XAUT/BTC, XAUT/USDT, and XAUT/KRW. Deposit and withdrawal services for XAUT will activate several hours before trading begins to ensure proper system functionality. Q3: What are the advantages of investing in XAUT compared to physical gold or gold ETFs? XAUT offers several distinct advantages including 24/7 trading accessibility, fractional ownership capabilities, and blockchain-based transfer efficiency. Unlike physical gold, XAUT eliminates storage concerns and enables global transfers. Compared to gold ETFs, XAUT provides direct ownership claims rather than shares in a trust, though both involve third-party custody arrangements. Q4: How does Upbit ensure the security of XAUT tokens on its platform? Upbit employs a multi-layered security architecture including cold storage for most assets, multi-signature authorization protocols, and continuous network monitoring. For XAUT specifically, the exchange utilizes established Ethereum wallet infrastructure with additional verification procedures. Upbit’s security measures comply with South Korean regulatory requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges. Q5: Are there any regulatory considerations for South Korean investors trading XAUT? Yes, XAUT trading on Upbit falls under South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act and related regulations. Investors must complete know-your-customer (KYC) verification and use real-name bank accounts for KRW deposits and withdrawals. Tax implications for cryptocurrency investments apply, though specific treatment of gold-backed tokens may require clarification from tax authorities.

According to Schiff’s calculations, this approach suffered a 47.5% decline in 2025, positioning it as the sixth-worst performer within the prestigious index. This revelation directly challenges MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s long-standing advocacy for Bitcoin as the ultimate corporate treasury asset. Bitcoin Strategy’s Troubling S&P 500 Performance Metrics Peter Schiff’s analysis provides specific performance metrics that place the Bitcoin strategy in concerning context. The 47.5% decline significantly underperforms the broader S&P 500 index, which has maintained relative stability through 2025’s economic conditions. Furthermore, this performance would rank only behind five other companies within the entire 500-company index for worst annual returns. Schiff’s critique centers on shareholder value destruction resulting from this approach. He argues that corporate resources allocated to Bitcoin acquisitions could have generated superior returns through traditional investments or operational improvements. The analysis comes during a period of increased regulatory scrutiny toward cryptocurrency holdings on corporate balance sheets. The MicroStrategy Case Study: A Corporate Bitcoin Pioneer MicroStrategy Incorporated, under Michael Saylor’s leadership, pioneered the corporate Bitcoin acquisition strategy beginning in August 2020. The business intelligence company has accumulated approximately 226,331 Bitcoin as of early 2025, representing one of the largest corporate cryptocurrency holdings globally. Saylor has consistently framed this strategy as a superior alternative to holding cash reserves or traditional investments. However, Schiff’s analysis highlights the volatility inherent in this approach. While MicroStrategy experienced substantial gains during Bitcoin’s bull markets, the 2025 decline demonstrates significant downside risk. The company’s stock price has historically correlated closely with Bitcoin’s price movements, creating amplified volatility compared to traditional technology companies. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin Strategy Versus Traditional Corporate Approaches A comparative examination reveals stark differences between Bitcoin-focused corporate strategies and traditional approaches. Traditional corporate treasury management typically emphasizes capital preservation, liquidity, and moderate returns through diversified instruments including: Short-term government securities providing stability and liquidity Investment-grade corporate bonds offering predictable returns Money market funds maintaining principal protection Operational reinvestment driving core business growth Conversely, the Bitcoin strategy represents a concentrated, high-volatility position that behaves more like a speculative investment than traditional treasury management. This approach exposes shareholders to cryptocurrency market risks beyond typical corporate operational concerns. 2025 Performance Comparison: Bitcoin Strategy vs. S&P 500 Segments Investment Approach 2025 Performance Volatility Level Bitcoin Corporate Strategy -47.5% Extreme S&P 500 Technology Sector +8.2% High S&P 500 Financial Sector +5.7% Moderate S&P 500 Utilities Sector +3.1% Low S&P 500 Index Overall +4.8% Moderate Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Volatility in Corporate Finance The debate surrounding corporate Bitcoin adoption extends beyond recent performance metrics. Since MicroStrategy’s initial acquisition, numerous companies have explored cryptocurrency treasury allocations with varying approaches. Notably, Tesla briefly added Bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2021 before selling approximately 75% of its position in 2022. Financial analysts have consistently highlighted several concerns regarding corporate Bitcoin strategies: Accounting treatment challenges under existing standards Regulatory uncertainty across multiple jurisdictions Environmental considerations related to proof-of-work mining Concentration risk from undiversified holdings These factors contribute to the ongoing debate about appropriate corporate exposure to cryptocurrency assets. Meanwhile, traditional gold investments, which Schiff advocates, have demonstrated relative stability during 2025’s market conditions. Shareholder Value Considerations in Volatile Markets The fundamental disagreement between Schiff and Saylor centers on shareholder value creation versus destruction. Saylor argues that Bitcoin represents a superior store of value that protects against currency debasement and inflation. Conversely, Schiff maintains that corporate resources should prioritize operational excellence and traditional value preservation. This philosophical divide reflects broader tensions within corporate governance regarding innovative versus conservative financial strategies. Institutional investors have expressed mixed reactions, with some applauding forward-thinking approaches while others emphasize fiduciary responsibility and risk management. Regulatory Landscape and Future Implications The regulatory environment for corporate cryptocurrency holdings continues evolving through 2025. Accounting standards boards globally are developing clearer guidelines for digital asset valuation and reporting. Simultaneously, securities regulators are examining disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies with significant cryptocurrency exposure. These developments could significantly impact the viability of corporate Bitcoin strategies moving forward. Enhanced disclosure requirements might increase transparency but could also highlight volatility concerns for risk-averse investors. Additionally, potential tax implications and regulatory changes create uncertainty for long-term holding strategies. Corporate governance experts emphasize the importance of board oversight and risk committee involvement in cryptocurrency investment decisions. They recommend comprehensive scenario analysis, stress testing, and clear communication with shareholders regarding strategy rationale and risk parameters. Conclusion Peter Schiff’s analysis of Bitcoin strategy performance within an S&P 500 context highlights significant concerns about corporate cryptocurrency adoption. The 47.5% decline in 2025, ranking as the sixth-worst performance in the index, challenges Michael Saylor’s advocacy for Bitcoin as the ultimate corporate treasury asset. This Bitcoin strategy evaluation comes amid evolving regulatory frameworks and ongoing debates about appropriate corporate risk exposure. The fundamental tension between innovative financial approaches and traditional shareholder value preservation continues shaping corporate treasury management decisions globally. FAQs Q1: What specific performance metric did Peter Schiff cite regarding Bitcoin strategy? Peter Schiff cited a 47.5% decline in 2025 that would rank a Bitcoin acquisition strategy as the sixth-worst performer if included in the S&P 500 index. Q2: How does Michael Saylor justify corporate Bitcoin acquisitions? Michael Saylor argues Bitcoin represents a superior store of value that protects against currency debasement and inflation, making it better than holding cash or traditional investments. Q3: What are the main criticisms of corporate Bitcoin strategies? Primary criticisms include extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainty, accounting challenges, environmental concerns, and concentration risk compared to diversified traditional approaches. Q4: How have other companies approached corporate cryptocurrency holdings? Approaches vary significantly, with Tesla briefly holding Bitcoin before selling most positions, while other companies have implemented smaller, more diversified cryptocurrency allocations. Q5: What regulatory developments could impact corporate Bitcoin strategies? Evolving accounting standards, enhanced disclosure requirements, securities regulations, and potential tax changes could all significantly impact the viability of corporate Bitcoin strategies.

This significant withdrawal of capital abruptly ended a brief period of net inflows, highlighting the persistent volatility and sensitivity of cryptocurrency markets to broader financial currents. The movement provides a critical data point for analysts tracking the maturation and stability of Bitcoin as an institutional asset class. Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown of the December 31 Exodus The data reveals a broad-based retreat from major fund providers. Leading the outflows was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $99.30 million exit the fund. This was closely followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB at $76.53 million and the converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at $69.09 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also experienced notable outflows of $66.58 million. Several other funds contributed to the total, including Bitwise’s BITB ($13.76M), the newer Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ($11.24M), VanEck’s HODL ($6.79M), and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC ($5.05M). This collective action suggests a sector-wide shift in sentiment rather than an issue isolated to a single fund. To provide immediate clarity, the following table summarizes the key outflow figures from the major funds involved: ETF Ticker Fund Provider Net Outflow (Dec. 31) IBIT BlackRock $99.30 Million ARKB Ark Invest $76.53 Million GBTC Grayscale $69.09 Million FBTC Fidelity $66.58 Million BITB Bitwise $13.76 Million Market analysts often scrutinize such flow data for several reasons. Firstly, it serves as a direct gauge of institutional and retail investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. Secondly, consistent outflows can pressure the underlying Bitcoin price, as authorized participants may sell Bitcoin holdings to meet redemption requests. Consequently, this single day’s activity warrants examination within the context of year-end portfolio rebalancing and broader macroeconomic conditions. Contextualizing the Shift in Cryptocurrency Investment Trends The reported outflows did not occur in a vacuum. They directly reversed the net inflows recorded just one day prior, demonstrating the rapid sentiment shifts characteristic of digital asset markets. Several concurrent factors likely influenced this capital movement. Primarily, the final trading day of the calendar year often sees significant portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and profit-taking as investors lock in positions before the new fiscal period begins. Digital assets, known for their volatility, frequently experience amplified effects from these seasonal financial behaviors. Furthermore, the broader macroeconomic landscape in late December provided a complex backdrop. Traders were assessing the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory, inflation data, and global economic indicators. Typically, such uncertainty prompts a flight to stability, potentially disadvantaging perceived risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, the performance of the spot Bitcoin ETF sector since its landmark SEC approval in January 2024 has been a story of explosive growth followed by periods of consolidation. This outflow event may represent a natural cooling-off phase after a year of intense accumulation by some funds. Expert Analysis on Fund Flows and Market Structure Financial researchers emphasize that daily flow data, while insightful, represents just one metric in a complex ecosystem. The long-term viability of spot Bitcoin ETFs depends on sustained adoption, liquidity, and their integration into diversified portfolios. The participation of traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity inherently brings a new level of scrutiny and a different investor base—one potentially more sensitive to short-term performance and regulatory headlines than long-term crypto natives. Historical data from other asset classes shows that new ETF products frequently experience volatility in their flow patterns during early adoption phases. The key metric for analysts is the cumulative net flow over extended periods, such as quarters or full years, rather than isolated daily figures. Nevertheless, large single-day outflows from multiple major providers simultaneously signal a coordinated shift in short-term risk assessment among a segment of the investor base. This could be linked to profit-taking after a quarterly rally or positioning ahead of anticipated market-moving events in early 2025. Potential Impacts and Forward-Looking Implications for Digital Assets The immediate impact of substantial ETF outflows is multifaceted. On the technical side, it creates sell pressure on the underlying Bitcoin held by these funds. Authorized Participants (APs) facilitating the redemptions must sell Bitcoin on the open market to raise cash, potentially contributing to downward price momentum. However, the mature and deep liquidity of the Bitcoin market often absorbs such flows with muted price impact, especially when compared to the market capitalization of Bitcoin itself. For the ETF ecosystem, persistent outflows could influence competitive dynamics. Funds with lower fee structures or stronger brand loyalty among crypto investors might demonstrate more resilience. The flow data also informs regulatory perspectives. Policymakers monitor these products for signs of investor protection risks or market instability. A pattern of extreme volatility in fund flows could become a point of discussion in future regulatory reviews, even as the products themselves function precisely as designed—providing transparent, daily liquidity. Looking ahead, market participants will monitor several indicators: Flow Reversal: Whether inflows resume in early January, suggesting the outflows were a year-end anomaly. Price Correlation: The strength of the correlation between ETF flow data and Bitcoin’s spot price. Competitive Shifts: If capital begins rotating between different spot Bitcoin ETFs based on fees or strategy. Macro Sensitivity: How clearly these funds act as a barometer for broader risk appetite in equity and bond markets. Conclusion The $348.34 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 31 serves as a potent reminder of the evolving and sometimes unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. While a single day’s data does not define a trend, it underscores the importance of context, including tax considerations, macroeconomic signals, and the natural ebb and flow of capital in regulated markets. For investors, these Bitcoin ETF outflows highlight the necessity of a long-term perspective and an understanding of the structural factors influencing short-term capital movements. As the asset class matures, the transparency provided by daily flow reporting will remain a crucial tool for assessing market health and investor sentiment. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed from an ETF exceeds the value of new shares created. This means more investors are selling their ETF shares than buying, leading the fund’s manager to sell some of the underlying Bitcoin to return cash to those exiting investors. Q2: Could these outflows cause the price of Bitcoin to drop? They can contribute to downward pressure. Authorized Participants selling Bitcoin to fulfill redemption requests adds sell orders to the market. However, Bitcoin’s price is influenced by many factors globally, so ETF flows are one component among many, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and broader market sentiment. Q3: Is it unusual for new ETFs to experience volatile flows? No, it is relatively common. New investment products, especially in a novel asset class like cryptocurrency, often see periods of heavy inflows followed by consolidation or outflows as early investors take profits and the market seeks a stable level of adoption. Analysts look at longer-term cumulative flows for a clearer picture. Q4: Why might investors choose to sell a spot Bitcoin ETF at year-end? Common reasons include tax-loss harvesting (selling at a loss to offset capital gains taxes), portfolio rebalancing to maintain target asset allocations, and profit-taking to lock in gains before closing the financial year’s books. Q5: How does Grayscale’s GBTC outflow compare to the newer ETFs? Grayscale’s GBTC, which converted from a closed-end trust to an ETF, has a unique history. It often shows different flow patterns due to its previously large discount to net asset value and its higher fee structure compared to newer competitors. Its outflows may represent a continued rotation into lower-fee alternatives, as well as general market sentiment.

According to definitive data from analytics firm TraderT, these funds collectively experienced net outflows totaling $72.11 million. This pivot occurred merely one day after the products posted net inflows, highlighting the volatile and sentiment-driven nature of early-stage crypto investment vehicles. The data provides a crucial, real-time snapshot of institutional and retail investor behavior following the landmark regulatory approval of these funds. Breaking Down the $72.1M Ethereum ETF Outflow TraderT’s granular data reveals the specific contributions from each major fund issuer. The outflows were not isolated to a single provider but represented a broad-based shift. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETHE) led the movement with a substantial withdrawal of $31.98 million. Furthermore, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) saw outflows of $21.56 million. VanEck’s Ethereum ETF (ETHV) followed with $14.1 million exiting the fund. Smaller but notable outflows also came from Franklin Templeton’s Ethereum ETF (EZET) at $2.25 million and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) at $2.22 million. This distribution indicates a market-wide reaction rather than a loss of confidence in a specific issuer. The collective movement underscores how macroeconomic factors or Ethereum-specific news can trigger simultaneous responses across competing financial products. Contextualizing the Sudden Shift in ETF Flows The reversal from inflows to outflows demands analysis within a broader market framework. Spot Ethereum ETFs only began trading in the United States in mid-2024, following a protracted regulatory process. Consequently, their flow data remains a primary indicator of direct, regulated investor exposure to Ether’s price. Daily flow volatility is common for new asset classes, yet the magnitude of this shift is noteworthy. Several contextual factors may have influenced investor decisions on July 31. First, broader cryptocurrency market sentiment often dictates ETF activity. A slight downturn in Bitcoin’s price or negative regulatory headlines can cause ripple effects. Second, profit-taking after a period of inflows is a standard market mechanism. Investors may have captured gains following Ethereum’s price appreciation after the ETF launch. Finally, competing yield opportunities in traditional finance, like rising bond rates, can temporarily draw capital away from perceived riskier assets like crypto. Expert Perspective on Flow Volatility Market analysts emphasize that daily flow data, while insightful, represents just one piece of a larger puzzle. “For any new ETF, especially in the digital asset space, we expect periods of consolidation after initial enthusiasm,” notes a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. The report suggests that flow volatility should normalize as the market matures and assets under management (AUM) grow. The true test for these products will be their sustained AUM growth over quarterly and annual horizons, not daily fluctuations. Historical data from the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024, provides a relevant comparison. Those funds also experienced significant daily flow volatility in their first months, including multi-day outflow streaks, before stabilizing and reaching record cumulative inflows. This pattern suggests the Ethereum ETF market may simply be following a similar maturation trajectory, with early investors adjusting their positions. Impact and Implications for the Digital Asset Market The immediate impact of $72.1 million leaving Ethereum ETFs is multifaceted. On a direct level, ETF issuers must manage the liquidity to facilitate these redemptions, typically by selling a corresponding amount of the underlying Ether held in custody. This activity can create slight selling pressure on the spot market, although the amount is relatively small compared to Ethereum’s total daily trading volume, which often exceeds $10 billion. More significantly, the flow data serves as a transparent gauge of institutional appetite. Persistent outflows could signal cooling interest or concern about near-term price prospects. Conversely, a quick return to inflows would indicate strong underlying demand. Regulators and traditional finance observers closely monitor this data to assess the real-world demand for crypto-based financial products beyond speculative trading. The Role of Data Providers Like TraderT The availability of timely, accurate flow data is itself a sign of market maturation. Firms like TraderT compile information from public filings and direct sources, providing transparency that was previously lacking in crypto markets. This data empowers all market participants—from retail investors to large institutions—to make more informed decisions. It also holds ETF issuers accountable for their performance and operational efficiency, fostering a more competitive and investor-friendly landscape. Conclusion The reported $72.1 million in net outflows from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on July 31 marks a notable, though not unprecedented, moment in the evolution of crypto-based exchange-traded funds. This event highlights the inherent volatility and sensitivity of these new investment vehicles to broader market sentiment. While daily movements capture headlines, the long-term viability of Ethereum ETFs will depend on sustained adoption, regulatory clarity, and Ethereum’s underlying utility development. Investors should view such flow data as one critical metric among many, considering it within the wider context of portfolio strategy and market cycles. FAQs Q1: What does “net outflow” mean for an Ethereum ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the total value of shares redeemed (sold) by investors exceeds the total value of shares purchased (created) on a given day. It means more money left the fund than entered it. Q2: Are these outflows a sign that Ethereum ETFs are failing? A2: Not necessarily. Daily or weekly flow volatility is common, especially for new ETFs. Analysts consider long-term trends in Assets Under Management (AUM) more significant than single-day movements for assessing overall success. Q3: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A3: To meet redemption requests, authorized participants may need to sell some of the underlying ETH held by the fund. This can create minor selling pressure on the spot market, but the effect is typically minimal compared to the total global trading volume of ETH. Q4: Which Ethereum ETF had the largest outflow on July 31? A4: According to TraderT data, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETHE) experienced the largest single outflow at $31.98 million. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on ETF flows? A5: Data is compiled by specialized analytics firms like TraderT, Bloomberg, and ETF.com. Many financial news platforms and the fund issuers themselves also report flow figures, though often with a one-day lag.

The network deployed a record 8.7 million smart contracts in a single quarter, according to a Token Terminal chart shared by Ethereum analyst Joseph Young. The figure is an all-time high and breaks the previous quarterly record of around 6 million contracts set in the second quarter of 2021. Developer Revival In his latest post on X, Young said that steady growth in contract deployments across multiple quarters is difficult to artificially inflate, which essentially means that the current trend reflects genuine, organic demand rather than short-term speculation. He attributed the surge mainly to the rapid expansion of rollups and Layer 2 networks, alongside rising activity in real-world asset (RWA) issuance, stablecoins, and wallet infrastructure, including intent-based systems. The data is particularly important given Ethereum’s recent history. Contract deployments had been trending sharply lower through 2024 and much of 2025. In 2024, quarterly deployments struggled to exceed 1.5 million, while the final quarter of that year saw just over 528,000 new contracts, the latter being the weakest level since 2017. Even in 2025, deployments fell from nearly 6 million in the first quarter to 3.1 million by the third quarter. Against this backdrop, the current spike is a clear reversal, which brings total lifetime contracts deployed on Ethereum to roughly 91.7 million. Renewed Momentum As a broader sign of renewed network momentum, Ethereum has also seen a rise in on-chain usage alongside falling costs. Data compiled by Etherscan revealed that the mainnet recently processed approximately 2.2 million transactions in a single day, which is yet another new record, while average transaction fees have dropped to around $0.17. This contrasts sharply with May 2022, when fees regularly exceeded $200 per transaction. Protocol upgrades in 2025, including Pectra and Fusaka, have improved validator efficiency and increased the gas limit, and have helped Ethereum handle higher activity at lower cost. Additionally, CryptoQuant found that total transfer counts climbed to around 1.06 million on December 29, a level not seen since October 2023. The metric became increasingly volatile in the final quarter of 2025 and broke away from the relatively stable activity seen earlier in the year. The rise in transfers has come even as ETH’s price remained below its yearly highs.

This pivotal listing bridges the established world of physical gold with South Korea’s dynamic crypto economy, offering investors a regulated, asset-backed digital alternative. Consequently, the integration provides a novel hedge against market volatility within a familiar trading environment. Bithumb’s Tether Gold Listing Expands Digital Asset Horizons Bithumb’s decision to list Tether Gold represents a calculated expansion of its trading portfolio. The exchange, one of South Korea’s largest and most regulated platforms, now provides direct KRW access to a tokenized gold product. Each XAUT token is physically backed by one fine troy ounce of gold stored in a Swiss vault. Therefore, this listing directly responds to growing investor demand for stable, tangible assets within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Market analysts view this as a strategic play to attract both traditional gold investors and crypto natives seeking asset diversification. Furthermore, the timing aligns with global economic trends. Central banks worldwide have been increasing their gold reserves. Simultaneously, cryptocurrency markets have matured, seeking legitimacy through asset-backed tokens. Bithumb’s move positions it at the intersection of these two powerful financial currents. The exchange facilitates easier entry for South Korean investors into the digital gold market without the complexities of international bullion storage or custody. Understanding Tether Gold and Its Market Impact Tether Gold (XAUT) operates as a digital representation of physical gold ownership. Tether International Ltd. issues the ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Crucially, each token corresponds to one troy ounce of gold on a London Good Delivery bar. The company publishes regular attestations from third-party auditors to verify the reserves. This transparency model has become a cornerstone for asset-backed stablecoins and tokens. The listing’s immediate impact includes several key developments: Enhanced Portfolio Options: South Korean traders can now diversify with a non-correlated asset directly from their Bithumb KRW wallets. Regulatory Alignment: Listing a fully reserved, audited asset supports South Korea’s strict financial regulatory framework for virtual assets. Market Accessibility: It lowers the barrier to gold investment, removing minimum purchase amounts and storage fees associated with physical bullion. For comparison, here is how XAUT contrasts with other gold exposure methods available in South Korea: Method Accessibility Custody Liquidity Physical Gold Bars/Coins Low (requires specialist dealer) Personal/Bank Vault Low Gold ETFs (e.g., on KOSPI) High (stock brokerage account) Central Securities Depository High (Market Hours) Tether Gold (XAUT) on Bithumb High (crypto exchange account) Swiss Vault + Blockchain High (24/7) Expert Analysis on the South Korean Crypto Landscape Industry experts point to this listing as part of a broader trend. “South Korea’s crypto market is maturing beyond pure speculation,” notes Dr. Min-ji Park, a fintech researcher at Seoul National University. “Investors are actively seeking assets with intrinsic value and lower volatility. The listing of a product like XAUT on a major domestic exchange is a logical step. It provides a familiar, compliant on-ramp for a store-of-value asset.” This perspective is supported by trading volume data from 2024, which showed increasing Korean investor interest in commodity-backed tokens on international platforms. Moreover, Bithumb’s compliance history plays a crucial role. The exchange has successfully navigated South Korea’s rigorous regulatory environment, implementing real-name verification and partnering with domestic banks. Listing an audited, asset-backed token like XAUT further strengthens its reputation as a trustworthy platform. This action builds authoritativeness and trustworthiness with both users and regulators. The Strategic Rationale Behind the XAUT Integration Bithumb’s listing strategy involves careful market analysis. South Korean investors have historically shown a strong affinity for gold as a safe-haven asset. However, the traditional purchase and storage process involves friction. By integrating XAUT, Bithumb digitizes this centuries-old investment. Users can buy, sell, or hold fractional ounces of gold instantly. The blockchain settlement provides a transparent and immutable record of ownership. Operationally, the exchange has prepared its infrastructure for the new asset pair. This preparation includes ensuring sufficient liquidity, updating trading engine protocols, and briefing customer support teams. The goal is a seamless user experience that mirrors trading any other major cryptocurrency on the platform. Additionally, Bithumb likely conducted extensive legal reviews to ensure the listing meets all guidelines from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) regarding virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Potential Implications for the Broader Crypto Economy This single listing carries wider implications for the cryptocurrency sector. First, it validates the model of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Success in a market as significant as South Korea could encourage other global exchanges to follow suit. Second, it demonstrates a pathway for crypto exchanges to offer products that appeal to conservative capital. This appeal is essential for the next phase of institutional adoption. Finally, it introduces a new dynamic for the Korean won trading pairs. Typically dominated by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the KRW market now includes a major commodity token. This inclusion could stabilize trading volumes during periods of extreme volatility in purely digital assets. It provides a built-off ramp within the crypto ecosystem that is still tied to a globally recognized value benchmark. Conclusion Bithumb’s listing of Tether Gold (XAUT) for KRW trading marks a definitive step in the evolution of South Korea’s digital asset marketplace. The move strategically combines the timeless value of gold with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It offers investors a compliant, accessible, and liquid method to gain gold exposure. Ultimately, this development underscores the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency exchanges as they bridge traditional finance with digital innovation. The successful integration of XAUT could set a precedent for future asset-backed token listings globally. FAQs Q1: What is Tether Gold (XAUT) and how is it backed? A1: Tether Gold (XAUT) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token. Each XAUT token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of physical gold. This gold is stored in a professional vault in Switzerland. Tether publishes regular proof-of-reserve reports from independent auditors to verify the backing. Q2: Why is Bithumb’s listing of XAUT significant for South Korean investors? A2: The listing is significant because it provides direct, 24/7 access to a digital gold asset using the South Korean won. It simplifies the investment process, removes physical storage concerns, and allows for fractional ownership. This makes gold investment more accessible within a regulated domestic exchange environment. Q3: How does trading XAUT on Bithumb differ from buying a gold ETF on the Korean stock exchange? A3: The key differences are trading hours and custody. XAUT trades 24/7 on Bithumb, while ETFs trade during stock market hours. Furthermore, XAUT ownership is recorded on the blockchain and represents a direct claim on specific vaulted gold. An ETF represents a share in a fund that holds gold, with custody managed by financial institutions. Q4: What are the risks associated with investing in Tether Gold? A4: Primary risks include counterparty risk related to the custodian holding the gold, smart contract risk on the Ethereum blockchain, and the regulatory risk inherent to digital assets. Although the gold is audited, investors must trust the custodian and issuer. The token’s price will also correlate with the global spot price of gold, introducing market risk. Q5: Does this listing indicate a trend for other cryptocurrency exchanges? A5: Yes, the listing of real-world asset (RWA) tokens like XAUT is a growing trend globally.

She also pointed to RSI behavior on the daily chart. Momentum remains below neutral, but it is no longer trending downward. Tara noted that “RSI is trying to break up.” That detail is crucial because RSI often turns before the price. RSI strength without price confirmation does not complete a move. However, it reduces downside pressure. Combined with flat trend support, this suggests stabilization. The chart shows XRP respecting the same zone across several sessions, and building a bullish setup on the daily chart . Buyers continue to defend that area. Sellers fail to push the price lower without a rebound. This balance keeps XRP compressed, and compression near support often precedes expansion. The breakout direction will depend on the close. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Importance of the Daily Close Tara made the condition clear. A bullish daily close above the moving average would change the short-term outlook. She stated that if “TODAY ends bullish and closes above the MA ($1.88), it could help fuel the next wave up to the $2.3 (Fib. 0.382) level.” That level aligns with the next Fibonacci retracement on her chart. The emphasis remains on the close, not intraday wicks. The asset currently trades at $1.84. A clean close above the MA would place XRP back above macro support and trend guidance. That would shift control toward buyers and open the path toward $2.30 and other higher targets . However, a failure to close above $1.88 could keep XRP within the current range. The price may continue to move sideways while momentum builds. That outcome delays the upside but does not invalidate the structure Tara highlighted.

According to aggregated exchange data from March 2025, the collective ratio across Binance, OKX, and Bybit showed traders maintaining nearly equal long and short exposure, with a marginal 50.92% to 49.08% split favoring long positions. This equilibrium emerges during a critical technical juncture for Bitcoin, providing valuable insight into professional trader psychology and potential price direction. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios Perpetual futures contracts represent one of cryptocurrency’s most sophisticated trading instruments, allowing participants to speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction without expiration dates. The long/short ratio specifically measures the percentage of open positions betting on price increases versus those anticipating declines. Market analysts universally monitor this metric because it reveals collective trader sentiment and potential contrarian signals. When ratios become extremely skewed in either direction, they often precede market reversals as overcrowded trades unwind. The current data shows remarkable balance across all three major platforms, suggesting neither bulls nor bears have established clear dominance. Derivatives trading volume has consistently grown since 2020, with perpetual futures now accounting for approximately 70% of all cryptocurrency derivatives activity according to CryptoCompare’s 2024 annual report. This dominance makes perpetual futures metrics particularly significant for understanding institutional and professional trader positioning. The three exchanges analyzed—Binance, OKX, and Bybit—collectively represent over 85% of global cryptocurrency derivatives open interest, making their aggregated data highly representative of overall market sentiment. Exchange-Specific Analysis of BTC Positioning Each major exchange displays slightly different trader behavior, though all maintain similar equilibrium patterns. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, shows the most balanced ratio at 49.77% long versus 50.23% short. This near-perfect balance suggests Binance traders remain particularly cautious, unwilling to commit strongly to either directional bias. OKX traders exhibit slightly more bearish positioning at 49.17% long versus 50.83% short, while Bybit shows similar sentiment at 49.16% long versus 50.84% short. The consistency across platforms indicates this is a broad market phenomenon rather than exchange-specific behavior. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios (24-Hour Period) Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 49.77% 50.23% -0.46% (Slightly Bearish) OKX 49.17% 50.83% -1.66% (Bearish) Bybit 49.16% 50.84% -1.68% (Bearish) Overall 50.92% 49.08% +1.84% (Slightly Bullish) Interestingly, the aggregated data shows a slight long bias overall despite individual exchanges displaying short biases. This mathematical outcome occurs because exchanges have different total open interest values, with Binance’s massive volume weighting the overall calculation. The divergence between exchange-specific and aggregated ratios highlights the importance of considering both perspectives when analyzing market sentiment. Traders should note that these ratios represent snapshots rather than predictions, reflecting current positioning that can change rapidly with market developments. Historical Context and Market Implications Current ratios exist within a broader historical pattern that provides essential context for interpretation. During Bitcoin’s 2021 bull market peak, long/short ratios frequently exceeded 70% long across major exchanges, indicating extreme bullish euphoria that preceded significant corrections. Conversely, during the November 2022 market bottom following the FTX collapse, ratios dropped below 30% long as panic selling dominated derivatives markets. The present equilibrium sits between these extremes, suggesting neither excessive fear nor greed currently drives trader decisions. Several technical and fundamental factors likely contribute to this balanced sentiment. Bitcoin has traded within a relatively narrow range for multiple weeks, lacking clear directional momentum that would encourage strong positioning. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding interest rate policies and geopolitical tensions creates hesitation among institutional traders. The balanced ratios may indicate that professional traders await clearer signals before committing to stronger directional bets. Market technicians often interpret such equilibrium as potential consolidation before a significant price movement, though the direction remains uncertain. Expert Analysis of Derivatives Market Psychology Seasoned derivatives traders recognize that balanced long/short ratios often precede increased volatility. When positioning becomes too balanced, even minor catalysts can trigger disproportionate moves as one side capitulates. According to derivatives analysts at Amberdata, similar balanced ratios in Q4 2023 preceded Bitcoin’s 28% rally over the following month. The current environment shares characteristics with that period, including reduced leverage across platforms and cautious institutional participation. Funding rates provide additional context for interpreting long/short ratios. These periodic payments between long and short positions help keep perpetual contract prices aligned with spot markets. Currently, funding rates across all three exchanges remain near neutral, neither strongly positive nor negative. This neutrality supports the balanced sentiment indicated by position ratios, creating a market environment where neither side pays significant premiums to maintain positions. Such conditions typically persist until new information enters the market, breaking the equilibrium. Risk Management Considerations for Traders Professional traders utilize long/short ratio data within comprehensive risk management frameworks rather than as standalone signals. The current balanced ratios suggest several practical implications for market participants. First, reduced directional bias means trend-following strategies may underperform until clearer momentum emerges. Second, options traders might consider strategies that benefit from volatility expansion rather than directional bets. Third, the equilibrium indicates that stop-loss orders may cluster near current price levels, potentially creating liquidity pools that accelerate moves when breaks occur. Several key risk factors warrant monitoring alongside ratio developments: Leverage levels: Current estimated leverage ratios remain moderate compared to historical extremes Options positioning: Put/call ratios show slightly more hedging activity than directional speculation Spot market flows: Exchange net flows have been neutral to slightly positive despite derivatives caution Macro correlations: Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional risk assets has decreased recently These factors collectively paint a picture of cautious but not fearful market participation. The balanced long/short ratios reflect this psychology, with traders maintaining exposure while avoiding excessive risk in either direction. This positioning allows flexibility to respond to new developments while limiting downside during unexpected volatility. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across Binance, OKX, and Bybit reveals a market in careful equilibrium during March 2025. With overall positioning showing a marginal 50.92% to 49.08% split favoring longs, and individual exchanges displaying slight short biases, professional traders demonstrate cautious participation without strong directional conviction. This balanced sentiment emerges during Bitcoin’s consolidation phase and may precede increased volatility as new catalysts emerge. Market participants should monitor ratio developments alongside leverage metrics, funding rates, and spot market flows for comprehensive understanding. The current BTC perpetual futures landscape suggests neither bulls nor bears control market narrative, creating conditions where unexpected developments could trigger significant price movements in either direction. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measure? The ratio measures the percentage of open perpetual futures contracts positioned for price increases (long) versus decreases (short). It provides insight into collective trader sentiment and potential market direction. Q2: Why are Binance, OKX, and Bybit specifically analyzed? These three exchanges collectively represent over 85% of global cryptocurrency derivatives open interest, making their aggregated data highly representative of overall market sentiment among professional and institutional traders. Q3: How often do long/short ratios change significantly? Ratios can change rapidly with market developments, though major shifts typically require substantial catalysts. Daily monitoring provides the most current sentiment picture, while weekly trends reveal broader positioning changes. Q4: What historical patterns exist with extreme long/short ratios? Historically, ratios above 70% long often precede corrections due to overcrowded bullish positioning, while ratios below 30% long sometimes indicate capitulation bottoms. Current balanced ratios suggest neither extreme sentiment prevails. Q5: How should traders use long/short ratio data in decision-making? Professional traders use ratios as one component of comprehensive analysis alongside technical indicators, fundamentals, and risk metrics. Balanced ratios like current levels suggest employing strategies that benefit from volatility expansion rather than strong directional bets.

Key Takeaways: An October flash crash erased billions from the net worth of top crypto executives after early-year gains. Michael Saylor, CZ, and the Winklevoss twins were among the hardest hit as Bitcoin and crypto stocks fell sharply. Despite volatility, corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to rise, with 192 public companies now holding BTC. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index published on Wednesday, Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, lost $2.6 billion over the past 12 months, reducing his net worth to $3.8 billion. The losses followed an October flash crash that sent Bitcoin and crypto-linked equities sharply lower after months of strong performance. Bitcoin Pullback Wipes Out Gains From Strategy’s Aggressive Treasury Bet Bloomberg noted that Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy delivered outsized gains through early October, when Bitcoin reached fresh record highs. That momentum quickly reversed as Bitcoin prices slid, dragging Strategy’s share price down by more than 50% and cutting nearly $6 billion from Saylor’s net worth from its peak. Other major crypto figures were also hit. Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, saw his fortune decline by about 5% since Jan. 1, leaving his estimated net worth at $50.9 billion, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss were among the hardest hit, with the twins losing roughly 59% of their combined wealth over the same period as crypto prices slid and trading volumes cooled. The losses stood in contrast to broader billionaire wealth trends. Bloomberg reported that just eight individuals accounted for roughly 25% of the $2.2 trillion in total gains among billionaires in 2025, underscoring how uneven the year was across industries. Did you destroy all your shareholders and lose $7b this year or not? pic.twitter.com/FfZLWcVNFD — lil retard (@comic) December 31, 2025 Not all crypto-linked executives fared poorly. Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of stablecoin issuer Circle, reportedly increased his net worth by 149% since June, buoyed by growing interest in dollar-backed stablecoins and the passage of the US GENIUS Act, which established a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Despite the volatility, corporate interest in digital asset treasuries continued to grow. Data from Bitcointreasuries.net shows that 192 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up sharply from a year earlier. Bitcoin itself remains under pressure. The cryptocurrency is down about 7% since the start of 2025, after peaking above $126,000 in October before falling to around $80,000 by late November. Bitwise CIO Sticks to Bullish 2026 Bitcoin Outlook Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan has downplayed expectations that US politics will drive the next leg higher. While Bitcoin rallied to fresh highs earlier in 2025 following Donald Trump’s inauguration, Hougan said the administration is unlikely to unlock significant new upside. Looking ahead to 2026, the industry remains divided. Fidelity’s director of global macro research, Jurrien Timmer, has suggested 2026 could be a pause year, with prices potentially sliding toward $65,000. Others remain more optimistic. Strategy CEO Phong Le has argued that Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals held up throughout 2025 despite weaker prices, while Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier this year that he expects 2026 to be an “up year” for the asset. According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data.

This historic influx, reported by data analytics firm Farside Investors, underscores a decisive move by institutional and retail investors toward regulated digital asset exposure. Consequently, these funds have cemented their role as a cornerstone of modern portfolio strategy. Spot Crypto ETFs Dominate 2025 Investment Flows The annual data reveals a clear hierarchy of investor preference within the digital asset ecosystem. Spot Bitcoin ETFs emerged as the undisputed leader, attracting $21.4 billion. Following closely, spot Ethereum ETFs gathered $9.6 billion, demonstrating robust demand for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the newer spot Solana (SOL) ETFs, launched later in the year, posted a notable $765 million in inflows. This distribution highlights a continued focus on established market leaders while showcasing appetite for select altcoins. Analysts point to several key drivers for this record year. First, regulatory clarity following the 2024 approvals provided a stable framework. Second, major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity brought immense credibility. Finally, the convenience of brokerage account access removed significant technical barriers for traditional investors. Therefore, the 2025 figures represent the culmination of a multi-year trend toward financialization. BlackRock’s IBIT Secures a Commanding Market Lead Within the competitive ETF arena, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) achieved a dominant position. The fund alone captured $24.7 billion of the annual inflows, a figure that surpasses the total net inflows for the entire spot crypto ETF category in many previous quarters. This performance solidifies BlackRock’s first-mover advantage and marketing prowess. The success of IBIT can be attributed to BlackRock’s unparalleled distribution network and brand trust. Many financial advisors, already familiar with the iShares ecosystem, readily allocated client funds to IBIT. Furthermore, the fund’s substantial assets under management quickly provided deep liquidity, creating a positive feedback loop that attracted more capital. As a result, the competitive landscape now features a clear titan. ETF Provider Fund Ticker Primary Asset 2025 Net Inflows (Approx.) BlackRock IBIT Bitcoin $24.7B Fidelity FBTC Bitcoin Data Pending ARK Invest/21Shares ARKB Bitcoin Data Pending Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin Converted from Trust Analysts Note a Recent Slowdown in Momentum Despite the explosive annual totals, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode observed a deceleration in demand over the final month of 2025. This cooling period aligns with typical year-end portfolio rebalancing and reduced trading activity. Glassnode analysts subsequently project a modest start to 2026, anticipating a period of consolidation before potential renewed interest. This pattern is not uncommon in new financial markets. After a period of intense capital deployment, investors often pause to assess performance and macroeconomic conditions. Key factors for 2026 include interest rate trajectories, broader equity market performance, and potential regulatory developments for other digital assets. Thus, the slowdown may represent a natural market breather. The Broader Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets The sustained inflows have had a profound structural impact on the underlying crypto markets. The spot ETF model requires issuers to purchase and custody the actual cryptocurrency, creating a constant source of buy-side pressure. This mechanism differs significantly from futures-based products and directly reduces the available liquid supply. Price Discovery: ETFs have integrated crypto price action more closely with traditional finance. Volatility Dampening: Large, steady institutional buys can reduce extreme price swings. Custody Standards: Demand for secure, regulated custody solutions has skyrocketed. Regulatory Dialogue: Success has fostered more constructive talks between the crypto industry and regulators. Moreover, the ETF wrapper has provided a crucial bridge. Pension funds, endowments, and registered investment advisors now have a compliant pathway to gain exposure. This institutionalization process, while gradual, is fundamentally changing the asset class’s profile from speculative to strategic. Looking Ahead to the 2026 Landscape The stage is set for an evolving narrative in the new year. Market participants will watch several developments closely. First, the performance of spot Solana ETFs will test demand for crypto diversification beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Second, applications for spot ETFs tracking other digital assets may emerge, depending on regulatory receptiveness. Furthermore, the fee war among issuers is likely to intensify as they compete for market share in a potentially slower growth environment. Finally, the integration of these ETFs into model portfolios and target-date funds could provide a new, automated stream of inflows. Ultimately, 2025 proved these vehicles are not a passing trend but a permanent fixture. Conclusion The $31.8 billion in net inflows for U.S. spot crypto ETFs in 2025 marks a historic milestone for financial market integration. Led by dominant players like BlackRock’s IBIT, these funds have successfully channeled institutional capital into Bitcoin and Ethereum, reshaping market dynamics. While recent momentum shows signs of moderation, the foundational shift toward regulated, accessible digital asset investment is undeniable. The performance of these spot crypto ETFs will remain a critical barometer for mainstream adoption as the market advances into 2026 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What are spot crypto ETFs? Spot crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold the actual underlying cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This allows investors to gain price exposure without directly buying, storing, or securing the digital assets themselves. Q2: How much money did Bitcoin ETFs specifically bring in during 2025? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $21.4 billion in net new inflows in 2025, representing the largest share of the total $31.77 billion gathered by the overall spot crypto ETF category. Q3: Why is BlackRock’s IBIT so dominant? BlackRock’s IBIT benefits from the firm’s massive scale, trusted brand among institutional investors, and extensive distribution network through financial advisors. Its early lead in gathering assets created a liquidity advantage that attracted further investment. Q4: What does the recent slowdown in inflows mean? Analysts from Glassnode noted a slowdown in the past month, which is typical during year-end periods. It may indicate a phase of consolidation after a record year, as investors assess the macroeconomic climate before committing new capital. Q5: How do ETF inflows affect the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum? Spot ETF issuers must buy the actual cryptocurrency to back their shares. This creates consistent, direct buying pressure in the market, which can support prices and reduce the circulating supply available to other traders.

David Doung X post Duong said 2025 was a turning point in how digital assets are accessed and used. Spot crypto ETFs provided regulated on-ramps for both retail and institutional investors, while digital asset treasury strategies became a new way for corporations to hold crypto on their balance sheets. At the same time, tokenization and stablecoins moved beyond experimentation and into more practical financial workflows, particularly in payments, settlements, and collateral management. He expects these developments to build on each other in 2026 as ETF approval timelines shorten, stablecoins play a larger role in delivery-versus-payment structures, and tokenized collateral becomes more widely accepted in traditional transactions. Despite volatile markets, Duong explained that global crypto adoption stayed relatively steady over recent years. Data from analytics platform Demand Sage shows adoption hovering around 10% between early 2023 and early 2025, suggesting a resilient user base that extends beyond short-term speculative cycles. According to Duong, this stability suggests that there is a more mature market structure than in crypto’s early years. Global crypto adoption statistics (Source: Demand Sage ) Regulation was another central theme in Duong’s outlook. He mentioned clearer global frameworks as a key driver behind crypto’s shift from a niche asset class toward an emerging layer of financial infrastructure. In the United States, policymakers focused on stablecoin oversight and market structure clarity through initiatives like the GENIUS Act. In Europe, regulators consolidated rules under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, or MiCA. Duong said these developments are less about restriction and more about operational readiness, which gives institutions clearer guardrails to manage risk, compliance, and product design. He also believes that crypto demand is no longer driven by a single narrative. Instead, it is a mix of macroeconomic pressures, technological progress, and geopolitical considerations, with a growing share of long-term allocators shaping market behavior. Over time, Duong believes this shift could support more durable capital flows and reduce purely speculative churn.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-01 07:00:00

The meme coin leader has slipped into a persistent d own trend, pushing its price to a 14-month low. A key factor behind the decline has been long-term holders. These holders were expected to provide stability. Instead, their actions have amplified d own side momentum for DOGE. How Are Dogecoin Holders Causing Losses? On-chain indicators reflect grow ing pessimism among Dogecoin holders. Liveliness, a metric that tracks the spending behavior of long-term holders, has dropped sharply. The indicator is now sitting at a four-month low. Such levels often suggest a surge in token movement after long periods of inactivity. The decline in Liveliness points to selling pressure from long-term holders. These holders typically sell when confidence weakens. In many cases, liquidation occurs to limit further losses. This behavior contrasts with accumulation phases, where holders keep coins dormant. Dogecoin Liveliness – Source – Glassnode If Dogecoin’s price continues to fall, selling pressure could intensify. Long-term holders may accelerate exits if losses deepen. Historically, this pattern has prolonged bearish phases. However, Liveliness alone does not guarantee future price direction. Broader market conditions remain influential. Will Dogecoin Price Manage To Recover? Dogecoin is currently changing hands just above the $0.121 support level. This zone has acted as a short-term floor on the two-day chart. Despite this, buying interest remains limited. The price has struggled to attract enough conviction for a sustained rebound. Continued selling from long-term holders could break this support. A drop below $0.121 may send DOGE toward $0.115. Such a move would extend the existing two-month d own trend. Technical weakness could further erode market confidence. Dogecoin Price – Source – TradingView A shift in holder behavior could alter this outlook. If long-term holders pause selling and choose to hold, supply pressure would ease. Reduced selling could allow price stabilization. In that scenario, DOGE may attempt a recovery. Reclaiming $0.131 as support would be critical for trend reversal signals. Why Would Exiting DOGE Holders Prefer Minotaurus (MTAUR) Instead? The Dogecoin holders who are selling their holdings due to climbing losses might look into alternative altcoins. The likely candidate would be new tokens like the gaming token Minotaurus (MTAUR) that operates on fundamentals over hype based demand. Tokens like MTAUR focus on purpose-driven ecosystems instead of acting solely as payment instruments. Although early participation comes with greater uncertainty, it can also deliver stronger ROI during bullish market phases. Minotaurus sets itself apart by embedding its token directly into gameplay. MTAUR functions as the in-game asset for a blockchain-based maze experience. It is used to unlock regions, apply upgrades, and obtain consumables. This approach centers on tangible use cases rather than market speculation. Can Minotaurus Addresses The Safety Concern From New Tokens? Risk management is a top priority for participants considering emerging crypto projects. Minotaurus has taken steps to reinforce trust by undergoing independent audits conducted by SolidProof and Coinsult. The project also operates on Binance Smart Chain, allowing transactions to process quickly while keeping fees low. From a supply perspective, Minotaurus applies structured cliff and vesting schedules to limit sudden token releases. Only 2% of the total supply is reserved for the team. This makes Minotaurus (MTAUR) a strong candidate for holders looking to move from DOGE to new tokens. Its low price of 0.000126 USDT also provides holders with a low entry point, which will save them from the worry of losses as the price rises in the future.

The chart indicates a repeating cycle where RSI historically bounces from its moving average, triggering strong upward momentum. In previous cycles, these bounces led to sharp increases in RSI and, subsequently, the asset’s price. The chart illustrates multiple market cycles. Each cycle shows the asset’s monthly RSI rising sharply after bouncing from the moving average. This pattern occurred consistently over several years. It provided a clear momentum signal before XRP entered notable price growth phases. #XRP – Monthly RSI: pic.twitter.com/wzmiGKJiGy — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 30, 2025 Current Cycle and Initial Setback In the current cycle, the RSI initially failed to bounce at the moving average. EGRAG CRYPTO marked this as “No Bounce.” This differs from prior cycles, in which the MA successfully supported RSI. The setback suggests momentum paused temporarily. The chart shows RSI dipping below the moving average before any recovery attempt. This break highlights a weaker initial attempt to maintain momentum compared to historical cycles. Despite the initial failure, the chart includes a projection labeled “NEW Bounce.” This suggests the possibility that RSI could reclaim the moving average. If it does, the analyst anticipates a repeat of historical behavior . Previous cycles suggest that once RSI reclaims and holds above the moving average, momentum resumes strongly, driving RSI toward the upper range near 80. EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis highlights a technical setup worth monitoring. The pattern suggests that XRP may be poised for another momentum phase once the bounce occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Upside for XRP The chart connects RSI behavior with price performance. A successful reclaim of the moving average could trigger sharp RSI gains. In prior cycles, this coincided with XRP price increases. The first cycle the analyst highlighted came in 2017 and early 2018, when the asset hit its previous peak. The second occurred in 2021, when XRP rose to $1.96. However, the failed bounce occurred shortly after the asset hit its all-time high in July . The analyst’s work implies that renewed momentum could create conditions favorable for higher prices. Historical evidence in the chart shows that upward RSI moves often precede strong price rallies. Traders can monitor RSI and the moving average for confirmation. If the pattern holds, XRP may experience a significant momentum wave. The projection targets the overbought RSI range near 80. However, the asset dropped toward oversold territory before the bounce.

Bitcoin’s 2025 Decline Breaks Historical Patterns Bitcoin’s performance throughout 2025 has fundamentally challenged market assumptions. According to verified CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency failed to achieve new highs following its April 2024 halving event. This outcome directly contradicts historical precedents established after the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings. Each previous cycle saw Bitcoin reaching unprecedented price levels within 12-18 months post-halving. The 2025 decline represents the first instance where this pattern has not materialized, creating significant uncertainty among analysts and investors. Market data reveals specific concerning metrics. Bitcoin concluded December 2025 trading at approximately $88,256, representing a 30% decline from its October 6, 2024 peak of $126,080. This performance gap widens considerably when compared to previous cycles. Following the 2020 halving, Bitcoin surged over 500% within 18 months. The 2016 halving triggered a 2,800% increase over a similar timeframe. These historical comparisons highlight the unprecedented nature of the current market behavior. The Halving Cycle Theory Explained The four-year cycle theory has served as Bitcoin’s fundamental market framework since its inception. This theory connects three interrelated components: the halving event, supply dynamics, and price appreciation patterns. Every 210,000 blocks mined (approximately four years), Bitcoin’s block reward reduces by 50%. This programmed scarcity mechanism has historically triggered substantial price increases as reduced new supply meets steady or growing demand. Key historical halving events include: November 2012: Block reward decreased from 50 to 25 BTC July 2016: Block reward decreased from 25 to 12.5 BTC May 2020: Block reward decreased from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC April 2024: Block reward decreased from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC The theory gained credibility through consistent validation across three complete cycles. Each halving preceded exponential price growth, creating a self-reinforcing belief system among market participants. This psychological component became as significant as the economic fundamentals, with investors timing entries based on halving dates rather than broader market conditions. Expert Analysis on the Cycle Breakdown Vivek Sen, founder of blockchain research firm Bitgrow Lab, provided definitive commentary on the situation. “The four-year cycle is now officially over due to Bitcoin’s year-end decline,” Sen stated in an exclusive interview. “We’re witnessing a maturation of Bitcoin’s market structure where traditional patterns give way to more complex macroeconomic influences.” Several analysts echo this perspective while adding crucial context. The cryptocurrency market now represents a $1.8 trillion asset class with significantly different characteristics than during previous cycles. Institutional participation exceeds 45% of daily trading volume, regulatory frameworks have evolved substantially, and Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional financial assets has increased during periods of economic uncertainty. Comparative Market Analysis: 2025 vs Previous Cycles Cycle Period Halving Date Pre-Halving Price Post-Halving Peak Time to Peak Percentage Gain 2012-2013 Nov 28, 2012 $12 $1,163 12 months 9,592% 2016-2017 Jul 9, 2016 $650 $19,783 18 months 2,943% 2020-2021 May 11, 2020 $8,600 $68,789 18 months 700% 2024-2025 Apr 19, 2024 $63,558 $126,080 6 months 98% The tabular data reveals a clear trend of diminishing returns across cycles, with the 2024-2025 period showing the smallest percentage gain and earliest peak. This compression suggests either market efficiency improvements or fundamental changes in how Bitcoin responds to halving events. The 2025 decline following the October 2024 peak represents an unprecedented deviation, as previous cycles maintained momentum for extended periods after initial peaks. Structural Market Changes Impacting Bitcoin Multiple structural factors have converged to potentially disrupt the traditional cycle. These elements collectively create a more complex market environment where simple historical patterns may no longer apply reliably. Primary market changes include: Institutional Dominance: Large financial institutions now control significant Bitcoin holdings through ETFs and corporate treasuries Regulatory Evolution: Comprehensive frameworks in major economies have altered market dynamics and investor behavior Macroeconomic Integration: Bitcoin now responds to interest rate changes, inflation data, and traditional market movements Market Maturation: Increased liquidity and sophisticated trading instruments have reduced volatility extremes Global Adoption Plateaus: User growth rates have stabilized in developed markets, shifting focus to utility rather than speculation These factors collectively suggest that Bitcoin has transitioned from a speculative technological experiment to an established financial asset. This maturation necessarily changes its price discovery mechanisms and cyclical behaviors. The market now processes information more efficiently, potentially reducing the dramatic boom-bust patterns characteristic of earlier cycles. Global Economic Context of 2025 The broader economic environment of 2025 provides essential context for understanding Bitcoin’s performance. Global central banks maintained restrictive monetary policies throughout the year to combat persistent inflationary pressures. Bond yields remained elevated, creating competitive returns from traditional fixed-income investments. These conditions historically correlate with reduced risk appetite across financial markets, particularly affecting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical tensions throughout 2025 further complicated the investment landscape. Regional conflicts and trade disputes created uncertainty that typically benefits Bitcoin as a non-sovereign asset. However, the cryptocurrency’s failure to rally under these conditions suggests either changing investor perceptions or increased correlation with traditional risk assets during periods of market stress. Implications for Investors and the Crypto Ecosystem The potential breakdown of the four-year cycle theory carries significant implications for various market participants. Investors who relied on historical patterns for timing decisions must reconsider their strategies. The cryptocurrency ecosystem faces potential restructuring as projects and businesses that depended on predictable cycles adapt to new realities. Portfolio allocation models require reassessment, particularly those using halving dates as primary timing indicators. Risk management frameworks must incorporate increased uncertainty about cyclical behaviors. Long-term holders may benefit from reduced volatility, while traders face more complex market dynamics without clear cyclical guides. The mining industry faces particular challenges from this development. Mining operations have historically planned capital expenditures and operational strategies around predictable post-halving price appreciations. The 2025 decline creates revenue pressures that could accelerate industry consolidation and technological innovation as miners seek efficiency improvements to maintain profitability under new market conditions. Conclusion Bitcoin’s 2025 decline represents a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency market evolution. The failure to rally following the 2024 halving suggests the potential end of the traditional four-year cycle theory that has guided investor behavior for over a decade. While historical patterns provided valuable frameworks, Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class necessitates more sophisticated analytical approaches incorporating macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and structural market changes. The 2025 decline does not necessarily indicate fundamental weakness but rather signals Bitcoin’s transition to a more complex and integrated financial instrument whose price discovery mechanisms have evolved beyond simple cyclical patterns. FAQs Q1: What exactly is Bitcoin’s four-year cycle theory? The four-year cycle theory posits that Bitcoin experiences predictable price patterns around its halving events, which occur approximately every four years. Historically, each halving (which reduces mining rewards by 50%) has preceded substantial price increases within 12-18 months as reduced new supply meets steady demand. Q2: Why is the 2025 decline particularly significant? The 2025 decline marks the first instance where Bitcoin failed to achieve new highs following a halving event. Previous cycles (2012-2013, 2016-2017, 2020-2021) all saw exponential growth post-halving, making the 2025 performance a historical anomaly that challenges established market assumptions. Q3: Does this mean Bitcoin will no longer experience bull markets? Not necessarily. The potential breakdown of the four-year cycle theory suggests that future price movements may follow different patterns or respond to different catalysts. Bull markets could still occur but might be driven more by macroeconomic factors, adoption milestones, or regulatory developments rather than predictable halving cycles. Q4: How are Bitcoin miners affected by this development? Miners face increased uncertainty as they can no longer rely on predictable post-halving price appreciations to offset reduced block rewards. This could accelerate industry consolidation, push miners toward greater operational efficiency, and potentially increase the adoption of renewable energy sources to reduce costs. Q5: What should investors consider in light of this cycle breakdown? Investors should diversify their analytical frameworks beyond historical patterns. Factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, institutional adoption rates, and technological advancements may become increasingly important for price discovery. Risk management should account for greater uncertainty about cyclical behaviors.

Investors Favor This $0.04 Altcoin Over Cardano,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-with-250-before-q1-2026-investors-favor-this-0-04-altcoin-over-cardano/,"Timing and upside potential are more important when investors are engaged with smaller amounts. Big cryptocurrencies tend to be slow. With Q1 2026 in sight, people are reconsidering the way to use small capital. Rather than contributing to some established assets, such as Cardano, a fresh DeFi crypto is undergoing early development, is still affordable, and has already proven itself. The name of that project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Developing The Mutuum Finance is developed to be a two-market decentralized lending and borrowing finance protocol. In the P2C market, customers deposit assets in common liquidity. They in turn are rewarded with mtTokens. These tokens reflect their status and they have APY which borrowers pay interest on. As an illustration, when the user deposits an amount of $250 worth of ETH in a pool with an APY of 6%, the value of the mtTokens would rise over time as the user will receive interest. The P2P market also enables users to lend with secured collateral. Borrowers are allowed to take fluctuating rates following the demand or fixed and predictable costs. Loan-to-Value regulations restrict the amount of borrowing. Liquidations will be instigated in case collateral value decreases below pre-determined limits. The liquidators will pay off some of the debt and get the collateral on a discount which will allow the system to move on. Participancy and Presale Advancement The presale of Mutuum Finance started in early 2025 and has developed into predetermined stages with specific prices and allocations. The project has collected over $19.5M, 18,700 holders and sold 820M tokens thus far. The total number of MUTM is 4B tokens, and 45.5% or approximate of 1.82B tokens is set aside in the presale. The distribution has been gradual which means that it will open up participation as the price went up. Phase 1 received the token at $0.01 and currently it is being sold at $0.04 in presale Phase stage 7. That is approximately 300% growth till now. The growth of phase 1 participants is pegged at 500% assuming that MUTM will launch at its target price of $0.06. The cost of each subsequent phase is more expensive and this has contributed to a stable demand and not sharp increases. In a bid to keep people interested, Mutuum Finance has a 24-hour leaderboard, where the most active participant daily earns $500 in MUTM. This will enable regular attendance since subsequent stages assign fewer tokens. V1 Launch and Analyst Outlook Team reports via official statements on X that Mutuum Finance is working on V1 of its lending / borrowing protocol, and will beta launch on the Sepolia testnet. The first assets to be backed are ETH and USDT. The issue of security has been addressed as a priority. The CertiK Token Scan of MUTM has been scored at 90/100, and the lending agreements have been audited by Halborn Security as a whole, the audit completed and the final update is pending. There is also a $50k bug bounty that will be open to assist in finding out the remaining problems. It has been suggested by some analysts that the market will review MUTM according to usage rather than according to stages of distribution once V1 is live and users can interact with both the protocols. The modeled condition is that in the measured condition MUTM would go past the mark of $0.06 and will increase further as the adoption follows, but the results will be contingent on the implementation and the market conditions. The Reason Why MUTM is Being Compared With Cardano (ADA) Mutuum Finance is a protocol that plans to launch its own stablecoin. Bridging and lending of a stablecoin will keep the activity stable against the background of downward and upward pricings of the broader crypto. This renders the protocol to be less market mood dependent. It can also be mentioned that Layer-2 compatibility is covered in the roadmap and it can reduce the transaction costs and enhance speed. In the case of lending platforms, reduced fees are essential, since users can interact with the protocol on a regular basis. Cardano is a reputable project, and the market cap restricts its growth. Price motion would most probably be slow with a $250 allocation. Mutuum Finance is another profile. It is a fresh crypt that is in its early pricing stage, has visible improvement, and an imminent product release. This difference is important to investors who are interested in what crypto to invest in now with a low budget. Instead of pursuing big networks, a large number are exploring assets in which a $250 could still be enough to gain a significant exposure in the lead-up to the next growth cycle. That is the reason why MUTM is being mentioned among the potential most suitable cryptos to purchase at this time before the year 2026 and the first quarter.

56679198,650616,1767252651,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56679198.jpeg,Crypto Predictions 2026: CoinFund President Shares His Forecast,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-predictions-2026-coinfund-president/,"CoinFund President Christopher Perkins is betting 2026 will be defined less by shiny new token narratives and more by balance sheets, regulation-enabled product launches, and the messy maturation of crypto into an industry that buys, sells, and consolidates itself. In a Dec. 31 thread on X, Perkins laid out seven predictions: #1 Crypto ‘M&A Summer’ And A $25 Billion Deal Year Perkins’ first and loudest call: 2026 will be “the year of crypto M&A.” He pegged 2025 M&A activity at roughly $8.6 billion in total deal value, then projected 2026 will “reach $25bn,” framing it as a step-change rather than a modest grind higher. He sketched consolidation pressure across multiple fronts, from “DAT/Labs/Foundation consolidation” to “DAT vs DAT (mNAV reckoning),” plus a two-way bridge between traditional finance and crypto. The direction of travel, in his telling, is straightforward: TradFi firms trying to catch up and crypto firms buying their way into regulated capabilities. “TradFi → Crypto (ugh, I’m behind and need to catch up),” he wrote. “Crypto (DATs, Exchanges) → TradFi (we need operating companies, securities capabilities and licenses, too!).” He also flagged “Asia→US” as a theme, arguing that a clearer regulatory environment will pull international players toward the US market. “2021 was stablecoin summer; 2026 is going to be M&A summer,” Perkins concluded. #2 Stablecoins To $600 Billion Perkins’ second prediction is a market-cap doubling in stablecoins, “surpassing $600bn (2x).” His reasoning hinges less on retail use and more on issuer economics and market plumbing. “For every stablecoin, someone is making net interest income. Who wouldn’t want one?” he wrote. “As markets tokenize, you’ll need stablecoins to buy and sell them. Watch the growth accelerate in 2026.” The subtext is that stablecoins become the default settlement asset for on-chain financial activity—especially if more real-world assets and market structures migrate on-chain—while issuer incentives remain strong. #3 A $2 Billion-Plus Crypto Hack As A Policy Catalyst Perkins also forecast a major security event: “A major hack >$2bn will shake confidence, lead to a drawdown and catalyze to policy changes.” He pointed to what he described as worsening trends, citing $3.4 billion in hacking during 2025, “a 51% increase,” then argued the attack surface grows as tokenization and stablecoins bring “hundreds of billions more” on-chain. He went further than the usual call for better security practices, floating a provocative historical reference as a possible policy direction. “Maybe it’s time for a new change to policy, like Letters of Marque and Reprisal,” he wrote. “Just sayin’….” The implication: if losses scale up, the policy response could become more aggressive—and less abstract. #4 Regulated Derivatives Return On market structure, Perkins predicted US crypto derivatives will come “back to the US in a major way,” with a “big battle for marketshare” as “new players enter the space.” Even as he expects the US share of global derivatives volume to triple, he argued CME’s slice of US crypto futures could fall amid broader competition. His thesis is rooted in regulatory momentum and institutional trading behavior. “Now that the regulatory path is clear, there will be a proliferation of new regulated futures products launched in the US,” Perkins wrote. “As crypto enters its institutional era, demand will be off the charts because basis trading will be their first step. This will breathe life back into alts.” #5 No Market-Structure Bill Not everything is acceleration. Perkins’ fifth prediction: a comprehensive market structure bill “will not be passed,” blaming political calendar gravity. “Sorry guys, this one is going to be too difficult. Midterms will take the oxygen out of the room,” he wrote. #6 New ATHs For Bitcoin And ETH Despite that, he still expects new highs in the majors, calling for bitcoin at $150,000 and ether above $5,000. “BTC and $ETH will hit ATHs,” Perkins wrote. “BTC hits $150,000; ETH makes passes $5,000.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase expects ETFs, stablecoins and tokenization to reinforce each other and drive faster crypto adoption in 2026. Global crypto adoption has stabilized, signaling market maturity rather than stalled growth. Clearer regulation in the US and Europe is enabling deeper institutional participation and real-world integration. In a year-end outlook shared on X this week , Duong said 2025 marked a turning point for the digital asset sector, with regulated spot ETFs opening the door for broader investor access, corporate crypto treasuries gaining traction, and stablecoins and tokenized assets becoming more embedded in traditional financial workflows. Coinbase: ETFs, Stablecoins and Tokenization Set to Accelerate in 2026 These trends, Duong argued, are likely to strengthen rather than fade. “We expect these forces to compound in 2026 as ETF approval timelines compress, stablecoins take a larger role in delivery-vs-payment structures, and tokenized collateral is recognized more broadly across traditional transactions,” he said. While crypto adoption has grown more gradually than early evangelists once predicted, the trajectory has remained stable. Data from analytics platform Demand Sage shows global crypto adoption fluctuating within a narrow band over the past two years, ranging from 10.3% in the first quarter of 2023 to 9.9% in the first quarter of 2025. Duong suggested that this steadiness reflects a maturing market rather than stagnation. A key catalyst for the next phase, he said, is regulatory clarity. In 2025, several major jurisdictions moved to formalize crypto oversight, reshaping how institutions evaluate risk and deploy capital. https://t.co/BY2Fr5Y0oj — David Duong (@DavidDuong) December 31, 2025 In the United States, lawmakers advanced stablecoin legislation through the GENIUS Act, providing a clearer framework for dollar-pegged tokens and payment use cases. In Europe, the rollout of the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation has brought greater consistency to licensing and compliance across member states. “The practical consequence is real operational readiness,” Duong said, pointing to clearer policy guardrails that allow firms to build products, scale infrastructure and integrate crypto rails into payments and settlement systems. Coinbase: Crypto Demand Broadens as Institutions and Macro Forces Take the Lead Beyond regulation, Duong also pointed out a structural shift in demand. Crypto markets are no longer driven by a single narrative or dominated by early adopters. Instead, a broader mix of institutions, allocators and end-users is shaping flows, tying crypto exposure to macroeconomic conditions, technological progress and geopolitical developments. “Demand no longer hinges on a single story,” he said, adding that crypto is increasingly viewed through a long-term strategic lens as it becomes part of mainstream financial architecture. Last month, Coinbase agreed to acquire The Clearing Company as it plans to scale prediction markets and advance its ambition of becoming an “Everything Exchange.” Prior to this, Coinbase filed lawsuits against the US states of Michigan, Illinois, and Connecticut, escalating a growing legal fight over who has the authority to regulate prediction markets in the United States.

In a video shared with his audience on X, he focused on Franklin Templeton’s recent statement. The emphasis was on structure, function, and portfolio relevance. That change in tone signals XRP’s increasing presence in institutional research rather than retail commentary. Rector highlighted how this messaging reflects internal conviction. Asset managers of Franklin Templeton’s scale do not publish casual endorsements . Their public explanations tend to mirror how products are presented to professional clients. XRP, in this case, appeared as infrastructure. It appeared as a component with a defined role inside digital asset portfolios. Franklin Templeton pushing XRP pic.twitter.com/qGLJd9CXMB — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 31, 2025 Franklin Templeton’s View on the XRP Ledger In the video, Rector referenced comments from Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton. Bayston described the XRP Ledger using direct and functional language. He stated that the XRP Ledger is “a payments-first blockchain enabling real-time, low-cost settlement and cross-border transaction efficiency.” That description avoided abstraction, focusing on settlement speed, cost control, and payment utility . This approach aligns with how institutions evaluate blockchain networks. They prioritize reliability, throughput, and finality. XRP fits that evaluation model due to its long operating history and consistent performance. XRP as a Portfolio Component Bayston addressed XRP’s position within diversified portfolios. He stated, “Within a diversified digital portfolio, we view XRP Ledger’s native token XRP as a foundational building block given its market cap significance.” That statement carries institutional weight. Franklin Templeton manages assets measured in trillions of dollars. Its research language reflects internal risk frameworks and compliance standards. Calling XRP a foundational building block places it alongside assets viewed as structurally important rather than speculative. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market capitalization plays a role in that assessment. Liquidity and depth matter for large allocations. XRP meets those requirements more effectively than many newer tokens due to its large supply . This factor supports its inclusion in institutional products. Spot XRP ETF Adds Context Franklin Templeton has also launched its spot XRP ETF . That development adds substance to its commentary. An ETF requires regulatory approval, custody infrastructure, and internal alignment. It also requires confidence that the underlying asset can support institutional demand. The ETF launch aligns with the firm’s explanation of XRP’s utility. This reinforces the idea that it serves a practical role within digital finance rather than a narrative-driven one.

Dell’s CFO, Jeff Clarke, said during a November earnings call that the company had never seen “costs move at the rate” they are rising now and said the impact will reach customers. AI data center expansion drains memory supply British computer maker Raspberry Pi raised prices in December and described the situation as “painful,” while Lenovo, the world’s largest PC maker, began stockpiling memory chips and other components, chief financial officer Winston Cheng said during a November appearance on Bloomberg TV. Analysts say demand for high-bandwidth memory has exploded, pushing chipmakers to focus production on advanced memory chips used in AI servers rather than lower-end parts used in consumer electronics. Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix , which control more than 70% of the global DRAM market, said orders for 2026 already exceed production capacity. Samsung increased prices for some memory chips by as much as 60% last month, with executive Kim Jae-june saying during an October earnings call that “AI-related server demand keeps growing and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply.” Consumers will have to deal with higher electronics prices as supply stays tight Analysts say consumers will shoulder the cost. Daniel at Macquarie expects electronics prices to rise 10% to 20% in 2026. CW Chung, joint head of Asia-Pacific equities research at Nomura, expects a smaller 5% increase, saying companies may try to cut costs elsewhere. Others see fewer options. Greg Roh, an analyst at Hyundai Securities, said electronics makers have little choice because cloud companies such as Amazon and Google are signing long-term deals with chipmakers to secure DRAM supply for servers, locking up memory chips before consumer brands can access them. Morgan Stanley expects large U.S. technology companies to spend $620 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up from $470 billion in 2025, with global spending on AI data centers and related hardware expected to hit $2.9 trillion by 2028. Peter Lee, an analyst at Citigroup , said, “AI data-centre inference demand is far greater than anticipated, depleting chip inventories for PCs and smartphones as well.” Peter said supply will remain tight until 2027, with stockpiling of chips worsening in 2026. Lu Weibing, president of Xiaomi, said in November that supply chain pressure in 2026 would be “far greater than” in 2025. Daniel at Macquarie warned that the worst case could mirror the severe supply disruptions seen during the pandemic. Samsung said in November it would add a production line at its South Korea plant. SK Hynix is building a $91 billion chipmaking cluster, announced in 2024. SK chair Chey Tae-won said in November, “We are thinking hard about how to address all demand.” An industry executive in Seoul said building a new plant takes two to three years. Until then, Peter said companies will “either raise product prices or sacrifice margins” as memory chips remain scarce.

All major crypto exchanges that deal with UK-based users must now hand over complete records. That includes how much a person paid, how much they sold for, and how much they profited. The data must also include each user’s tax residency. The UK is among the first 48 countries to put these rules into effect under the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, or CARF, which was drawn up by the OECD. The global goal is to stop people from hiding profits in crypto. Over 75 countries have signed up to follow these rules. Some jurisdictions, like Hong Kong, Singapore, the UAE, and Switzerland, will begin in 2027. The United States will start collecting in 2028 and begin sharing that data in 2029. “This is the beginning of the end for crypto investors who thought they could invest and gain from crypto in secrecy from tax and other law enforcement agencies,” said Andrew Park, who works on tax investigations at Price Bailey. Andrew warned that anyone living in participating countries, including the UK, should understand that their crypto records will be shared directly with their government. He also urged traders to ask themselves if they’re truly tax-compliant before it becomes a criminal issue. Exchanges must report profits, trading history, and residency info HMRC is building a direct pipeline of crypto information. From 2027, the agency will automatically send and receive crypto trading data with other countries. These include all EU member states, plus Brazil , South Africa, the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands. Every single crypto transaction tied to a UK taxpayer will be visible. Seb Maley, who runs tax insurance company Qdos, said this is “a major shift in how crypto trading is monitored from a tax perspective.” “HMRC will soon know exactly who is making gains — and how much,” Seb added. Anyone who’s traded crypto in the UK and made over £3,000 in gains will now have to pay capital gains tax. But that’s not all. If HMRC believes someone is trading regularly, it may treat them like a business, which means paying income tax and national insurance. Even non-cash transactions can count as disposals. That includes using crypto to buy stuff, trading one coin for another, or giving tokens to someone, unless they’re a spouse or civil partner. Every single one of those cases could trigger a tax bill. UK boosts enforcement with new crypto tax section and warning letters Dawn Register, a tax dispute specialist at BDO, said the UK government has been tracking non-compliance in the crypto space for a while. “HMRC has been concerned for some time about high levels of non-compliance among crypto investors,” Dawn said . She added that joining this international system gives HMRC access to “a richer dataset” and allows them “to better target those UK tax residents it suspects of failing to correctly declare their gains.” In the 2024–25 tax year, HMRC sent out 65,000 warning letters to people suspected of owing tax on crypto, that’s up from 27,700 letters the year before. There’s also now a voluntary disclosure facility, which gives people a chance to admit to undeclared crypto profits before April 2024. But Dawn said anyone thinking about it should talk to a tax advisor first, before HMRC knocks on their door. This year, for the first time, the self-assessment tax form has a section specifically for crypto profits and losses. Anyone who made crypto gains during the 2024–25 tax year might need to file a tax return before January 31, according to Dawn. Get seen where it counts.

This projection, reported by The Daily Hodl on March 15, 2025, comes amid evolving market dynamics that could reshape the entire digital asset landscape. The prediction carries particular weight given Dragonfly’s prominent position in venture capital and Qureshi’s extensive experience in blockchain investment analysis. Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysis and Market Context Haseeb Qureshi’s Bitcoin price prediction represents one of the more optimistic forecasts for 2025. Currently, Bitcoin trades at approximately $88,500, meaning the projected surge to $150,000 would require substantial market momentum. Historical data shows Bitcoin has experienced similar percentage gains during previous bull cycles. For instance, between October 2020 and April 2021, Bitcoin increased by approximately 350% from $10,000 to $45,000. However, achieving such growth from current elevated levels presents different challenges and opportunities. Several factors support this Bitcoin price prediction. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major financial institutions expanding cryptocurrency services. Regulatory clarity has improved in key markets, reducing uncertainty for investors. Additionally, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 typically precedes significant price appreciation in subsequent years. The network’s fundamentals remain strong, with hash rates reaching new highs and adoption metrics showing steady growth across global markets. Market Dominance Shift and Altcoin Implications Qureshi’s analysis extends beyond simple Bitcoin price prediction to encompass broader market dynamics. He anticipates that while Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs, its market dominance will likely decline. This pattern has historical precedent. During the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin’s dominance dropped from 95% to 35% as capital flowed into alternative cryptocurrencies. Similarly, in 2021, dominance fell from 73% to 40% during the altcoin season. The potential decline in Bitcoin dominance signals important opportunities for alternative cryptocurrencies. Qureshi specifically highlighted that this shift could pave the way for a significant altcoin rally. Market analysts note several factors supporting this outlook: Rotation patterns: Historical data shows capital typically rotates from Bitcoin to altcoins after major BTC rallies Infrastructure development: Layer-2 solutions and interoperability protocols have matured significantly Institutional diversification: Major investors increasingly allocate to diversified crypto portfolios beyond Bitcoin Technological innovation: New use cases in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 continue to emerge on alternative chains Ethereum and Solana Positioned for Strength Within the altcoin landscape, Qureshi identified specific opportunities and challenges. He noted that recently launched blockchain networks might underperform expectations, while established platforms like Ethereum and Solana could deliver stronger-than-anticipated results. This perspective aligns with several market indicators. Ethereum continues to dominate decentralized finance and non-fungible token markets, with its transition to proof-of-stake reducing environmental concerns for institutional investors. Solana has demonstrated remarkable resilience and technological progress despite previous network challenges. The platform’s high throughput and low transaction costs position it well for mass adoption scenarios. Both networks benefit from extensive developer ecosystems, substantial institutional backing, and proven track records during previous market cycles. Their relative maturity compared to newer networks provides stability that appeals to risk-adjusted investors. Expert Analysis and Historical Precedents Haseeb Qureshi brings substantial credibility to this Bitcoin price prediction through his extensive industry experience. As managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, he oversees investments across the global cryptocurrency landscape. Previously, Qureshi worked as a software engineer at Airbnb and earned recognition as a professional poker player, skills that inform his probabilistic approach to market analysis. His predictions carry weight within investment circles due to Dragonfly’s successful track record identifying emerging trends. Historical analysis provides context for evaluating this Bitcoin price prediction. The cryptocurrency has experienced four major market cycles since its inception, each featuring distinct characteristics: Cycle Peak Price Duration Dominance at Peak 2011 $31 11 months 100% 2013 $1,163 13 months 94% 2017 $19,783 17 months 65% 2021 $68,789 18 months 42% This historical data reveals several patterns relevant to the current Bitcoin price prediction. Cycle durations have generally extended over time, suggesting maturation in market structure. Bitcoin dominance at cycle peaks has consistently declined, supporting Qureshi’s projection of further erosion. Each cycle peak has exceeded the previous by significant multiples, with the smallest increase being approximately 3.5 times the prior peak. A move to $150,000 would represent roughly 2.2 times the 2021 peak, which falls within historical parameters. Market Risks and Counterarguments While the Bitcoin price prediction presents an optimistic outlook, several risk factors warrant consideration. Regulatory developments remain unpredictable across major jurisdictions. Macroeconomic conditions, particularly interest rate policies and inflation trends, significantly impact risk asset performance. Technological challenges, including potential security vulnerabilities or scalability limitations, could affect adoption rates. Market sentiment remains fragile, with investor psychology playing a substantial role in cryptocurrency valuations. Alternative viewpoints exist within the analyst community. Some experts emphasize that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has increased, potentially limiting upside during economic uncertainty. Others note that adoption curves may follow S-shaped patterns with natural plateaus. The environmental debate surrounding proof-of-work consensus continues influencing institutional participation. These factors collectively create a complex landscape where the Bitcoin price prediction represents one plausible scenario among multiple possibilities. Conclusion Haseeb Qureshi’s Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000 represents a significant bullish outlook for 2025 markets. The forecast combines technical analysis, fundamental evaluation, and market cycle understanding. Beyond the specific price target, the prediction highlights important structural shifts, particularly regarding Bitcoin dominance and altcoin opportunities. Ethereum and Solana appear positioned for relative strength according to this analysis, while newer networks may face greater challenges. As cryptocurrency markets continue evolving, this Bitcoin price prediction provides valuable perspective for investors navigating complex digital asset landscapes. Market participants should consider multiple scenarios while recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology across global financial systems. FAQs Q1: What specific factors support the Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000? Several factors support this Bitcoin price prediction, including continued institutional adoption, improving regulatory clarity, the historical pattern of post-halving appreciation, strong network fundamentals with record hash rates, and expanding global adoption metrics across both developed and emerging markets. Q2: Why would Bitcoin dominance decline if the price reaches new highs? Historical patterns show that after major Bitcoin rallies, capital typically rotates into alternative cryptocurrencies seeking higher returns. This phenomenon, combined with maturation of altcoin ecosystems and diversification by institutional investors, typically reduces Bitcoin’s percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization even as its absolute price increases. Q3: Which altcoins might benefit most according to this analysis? The analysis specifically highlights Ethereum and Solana as likely beneficiaries, citing their established developer ecosystems, institutional backing, technological maturity, and proven track records during previous market cycles compared to newer blockchain networks that may face greater challenges. Q4: How does this Bitcoin price prediction compare to other analyst forecasts? This prediction falls within the range of analyst expectations for 2025, with some forecasts being more conservative ($100,000-$120,000) and others more aggressive ($200,000+). The prediction’s distinct value lies in its connection to broader market dynamics, particularly the anticipated shift in Bitcoin dominance and altcoin implications. Q5: What are the main risks to this Bitcoin price prediction? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty across major jurisdictions, macroeconomic factors like interest rate policies and inflation, potential technological challenges or security vulnerabilities, changing investor sentiment, increased correlation with traditional markets, and the possibility that adoption follows S-curve patterns with natural plateaus rather than continuous exponential growth.

Several sources say these offerings could bring in billions of dollars, making 2026 a record year for the people who invested early and the firms that help companies go public. SpaceX, by Elon Musk, recently informed its backers that it intends to list within the coming year, barring any serious problems in financial markets. Meanwhile, Anthropic has brought on the California-based law firm Wilson Sonsini to start getting ready for a public offering. OpenAI has been meeting with top legal practices, including Cooley, though the maker of ChatGPT has not yet picked which lawyers will guide its process, according to sources. Valuations soar into hundreds of billions The companies have yet to set IPO valuation targets. But their private valuations give some indication of their scale. OpenAI currently carries a price tag of $500 billion and is talking with investors about raising fresh money that could push its value past $750 billion. These discussions are still in early phases, but the company could take in tens of billions of dollars, people familiar with the talks said. SpaceX is working on selling existing shares among private investors at a valuation of $800 billion, several sources confirmed. Anthropic is also seeking new investment that backers expect will value the artificial intelligence company above $300 billion. If these three companies alone sold stock to the public, they would bring in more than the roughly 200 American companies that went public in 2025. Peter Hébert, who started the investment firm Lux Capital, said he cannot remember seeing anything like this before. “I can’t recall a crop like this — three private companies which would be among the largest public market caps in the world,” Hébert said. “The likelihood of all these companies listing [in 2026] is small, but possible, and would mean an epic bonanza for VCs, bankers and deal attorneys.” SpaceX is expected to raise more than the $29 billion Saudi Aramco collected when it went public in 2019, making it the biggest stock offering ever. A challenging year for IPOs in 2025 Last year saw some technology companies list their shares, including Figma, Klarna, CoreWeave, and Chime. During the first nine months of 2025, American companies raised more than $30 billion through new stock offerings, with most of that coming from tech firms, according to EY data. Other large private companies are also considering going public this year. Databricks, a data analytics business valued at $134 billion, and Canva, a design platform worth $42 billion, are among those looking at their options, according to EY. Founders Fund, the investment firm connected to Peter Thiel, put $20 million into SpaceX back in 2008 and has added more money in later rounds. That stake is now worth tens of billions of dollars. Alphabet also owns a position worth billions. Khosla Ventures, which got into OpenAI early, took a 5 percent stake in 2019. Last year, both Anthropic and OpenAI took steps to prepare for life as public companies. They hired executives who have run publicly traded businesses before, cleaned up how their boards operate, and brought in large investors who typically buy shares of public companies. These preparations mean the companies can choose when they want to go public, though recent market movements have created some uncertainty. Large publicly traded companies like Oracle and Broadcom have seen their stock prices drop sharply as worries grow about whether artificial intelligence companies are overvalued. “When you have a generational company who is defining their category, I don’t think their decision to go public is a reaction to a macro market view,” Ryan Biggs, co-head of venture investment at Franklin Templeton, said “These businesses are so strong that they are the ones driving the macro.” Plans could still change if major political or economic problems arise. Going public will also subject these companies to much closer examination than they face as private businesses. SpaceX did not respond when asked for comment. OpenAI also declined to comment.

In a Dec. 31 interview with Altcoin Daily, the SkyBridge Capital founder framed 2025 as a year where positioning and sentiment broke down under selling pressure he said he didn’t anticipate. “There’s probably $4.6 billion of whale selling this year into the ETF demand,” Scaramucci said, arguing that the deleveraging event around Oct. 10 amplified the move. “There was a massive amount of deleveraging. It impacted some of the market makers. It forced a liquidity crisis,” he added, describing a 30% drop as “garden variety” for bitcoin, but still a surprise for traders leaning bullish. Scaramucci said he now sees the setup improving precisely because sentiment turned so negative. “We were tilted to the bulls, we’re now decidedly very bearish,” he said, claiming his internal “bull meter” sits around 13 or 14 out of 100. The flip side, he argued, is that incremental good news, less large-holder selling, steadier ETF inflows, or regulatory progress, could matter more than usual. Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Swipe Nearly $3 Billion In 2025 Despite Fewer Attacks – Report A central part of Scaramucci’s thesis was that the market still expects US market-structure legislation to pass, and that the timeline matters. “I do think it is detrimental because I do think there is still a market expectation that it’s going to pass. I do think you need that clarity,” he said of the Clarity Act. Without it, he argued, serious tokenization efforts remain constrained by legal uncertainty: “Who’s going to spend the kind of money that you need to switch over the financial system if you’re not guaranteed that you’re going to be able to use it.” He also tied the policy fight to a broader economic claim: “There’s between, depending on how you measure it, there’s three and a half to $4 trillion dollars worth of transaction verification expenses in the global economy per year… If you could get that down, let’s say you cut it in half, you could unleash a $2 trillion capital spend in other areas of the economy or just better wages for people.” Related Reading: RWA Tops Crypto Narratives In 2025: CoinGecko Reports 185% Growth Pressed on odds of passage before the midterms, Scaramucci said it should be “north of 50%,” arguing Democrats have learned there is “no anti-crypto voter,” while crypto-aligned spending can be decisive in tight races. Scaramucci’s Top-3 Altcoins And Bitcoin Prediction Asked for his current top-three altcoins, Scaramucci named Solana first, followed by Avalanche and Telegram-linked TON. “My three top coins then would be Solana, it would be Avalanche and believe it or not… it would be the Telegram token known as Ton,” he said, while acknowledging he has been early or wrong on timing. He said he first bought TON at $7.50, averaging near $4.00, while saying it was trading around $1.50 at the time of the interview, but still sees it as a token that could be used across Telegram’s network as it grows. On why Solana sits at No. 1, Scaramucci kept it simple and comparative: “Cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on,” he said, adding he’s “not an Ethereum negative person” and expects “a multicoin world.” Macro is the other pillar. Scaramucci expects “two to four interest rate cuts” next year and argued a president facing midterms will want growth optics. “He’s going to flood the zone with capital. He’s going to drop interest rates. He’s going to try to perk up the economy,” Scaramucci said. “That bodes well for the stock market… for the altcoin market… and… for crypto.” For bitcoin, he stuck with his $150,000 call—“I’m off by a year, I think”—and said he recently “bought more Bitcoin” for his family, betting that ETF flows and easier policy can overpower the hangover from 2025’s whale-driven selling. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.94 trillion.

The Middle East made the biggest ones too, with Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Investment Company investing $12.9 billion into tech last year. The Kuwait Investment Authority came second with $6 billion, and the Qatar Investment Authority is third with $4 billion in deals. Together, these three accounted for more than a third of all digital investments by state-backed funds the entire year. Altogether, the top seven Gulf funds dumped $126 billion into global deals, making up 43% of total sovereign wealth fund capital deployments worldwide. That’s the highest percentage ever recorded. Most of that cash went straight into tech, which [no surprise] dominated investor attention amid market recovery and fresh structural demand for AI tools, chips, and data infrastructure. PIF leads with one massive buy while Mubadala racks up transactions Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) topped the global deal value chart last year with a total of $36.2 billion committed. But nearly all of that came from one big purchase: its buyout of Electronic Arts . Once that’s removed, the volume crown clearly goes to Mubadala, which notched 40 separate deals totaling $32.7 billion, setting its own internal record for activity in a single year. While the Gulf states spent aggressively, sovereign investors across the board also expanded their reach into real estate, infrastructure, public equities, and fixed income. They took full advantage of 2025’s rebound across major asset classes, especially after the S&P 500 bottomed out in April during the tariff panic and then worked its way to fresh highs by the end of December. On the global leaderboard of who controls what, the United States leads with $13.2 trillion in state-owned investor assets, followed by China with $8.2 trillion, and the United Arab Emirates holding $2.9 trillion. As for destinations, the U.S. completely dominated 2025 by pulling in $131.8 billion in sovereign capital, nearly double the previous year’s total of $68.9 billion. U.S. equities regain footing while China investments collapse China, on the other hand, saw a massive pullback. Sovereign investor flows into the country dropped from $10.3 billion in 2024 to $4.3 billion in 2025. The drop came as geopolitical risk climbed and returns lagged. By contrast, U.S. assets surged in popularity, thanks in part to the S&P 500’s ability to shake off its largest drawdown since the spring. After falling around 6% from peak to trough, the index recovered its October 27 high by December, forming a bullish pattern. While not textbook, the structure set a higher low in December, and the market entered the new year holding firm above that level. Charts from Global SWF show how often the index moved 1% up or down over the last two years. Most of the big swings happened during the deepest selloffs, including spring 2025 and late October. But once the index regained its old highs, those wild daily moves started to fade. That change in rhythm, paired with ongoing strength, left traders eyeing more gains if volatility continues to calm. Zooming out, this year’s recovery marks the fourth major breakout in the current bull cycle . It joins the other surges that started in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2022. In each case, deep corrections turned into setups for the next rally. So if the current trend holds, markets may still be in the early-to-middle innings of a larger advance heading into 2026.

However, an XRP enthusiast, Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), took a different route in a recent post. He shared a clip featuring Greg Kidd, a former Ripple executive and the company’s 10th employee. The message was not about short-term price action, but about what actually makes Ripple’s vision work. Xaif argued that liquidity is more important than the asset’s absolute price. He added that XRP “isn’t built to sit, it’s built to move.” The focus was clear. Utility comes first , and the price will follow, as demand increases. Liquidity enables everything else. Exactly Liquidity > Absolute Price. XRP isn’t built to sit it’s built to move. Price is just a label, liquidity is the engine that enables frictionless settlement, adoption, and market velocity. Deep liquidity removes resistance and friction is the enemy of scale. https://t.co/K6BD02IACB pic.twitter.com/MDCbtcnVOk — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 31, 2025 A Focus on Movement Instead of Optics Xaif’s post centers on the idea that XRP’s role depends on how easily it can move through markets. He described the price as “just a label” while calling liquidity “the engine that enables frictionless settlement , adoption, and market velocity.” His argument avoids hype and emphasizes function. In this view, a high price alone does little if markets lack depth. Fast entry and exit matter more than static valuation. Liquidity allows institutions to transact at scale without distortion . That is the environment Ripple needs for global settlement. Comments That Reinforce the Point The video Xaif shared features Greg Kidd explaining why liquidity sits at the center of Ripple’s model. Kidd said, “For Ripple to be successful, XRP needs to be liquid, so there’s no friction getting into it and out of it.” He stressed that liquidity matters more than “the absolute price.” Kidd did not dismiss the price entirely. He acknowledged market dynamics. “When there’s more demand than supply , the prices rise,” he said. He added that rising prices benefit those who hold the asset. Still, his emphasis stayed on demand and usage rather than speculation. As a former Ripple executive, Kidd spoke from experience. His comments showed early design priorities. Ripple targeted settlement efficiency, and XRP serves as the perfect bridge asset for that role. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Liquidity Supports Adoption Liquidity supports trust. Market participants need assurance that they can execute large transactions without disruption. That applies to banks, payment providers, and liquidity hubs. XRP’s usefulness depends on that confidence. Deep liquidity also supports volatility control. Thin markets amplify swings. Deep markets absorb flows. That stability attracts larger players. It also reduces costs for cross-border transfers. Both Xaif and Kidd point to the same outcome. Demand creates value, utility creates demand, and liquidity allows utility. The price reflects that process rather than leading it. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.449194. By 2032, DOGE might touch $0.92203 with an average trading price of $0.886567. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations.

The cryptocurrency gained 0.85% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.116 level. As of January 1, 2026, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals an upward trend. The memecoin’s price increased to $0.118 today, representing a minimal 0.85% gain since it closed at the $0.117 level yesterday. This uptrend indicates a comparatively positive market sentiment, as the memecoin is gaining again; however, the coin may find resistance around the $0.123 zone as it continues to move toward that level.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.138, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.116. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 34 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a buy indication as it moves upwards, as the overall market sentiment is positive as of now. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis Buying interest restores below the SMA, which is evident from green candlesticks, as bulls are continuing their lead. The DOGE/USD pair is facing increasing volatility as it approaches the $0.118 level. This increased volatility signals more volatile price movements in the coming hours. buying momentum is currently pushing the DOGE price toward the local resistance of $0.121. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands have diverged, leading to comparatively high volatility levels. This divergence signifies increased market unpredictability. The upper Bollinger Band is now at $0.127, which indicates the resistance level. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band is at $0.116, showing the support level. The RSI indicator has entered the neutral area once again on the 4-hour chart. Over the last four hours, its value has increased to 32. This situation hints at buyer dominance, and further appreciation seems possible if buyers succeed in a break above the current price level of $0.118.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding current market events. The coin’s value has increased to $0.118 in the past 24 hours. If buyers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further gains and retest the $0.123 resistance. Conversely, if the bearish trend revives, the meme coin may plunge toward the $0.116 support zone in the current trading session. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.26006–$0.330985level by 2027. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.118 over the last 24 hours as buyers successfully forced sellers to exit. Moreover, buyers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2026? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.295522 in 2026. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2029. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin near $1 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 4231.11 DOGE in January; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading below its average price of the last year. Currently, the coin is trading below the previous year’s peak price of $0.434, which was observed in January 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $0.92203 mark by 2032, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinions on Dogecoin The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF has entered a critical regulatory window, with a final decision expected this month.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. At the start of October, Doge was trading above $0.21, and at the start of November, it hovered near $0.187. By the end of December, the price of Dogecoin declined toward $0.122. At the start of 2026, Dogecoin is trending near $0.118, as the current Doge sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-01 09:08:39

According to Reuters, the approval replaces the expired exemption program known as validated end-user status, which ended on December 31, under Donald Trump’s administration. Without this license, shipments would’ve hit a wall starting January. The new authorization covers all U.S.-controlled tools heading into the Nanjing site and skips the need for separate vendor applications. In a statement to Reuters, TSMC allegedly said the license “ensures uninterrupted fab operations and product deliveries.” That plant, which runs 16-nanometer and other mature node production lines, is not used for TSMC’s most advanced chips. Still, the company said in its 2024 annual report that the site brought in about 2.4% of its full-year revenue. The company also runs another facility in Shanghai. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were granted similar permissions. All three companies had to apply for fresh licenses after their previous privileges expired. Those earlier privileges had given them a smoother path to operate in China despite the U.S. export controls aimed at limiting Beijing’s tech development. Earthquake hits Taiwan sites while Nvidia pushes for more chips Just as TSMC secured supply chain clearance for China, it had to manage a local disruption. The company said on Saturday that a small number of buildings inside its Hsinchu Science Park campus triggered emergency evacuation procedures after an earthquake. In a public statement, the company said , “Prioritising personnel safety, we are conducting outdoor evacuations and headcounts in accordance with emergency response procedures. Work safety systems at all facilities are operating normally.” Operations elsewhere, including the main fabs, weren’t affected. Meanwhile, Nvidia is leaning heavily on TSMC again. Cryptopolitan reported that Jensen Huang’s company is facing huge pressure after Chinese tech companies placed orders for over 2 million H200 chips, while Nvidia only has 700,000 units ready to ship. That forced them to ask TSMC to start producing more of the H200 chips. Three people briefed on the situation allegedly said that mass production will likely begin by the second quarter of 2026. There’s still a major hurdle. The chips haven’t been cleared by Beijing yet. And although Trump’s White House lifted the previous export ban in November, shipments to China now come with a 25% tariff. The clock is ticking while demand surges, and the production bottleneck could hit other Nvidia customers outside China. Wall Street raises price targets on TSMC amid AI chip demand Wall Street stays bullish on TSMC’s TSM stock though. On December 7, analysts at Bernstein bumped their price target for TSMC to $330, up from $290, maintaining an Outperform rating. Their note explained that the reason was TSMC’s plan to boost Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) output to 125,000 wafers per month by the end of 2026. But Bernstein also warned that this won’t be enough to handle both Blackwell and Rubin, Nvidia’s upcoming chip designs for 2025 and 2026. Then on December 10, Bernstein SocGen Group backed the same $330 target and said TSMC was beating both its own Q4 forecast and the market’s estimates right after the chipmaker reported NT$344 billion in November revenue, a 24.5% surge in a year. Bank of America went even higher, setting their TSM price target at $360 and argued that TSMC is dominating production for both next-gen AI chips and new mobile processors, which are central to the ongoing demand in high-performance computing.

A few projects quietly develop, in their turn, and grow gradually, until at a later point, they start to be discussed. The trend is now attracting attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Whereas lots of traders pursue short movements, commentators in markets have begun to examine projects that have controlled growth and clear development. The consistent positive growth has put MUTM on the list of companies that are seeking the next big crypto as opposed to a trading opportunity. The Current State of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance launched its presale in early 2025 at the initial price of $0.01. The token has since passed through various stages with fixed prices. MUTM is now selling at $0.04, which is approximately a 300% increase on the initial phase. The project is currently at Phase 7 whereby the price of tokens rose once again with previous distributions being depleted. To date, Mutuum Finance has raised $19.5M and approximately 18,700 holders. The total number of tokens sold is 820M. The presale is assigned 45.5% or about 1.82B of the entire 4B MUTM supply. This structure diffuses distribution across time rather than supplying the amount of supply at a single point in time. The official opening cost is pegged to be $0.06 and that is why some of the analysts feel the current pricing is at a discount stage. They point out that the pattern of price changes has been in line with demand as opposed to abrupt increase, which can be an indicator of gradual build up. The Future of Mutuum Finance? Mutuum Finance concentrates on dual lending the markets in DeFi. The protocol will provide users with the ability to provide assets to generate yield and provides others with the ability to borrow liquidity on collateral. Interest rates will change depending on the usage, so that it will balance the supply and demand within the system. One of the main elements of the design is mtTokens. When the users post assets they are awarded to receive the mtTokens, which indicates their portion of the lending pool. Such mtTokens become more valuable in accordance with the interests being paid off by the bank, thus making it more of a store than a gambling game. There is also a buy-and-distribute mechanism of Mutuum Finance. MUTM bought on the open market with a fraction of protocol fees is redistributed to users who put mtTokens in the safety module. This ties token demand to protocol activity rather than market or only market focus. Security has been worked upon as a main requirement. MUTM has achieved a 90/100 CertiK Token Scan rating, and a review of the lending contracts was carried out by Halborn Security , the audit was done and the final updates are awaited. There is also a $50k bug bounty that can be used to detect possible problems. V1 launch, Demand Indicators and The Interest of Whales The official announcements by the team posted on X indicate that Mutuum Finance is developing V1 of its protocol of lending and borrowing, with a beta release towards the Sepolia testnet. This is where the development stage ends and the live testing other phase begins where there is a broad exposure of many projects. The demand indicators have already been noticed. Phase 6 was sold off fast, which decreased reserve quantities and dragged the project into the stage underway. Increased whale participation, with single allocations close to 100K, in the recent periods are also reported by market commentators. Greater entrances at a late stage are frequently seen to be positioning in the lead of wide exposure. Mutuum Finance also has a 24-hour leaderboard, where the best user per day in terms of contributions is rewarded with $500 in MUTM. Access to card payments has also been introduced, and the participation of a larger audience has become easier. Has MUTM Reached The Next Big Crypto? The still new Mutuum Finance has a few pieces in place. Pricing has developed continuously. Investments and the number of investors are on the increase. Security checks have been carried out. V1 is approaching. To investors watching the current cryptocurrency prices with the question of what crypto to buy today with long term growth potential, MUTM is a better investment since it will offer early pricing and apparent growth. Instead of being driven by hype, its growth narrative is pegged on lending business, yield demand and calculated growth. That is why, some commentators of the market tend to suppose that Mutuum Finance shifts in the quiet growth to the more mass awareness. Its future will rely on how it performs, however, its present trend has justified why increasing numbers of people are looking to this regard as an altcoin.

Over $24M in tokens were awarded to Jump Crypto for its large-scale activity as a market maker. The Lighter airdrop was linked to whale wallets, with a significant allocation to Jump Crypto. The market maker was among the large-scale entities to farm points and receive significant token allocations. Lighter allocated 25% of the tokens to the community with immediate unlocks, while team and other allocations remained vested. However, on-chain data suggests some of the community wallets may be linked to deliberate farming groups, leaving whales well-supplied with new LIT tokens. Is the Lighter airdrop going to insiders? The Lighter airdrop arrived after months of point farming. On-chain data shows the airdrop allocations are concentrated at the top, distributed among the most active wallets. Trading on the exchange was heavily incentivized, and whales could easily afford to farm points. On-chain researchers noticed clusters of wallets that ended up with significant allocations. One cluster was traced to a total of $26M in LIT tokens following the airdrop. This entity deposited ~$5M USDC into LLP around 9 months ago, split across 5 wallets, and received 9,999,999.60 LIT from the airdrop (~$26M) – a perfectly round number. This excludes LLP yield, which adds another $1–2M in returns. This represents 1% of total supply and ~4% of… pic.twitter.com/tOjlubo1YU — MLM (@mlmabc) December 31, 2025 Another batch of wallets was also connected to Jump Crypto, receiving over $24M in LIT tokens . The allocation was based on market maker activity from early November onward. Jump Crypto received market maker allocation and fees According to wallet allocations, Jump Crypto received 323,956 LIT, which was awarded as a fee for market making activities. Before that, the market maker received 9,284,890 LIT as liquidity for its activities, or 0.93% of the total supply, or 3.72% of the circulating supply. Using market makers on new exchanges has been a normal practice for crypto projects. Yet the inclusion of large-scale whales sets questions on the ability of LIT to survive early price discovery. Previously, Jump Crypto has also been active on Hyperliquid, becoming a large-scale holder of HYPE tokens . Will the LIT token recover its rising trend? LIT set out to become a revenue-sharing token, modeled after HYPE. After its launch, LIT peaked at $2.82. Since then, LIT started to slide, and is down to the $2.50 range. LIT has a smaller community allocation compared to HYPE, and even the community tokens are taken into whale wallets or sniped by potential insiders. In the early stages, LIT also fell to panic-selling, with fears it may repeat the fate of XPL and continue losing to new all-time lows. LIT still has limited derivative open interest, and only five whales are making bets on Hyperliquid. Two of the Hyperliquid whales hold unrealized gains from shorting the token, while three are still holding long positions, signaling confidence in a price recovery. Lighter has also hinted at a potential Coinbase listing, which would change the liquidity profile of the token. Now, Lighter has to show it can sustain its real demand and activity following the point farming season and initial token-listing hype. Based on DeFiLlama data, Lighter fees have slowed down in December, from $1.39M daily down to $139K, a 90% shrinking of activity. The perpetual futures DEX recently passed Aster in daily volume, but is yet to prove its sustainability beyond the effect of whales and market makers.

56682709,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257849,1767261311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Mainstream Finance Integration Set to Skyrocket in 2025, Says Novadius CEO",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-mainstream-finance-integration-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Mainstream Finance Integration Set to Skyrocket in 2025, Says Novadius CEO NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 – The integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream finance is poised for unprecedented acceleration this year, according to a prominent asset management executive. Nate Geraci, CEO of Novadius Wealth Management, recently declared that 2025 will serve as a definitive turning point. His analysis points to a cascade of regulatory and product developments that began crystallizing in 2024. Consequently, the traditional financial infrastructure is now actively embracing digital assets. This shift represents a fundamental evolution in global capital markets. Crypto Mainstream Finance: The 2024 Foundation Geraci’s forecast hinges on pivotal events from the previous year. Specifically, he cites the resolution of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. That landmark case concluded with regulatory clarity for XRP. Subsequently, it led directly to the approval and launch of a spot exchange-traded fund for XRP. This event proved to be a critical catalyst. It demonstrated a viable pathway for other digital assets to enter regulated markets. Moreover, it signaled a shift in regulatory posture toward pragmatic engagement. The success of the XRP ETF established a powerful precedent. Financial institutions observed strong investor demand and robust operational mechanics. Following this, the market witnessed the successive launches of spot ETFs for major altcoins. These included Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC). Each launch further normalized the concept of single-asset crypto funds within traditional brokerage accounts. The process demystified digital assets for millions of retail and institutional investors. The ETF Onslaught and Portfolio Diversification The product innovation extended beyond single-asset funds. A significant development was the introduction of a broad-market crypto index ETF. This fund includes a diversified basket of assets such as Cardano (ADA), Sui (SUI), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK). This product serves a different purpose. It allows investors to gain exposure to the digital asset sector without picking individual winners. Therefore, it functions similarly to an S&P 500 ETF for traditional equities. This marks a maturation of the investment vehicle landscape. Key Crypto Spot ETF Launches (2024-2025) Asset ETF Ticker (Example) Launch Date Primary Sponsor XRP XRPF Q3 2024 Major Asset Manager Solana (SOL) SOLV Q4 2024 Global Investment Firm Hedera (HBAR) HBAR Q1 2025 ETF Specialist Litecoin (LTC) LTCN Q1 2025 Traditional Bank Affiliate Crypto Index (ADA, SUI, DOT, LINK) DIGI Q1 2025 Index Fund Giant These products collectively address several longstanding barriers to adoption: Regulatory Comfort: ETFs operate within a well-understood regulatory framework. Custody Solutions: The sponsor manages secure, insured custody of the underlying assets. Tax Simplicity: They provide a familiar 1099 tax form, unlike direct crypto ownership. Accessibility: Investors can buy shares through any standard brokerage account. Expert Analysis on the Structural Shift Financial analysts echo Geraci’s sentiment, highlighting the structural shift. The convergence of clearer regulation and proven product models is creating a feedback loop. As more ETFs launch, they attract more capital. This increased capital validates the asset class for more conservative institutions. Subsequently, these institutions develop more products and services. This cycle is now self-reinforcing. The total assets under management in crypto-linked ETFs have surpassed $150 billion globally. This figure provides concrete evidence of mainstream acceptance. Furthermore, traditional finance giants are not merely offering products. They are integrating blockchain technology into their core operations. Major custodian banks now offer digital asset safekeeping. Investment banks have established dedicated crypto research divisions. Payment networks are leveraging stablecoins for settlement. This deep, operational integration is the true hallmark of mainstream adoption. It moves beyond speculative investment into utility and infrastructure. Regulatory Clarity as the Primary Catalyst The acceleration Geraci predicts relies heavily on continued regulatory progress. The SEC’s actions in 2024, while initially contentious, ultimately provided a roadmap. Key court rulings established distinctions between securities and non-securities in the crypto space. This clarity allowed asset managers to confidently structure compliant products. Congress is also considering broader digital asset market structure legislation. Bipartisan support appears to be growing for a coherent federal framework. International coordination is another critical factor. Regulatory bodies in the UK, EU, Singapore, and Japan are advancing their own regimes. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is fully in effect. It provides a comprehensive rulebook for the 27-nation bloc. This global patchwork is gradually coalescing into interoperable standards. Consequently, multinational firms can now deploy crypto services at scale with reduced jurisdictional risk. Impact on Traditional Financial Portfolios The practical effect of this integration is profound for portfolio construction. Financial advisors at firms like Novadius can now formally allocate to digital assets. They use the new ETF products to implement these allocations. This marks a departure from the past. Previously, advisors could only recommend self-custody on external exchanges. Now, they can purchase a spot crypto ETF within the same portfolio holding stocks and bonds. This seamless integration fundamentally changes the asset class’s accessibility. Portfolio theory is adapting to include digital assets. Research from university endowments and pension funds indicates a small allocation can improve risk-adjusted returns. This is due to crypto’s historically low correlation with traditional stocks and bonds. As a result, target-date funds and model portfolios are beginning to include a 1-5% digital asset allocation. This institutional adoption drives massive, sticky capital flows into the ecosystem. Conclusion The prediction by Novadius CEO Nate Geraci that crypto’s entry into mainstream finance will accelerate in 2025 is grounded in observable trends. The foundational work of 2024, marked by regulatory milestones and successful product launches, has built substantial momentum. The proliferation of spot and index ETFs has bridged the gap between digital and traditional finance. Ongoing regulatory developments worldwide provide the necessary stability for further growth. Therefore, the integration of cryptocurrency is no longer a speculative future possibility. It is a current, accelerating reality reshaping the global financial landscape. The focus for market participants now shifts from questioning if integration will happen to navigating how it will evolve. FAQs Q1: What does “crypto mainstream finance integration” actually mean? It refers to the process where cryptocurrencies and related digital assets become accessible, usable, and regulated within the traditional financial system. This includes products like ETFs in brokerage accounts, bank custody services, and payment integration, moving beyond niche exchanges. Q2: Why are spot ETFs considered so important for mainstream adoption? Spot ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to the price of a cryptocurrency without directly buying, storing, or managing the digital asset. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, fit into existing investment accounts, and come with familiar regulatory protections and tax reporting. Q3: What was the significance of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in this process? The lawsuit’s resolution provided critical legal clarity on whether certain digital assets (like XRP) are considered securities. This clarity gave asset managers the confidence to create and launch compliant financial products like ETFs, setting a precedent for other assets. Q4: How does a crypto index ETF differ from a single-asset spot ETF? A single-asset ETF (like for Solana) tracks one cryptocurrency. An index ETF holds a basket of multiple digital assets, similar to how an S&P 500 ETF holds many stocks. This allows for diversified sector exposure with one investment, reducing single-asset risk. Q5: Is this integration primarily a U.S. phenomenon, or is it happening globally? While U.S. regulatory and market developments are highly influential, integration is a global trend. The European Union’s MiCA regulation, product launches in Canada and Brazil, and initiatives in Asia-Pacific markets all contribute to worldwide mainstream finance integration for crypto.

Warren Davidson warned this week that the United States is moving toward a financial system that would be licensed, permissioned and heavily monitored — a change he says would undercut the original promise of permissionless, private money. He used social posts to flag the concern and urged colleagues to rethink how new rules for stablecoins and digital IDs are written. Lawmakers Flag The GENIUS Act The debate centers on the GENIUS Act, a federal bill that creates a framework for payment stablecoins and related services. Based on reports, the GENIUS Act (S.1582) established rules that would let certain nonbank firms issue payment stablecoins under federal supervision. The bill’s text and summaries show it aims to clarify who can issue these tokens and how they must operate. Critics say the technical design could let a government or bank-backed system run like a wholesale CBDC. What’s going on in crypto? Flat or declining markets. Definite vibe shift… A few thoughts. Markets have stalled, in my opinion, because the disintermediation use case has been effectively destroyed in America. An account-based industry offers no distinct advantage over the… — Warren Davidson (@WarrenDavidson) December 31, 2025 Privacy Fears And Legislative Pushback According to Davidson’s posts, the problem is not stablecoins themselves but how the rules could be used to build a backend that behaves like a digital dollar under tight control. He warned that an account-based model tied to digital identity could let authorities track or limit transactions. Reports have also pointed to other bills and votes going through Congress that influence this debate, and Davidson has a record of pushing anti-surveillance measures such as legislation related to banning programmable CBDCs. A History Of Bills And Statements Davidson is not alone in raising alarms. Other members of Congress have questioned how new laws might reshape custody, banking roles, and who gets to issue digital money. Some lawmakers argue that clearer rules will attract banks and bring consumer protections, while opponents say those same rules could shift economic power to large financial firms and make everyday payments more traceable. Public records show hearings and committee activity on digital payments and CBDC consequences were held in 2025 as Congress weighed these policies. What Comes Next For Crypto Policy Based on reports, the fight over stablecoin structure and digital identity is likely to continue on Capitol Hill and in public comment periods. Supporters of federal clarity say predictable rules lower risk for users and for the financial system. Critics like Davidson say that predictability should not come at the cost of personal privacy or the right to self-custody. Media outlets covering the story note that the debate spans policy, technology and civil liberties, and that lawmakers will face pressure from banks, tech firms, the crypto industry and privacy groups.

Her post addressed the growing divide between XRP commentators, specifically as criticism intensified around bold forecasts that failed to materialize by the end of the year. Her message aimed to cool tensions among community members. The XRP Family is divided again. Every year that passed, someone had a price prediction. It's a part of the game, the community always does that. Even the bear made one, the only one for the end of 2018 : $589+ The bear was wrong on this one and Brad admitted that he didn't… pic.twitter.com/pZTEeNmYKF — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) December 30, 2025 Price Predictions Have Always Been Part of XRP Xena began by stating that price predictions are not a new phenomenon in the XRP ecosystem. “Every year that passed, someone had a price prediction,” she wrote, calling it a long-standing feature of the community rather than a recent problem. She pointed back to 2018, when even bearish commentators issued extreme forecasts. Xena referenced the end of 2018 prediction of $589 or more, which never happened. She argued the failure came from incorrect assumptions about regulatory readiness, not from bad faith. According to Xena, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse later admitted that the company underestimated how far behind the U.S. government was on crypto regulation. Delays Changed the Timeline Xena argued that regulatory delays, not flawed logic, derailed early expectations. After Brad Garlinghouse acknowledged the regulatory reality, bearish sentiment intensified. She referenced the launch of Loadstar as a turning point. Xena said that with regulation in place, outcomes could have differed. “It’s not about trade. It’s a repricing,” she wrote, adding that XRP’s value depends on utility and regulatory clarity, not speculation. Challenging the Speculation Narrative Xena also revisited Garlinghouse’s statement that “XRP is not a speculative asset.” While acknowledging that many disagree, she questioned the authority of those critics. She then turned her attention to content creators. Xena questioned how end-of-year price predictions are considered harmful, while click-driven videos with aggressive titles are treated as acceptable. In her view, both rely on conviction and opinion, not certainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Dispute Within the Community Xena’s comments come as Levi Rietveld continues to criticize Jake Claver for outlandish XRP predictions. Claver has suggested XRP could trade in the thousands and has maintained double-digit targets before the end of 2025. As XRP remained under $2 near the year’s end, Rietveld intensified his criticism . Xena did not endorse Claver’s numbers. Instead, she questioned the credibility of attacking others for behavior that many XRP YouTubers previously displayed. A Call for Consistency Xena closed by urging introspection. Price predictions, she argued, are opinions backed by belief, not guarantees. Being wrong does not justify public shaming when the same mistakes exist across the community. Dividing the XRP community over predictions only weakens it, especially when critics once made similar calls themselves.

The continual sideways choppiness looks set to continue, as the $BTC price founders below the major ascending trendline yet again. Are we in for a bearish Q1, or is there light at the end of the tunnel for this bottoming process? $BTC price continues to march sideways Source: TradingView In the short-term time frame there isn’t really anything much to report. The $BTC price is just continuing to march sideways. In fact, the downtrend line may as well not even be there for all the lack of respect the price has paid it since breaking through. Yes, there was an initial spurt, but that only really matched the short-lived rallies that went before, and which also petered out once they encountered the $90,000 horizontal resistance. In addition, the price has gone below the major ascending trendline so many times now that it’s ceased to be a concern - until of course when potentially the price starts to drop well below. The Stochastic RSI indicator lines still have a little way to go to hit the bottom, so if they do, there might be a bit more downside to come in this reversal leg, which could take the price down to the $86,000 horizontal support. $BTC price remains in a bear flag Source: TradingView Zooming out into the daily time frame it can be seen that the price is slowly inclining upwards, although this is within a bear flag pattern, which could eventually break down and send the price very much further down. Nevertheless, while the $BTC price persists above the major trendline and decent support at around $86,000, there is still plenty of hope for the bulls. The Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart continues to be in favour of the bulls given that the indicator line has broken through the downtrend and remains above it. Bitcoin closes lower for 2025 Source: TradingView Whichever way the bulls try to put gloss and shine on Bitcoin’s progress over the whole of 2025, the damning evidence is that the $BTC price is lower at the end of the year than it was at the beginning. So is this a sign that Bitcoin has topped at $126,000 and that we are already some way into a bear market? Not necessarily. In fact, it can be argued that the chart and indicators are pointing to a major rally. Firstly, if one looks left at the last major reversal it can be seen that there was a big red monthly candle followed by a small indecisive one, that was then followed by bigger green monthly candles. Isn’t almost the exact same setup playing out now? Yes, there was a bottoming tail for the first green candle last time, and this could happen again. However, the price wasn’t as oversold last time. Therefore, we could arguably expect that same rally. Time to do the opposite of the herd Markets will usually do the opposite of what most expect. Crypto has been abandoned by investors in droves. Many have gone across to the traditional stock market - excited by the gains from the likes of Nvidia and other AI stocks. Bitcoin and crypto is unloved, beaten down, and last year’s shiny thing. If one looks at the $BTC price compared to any of the big stock market assets, or even gold and silver, it is right at the bottom for practically everything. Now might be a very good time to buy.
