Cardano’s price increase in the past 30 days has been more than impressive, with its price doubling within this period. At the time of writing, the ADA is now trading at its highest point so far in 2024 after breaking above the March high of $0.77. Delving deeper into the forces behind this rally, on-chain metrics suggest that the surge is being driven by strong buying momentum, particularly from large ADA holders. Data from the blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock highlights a noteworthy spike in large transaction volume, which today reached $22.56 billion. This figure marks a 297% spike in large transaction volume in the past two weeks. Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume The surge in Cardano’s large holder activity is highlighted by the ‘Large Transactions Volume in USD’ metric provided by blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock. This metric captures the total value of on-chain transactions exceeding $100,000 within a 24-hour period, offering insights into the behavior of high-net-worth investors and institutional participants. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Surge To $138,000 Before Recording A 30% Crash Interstingly, the Large Transactions Volume in USD metric recently reached $28.43 billion on November 16, which is its highest so far till date. Such a figure underscores the significant interest and heightened activity on the Cardano blockchain, particularly among large-scale holders who are likely driving much of the network’s momentum. This elevated level of activity has shown no signs of stopping, with the most recent data reporting $22.56 billion in large transactions over the past 24 hours. To provide perspective, Cardano began November with daily large transaction volumes hovering just below $6 billion before experiencing a notable uptick starting November 6. What’s Next For ADA Price? At the time of writing, the ADA price is trading at $0.80, up by about 6.5% in the past 24 hours. This price point marks the highest ADA price since May 2022. Not just large holders; retail holders are also in on the trend. The ADA trading volume has surged by about 29% in the past 24 hours, coming in at $2.31 billion.

On-chain data and key market indicators suggest that this bullish momentum is likely to persist, with the next significant price target being a breakthrough above the psychological $1 mark. Beyond the large transaction metric, other metrics such as the net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a very optimistic outlook.

36639325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654013,1732147258,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Rally Driven By U.S. Coinbase Investors – Top Analyst Shares Metrics,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-driven-by-u-s-coinbase-investors-top-analyst-shares-metrics/,"Bitcoin reached a new all-time high yesterday, surging to $94,000 and solidifying the bulls’ control over the market. This milestone has ignited widespread speculation about the key factors fueling the rally, as Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines and capture investor enthusiasm. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Key insights from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shed light on the drivers of this historic surge. According to Ju, this rally has been powered by Coinbase investors, with U.S.-based buyers playing a significant role. The influx of demand from these investors underscores the growing domestic interest in Bitcoin and highlights the critical influence of American market participants on global crypto trends. Adding to the excitement, market sentiment appears to be heavily influenced by the pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump. His support for digital assets has sparked optimism across the industry, potentially creating a favorable regulatory environment that could sustain Bitcoin’s growth. Bitcoin Demand Continues To Drive The Price Bitcoin demand remains remarkably strong, even as miners and long-term holders (LTHs) take profits during this rally. Despite selling pressure from these groups, BTC continues to rise, underscoring the robust market appetite for the leading cryptocurrency. This strength suggests buyers readily absorb the distributed supply, fueling Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently shared insightful data on X that highlights the driving forces behind this rally. According to Ju, U.S.-based investors using Coinbase have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s surge. He referenced the BTC Hourly Coinbase Premium (Volume-Weighted, USDT/USD Adjusted), which measures the difference in Bitcoin prices on Coinbase compared to other exchanges. The premium is currently positive and growing, indicating that U.S. investors are willing to pay more for BTC than their international counterparts. This trend demonstrates strong demand from U.S. market participants, likely buoyed by improving market sentiment and potential regulatory optimism. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target If this upward momentum in U.S. demand persists, Bitcoin’s rally could extend further in the coming weeks, potentially setting new highs before any major correction occurs. However, as with all parabolic trends, traders and analysts remain cautious, recognizing the possibility of eventual pullbacks. The focus remains on Bitcoin’s strength, as buyers continue to outpace sellers, driving the market higher. BTC Setting New Highs (Again) Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $93,300, following its recent break above the all-time high (ATH) of $93,483. While this move marked a new milestone for BTC, the price has since entered a sideways range within a defined uptrend, indicating that demand continues to outweigh supply. However, the breakout above the ATH lacked significant momentum, resembling more of a small spring than a decisive rally. This suggests that bulls might be starting to lose steam. Despite this, BTC’s ability to maintain above $89,800 in the coming hours will be critical. Holding this key support level could pave the way for a surge to $95,000, aligning with broader market expectations of continued bullish momentum. Such a move would likely reaffirm confidence among investors, potentially driving further buying interest as Bitcoin eyes the psychological $100,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Supply – On-Chain Metrics Reveal Low Seller Volume On the other hand, a drop below $89,800 would shift the short-term narrative. This scenario could lead to a retrace toward lower demand zones around $85,000, where buyers might regroup to push prices higher again. As BTC consolidates near its ATH, the market awaits a decisive move to determine whether the bulls remain firmly in control or if a temporary correction is on the horizon.

Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says Upon listing, this solid upward trend catapulted BONK to its all-time high, raising its market capitalization to an impressive $4.2 billion. The trading volume of the token increased by 77%, indicating significant individual and institutional interest. Such frenzy ensured that the memecoin became the number one meme coin within the Solana network. Nevertheless, the accompanying positive sentiments (and anxieties) will lead investors to ask whether BONK will be able to keep the pace considering the historical volatility of the market. 신규 디지털 자산 봉크(BONK) 거래지원 안내 ✅ 지원 마켓: KRW 마켓 📅 거래지원 개시 시점: 2024-11-20 12:30 예정 🔗 공지 바로가기:https://t.co/r2DhwVlJcO#Upbit #BONK pic.twitter.com/vSTAAG5cLv — Upbit Korea (@Official_Upbit) November 20, 2024 Whales Join The BONK Party Institutional investors see BONK’s promise. A recent whale transaction shows the increasing faith in this meme coin: 65.4 billion BONK tokens for $3.4 million in USDC were bought. Such big sales not only confirm BONK’s popularity but also show how it affects Solana’s bigger ecology. The rise of the token has drawn more than just whales. Blockchain data shows that the amount of people interested in BONK futures topped $53.5 million, which is around seven times the monthly low. This means that traders are betting on BONK’s rising trend, even though such assets come with risks. Technical Breakthrough Fuels Optimism The recent end of BONK’s long-term consolidation period offers traders a hopeful signal. Experts say the major causes driving the meme coin’s rise are aggressive trading and increasing buying pressure. BONK temporarily exceeded joke currencies like DogWife when its price shot to $0.00005916 for a fresh ATH. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00005364, up 67% in the last seven days, data from Bitstamp shows. Nonetheless, analytical tools suggest that the buying pressure in the market is reaching its limits. This, however, may lead to some temporary downward movement, but experts are still positive on BONK coming back after a certain period. Although the token has retraced to $0.00005684, this hasn’t dampened the community enthusiasm. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Hits Milestone: $400 Price Target Gains Traction Bright Future For BONK And Solana More than just a viral currency narrative, BONK’s explosive expansion is a triumph for the Solana ecosystem. The buzz around BONK has refocused attention on Solana, attracting fresh users and so strengthening its reputation as a top blockchain platform. At the same time, the prospect appears to be very optimistic, showing an increase of 252% in price expectations during the next three months, and a further 185% increase in six months. While the thrill of speculation is there, veteran traders ring in their warning. As BONK rides this wave, it’s clear the memecoin is no longer just a joke—it’s a phenomenon reshaping the crypto landscape.

BTC is showing positive signs and might continue to rise above the $95,000 level. Bitcoin started a fresh increase above the $92,000 zone. The price is trading above $92,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $93,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $95,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price remained supported above the $91,000 level. BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $92,000 level. It cleared the $94,000 level and traded to a new high at $94,980 before there was a pullback. There was a move below the $94,200 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $94,980 high. However, the price is stable and consolidating near the $94,200 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $93,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $93,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $94,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,000 level. A clear move above the $95,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $98,000. A close above the $98,000 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $100,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $102,000 resistance level. Another Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,700 level. The first major support is near the $92,800 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $94,980 high. The next support is now near the $91,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $90,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $93,800, followed by $92,800.
