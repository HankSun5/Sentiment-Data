Cardano’s price increase in the past 30 days has been more than impressive, with its price doubling within this period. At the time of writing, the ADA is now trading at its highest point so far in 2024 after breaking above the March high of $0.77. Delving deeper into the forces behind this rally, on-chain metrics suggest that the surge is being driven by strong buying momentum, particularly from large ADA holders. Data from the blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock highlights a noteworthy spike in large transaction volume, which today reached $22.56 billion. This figure marks a 297% spike in large transaction volume in the past two weeks. Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume The surge in Cardano’s large holder activity is highlighted by the ‘Large Transactions Volume in USD’ metric provided by blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock. This metric captures the total value of on-chain transactions exceeding $100,000 within a 24-hour period, offering insights into the behavior of high-net-worth investors and institutional participants. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Surge To $138,000 Before Recording A 30% Crash Interstingly, the Large Transactions Volume in USD metric recently reached $28.43 billion on November 16, which is its highest so far till date. Such a figure underscores the significant interest and heightened activity on the Cardano blockchain, particularly among large-scale holders who are likely driving much of the network’s momentum. This elevated level of activity has shown no signs of stopping, with the most recent data reporting $22.56 billion in large transactions over the past 24 hours. To provide perspective, Cardano began November with daily large transaction volumes hovering just below $6 billion before experiencing a notable uptick starting November 6. What’s Next For ADA Price? At the time of writing, the ADA price is trading at $0.80, up by about 6.5% in the past 24 hours. This price point marks the highest ADA price since May 2022. Not just large holders; retail holders are also in on the trend. The ADA trading volume has surged by about 29% in the past 24 hours, coming in at $2.31 billion.

On-chain data and key market indicators suggest that this bullish momentum is likely to persist, with the next significant price target being a breakthrough above the psychological $1 mark. Beyond the large transaction metric, other metrics such as the net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a very optimistic outlook.

This milestone has ignited widespread speculation about the key factors fueling the rally, as Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines and capture investor enthusiasm. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Key insights from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shed light on the drivers of this historic surge. According to Ju, this rally has been powered by Coinbase investors, with U.S.-based buyers playing a significant role. The influx of demand from these investors underscores the growing domestic interest in Bitcoin and highlights the critical influence of American market participants on global crypto trends. Adding to the excitement, market sentiment appears to be heavily influenced by the pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump. His support for digital assets has sparked optimism across the industry, potentially creating a favorable regulatory environment that could sustain Bitcoin’s growth. Bitcoin Demand Continues To Drive The Price Bitcoin demand remains remarkably strong, even as miners and long-term holders (LTHs) take profits during this rally. Despite selling pressure from these groups, BTC continues to rise, underscoring the robust market appetite for the leading cryptocurrency. This strength suggests buyers readily absorb the distributed supply, fueling Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently shared insightful data on X that highlights the driving forces behind this rally. According to Ju, U.S.-based investors using Coinbase have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s surge. He referenced the BTC Hourly Coinbase Premium (Volume-Weighted, USDT/USD Adjusted), which measures the difference in Bitcoin prices on Coinbase compared to other exchanges. The premium is currently positive and growing, indicating that U.S. investors are willing to pay more for BTC than their international counterparts. This trend demonstrates strong demand from U.S. market participants, likely buoyed by improving market sentiment and potential regulatory optimism. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target If this upward momentum in U.S. demand persists, Bitcoin’s rally could extend further in the coming weeks, potentially setting new highs before any major correction occurs. However, as with all parabolic trends, traders and analysts remain cautious, recognizing the possibility of eventual pullbacks. The focus remains on Bitcoin’s strength, as buyers continue to outpace sellers, driving the market higher. BTC Setting New Highs (Again) Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $93,300, following its recent break above the all-time high (ATH) of $93,483. While this move marked a new milestone for BTC, the price has since entered a sideways range within a defined uptrend, indicating that demand continues to outweigh supply. However, the breakout above the ATH lacked significant momentum, resembling more of a small spring than a decisive rally. This suggests that bulls might be starting to lose steam. Despite this, BTC’s ability to maintain above $89,800 in the coming hours will be critical. Holding this key support level could pave the way for a surge to $95,000, aligning with broader market expectations of continued bullish momentum. Such a move would likely reaffirm confidence among investors, potentially driving further buying interest as Bitcoin eyes the psychological $100,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Supply – On-Chain Metrics Reveal Low Seller Volume On the other hand, a drop below $89,800 would shift the short-term narrative. This scenario could lead to a retrace toward lower demand zones around $85,000, where buyers might regroup to push prices higher again. As BTC consolidates near its ATH, the market awaits a decisive move to determine whether the bulls remain firmly in control or if a temporary correction is on the horizon.

Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says Upon listing, this solid upward trend catapulted BONK to its all-time high, raising its market capitalization to an impressive $4.2 billion. The trading volume of the token increased by 77%, indicating significant individual and institutional interest. Such frenzy ensured that the memecoin became the number one meme coin within the Solana network. Nevertheless, the accompanying positive sentiments (and anxieties) will lead investors to ask whether BONK will be able to keep the pace considering the historical volatility of the market. 신규 디지털 자산 봉크(BONK) 거래지원 안내 ✅ 지원 마켓: KRW 마켓 📅 거래지원 개시 시점: 2024-11-20 12:30 예정 🔗 공지 바로가기:https://t.co/r2DhwVlJcO#Upbit #BONK pic.twitter.com/vSTAAG5cLv — Upbit Korea (@Official_Upbit) November 20, 2024 Whales Join The BONK Party Institutional investors see BONK’s promise. A recent whale transaction shows the increasing faith in this meme coin: 65.4 billion BONK tokens for $3.4 million in USDC were bought. Such big sales not only confirm BONK’s popularity but also show how it affects Solana’s bigger ecology. The rise of the token has drawn more than just whales. Blockchain data shows that the amount of people interested in BONK futures topped $53.5 million, which is around seven times the monthly low. This means that traders are betting on BONK’s rising trend, even though such assets come with risks. Technical Breakthrough Fuels Optimism The recent end of BONK’s long-term consolidation period offers traders a hopeful signal. Experts say the major causes driving the meme coin’s rise are aggressive trading and increasing buying pressure. BONK temporarily exceeded joke currencies like DogWife when its price shot to $0.00005916 for a fresh ATH. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00005364, up 67% in the last seven days, data from Bitstamp shows. Nonetheless, analytical tools suggest that the buying pressure in the market is reaching its limits. This, however, may lead to some temporary downward movement, but experts are still positive on BONK coming back after a certain period. Although the token has retraced to $0.00005684, this hasn’t dampened the community enthusiasm.

The buzz around BONK has refocused attention on Solana, attracting fresh users and so strengthening its reputation as a top blockchain platform. At the same time, the prospect appears to be very optimistic, showing an increase of 252% in price expectations during the next three months, and a further 185% increase in six months. While the thrill of speculation is there, veteran traders ring in their warning. As BONK rides this wave, it’s clear the memecoin is no longer just a joke—it’s a phenomenon reshaping the crypto landscape.

BTC is showing positive signs and might continue to rise above the $95,000 level. Bitcoin started a fresh increase above the $92,000 zone. The price is trading above $92,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $93,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $95,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price remained supported above the $91,000 level. BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $92,000 level. It cleared the $94,000 level and traded to a new high at $94,980 before there was a pullback. There was a move below the $94,200 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $94,980 high. However, the price is stable and consolidating near the $94,200 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $93,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $93,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $94,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,000 level. A clear move above the $95,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $98,000. A close above the $98,000 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $100,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $102,000 resistance level. Another Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,700 level. The first major support is near the $92,800 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $94,980 high. The next support is now near the $91,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $90,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $93,800, followed by $92,800.

36645555,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654023,1732158025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-test-of-0-786/,"The Dogecoin price has been trading sideways for the past few days, consolidating around the $0.4 mark as it targets a breakout to the upside. This $0.4 price point is represented by the 0.786 Fibonacci level, which an analyst has confirmed that Dogecoin continues to test in order to witness a price rally. Dogecoin Price Targets 0.786 Fib Breakout Kevin, a Dogecoin analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has shared his analysis of the DOGE price action, highlighting a key resistance point that could catalyze the meme coin’s anticipated rally. Given the recent surge in the Dogecoin price this month, many analysts have forecasted that the meme coin is gearing up to hit the $1 ATH. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Possible 40% Crash For XRP Price With Gravestone DOJI Candle Formation Some of these analysts have also suggested that factors like Donald Trump‘s win in the U.S. Presidential election, Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E commission, and growing positive sentiment in the crypto community, could become the critical drivers for the Dogecoin price, pushing it to new highs. Despite this bullish sentiment, the DOGE price continues to trade sideways, struggling to break through the $0.4 price. Kevin has disclosed that the $0.4 mark is a crucial resistance level for Dogecoin, representing the 0.786 Fib. He highlighted that the Dogecoin price has been testing this critical Fibonacci level but was sharply rejected on November 19. This price rejection is also among several failed attempts in the past few days, as Dogecoin has repeatedly tested this crucial level. While the optimism for a Dogecoin price surge is high, Kevin has stated that unless the meme coin can break above this crucial resistance level “cleanly and violently,” there’s no reason for investors to expect any major price movement or get overly excited about a potential rally. The Dogecoin analyst also highlighted a critical resistance level for the Bitcoin price. Kevin has revealed that Bitcoin’s next upside rally will occur once it clears the resistance level at $100,000. The analyst suggests that the market will likely move slowly and remain relatively uneventful until the pioneer meme coin can break past this crucial milestone. Dogecoin Next Target: Monthly Close Above $0.335 In another X post, Kevin explained the downside target for the Dogecoin price if it fails to break the 0.786 Fib resistance level. He revealed that the DOGE price moment, via its chart, is showcasing a “nasty triple top” at the macro 0.786 Fib level. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Surge To $138,000 Before Recording A 30% Crash Kevin has predicted that a drop to the $0.30 mark is highly possible for Dogecoin if volatility and market uncertainty persist. This decline could also be triggered by selling pressures and a lack of bullish momentum. Conversely, the analyst has revealed that the next big rally for Dogecoin could be seen if the meme coin can close a monthly candle above $0.335 in the next 11 days. Kevin has stated that achieving this feat would be a significant milestone, marking Dogecoin’s highest monthly candle close of all time.

Ethereum Price Struggle Continues Ethereum price attempted an upside break above the $3,200 resistance but failed unlike Bitcoin.

The price might start a fresh increase if it clears the $1.150 resistance zone. XRP price started a downside correction below the $1.120 level. The price is now trading below $1.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1.150 resistance. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $1.150 and $1.180 levels. It started a downside correction and traded below the $1.120 level. It underperformed Bitcoin and struggled like Ethereum in the past two sessions. The price is now trading below $1.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.1380 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $1.150 level. The next key resistance could be $1.1680 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2747 swing high to the $0.9988 low. A clear move above the $1.1680 resistance might send the price toward the $1.200 resistance or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2747 swing high to the $0.9988 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.2250 resistance or even $1.2320 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.250 or $1.265. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $1.1380 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.100 level. The next major support is near the $1.0650 level or the triangle’s lower trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.0650 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.020 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.980 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $1.1000 and $1.0000.

In a post on Tuesday via X, Novogratz declared that countries are already purchasing Bitcoin. Nation-State Bitcoin FOMO Is Real “Countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes—these are massive pools of capital entering the market. We’re witnessing global adoption at scale and the next rally could be massive. Buckle up. Caught up last week with Bloomberg TV, he stated via X. In the Bloomberg interview, Novogratz elaborated on the unprecedented interest from sovereign entities. He mentioned a close associate—the person who introduced him to BTC in 2013—who is currently in the Middle East. “He’s never seen anything like it,” Novogratz said. “He’s convincing more people to buy Bitcoin in the three days he’s been there than any time in his whole career, and they’re huge pools of capital. And so we’re seeing something globally.” Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Push Price Above $1 Million, Expert Predicts Novogratz noted that when former President Donald Trump advocated in Nashville that he intended to be a “crypto president” and a “Bitcoin president,” it caught the attention of international leaders. “Other leaders heard that,” he remarked, suggesting that geopolitical factors could contribute to an “amazing rally” in the Bitcoin market. When questioned about the likelihood of the United States establishing a Strategic BTC Reserve under a Trump presidency, Novogratz remained cautious. “I still think it’s a low probability,” he stated. He cited the complexities of US legislative processes, emphasizing that while the executive branch or the House might show enthusiasm, the Senate often urges restraint. “That’s the role of the Senate,” he said, pointing out that Republicans do not hold a 60-seat majority necessary to push through such initiatives unilaterally. Nonetheless, Novogratz acknowledged the potential benefits of the US embracing Bitcoin at a strategic level. “It would be very smart for the United States to take the Bitcoin they have and maybe add some to it,” he suggested, adding that it would signal a commitment to being a “technology-first country, a crypto and digital asset-first country.” While he doesn’t believe the US dollar requires backing by Bitcoin, he admitted that if a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve were established, “Bitcoin heads to $500,000.” Related Reading: BitMEX Founder Predicts How Bitcoin Goes To $1 Million Under Trump He added: “If it happens in the short term without a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it’s going to mean six, seven, eight years,” Novogratz cautioned. “Then it’s just a scramble to get the hot commodity.” He expressed concerns that such a scenario could be indicative of hyperinflation, which historically leads to societal instability. “In every country that experiences hyperinflation, the results are really crappy,” he noted. Discussing Bitcoin’s potential to rival gold as a store of value, Novogratz highlighted a generational shift in investment preferences. “The total market cap of gold is like $16 trillion,” he explained, which translates to approximately $800,000 per BTC if it were to reach parity. “When does Bitcoin become gold?” he asked rhetorically. Novogratz, who is turning 60 next week, admitted he still owns gold, calling himself “an old guy.” However, he pointed out that younger generations are less inclined to invest in gold. “Forty-year-olds own no gold. Thirty-year-olds own none,” he observed. “As we see this generational shift, Bitcoin should match gold within five or ten years, and that gets you to $800,000.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,000.

Particularly, while Bitcoin’s price action remains a dominant force in the market, Ethereum’s derivatives activity suggests that it could be gearing up for notable upward momentum. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Undervalued? Investors Hold Firm While Price Targets Rise New Highs In ETH Open Interest And Leverage Ratios According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s EgyHash, the open interest in Ethereum has surpassed its previous all-time high, marking a 40% increase in just four months and exceeding the $13 billion threshold. The surge in open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, reflects a growing engagement among traders and institutions in Ethereum’s market. Alongside this, EgyHash also mentioned that funding rates have turned moderately positive, signalling that long-position traders are currently dominant. This aligns with a sentiment favouring further price increases for ETH in the short term. The rise in open interest is not the only indicator of Ethereum’s increasing activity in derivatives markets. The CryptoQuant analyst pointed to Ethereum’s estimated leverage ratio. EgyHash disclosed that this metric which is calculated as the ratio of open interest to the exchange’s coin reserves, has also reached a new all-time high of +0.40. Commenting on what these rising metrics means for market participants, the CryptoQuant analyst wrote: While these trends underscore positive market sentiment toward ETH, it would be prudent to remain mindful of potential risks. The elevated leverage and dominance of long positions could increase the likelihood of a long squeeze if sudden price volatility occurs, potentially leading to market corrections. Ethereum Market Performance Regardless of the positive key metrics, Ethereum has continued to be one of the underperforming crypto in the market especially when compared to Bitcoin. Particularly, while Bitcoin has consistently being breaching major resistance to hit new highs, ETH still remains 36.2% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 registered in 2021. However, as of today, the asset seems to be gearing up for an uptrend. At the time of writing, Ethereum has surged by 0.9% in the past day with a current trading price of $3,112. Renowned analyst known as Ali on X has recently shared his outlook on the asset noting that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin soon. The analyst backed this statement citing several key metrics and trends. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Challenges: Will It Find Traction Soon? According to Ali, the altseason indicator is flashing buying opportunity and ETH’s MVRV momentum nears a key moving average suggesting significant upside potential. The analyst also mentioned the spot exchange-traded flows (ETF) Inflows and increasing whale Activity. Ali then suggested that Ethereum could test $4,000 and $6,000 levels based on an ascending parallel channel. He also highlighted a bullish theory on ETH’s potential to hit $10,000.

Analysts are dubbing this rally the “Trump trade,” as the recent political developments surrounding Donald Trump’s victory have instilled renewed confidence among investors in BTC and the broader crypto market. Analyst Forecasts 42% Increase For BTC Despite the impressive surge, analysts believe Bitcoin’s price discovery is far from complete, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Among those sharing this bullish sentiment is analyst Ali Martinez, who draws parallels between Bitcoin’s current price movements and those seen in December 2020, before the notable uptrend that ultimately led to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Forms A ‘Nasty Triple Top’: Analyst Reveals What’s Next Martinez notes that the relative strength index (RSI), a key technical indicator used to gauge momentum, is currently mirroring the patterns observed in late 2020. This similarity suggests that the BTC price may be poised for significant upward movements in the coming months. According to Martinez, if this trend continues, Bitcoin could target the $108,000 mark, followed by a potential correction to around $99,000, before bouncing back to a predicted milestone of $135,000. This forecast represents an increase of over 42% from current levels, although Martinez did not specify a timeline for these movements, indicating they might occur anywhere between now and the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin To Reach $1 Million By 2029? In even more optimistic projections, market expert Timothy Peterson, who identifies as a network economist, suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish trend could persist until November 2025, with ambitious targets set for the future. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peterson predicted that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 per coin by Thanksgiving Day 2025. He bases this projection on Metcalfe’s Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of users. This indicates that as more individuals adopt Bitcoin, its value is likely to increase significantly. Related Reading: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Options Surge: December 20 Call Signals BTC Price Target Of $180,000 Looking further ahead, the economist also asserts that the Bitcoin price could achieve the coveted valuation of $1,000,000 per coin by 2029, representing a staggering 954% increase from current levels. Trading at $94,730 as of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has seen massive gains in recent weeks, with a 26% and 39% increase in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively. Furthermore, BTC has reached a market cap valuation of $1.8 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world, currently ranked 7th, just behind companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But quite far from the leading asset in this matter which is gold with a market cap of $17 trillion.

Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Parabolic Phase Just Begun’, Is BTC Hitting $100,000 This Week? Solana-Based Memecoin Rug Pulled By 12-Year-Old As the market enters the rally’s second leg, Solana memecoins remain the cycle’s top narrative, and many traders continue to try to find and profit from the next big thing. However, scammers continue to attempt to take advantage of the memecoin frenzy. A Gen Z trader has made the headlights after trying to rug a Solana-based memecoin he created on a live stream. The 12-year-old trader has a crypto-dedicated X account and has previously shared his profits. On Monday, he posted a picture sharing he “just made $2k before school.” The next day, the young trader launched the Gen Z Quant (QUANT) token on the popular Solana-based launchpad, Pump.fun. While the token’s price rose, he expressed surprise before flipping the watchers. According to the on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the kid sold all his QUANT holdings, around 51 million tokens. The Gen Z trader got 128 Solana (SOL), worth $30,000, for the tokens, making a $29,600 profit in minutes. After the kid ended the live stream, the crypto community took over the Solana memecoin, sending the price toward the $0.08 mark as “revenge.” The token rose over 77,000% to a market capitalization of $82.3 million in the early hours of Wednesday before retracing toward the $50 million mark. As a result, the Gen Z trader’s holdings would have been worth around $4 million just a few hours after rug-pulling. Some crypto investors considered the takeover a “lesson for all of those who rug.” Meanwhile, others questioned the state of the community for it to be scammed by a child and argued that investors should not abandon the Solana memecoin “to prove a point.” The Rapid Fall Of QUANT Following the rug pull, the kid created another two memecoins, LUCY and SORRY, seemingly poking fun at the crypto community for his QUANT scheme. However, he sold these tokens for 103 SOL, worth $24,000 at the time of the report. The Gen Z trader’s scheme also resulted in several memecoins related to the event. However, some of the tokens were based on the kid and his family, who had their information doxxed online after the incident. Notably, a lucky trader managed to get a 2,141x return on his QUANT investment despite the rug pull. Lookonchain also reported on an investor who spent 2 SOL, valued at $462, to buy 18.89 million QUANT tokens. Related Reading: Aptos Following SUI’s Lead? Analyst Says APT’s ‘Explosive Breakout’ Targets $20 Three hours later, the crypto community had sent the token to its peak, driving his unrealized profits to nearly $1 million. The trader sold 3.71 million QUANT for 116 SOL, worth $27,000, and left 15.18 million QUANT, making an unrealized profit of $962,000 at the time of the report. Despite the takeover, the memecoin’s rally has significantly slowed throughout the day, falling 57% from its peak. As of this writing, the token trades at $0.035, with a market capitalization of $35.11 million.

Data from suivision and suiscan indicate that block generation stopped at 09:15 UTC today, and the network has yet to resume normal operations. This marks the first major outage for the project, a blockchain praised as “Solana killer.” SUI Price Crashes Following Network Outage Members of the community have suggested that issues with validators might be the cause of the disruption. Validators, critical for processing transactions and maintaining the blockchain’s integrity, appear to be experiencing problems. The official status page, status.sui.io, acknowledges the issue, stating that they are “continuing to investigate” and confirming that “validators are down.” Despite these updates, the development team has not released an official statement detailing the root cause or providing a timeline for resolution.

Crypto analyst Quinten Francois commented, “SUI has been down for 55 min, with no blocks produced during this period. SOL 2.0?” Similarly, WantCoinNews expressed interest in how the Sui community and developers will handle the downtime, stating that their response could “either destroy or strengthen the trust in the chain.” They added a personal note, saying, “Let me just ignore this Solana type FUD and look for entries. Minimum $5.” Ben Armstrong, known as BitBoy, weighed in on the matter: “It is with great pause, I declare SUI officially the next SOL. How many times do I have to say it? Can’t wait to hear from the team on this one. Solana has taught us that it’s way better for a blockchain to be overwhelmed than not used.” Related Reading: Aptos Following SUI’s Lead? Analyst Says APT’s ‘Explosive Breakout’ Targets $20 Following the news of the outage, the token’s price dropped by 7%. Over the last 24 hours, the SUI price has fallen by nearly 10%, reflecting investor concerns over the network’s reliability. Despite this setback, SUI remains one of the few altcoins to have reached a new all-time high in the current market cycle. The price dip brings the token to a critical support level at the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of $3.24. If this support holds, SUI could be poised for another upward movement, potentially targeting the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level at $4.97. At press time, SUI traded at $3.39.

The company grew compute power sold by 92% year over and improved rate by 12%. Canaan's Avalon Nano 3 machine could conceivably generate increased interest from home miners if the psychological level of $100k BTC is breached. We are not yet in the 'gold rush' phase of the market judging by current Nano 3 prices, but BTC leads CAN stock higher if history is a guide. When I l ast covered Canaan Inc ( CAN ) for Seeking Alpha in March of this year, I rated the stock a 'hold' and noted the company's high cash burn and reliance on shareholder dilution for funding operations. The latter of which is certainly not unique to Canaan and is generally standard operating procedure among public Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies. In this update, we'll look at Canaan's recently reported Q3 earnings report and assess if any further boost can reasonably be expected in the stock now that Bitcoin is seemingly surging toward a six-figure dollar denominated coin price. What Canaan Does To briefly recap Canaan's business; the company derives most of its revenue from selling Bitcoin mining machines. The company's primary product line is the AvalonMiner machine - the most recent of which is the A15 series: Canaan Q3 Deck Subsequent to the end of September, Canaan has announced sales of its A15 series machines to publicly traded Bitcoin miners HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ). The company also offers a consumer-focused miner via the Avalon Nano 3 machine. We'll get into that product a bit more shortly. In addition to selling machines to both consumers and major mining businesses in the industry, Canaan also has a self-mining operation that has typically generated between 10-20% of the company's quarterly revenue over the last two years. Canaan's Q3 Earnings For the quarter ended September 2024, Canaan reported $73.6 million in total revenue with $64.5 million in products revenue and just under $9 million in self-mining revenue. The company beat estimates on the top line but missed expectations on EPADS of -$0.27. Canaan While the company managed to reduce COGS year over year by 7% from $102.4 million to $95.1 million, Canaan still reported a gross loss of $21.5 million in Q3. Canaan Quarterly opex came in at $35.3 million which made the total loss from operations $56.8 million; this was actually an improvement from the $112.8 million operating loss in the period from the prior year but a larger operating loss sequentially. Breaking the company's figures down a bit more, Canaan grew computing power sold year over year by 92%: Canaan The average selling price of that compute was $8.8 TH/s, which was up 12% year over year. Something I find interesting from that slide is the Nano 3 sales and revenue from those sales. At $1.4 million for 10,000 units, the Nano 3 generated roughly $140 per unit sold for Canaan last quarter. Canaan I actually think this is a fairly interesting product because it's marketed toward the general public rather than professional miners. When Bitcoin inevitably eclipses six figures, machines like this Nano 3 could conceivably be profitable as in-home miners if energy expenses are low enough. That said, the most realistic scenario is these types of home mining machines will fail to generate a positive return after all-in energy and machine purchase costs. But judging from the company's website, it appears as though December Nano 3 shipments are being sold a discount. This is not what I'd expect to be seeing with Bitcoin's price nearing $100k. So where is ""digital gold"" fever? In a 'gold rush' there is certainly logic to being in the picks and shovels business. When digging for ""digital gold,"" the shovels are computer chips. During the last cycle, the price of CAN exploded from under $2 per share in October 2020 up over $39 by March of 2021: Data by YCharts What's telling to me from the chart above is the fact that it took the price of BTC rocketing over $30k per coin for CAN stock to enter a mania. This cycle, we have a Bitcoin price that is quickly closing in on $100k per coin yet CAN is still close to its nominal share price lows from August. The chart below is similar to a chart I shared in my last CAN piece: Data by YCharts Canaan had negative net income in 2020 and deeply negative net income in 2019 - thus, the depressed share price at that time shouldn't be all that surprising. But I think the story that this chart really conveys is pretty simple: Bitcoin led CAN stock and CAN stock led CAN's quarterly revenue. There is certainly no rule that says this has to happen again. But I actually don't dislike the stock down here if we do indeed get a six figure BTC price. Balance Sheet Considerations Like many other Bitcoin mining stocks, operations are generally subsidized by shareholder dilution. This has certainly been the case for Canaan as well. The company continues to raise capital through preferred share sales and even announced another $30 million of securities sales the same day it released Q3 earnings. This latest preferred offering comes after Canaan closed the third tranche of additional preferred shares for $50 million less than a month prior. Canaan At the end of Q3, Canaan had $71.8 million in cash and $138.2 million in prepayments and other current assets. There was $186.3 million in total liabilities - 81% of which were current with $77 million of that being convertible preferred shares. Canaan The company does have a fairly large BTC stack at 1,212 million coins. That hoard has a market value of $114 million at a $94k BTC price per coin. However, 730 million of those coins are not directly held and thus introduce counter party risk into the equation. Closing Thoughts If we think about this through the perspective of the market, six figure Bitcoin is going to probably generate headlines in the broad media landscape. Those headlines may trigger a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency market from the larger public. Higher BTC prices inevitably make the economics of mining more viable. And mining profitability generally strengthens the incentive to mine whether the 'gold' is physical or digital. The point is, as long as Michael Saylor's ' infinite money glitch ' positive feedback loop keeps pushing BTC prices higher, I think there is a realistic scenario where CAN shares can have a run again provided the market starts sniffing out increased machine sales before the revenue is disclosed in Canaan's earnings. But to be clear, I don't think this company is a great long term investment by any stretch. But as a speculative swing trade with $100k BTC as a primary catalyst, it might be worth a shot at $1.70 per share. I have a small position in CAN that I expect to hold for the next few months. I do not anticipate the share price will get remotely close to revisiting previous cycle highs. I'll reiterate the 'hold' call.",BTC-USD|CAN,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-21 13:30:00

Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price. XRP Investors Have Been Depositing To Binance Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a large amount of XRP deposit transactions have headed to Binance recently. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which keeps track of the net transfers going in or out of a given centralized exchange. The traditional form of this metric measures the difference between the inflow and outflow volume for the platform, but in the context of the current topic, a different version of the indicator is of interest: one that counts the net number of deposit/withdrawal transactions. When the value of the metric is positive, it means there are more inflow transfers happening for the exchange than outflow ones. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for XRP. Related Reading: Cardano Outperforms Market With 50% Surge: Here’s Why On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies withdrawals are dominant on the exchange. Such a trend can be a sign that holders are interested in HODLing into the long term, which can naturally have bullish effects on the price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the XRP Exchange Netflow for Binance over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the XRP Exchange Netflow for Binance has mostly stayed inside the positive territory during the last two years, which suggests investors have constantly been making withdrawal transactions. Recently, however, the metric appears to have diverged from the norm, as its value has registered a sharp positive spike. The asset has seen a sharp rally of over 54% in the past week, so it’s possible that the traders making the deposits are looking to sell and realize their profits. Now, the main question is, is this selling a potential threat to XRP’s value? The indicator is sitting at 470 right now, which suggests significantly more inflows than outflows. Considering that this is also just the 30-day MA, the peak value is bound to be even higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is About To See A Historically-Profitable Crossover In This Metric While this high number of inflow transactions may look like a danger at first glance, it may actually not be so, since it corresponds to activity that’s mostly from the retail investors. Whales don’t tend to leave behind too many transactions, as they prefer to move large amounts with a single transaction. Thus, whenever this version of the Exchange Netflow spikes, it’s a sign that the small holders are depositing. Naturally, there could still be a few whale transfers among these inflows, which can indeed end up having a negative effect on the XRP price. It only remains to be seen, though, which of the scenarios holds true. XRP Price XRP has pulled ahead of the rest of the market with a sharp rally during the past week, which has taken its price to $1.09.

The token has fluctuated wildly over the course of the last several months and this particular exchange on November 20, has caused significant interest due to its enormity and the prevailing market tendencies. Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania Investor Confidence In The Face Of Volatility A bold move from an anonymous investor comes at a time when the meme coin is seeing some volatility. PEPE has been down, trading at about $0.00002027 as of November 19 after hitting an all-time high of about $0.00002457 earlier this month. Based on data from Lookonchain, the unknown investor shelled out $2 million worth of USDC to purchase 105,328,301,633 (approximately 105.33 billion) PEPE in a single transaction. Someone spent 2M $USDC to buy 105.33B $PEPE in a single transaction! Address: 0xd71c6b3760cfd22e50e5514d163986552a96930b pic.twitter.com/kDKmgptPEc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 21, 2024 The investor thought it would be smart to buy more of the joke cryptocurrency at a lower price, even though the price was going down. Some investors might agree with the choice. This includes “whales,” who have been buying PEPE during market swings. PEPE: Market Trends And Performance Since its April 2023 launch, PEPE has undergone significant transformation. Starting extremely modest at $0.00000001, its market value skyrocketed in a few weeks to over $1 billion. This coin got rather more well-known as prominent exchanges like Robinhood and Coinbase started trading it. Still, PEPE is vulnerable to market patterns swayed by more general economic events and social media, just as many cryptocurrencies are. Among the meme coins that have lately gone somewhat popular are PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Actually, PEPE saw an amazing increase of more than 106% just in mid-November. Prospects And Obstacles Although the recent acquisition indicates robust investor interest, PEPE and comparable meme currencies are confronted with numerous obstacles. Market volatility continues to be a significant concern, as prices can fluctuate significantly in response to regulatory news or social media trends. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says PEPE’s standing in the market could potentially be impacted by rival coins. To maintain its drive, PEPE needs to draw in fresh investors while also showing practical usefulness that goes beyond its status as a joke. For those investors pondering an initiation or increase of their stakes in meme currencies like PEPE, keeping abreast with the shifting rhythm and patterns of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is of utmost importance, given its constant advancement. The most recent large-scale transaction is indicative of the risks and opportunities that are inherent in this rapidly evolving market. Investors are closely monitoring the outcome of this audacious maneuver to determine whether it will prove advantageous or whether the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies will generate additional uncertainty in the near future.

As the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum has the biggest price correlation with Bitcoin. However, you could argue the Ethereum price has been largely left behind in terms of performance throughout the ongoing bull cycle. Interestingly, a crypto analyst, Ben Lilly, has shared a bold prediction about the trajectory of the Ethereum price. Taking to a post on the social media platform X, Ben Lilly forecasted that the Ethereum price will reach a new all-time high (ATH) between December 21, 2024, and January 7, 2025. The prediction stems from his analysis of the previous performance of the ETH price movements during Bitcoin’s ATH discovery phase in 2021. A Historical Parallel: Ethereum’s 2021 Rally In his analysis, Ben Lilly referenced Ethereum’s price behavior during the historic rally of the Bitcoin price in the 2021 bull run. At the time, the Ethereum price was trading nearly 60% below its 2018 peak. After Bitcoin broke out to fresh ATH levels, it took Ethereum five weeks to follow suit, rallying by about 640% to reach its current ATH of $4,878. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? Lilly believes the present market conditions mirror those of 2021, with the Bitcoin price recently entering price discovery mode. Ethereum, which was approximately 50% below its 2021 peak of $4,418 as of November 2024, has started to rebound, showing over 20% gains within just two weeks from a low of $2,366 on November 4. Interestingly, the analyst’s comments suggest that as the Bitcoin price continues to set new price records this bull run, Ethereum is likely to follow with a substantial price leap very soon. The timeframe for this substantial price leap, he projects, aligns closely with late December 2024 and early January 2025. Based on his projections, the analyst asserts that Ethereum could repeat its historical pattern and rally significantly within a short timeframe. He highlights that a 300% surge from Ethereum’s November 4 low price level could push it toward the $10,000 mark. ETH will form a new ATH between Dec 21-Jan7. I don’t make the rules. pic.twitter.com/NVgVdQ8Bsj — Ben Lilly (@MrBenLilly) November 20, 2024 Current State Of The Ethereum Price Ben Lilly’s Ethereum price prediction highlights the importance of the Bitcoin price momentum to that of the second-largest asset. Particularly, the 2021 pattern he pointed to is a result of an altcoin season where the altcoin market (led by Ethereum) started to outperform the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: 297% Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume Suggests ADA Price Could See Another Uptrend As it stands, an altcoin season has yet to materialize this cycle, and all the interest is going into Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price is currently on an all-time high roll, meaning the market will have to continue to wait for the interest to roll into Ethereum. At the time of writing, the ETH price is trading at $3,107 and is down by 3.84% in the past seven days.
