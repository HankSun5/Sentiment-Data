(NASDAQ: COIN) announced plans to list Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a fast-growing Solana (SOL)-based memecoin. The cryptocurrency exchange announced that trading of FARTCOIN will commence on Thursday, June 12, 9AM PT, if the set liquidity conditions are met. Coinbase highlighted that the trading of FARTCOIN against the U.S. dollar will be rolled out in phases once the set liquidity conditions are met. Fartcoin Records Higher Demand From Whale Investors According to on-chain data analysis, the overall demand for FARTCOIN has remained elevated in the past few weeks. According to market data from Nansen , a whale withdrew 14,916 Solana coins from the Binance exchange and purchased 1.68 million FARTCOIN at a market value of about $1.4. The imminent listing of FARTCOIN on Coinbase will further trigger heightened demand from whale investors, especially amid the anticipated 2025 altseason. Furthermore, the notable crypto regulatory clarity in the United States has helped increase the overall altcoin demand in the recent past. What Next? After an impressive rally in the past few weeks, fueled by Coinbase listing speculations, FARTCOIN price has experienced a significant resistance of around $1.5. However, the mid-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $1.35 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $376 million, has gained around 40 percent in the last seven days.

XRP, long watched for its institutional narratives, is now attracting serious speculation following a potential W-shaped reversal formation, which could push its market capitalization to a staggering $1.5 trillion. In parallel, Stellar (XLM) has hit an all-time high in Total Value Locked (TVL), exceeding $97 million—a record level that suggests real capital is flowing into the network’s smart contracts and DeFi ecosystem. And yet, while these legacy projects continue to deliver, one emerging protocol is rapidly gaining momentum for its technological depth and early-stage accessibility: Qubetics ($TICS). As a Web3 aggregator focused on interoperability and tokenized real-world assets, Qubetics is establishing its niche in cross-chain utility with a limited-supply model and a fully functioning ecosystem on the horizon. With its ongoing presale raising over $17.9 million, Qubetics is now being evaluated alongside XRP and Stellar as a next bull run crypto with serious breakout potential. Qubetics Real-World Asset Marketplace: The Missing Bridge in Bull Market Utility Unlike typical Layer 1 protocols, Qubetics isn’t competing on speed or singular chain dominance—it’s solving the issue of Web3 fragmentation at its root. As the first true Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is designed to connect otherwise siloed networks through applications that deliver actual business value. One of its cornerstone features is the Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace, where tangible and intangible assets—from property to fine art, invoices to intellectual property—can be securely digitized, fractionalized, and traded on-chain. In practical terms, a commercial real estate firm in Toronto could tokenize a development project, list shares of ownership on Qubetics’ marketplace, and receive funding from participants across multiple continents—without relying on traditional banking rails or intermediaries. Simultaneously, a digital creator in Singapore could collateralize streaming rights or music royalties as smart contract-backed assets, enabling liquid trading or borrowing in real time. These use cases offer not only immediate business value but also align with incoming trends around tokenized treasuries, decentralized identity, and regulated asset registries. With this kind of regulatory-aligned functionality and multi-sector utility, Qubetics brings to the table exactly what analysts are looking for in a next bull run crypto—a token backed by function, scarcity, and a narrative of real-world adoption. As market demand shifts toward compliant, high-utility assets, this infrastructure positions Qubetics for strong short- and mid-term performance once the market cycle turns bullish. Qubetics Presale Momentum Suggests Early Access to the Next Bull Run Crypto As of its most recent update, Qubetics presale is in Stage 37, with a token price of $0.3370. The protocol has raised over $17.9 million, sold more than 515 million tokens, and now counts 27,800+ holders globally. With only 10 million tokens left at the current price before a price bump or presale closure, early buyers are moving quickly to secure allocations. This urgency is not without merit. The total supply of $TICS has been reduced to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% allocated to the public, enforcing a well-controlled scarcity model. A $7,000 allocation currently buys approximately 20,772 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that position becomes $20,772. If the price moves to $5, $10, or $15, those same tokens yield $103,860, $207,720, or $311,580, respectively. Even a modest $100 buy-in, yielding 296 tokens, would convert to $2,960 at a $10 valuation. These return multiples—particularly when placed in the context of a project with tangible use cases—are central to why the Qubetics presale is being flagged by several analytics platforms as the best crypto pre sale opportunity currently live. Not only does it match market enthusiasm, it aligns with strategic fundamentals that could allow $TICS to rally significantly in the next macro uptrend. For those positioning early, Qubetics represents more than just a speculative bet—it embodies the blueprint of a potential next bull run crypto. Stellar Hits Record TVL, Signaling Institutional Strength and DeFi Expansion Stellar (XLM) has experienced a pivotal breakthrough, as reported by FXStreet. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) recently hit a record $97 million, reinforcing the network’s rising utility within decentralized finance. According to the report, this is not a one-off data point but rather part of a broader trend where capital allocation to Stellar-based smart contracts and liquidity pools has steadily increased over Q2 2025. What makes this development even more meaningful is the synchronized growth in price action. XLM has been holding above its 20- and 50-day EMAs and is currently challenging a breakout above the $0.108 resistance level. A successful daily close above this price point could confirm the breakout and potentially initiate a rapid upward trajectory, especially if it aligns with broader crypto market movements. The combination of rising TVL and price structure stability suggests more than just speculative movement. It reflects growing institutional confidence in Stellar’s use case as a compliant, scalable Layer 1 solution. With expanding traction in the DeFi space, Stellar now finds itself on analysts’ radar not just for long-term fundamentals, but as one of the most practical picks for next bull run crypto positioning. XRP’s W-Shaped Reversal Could Signal a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Market Cap Surge As noted by The Crypto Basic, a W-shaped reversal formation may be setting up for XRP, potentially catalyzing one of the largest market moves in altcoin history. Analysts suggest that if this pattern plays out successfully, XRP’s market capitalization could surge to $1.5 trillion, drastically redefining the asset’s place in the crypto hierarchy. This projection is based on historic resistance flipping into support and confluence from long-term Fibonacci retracement levels. Currently, XRP is trading just below a key psychological barrier of $1.50, with technical models forecasting an upside breakout that aligns with increased on-chain volume and whale accumulation metrics. If XRP breaks above its neckline resistance, technical analysts expect exponential inflows to follow. Such forecasts are not made lightly. XRP’s role in cross-border finance, coupled with its ongoing court clarity and RippleNet adoption, already supports long-term growth narratives. However, with bullish structural indicators and broader altcoin sentiment improving, XRP’s technicals may now be aligning for breakout-level participation in the next bull run crypto wave. Conclusion: As the Cycle Warms, Three Names Stand Ready While market conditions continue to evolve under the weight of regulation and macroeconomic realignment, data-backed altcoins are beginning to separate from speculation-driven tokens. XRP’s chart structure and market cap potential, Stellar’s rising DeFi footprint and liquidity strength, and Qubetics’ real-world tokenization framework each paint a picture of strength from different angles. Qubetics, in particular, remains distinct in its offering. Its presale has demonstrated consistent demand, supported by limited supply mechanics and meaningful utility. Its application in asset tokenization and chain-agnostic architecture make it a rare convergence of innovation and discipline. For participants watching for the next bull run crypto , Qubetics is arguably the most promising among newer entrants. Combined with the upward motion in XRP and Stellar, this trio forms a diversified, high-utility shortlist for anyone scanning the market for top crypto presale, crypto pre sale, or the best crypto presale with actual economic logic behind the tokenomics. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the next bull run crypto to watch? Qubetics, XRP, and Stellar are currently positioned as leading candidates for the next bull run crypto, thanks to presale momentum, DeFi growth, and bullish technicals. How much has Qubetics raised in its presale? Qubetics has surpassed $17.9 million raised, with 515 million tokens sold and fewer than 10 million tokens remaining at the current presale price of $0.3370. What does Stellar’s TVL record mean? Stellar’s all-time high $97 million TVL reflects growing institutional participation and a maturing DeFi ecosystem, boosting its appeal as a next bull run crypto asset.

A fascinating development is unfolding in Ukraine, where legislators are pushing for a Ukraine crypto law that could dramatically change how the nation’s central bank operates. This isn’t just about acknowledging digital assets; it’s about potentially integrating them into the very fabric of national finance. What Does This Ukraine Crypto Law Propose? At the heart of this proposal is a draft bill aimed at amending the existing law governing the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). Currently, the NBU’s holdings are primarily limited to traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies as part of its gold and foreign exchange reserves. The proposed amendment seeks to broaden this scope to include crypto assets. According to reports, including insights shared by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak on Telegram and covered by Cointelegraph, the key aspect of this draft bill is that it would permit , but not mandate , the National Bank of Ukraine to acquire and hold cryptocurrencies. This distinction is crucial. It gives the central bank the flexibility to explore digital asset holdings without forcing an immediate, potentially risky, pivot. Think of it this way: Current Law: NBU reserves = Gold + Foreign Currencies Proposed Law: NBU reserves = Gold + Foreign Currencies + (Optional) Crypto Assets This move signals a growing recognition within Ukrainian legislative circles of the increasing importance and potential utility of digital assets in the global financial landscape. Why Would a Central Bank Consider Holding Crypto Reserves? The idea of a central bank adding cryptocurrencies to its crypto reserves might sound unconventional to some, but there are several potential strategic reasons behind such a move: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like Bitcoin could help diversify the national reserves, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. While volatile, crypto assets operate under different market dynamics than traditional currencies or gold. Inflation Hedge: Some view Bitcoin, in particular, as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, similar to gold. Including it could offer an alternative store of value. Innovation & Future Preparedness: Embracing crypto reserves demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, positioning the National Bank of Ukraine at the forefront of exploring the integration of digital assets into sovereign finance. This could also build expertise for potential future initiatives like a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Attracting Investment & Talent: A positive stance on crypto at the central bank level could signal to the global crypto community and tech investors that Ukraine is a crypto-friendly nation, potentially attracting foreign investment and fostering domestic innovation. While the immediate impact of this draft bill passing might be minimal (since holding crypto is optional), the symbolic significance is immense. It opens the door for the Ukraine central bank to actively participate in the digital asset space. Exploring the Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Reserves If the National Bank of Ukraine were to utilize this new legal framework, including Bitcoin reserves could offer specific advantages. Bitcoin, as the largest and most established cryptocurrency, is often the first digital asset considered for institutional or sovereign holdings. Potential benefits of holding Bitcoin could include: Potential for High Growth: While highly volatile, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional reserve assets. A small allocation could potentially yield substantial returns over time. Global Accessibility & Liquidity: Bitcoin is a globally traded asset with high liquidity, making it relatively easy to buy and sell compared to certain illiquid assets. Decentralization: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means it is not controlled by any single government or central authority, offering a degree of independence from geopolitical risks associated with fiat currencies. However, these benefits come with significant risks that the National Bank of Ukraine would need to carefully consider. What Challenges Does Holding Crypto Present for the Ukraine Central Bank? While the potential benefits are intriguing, incorporating crypto assets into national reserves, particularly for the Ukraine central bank, is fraught with challenges: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are known for dramatic price swings. Holding these assets would expose the national reserves to significant market risk. Security Risks: Managing private keys and securing large quantities of crypto assets requires sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. This creates uncertainty regarding compliance, taxation, and potential future restrictions. Valuation and Accounting: Determining the appropriate valuation methods and accounting standards for volatile digital assets within a central bank’s balance sheet is complex. Public Perception and Political Risk: Investing public funds, even indirectly, into volatile and often controversial assets like crypto could face significant public scrutiny and political opposition. The NBU would need to develop robust risk management frameworks, secure storage solutions, and clear policies before making any move to acquire crypto reserves. Global Context: Are Other Nations Considering Crypto Reserves? Ukraine isn’t operating in a vacuum. The conversation around sovereign crypto holdings is gaining traction globally, albeit slowly. El Salvador: Famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and has acquired a significant amount of Bitcoin for its national treasury. Central African Republic: Also adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, though implementation has faced challenges. Other Nations: While most central banks are focused on exploring CBDCs, many are also researching the broader implications of crypto assets and blockchain technology. Discussions about diversification of reserves are ongoing in various financial circles. Ukraine’s potential move, while currently just a legislative proposal allowing the option, places it among the nations actively exploring the frontier of digital assets at the sovereign level. It’s a strong indicator of the increasing mainstream acceptance and consideration of cryptocurrencies. What Happens Next with the Ukraine Crypto Law? The draft bill must go through the standard legislative process in Ukraine. This involves readings, potential amendments, and ultimately, a vote. There’s no guarantee it will pass, and even if it does, there’s no timeline or requirement for the National Bank of Ukraine to actually begin holding crypto reserves. However, the introduction of this bill itself is a significant step. It forces a national conversation about digital assets, their role in the economy, and their potential place in national financial strategy. It suggests a potential future where central banks might view assets like Bitcoin not just as speculative instruments, but as viable components of a diversified national reserve portfolio. For crypto enthusiasts and market observers, this development from Ukraine is a positive signal, indicating that national governments are increasingly looking at how digital assets can fit into traditional financial structures. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Sovereign Finance The proposed Ukraine crypto law allowing the National Bank of Ukraine to potentially hold crypto assets in its reserves is a landmark development, even in its current draft form. It signifies a legislative willingness to embrace the possibilities presented by digital currencies like Bitcoin. While challenges related to volatility, security, and regulation remain substantial, the mere consideration of crypto reserves by a central bank is a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of global finance. This bill opens the door for Ukraine to potentially join a small but growing group of nations exploring the integration of digital assets into their national financial strategies, offering a fascinating glimpse into the future of sovereign wealth and reserve management.

45826299,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=744945,1749684108,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45826299.jpeg,Republicans remove military spending and tax policy to avoid Senate rule violations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/house-republicans-amend-big-beautiful-bill/,"House Republicans just rewired Donald Trump’s One Big, Beautiful bill to keep it alive in the Senate, ripping out several key provisions that had been flagged as rule violations. The changes went through on Wednesday afternoon after a 213 to 207 vote, locking in a procedural maneuver that updated the bill automatically without needing a second full House vote. The only Republican to vote no was Thomas Massie, a lawmaker from Kentucky. The maneuver was needed to protect the bill’s reconciliation status — that is, the special privilege that allows it to bypass the filibuster and pass the Senate with a simple majority. Without these tweaks, the bill would’ve lost that shield and been exposed to a 60-vote threshold it had no chance of clearing. According to reporting from Politico, the stripped-down version is meant to preserve the package’s viability ahead of the Senate’s review. Republicans remove military spending and tax policy to avoid Senate rule violations Republicans deleted many big-ticket items that were originally in their House version. These included $2 billion for Pentagon military intelligence, over $500 million for missile development, and a policy to crack down on the employee retention tax credit, which had turned into a scam magnet during and after the pandemic. That last item alone was expected to generate more than $6 billion in offsets that were supposed to balance the bill’s other spending and tax cuts. But none of that could survive the Senate parliamentarian’s review. If those policies stayed, the parliamentarian would’ve ruled the bill out of order under reconciliation rules. That would have made it vulnerable to a filibuster and likely dead on arrival. So Republican leadership acted fast to rip out those items before the bill even reached the Senate. They aren’t done yet. The Senate parliamentarian is still going through the rest of the package, and more sections could get cut for breaking budget rules. That means more adjustments are coming — and fast — because Republicans are still aiming to pass the full bill by July 4. Leadership plans more changes while Senate rewrites bill Trump’s party wants to rewrite and reintroduce some of the policies that got pulled. But they’ll try doing it through the Senate version instead, hoping they can get the language right this time without losing the fast-track privilege. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are writing their version of the package now, and they’ve got less than a month to lock it in. Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, told reporters, “We’ll see what they produce,” referring to the Senate’s work. “I just need them to come to their final decisions on everything. So we’ll see how it shapes up.” Behind closed doors, aides in both chambers know the timeline is tight. Some say that even if the Senate moves quickly, it could still take weeks or even months to finalize if their version drifts too far from what the House passed. That’s a problem, because neither chamber wants to go through another pingpong fight — sending the bill back and forth for revisions. The current plan is to settle all disputes during the Senate process. That way, once the Senate finishes, the House can vote again — once — to approve the final product and send it to Trump. But for that to work, they’ll need to agree ahead of time on some major sticking points: spending cuts, business tax extensions, and the SALT deduction cap. “There’s just a lot of coordination to hopefully avoid some of the potential snafus that could happen with something that’s this complicated,” said John Thune, the Republican whip. Work is already underway. Nick LaLota, a Republican from New York, met with Senate GOP staff on Wednesday to talk about raising the SALT cap. Over in a separate meeting Tuesday night, Chip Roy from Texas and Scott Perry from Pennsylvania sat down with budget hawks like Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and Rick Scott to push for tighter spending limits and to keep the House’s cuts to clean energy tax credits in place.

Capital flows are shifting, signaling a new wave of opportunities. Discover which three altcoins experts believe are set to soar in the next market phase. Hedera HBAR: Past Declines Spotlight Key Price Levels for Future Moves Over the past month, Hedera has seen a decline of nearly 19% following a modest one-week gain. The coin's performance over the last six months has shown a consistent downward trajectory, with a total drop of around 40% indicating ongoing selling pressure. Buyers have struggled to regain momentum, and the recovery attempts have been weak, reflecting a market still in a bearish sentiment. Traders are growing cautious, as the coin remains unable to shift its negative trend significantly, which may lead to increased uncertainty in the near future. Current pricing for Hedera is between $0.1431 and $0.2112, with immediate resistance at $0.2538 and key support around $0.1177. The RSI near 49.79 suggests a neutral market stance, but moving averages lean slightly bearish. Traders should monitor the lower support closely; a bounce from $0.1177 could present a buying opportunity if supported by volume. Breaking through the $0.2538 barrier is crucial for testing further resistance at $0.3219. A drop below $0.1177 could lead to declines towards $0.0497, signaling a need for caution and defined stop-loss strategies as the market awaits clarity. Pi Network: Six-Month Surge Amid Recent Price Corrections PI saw a significant pullback recently, with prices dropping nearly 19% in the last month and a modest 2% decline in the past week. Over the previous half-year, however, it surged by over 500%, showing strong long-term momentum. This dramatic rebound contrasts sharply with the recent volatility, indicating robust demand despite short-term price corrections. The price action reflects a wide-ranging recovery that highlights the potential for future gains even when facing a dip in momentum. Current price levels sit between approximately $0.26 and $1.36, with initial resistance around $2.06 and a secondary barrier near $3.16. The market is currently under bearish pressure, with indicators like moving averages suggesting a negative trend. RSI readings in the low 40s indicate that bears maintain short-term control but are not at critical resistance levels. No clear trend has emerged, making it essential for traders to monitor price behavior closely. Trading on declines toward support levels may favor short-term strategies, while a break above $2.06 could spark buying interest aimed at reaching $3.16. Cronos Price Analysis: Short-Term Levels Amid Long-Term Decline Over the last month, Cronos declined by about 4%, with weekly moves around -2%. In the past six months, the coin experienced a significant drop of approximately 46%. Price action has remained within a narrow range, fluctuating between $0.09 and $0.12. This trend indicates a market under pressure, characterized by slight negative momentum and technical indicators trending downward. Despite the extended decline, the coin trades within clear boundaries that could offer opportunities for a rebound should buying pressure return. Currently, Cronos is trading between $0.09 and $0.12, facing key levels that shape its trading activity. Resistance is at $0.12, while support rests at $0.08, creating distinct boundaries for near-term price movements. A secondary resistance level at $0.15 and additional support at $0.05 further define potential trading zones. Oscillator readings indicate mild downward pressure, while the RSI near 54 shows a balanced market that is neither oversold nor overbought. This lack of dominance by bulls or bears leaves room for traders to explore opportunities on both sides. Traders may consider buying near the 8-cent support or selling near the $0.12 resistance to capitalize on short-term movements. Conclusion Capital is moving away from Bitcoin and into alternative coins. HBAR offers fast transaction speeds and strong security. PI is gaining attention for its unique consensus mechanism. CRO is expanding its reach through strategic partnerships and user incentives. These coins show promising potential for growth in the next phase of the market.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.9511 Market cap $974.49M Trading volume $526.17M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.04 24-hour low $0.9353 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.82% 50-day SMA $0.8650 14-Day RSI 57.31 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index – Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $1.2177 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bears are in control of the market. The $0.375 support remains critical. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF shows neutral-to-bearish momentum The WIF/USDT price analysis on June 11 shows a bearish candle with the price at $0.950, below the middle Bollinger Band. This suggests a neutral-to-bearish outlook. If the price moves below the lower band, it could continue to drop towards the next support. The RSI is at 48.82, indicating neutral conditions but leaning toward bearish momentum. The MACD is also bearish, with the histogram confirming the current sentiment. WIF shows neutral-to-bearish momentum Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF is bearish in the short-term The 4-hour chart shows a 3.55% drop in price, indicating bearish momentum. The price is currently trading below the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which further suggests a potential downtrend in the short term. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is negative at -3.91M, suggesting that the bearish sentiment is more prominent as traders exit their positions. WIF is bearish in the short-term The Money Flow Index (MFI) stands at 53.53, placing it in a neutral range. This indicates that there is no clear buying or selling dominance, and the market is neither in an overbought nor oversold condition. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.7672 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.8229 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.8794 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.9788 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.8650 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.6862 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.2177 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9207 BUY EMA 5 $0.8480 BUY EMA 10 $0.7106 BUY EMA 21 $0.6015 BUY EMA 50 $0.6288 BUY EMA 100 $0.9206 BUY EMA 200 $1.3531 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF/USDT appears to have a bearish outlook. If the price drops below key support levels and the indicators remain in their current positions, further downside movement could occur. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Traders are now watching closely as optimism builds around a potential move toward higher resistance levels. Chainlink (LINK) is facing a more cautious outlook. The token is hovering just above key support at $17.80, and analysts warn that a breakdown could trigger a deeper decline. Technical indicators are showing signs of weakness, making sentiment fragile. In the background, Unstaked ($UNSD) is building something more sustainable. With nearly $9.5 million raised and a projected 2,700% return at launch, its AI-powered agents are set to automate social growth across platforms with no coding required. Unstaked is gaining ground not through speculation, but by delivering real product utility. BNB Eyes $950 as Regulatory Pressure Eases Binance Coin (BNB) is gaining momentum following reports that the SEC’s legal action against Binance could be delayed or possibly dropped altogether. This shift in sentiment has pushed BNB above the $635 level, drawing renewed interest and optimism among market participants. Analysts are now watching the $680 resistance level closely. A clean break above could open the door to a climb toward $950 in the coming weeks. As the native asset of the Binance ecosystem, BNB continues to play a central role by powering trading discounts, launchpad participation, and other core platform utilities. Chainlink Faces Critical Test as Support Weakens Chainlink (LINK) is trading just above a key support zone near $17.80, and analysts are warning of a potential breakdown. If support fails, the token could fall sharply, with targets ranging from $15.50 to $14.80. Recent attempts to hold above $19.50 have failed, and technical indicators are signaling weakness. Volume has declined, and the RSI shows continued softening, suggesting limited buying pressure in the short term. While Chainlink remains a vital piece of Web3 infrastructure by connecting blockchains with real-world data, short-term sentiment appears cautious. A rebound at current levels could help stabilize price action, but the risk of further decline remains high. Why Unstaked Is the Most Underrated Growth Engine in Web3 Success in Web3 is no longer about chance or chasing trends. It is now about efficiency and execution, and Unstaked is quietly emerging as the most powerful tool in the space with its AI-powered marketing agents set to go live at launch. At the center of its platform are intelligent AI agents that automate real-time outreach, schedule posts based on live sentiment data, and respond dynamically across more than 10 social platforms. These agents run nonstop and require no coding, making them ideal for solo creators, meme coin teams, and DAOs looking to scale without hiring. The system is designed to make high-impact growth accessible. Founders no longer need to build marketing departments from scratch. Unstaked offers a plug-and-play solution where AI handles what used to take entire teams. Whether it is community engagement or brand visibility, these agents are built to do the work on their own. The Unstaked token gates access to this powerful system. Now in stage 19 of its AI crypto presale and priced at $0.011065, it comes with a projected launch price of $0.1819. That points to a potential 2,700% return for early holders. Nearly $9.5 million has already been raised, signaling strong confidence from early buyers. As the need for smarter growth intensifies across Web3, Unstaked is positioning itself as the tool of choice. With AI agents going live after launch, the current presale may be the last true entry point before the platform becomes a staple in every project’s toolkit. Final Thoughts BNB’s rally shows how quickly sentiment can flip with regulatory updates, while LINK’s drop reveals how fragile markets become when support levels start to break. These moves reflect short-term reactions driven by headlines and technical signals. Unstaked is playing a different game. It is building long-term value through AI-powered tools that automate marketing across Web3. With a stage 19 price of $0.011065 and a projected $0.1819 launch, the 2,700% upside is tied to real utility. As more teams prioritize automation over speculation, Unstaked could become a foundational asset in every serious project’s toolkit.

Nick Carcaterra, a spokesperson at the actual Goldman Sachs, tells the WSJ that Eghbali hasn’t worked for the financial giant, which is taking action regarding the use of its name. Eghbali reportedly represents trade creditors through his firm Olympus Guardians and is involved in numerous cases related to high-profile companies like Forever 21, Hooters and Virgin Orbit. The California businessman tells the WSJ he considered embarking on a business venture that he thought would receive funds from the actual Goldman Sachs, so he registered Goldman Sachs Capital. That venture didn’t materialize, and Eghbali has since used the LLC to maximize employee retention credits (ERCs), refundable tax credits designed to encourage employers to keep on employees during the pandemic. Carcaterra, however, tells the WSJ that Eghbali’s reasoning for registering Goldman Sachs Capital does not follow logic. A representative for the California Secretary of State’s Office tells the WSJ that it doesn’t regulate brand or intellectual-property issues and only cross-checks registrations against names that are already in its system, not national brands.

Interest jumped from 8% in 2024 to 29% this year among 100 executives at Fortune 500 companies. That’s more than three times the level of a year ago. And small ones aren’t far behind. A fresh look at the numbers shows stablecoins are moving from fringe tech talk into boardroom discussions. Rising Interest Among Big Firms According to Coinbase’s State of Crypto report released Tuesday, 29% of surveyed executives say their company plans to work with stablecoins or is curious about them. Last year only 8% felt the same way. Yet just 7% of those firms have actually started using or holding stablecoins. It’s clear that many leaders are still in a testing phase. Slow bank transfers and steep fees on regular payments have pushed them to look for alternatives. Small Businesses Join The Trend Based on reports from the same study, 251 financial decision-makers at small and medium businesses took part in the survey. Now 81% say they’re interested in stablecoins , up from 61% a year ago. Almost half—46%—expect to use crypto in the next three years. And more than 82% think crypto can tackle at least one real cost or cash-flow issue for their business. Whether it’s cutting payment fees or speeding up cross-border transfers, smaller outfits see solid reasons to experiment. Transactions Hit New Heights Crypto flows are already huge. Organic stablecoin transfers hit $719 billion in December 2024 and $717 billion in April 2025—the two highest months on record so far. Overall, total stablecoin volumes reached over $27 trillion in 2024, beating the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard by nearly 8%. Holder counts climbed past 160 million in May. Early Movers And Experiments Even big names are taking notes. At a Bloomberg Tech Summit on June 5, Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the ridesharing giant is in a study phase for stablecoin payments. The goal is simple: lower costs when moving money around the globe. And on May 14, Fireblocks reported that 90% of institutional players they surveyed are exploring stablecoin use in some part of their operations. That could mean anything from instant remittances to more efficient payroll in countries where banks are slow or expensive.

In an X post on Wednesday, Grachev requested the core developers at Near Protocol to consider theThe move to boost the long term prospects of the project. Grachev reminded the core founders that DWF Labs currently holds 5 million NEAR tokens and has staked an additional 6 million tokens. To spice up the proposal, Grachev told the core developers that DWF Labs would purchase an additional 10 million NEAR tokens. Meanwhile, Bowen Wang, a developer at Near Protocol, welcomed the idea of reducing the token’s inflation but highlighted that the final move is up to the community. Moreover, the current inflation is part of the incentive plan to attract more holders to stake NEAR tokens and secure the protocol. I think it could be a good idea to reduce inflation to make the tokenomics more sustainable, but it is up to the community to decide — Bowen Wang (@BowenWang18) June 11, 2025 Closer Look at NEAR Price Action Amid the highly anticipated altseason 2025, catalyzed by rising institutional demand and imminent reversal of the Bitcoin dominance, NEAR price has signaled bullish sentiment.

This article delves into a crucial element that could be pivotal for these cryptocurrencies. Readers will discover which digital assets are poised for potential growth, sparking curiosity about the mid-term price predictions. Solana Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Levels Solana has shown a blend of slight recovery and a significant drop in recent periods. Over the last week, the coin registered a modest gain of 1.56%, hinting at some short-term strength. However, in the past month, it declined by approximately 10.36%, and looking back over a six-month span, the loss approaches 30%. This volatility indicates that while there have been quick upward shifts, they have not been enough to overcome the broader downward pressure. The market continues to struggle with finding stable upward momentum, although it remains active with rapid changes in shorter intervals. At present, Solana trades within a defined range, with immediate support at $115.84 and a second support near $69.81. Resistance levels are identified at $207.90 and $253.93. The current price action indicates a battle between buyers and sellers, with the RSI close to 50 and oscillators suggesting a slight downward trend. Bulls are attempting to break through resistance levels, but bears maintain influence, resulting in an unclear overall trend. Focusing on local support zones for potential bounces and observing key resistance and support levels can guide short-term trading strategies. A resistance hold may open the door to higher targets, while a breach of support could signal further losses. Ethereum Market Trends: Past Adjustments and Key Levels Over the last month, Ethereum posted a modest gain of 4.23%, with a weekly increase of 3.16%. However, the coin faced a decline close to 30% over the past six months, reflecting significant volatility as prices fluctuated between $1923.57 and $2961.91. These fluctuations highlight ETH's resilience during a period where traders assessed opportunities against broader market pressures. Recovery efforts continued amidst a downtrend, indicating a battle for stability. Currently, Ethereum trades within a price zone between approximately $1923.57 and $2961.91. Resistance levels are found at around $3395.39 and $4433.73, while support sits at about $1318.71, with additional support near $280.38. Buyers are trying to push prices higher, but sellers maintain enough influence to limit sharp increases. The market shows a slightly bullish bias, as indicated by the RSI reading of 62.08, but no clear trend exists. Traders may consider a range-bound strategy, focusing on buying near support and selling near resistance while remaining cautious of the recent downward trend. Monitoring technical indicators and volume trends will be essential for making informed trading decisions. Conclusion Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have significant potential for growth in the mid-term. Increased adoption and innovative technological advancements are key factors driving this potential. Both coins are positioned to benefit from rising interest and demand in the market. Future price movements will likely reflect these positive developments. Investors may find promising opportunities if these trends continue. The outlook for SOL and ETH appears favorable, and market participants should keep a close watch.

For those tracking the intersection of tech giants and AI, a significant development comes from Apple. The company’s native AI image generation tool, Apple Image Playground , is set to receive a major upgrade through a strategic ChatGPT integration . This move aims to revitalize the platform after its initial lukewarm reception. What Were the Initial Challenges for Apple Image Playground? When Apple first introduced Image Playground last year, powered by Apple Intelligence, the vision was clear: provide users with a simple way to create unique, personalized images directly on their devices. However, upon launch, the reality fell short for many. User feedback highlighted several limitations: Quality Concerns: Some users reported receiving low-quality or distorted images, such as a prompt for a hand resulting in an image with six fingers. Limited Capabilities: Basic descriptions like “old man” or “flower” sometimes failed to produce results. Perceived Simplicity: Compared to more advanced AI image generators available, Image Playground felt juvenile to some, leading them to question its practical use cases beyond simple, emoji-like creations. While some users found it a fun experience, the overall sentiment pointed towards a tool that needed significant improvement to compete in the growing AI image generation space. How Does ChatGPT Integration Boost Apple Image Playground? Fast forward to this year’s WWDC, where Apple announced a crucial update: integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into Image Playground. This partnership is designed to inject more sophistication and capability into the app’s generation process. The key benefits of this ChatGPT integration include: Expanded Style Options: Moving beyond the initial limited styles (Animation, Illustration, Sketch, Genmoji), users will gain access to new, more artistic styles like Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, Anime, and Print. ‘Any Style’ Flexibility: A new “Any Style” option allows users to describe exactly the look and feel they want for their image, offering unprecedented creative control within the app. Improved Understanding: By leveraging ChatGPT’s advanced language understanding, Image Playground should be better equipped to interpret complex prompts and deliver more accurate and relevant image results. These new styles will be clearly labeled under a “ChatGPT style” banner, indicating the source of the enhanced capability. Apple AI Strategy: More Than Just Image Generation This move isn’t an isolated incident but fits into Apple’s broader Apple AI strategy. The company has already established a working relationship with OpenAI, bringing ChatGPT capabilities to other parts of its ecosystem. For example: Siri Integration: Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s knowledge base when it encounters questions it cannot answer on its own, or when a user specifically directs the query to ChatGPT. Writing Tools: System-wide writing tools across apps like Notes and Mail leverage ChatGPT to help users generate, rewrite, or summarize text. Integrating ChatGPT into Image Playground therefore makes strategic sense, allowing Apple to quickly enhance a key AI feature by partnering with a leader in the field, rather than relying solely on its internal models for this specific task. When Can Users Expect the Update? The updated Apple Image Playground featuring the ChatGPT integration is slated for release alongside the new operating system updates, expected this fall with iOS 26 . This timing suggests that the enhanced AI image generation capabilities will be available to a wide range of Apple users relatively soon. Why This Matters for AI Image Generation By incorporating ChatGPT, Apple is giving Image Playground a second chance to impress users and become a more viable competitor in the increasingly crowded landscape of free AI image generation tools. This integration addresses the primary criticisms of the original version by promising better quality, more flexibility, and a wider range of creative options. It positions Apple’s native tool as a more well-rounded service, potentially attracting users who might otherwise turn to third-party apps for their AI image creation needs. In conclusion, Apple’s decision to bolster Image Playground with ChatGPT integration is a significant step. It acknowledges the initial shortcomings while demonstrating Apple’s commitment to improving its AI offerings. The promise of enhanced styles and better generation capabilities arriving with iOS 26 makes Image Playground a tool worth revisiting for anyone interested in accessible AI image generation directly on their Apple devices.

45829260,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=744964,1749687626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45829260.jpeg,Singapore’s crypto warning triggers exchange exodus,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/singapore-crypto-crackdown-triggers-exodus/,"Singapore’s latest regulatory clampdown on offshore digital-asset firms has triggered a wave of urgent exits and staff restructuring among major crypto exchanges operating in the city-state without a license. Bitget and Bybit, both top-10 crypto exchanges globally by trading volume, are now preparing to shift operations out of Singapore, sources familiar with the matter revealed. Bitget will relocate staff to crypto-friendly jurisdictions such as Dubai and Hong Kong, while Bybit is weighing similar moves. Both exchanges declined to comment publicly. The move follows a final warning from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which on May 30 issued a directive requiring crypto firms with Singapore-based operations serving overseas clients to cease such activities by June 30. The notice leaves no room for transitional arrangements and states that new licenses will be granted only under “extremely limited” conditions. MAS crackdown sparks panic and job fears The MAS decision has rattled many offshore crypto firms with substantial local teams. Arthur Cheong, founder and CIO of DeFiance Capital LLC, warned that hundreds of jobs could be at risk, as many exchanges have front-office teams — including business development and sales — stationed in Singapore to serve global clients. “This is almost as good as an evacuation procedure,” said Patrick Tan, general counsel at blockchain analytics firm ChainArgos, which is not affected by the directive. Chris Holland, a partner at Singapore-based consultancy HM, noted a surge in inquiries: “Calls are at all hours given the impact on businesses headquartered outside Singapore. Some are scrambling to understand their exposure and risks.” Singapore has long marketed itself as a regulated, innovation-friendly crypto hub, drawing major players like Coinbase and Crypto.com to set up regional operations. However, the city-state also continues to bear the scars of the 2022 market crash, which collapsed several high-profile local crypto ventures. In response, MAS has grown increasingly hawkish, tightening oversight while discouraging retail crypto speculation and limiting advertising. The May directive builds on the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2022, where MAS had already signaled its intention to rein in unlicensed digital asset providers. In a follow-up on June 6, MAS stated that only a “very small” number of providers would be directly affected — yet firms remain unclear about how the rules apply to hybrid or decentralized operation models. Regulators close in as offshore crypto firms scramble to define operations The opaque structures of many offshore exchanges have long complicated Singapore’s crypto compliance environment. Grace Chong, head of financial regulatory practice at Drew & Napier LLC, noted that companies leveraging Singapore-based staff to support foreign operations — without clearly defined boundaries — occupy a legal “gray area.” For its part, MAS maintains that it has consistently communicated its expectations. “This move should not come as a surprise,” said an MAS spokesperson. “Entities already licensed are not affected by this latest guidance.” Still, the sudden enforcement has caught some off guard. Unlike licensed players, offshore entities will now need to make swift adjustments or face possible enforcement actions. Exchanges like Binance, which has been on MAS’s investor alert list since 2021, represent how difficult regulatory navigation has become. Binance CEO Richard Teng has described the firm as “remote-first,” adding that discussions about a global headquarters remain ongoing. A Binance spokesperson reiterated the exchange’s intent to comply with local regulations globally but offered no details on its Singapore operations. As MAS tightens the net, other jurisdictions like Dubai, Hong Kong, and even Australia are emerging as alternative bases for crypto firms forced to adapt — or flee.

The transition will depend on the progress of Cardano towards Bitcoin interoperability, which is a long-awaited move that may bring native BTC to decentralized finance. Andrew Throuvalas, the senior content manager at BitcoinOS, believes that Minswap occupies a privileged place in the Cardano ecosystem. Minswap will be the largest DEX on a UTXO-based smart contract platform, making it the natural leader in adding Bitcoin DeFi functionality. Minswap is the largest DEX on Cardano – the first and largest UTXO smart contract chain that will plug into Bitcoin. 🟠🤝🔵 That means Minswap will have a first-mover advantage as a proper BTC DEX. It's hard to underestimate the opportunity. @MinswapDEX thread anyone? pic.twitter.com/OZipNkCQ1N — Andrew | BitcoinOS (@AThrouvalas) June 11, 2025 Its technical basis and proven liquidity put it in a good position to be the first BTC-enabled DEX on Cardano. According to DeFiLlama, Minswap now has more than $83.43 million in total value locked, or over a quarter of the entire Cardano DeFi sector. Cardinal protocol sets the stage Charles Hoskinson , the founder of Cardano, unveiled the Cardinal Protocol earlier this month, a Bitcoin DeFi solution that was born to enable decentralized capabilities on BTC. The protocol will enable the lending, swaps, and yield farming capabilities of Bitcoin holders on Cardano. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 The announcement of the protocol served as a breakthrough in developing cross-chain DeFi. Bitcoin, which currently has a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, has yet to be fully utilized in DeFi because of technical impediments. Cardano proposes to address this through its extended UTXO model and off-chain computation plans to achieve smart contract execution with BTC. Hoskinson has said that unlocking Bitcoin DeFi may represent a trillion-dollar opportunity, introducing capital efficiency to the largest digital asset. The Cardinal Protocol is considered a foundation stone of that vision, as it will provide the plumbing required to bring Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano-native dApps. In Bitcoin DeFi, timing can become a crucial aspect of becoming a leader. The availability of Minswap and the emphasis on cross-chain capability in Cardano provide a confluence that supports early adopters. With users seeking more opportunities to utilize BTC than merely holding it, decentralized financial services platforms seem set to gain more traction. The early lead that Minswap has managed to acquire may result in an increase in trading volume, user activity, and protocol revenue. It currently has a solid market position in Cardano with $83 million TVL. By adding Bitcoin to its list of supported assets, that number may rise substantially, particularly should network activity-driven demand grow in the aftermath of the Cardinal Protocol launch. ADA price builds toward potential breakout With the infrastructure improvements in Cardano, ADA is testing a major resistance area. The token is trading right under the $0.7 mark, with analysts predicting a breakout once it surpasses the $0.77 mark. Renowned crypto analyst JavonTM1 predicts that, based on Fibonacci levels, Cardano may be aiming at $5.35 in a fresh bull run. Another market analyst, Ali, indicates that continued movement above $0.77 will activate a bullish trend. Prominent analyst Crypto Winkle pointed out that ADA has built strong support between 0.63 and 0.67, where it is still recovering. The token is currently testing resistance at around $0.70- an area that has monitored gains over months. Winkle added that a decisive break above $0.70 may result in a sharp move up to the $1.60 level. Source:X Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced via Truth Social that a long-awaited trade agreement with China has been finalized, pending only President Xi Jinping’s approval. The deal reportedly includes a rollback of select export tariffs and was confirmed by both nations’ commerce officials. BREAKING: TRUMP SAYS TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA IS DONE MARKETS LIKELY TO REACT STRONGLY! pic.twitter.com/awVibnj3xS — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) June 11, 2025 In response to this, the BTC/USD pair surged to an intraday high of $110,300 ahead of pulling back to around $109,560. This follows months of volatility sparked by Trump’s earlier tariff threats, which had briefly driven BTC down to $74,434. The conclusion of the deal eased macro risk, lifting sentiment in both equity and crypto markets. Analysts suggest that reduced global trade friction could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin to retest and potentially surpass its all-time highs, especially if macroeconomic stability continues. Bitcoin Holds Key Support Amid Inflation Watch Despite a slight 1.4% dip in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin price prediction remains technically supported. Trading near $108,610, the two-hour chart reveals BTC sitting atop a confluence of supports: the 50-EMA ($108,123), ascending trendline, and the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $108,595. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick action shows indecision, with repeated rejection near $109,355 and $110,574. The MACD has turned bearish, with a widening gap, suggesting further weakness. However, bulls still have a case: so long as BTC holds above $108,100, a rebound remains possible.

With both Bitcoin and Ethereum pushing into higher prices, investor sentiment is improving, and altcoins like Solana appear poised to follow once the major players confirm a breakout. After weeks of consolidation and volatility, the stage may be set for a stronger move if current trends hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level – Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis revealing that SOL has formed a higher low on the chart—a key bullish signal—and is now charging back toward the range highs. This structure indicates growing strength and the potential for Solana to retest and break through key resistance levels if buyers maintain pressure. The $150 zone now acts as a short-term support base, and as long as SOL holds above it, the bullish case remains intact. A confirmed breakout in BTC and ETH could act as the catalyst Solana needs to enter a new phase of upside. With the market leaning bullish and Solana’s technicals aligning, traders are watching closely to see if this move is the beginning of Solana’s next leg higher in the ongoing altcoin cycle. Solana Approaches Resistance As Bulls Regain Momentum Solana is showing renewed strength after spending several days consolidating below the $160 level. With a fresh move upward, SOL is now pushing into key resistance just under $175, a zone that has capped price advances multiple times over the past few months. This renewed momentum comes as the broader crypto market heats up, with Bitcoin and Ethereum breaking higher and dragging sentiment with them. Still, despite the optimism, caution lingers. Most altcoins, including Solana, remain well below their all-time highs. Jelle highlighted a critical development in Solana’s structure: the formation of a higher low. This bullish signal suggests growing buyer confidence and technical strength, as SOL now charges back toward the top of its range. According to Jelle, a breakout above $185 would be the key trigger that opens the door to new all-time highs. While the short-term trend favors the bulls, one key hurdle remains — flipping the $175–$185 resistance zone into support. This region has consistently rejected upside attempts, and clearing it with strong volume and follow-through is essential for confirming the next leg higher. Until then, Solana remains in a recovery phase. But with improving market conditions and clear signs of accumulation, momentum is shifting. A confirmed breakout could mark the return of “Solana season,” where SOL reclaims leadership among top altcoins. For now, all eyes are on the $185 level — the line between consolidation and a potential explosive rally toward uncharted territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level – No Clear Breakout Yet SOL Price Action Details Solana is currently trading at $165.80 on the daily timeframe, showing continued strength after reclaiming the 50-day SMA at $160.99. Price is now approaching the 100-day SMA at $175.70 — a key level that previously rejected multiple breakout attempts. The recent bounce from the $142–$145 support zone marked a higher low, reinforcing a bullish structure and setting the stage for another attempt to break through resistance. Volume has been rising modestly as price moves higher, suggesting growing interest and momentum among buyers. The crossover between the 50-day and 100-day SMAs would add further confirmation of trend strength, especially if SOL can maintain its current pace and push above $175 with conviction.

Currently, attention is sharply focused on key developments impacting the US Dollar and Sterling , currencies central to the Forex market . These movements, driven by anticipated economic data and policy decisions, offer valuable insights for anyone navigating the broader financial ecosystem. Why is the US Dollar Under Pressure Ahead of Key CPI Data ? The US Dollar has seen a recent dip, a movement largely attributed to market anticipation surrounding the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. This report is a critical indicator of inflation, a factor that heavily influences the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. Here is why the CPI data is so significant: Inflation Gauge: CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. High inflation erodes purchasing power. Fed Policy Influence: The Federal Reserve monitors inflation closely when deciding whether to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates. Higher inflation can prompt the Fed to consider rate hikes to cool the economy. Currency Impact: Higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns, thus strengthening it. Conversely, expectations of stable or lower rates can weaken a currency like the US Dollar . Markets are currently pricing in various scenarios for the CPI release. A figure that comes in lower than expected could reinforce the view that the Fed may not need to raise rates aggressively, or could even cut them sooner, putting downward pressure on the US Dollar . Conversely, a higher-than-expected number might support the case for tighter policy, potentially boosting the dollar. What Does the UK Spending Review Mean for Sterling ? Across the Atlantic, Sterling , the British pound, is also facing its own set of market drivers. The currency’s performance is closely tied to the UK’s economic outlook and fiscal policy. A major event on the horizon is the UK government’s Spending Review . The Spending Review is an important fiscal event where the government sets out its spending plans for the coming years across various departments and public services. It provides a detailed look at the government’s priorities and its approach to public finances. Key aspects watched by the market include: Fiscal Headroom: The review indicates how much fiscal flexibility the government has, impacting its ability to stimulate the economy or address debt. Investment Priorities: Details on infrastructure spending, public services, and other investments can signal growth potential or fiscal strain. Overall Economic Strategy: The review reflects the government’s broader economic vision and its commitment to fiscal responsibility or stimulus. The market’s reaction to the Spending Review will depend on whether the plans are perceived as supportive of economic growth, fiscally prudent, or potentially inflationary. Positive signals could provide a boost to Sterling , while concerns about rising debt or insufficient growth plans could weigh on the currency. How Do These Events Shape the Global Forex Market ? The movements in the US Dollar and Sterling are not isolated events; they are significant components of the vast and interconnected Forex market . As the world’s largest financial market, foreign exchange trading is constantly influenced by macroeconomic data, central bank actions, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. The interplay between major currency pairs, such as GBP/USD (Sterling against the US Dollar), is directly affected by the relative strength or weakness of each currency. For example, if the US Dollar weakens due to anticipated lower interest rates while Sterling holds steady or strengthens based on positive Spending Review signals, the GBP/USD pair could see an upward move. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for participants in the Forex market . Traders and investors analyze these events to forecast currency movements and make informed decisions. The volatility created by such releases also presents opportunities, but it comes with increased risk. Broader Implications: Beyond Traditional Currencies While the immediate impact of CPI data and the Spending Review is felt in the traditional Forex market , these macroeconomic factors can have ripple effects on other asset classes, including commodities, stocks, and even cryptocurrencies. For instance, a weaker US Dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets, like certain commodities or even Bitcoin, more attractive to international buyers holding other currencies. Conversely, a strong dollar can weigh on these assets. Changes in interest rate expectations, driven by data like the CPI data , influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite, factors that also play a role in the cryptocurrency market. The outcome of the UK Spending Review , by affecting the economic outlook of a major global economy, can also contribute to overall market sentiment, which indirectly influences investor behavior across different asset classes. Navigating Uncertainty: What to Watch For The coming days are critical for currency markets. Market participants will be closely watching the official CPI data release from the United States and details emerging from the UK Spending Review . The actual figures and policy announcements will likely trigger sharp reactions, potentially diverging from current market expectations. Key points to monitor: The headline and core CPI figures (excluding volatile food and energy prices). Year-over-year and month-over-month CPI changes. Specific spending commitments and fiscal targets in the UK review. Official commentary from the Federal Reserve and UK Treasury officials following the events. These events underscore the importance of staying informed about global economic developments. While unpredictable, they provide valuable insights into the forces driving currency values and influencing the broader financial landscape. Summary: Awaiting Key Economic Signals The US Dollar ‘s recent slip reflects market anticipation of crucial CPI data that will shape expectations for US monetary policy. Simultaneously, Sterling is positioned to react to the details of the UK government’s Spending Review , a key determinant of the nation’s fiscal path. These significant events in the Forex market highlight the sensitivity of currencies to macroeconomic announcements and underscore their broader influence on global finance. Traders and investors across various markets, including digital assets, will be watching closely for signals that could dictate future price movements.

Ever wondered what could truly ignite a massive rally in the crypto market? Sometimes, it’s not just about positive news or adoption; it can be the pain of those betting against an asset. That’s exactly the scenario being highlighted for Ethereum (ETH), thanks to insights from a prominent figure in the investment world. Jack Yi, the founder of blockchain investment firm LD Capital , recently shared a compelling analysis that suggests a significant bullish catalyst for Ethereum might be brewing right under the market’s nose. His view centers on the sheer volume of short positions currently open on ETH across various platforms. This isn’t just speculation; he’s pointing to concrete figures that paint an interesting picture for the potential future price action of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Why Massive Short Positions Matter for Ethereum ‘s Price It might seem counterintuitive, but a large number of people betting *against* an asset can actually become a powerful fuel for its price increase. This is the core idea behind a short squeeze. Jack Yi’s analysis for Ethereum specifically highlights the scale of this ‘contrarian fuel’. He pointed to a staggering total of approximately $5 billion in short positions on ETH. Let’s break down where these significant shorts are located, according to Yi’s observations: Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME): A notable $1.3 billion in short positions. This platform is often associated with institutional investors, suggesting a substantial amount of professional money is currently betting on ETH’s price decline. Aave: Around $1 billion in shorts on this popular decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. Aave allows users to borrow assets, and borrowing ETH to sell it (shorting) is a common strategy here. Other Exchanges: An estimated $3 billion+ across various other centralized and decentralized trading platforms. This captures the broad market sentiment from retail traders and other participants. The combined weight of these positions, totaling roughly $5 billion, is what Yi believes could be the primary driver for a significant upward move. But how exactly does betting against an asset lead to its price going up? Understanding the Mechanics of a Crypto Short Squeeze To grasp why these $5B shorts are bullish fuel, we need to quickly understand short selling and short squeezes. Short Selling: This is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like ETH) and sells it on the open market, hoping the price will fall. If the price drops, they buy the asset back at the lower price, return the borrowed asset, and pocket the difference. It’s a bet on the price going down. Short Squeeze: This happens when the price of an asset that has a large number of short positions starts to rise rapidly. As the price increases, short sellers begin to face significant losses. To limit these losses, they are forced to buy the asset back to close their positions. This sudden wave of buying activity further drives the price up, triggering more short sellers to buy, creating a cascading effect that ‘squeezes’ the price higher at an accelerated pace. In the context of Ethereum , a $5 billion aggregate short position means there are potentially billions of dollars worth of ‘forced buying’ waiting to happen if the price starts moving against these short sellers. This potential buying pressure is the core reason for the bullish outlook based on this data point. What Does This Mean for ETH Price Prediction ? Jack Yi didn’t just highlight the shorts; he also offered potential price targets if a short squeeze were to materialize. He suggested that this scenario could realistically push the ETH price to levels like $3,000, then potentially $3,500, and even beyond to $4,000 or higher. While $4,000 might seem ambitious depending on the current market price, the mechanism of a short squeeze is known for its ability to cause rapid and substantial price movements that can overshoot levels predicted by fundamental analysis alone. The speed and intensity of the upward move are directly related to how many short sellers are forced to cover their positions and how quickly they do so. It’s important to remember that a short squeeze is a catalyst, not necessarily a reflection of long-term value. However, in a market like crypto, catalysts can have significant and lasting impacts on sentiment and price discovery. LD Capital ‘s Conviction: Putting Money Where the Mouth Is LD Capital isn’t just talking about the potential; they’re acting on it. Jack Yi mentioned that this bullish outlook, largely driven by the potential for a short squeeze from the massive short positions, was the primary reason behind their decision to purchase 100,000 ETH options . Buying call options is a way to bet on the price of an asset increasing by a certain date, offering leveraged exposure to upward price movements. This move by a firm like LD Capital, which specializes in blockchain investments, signals strong conviction based on their analysis of the market structure, particularly the identified vulnerability presented by the large short interest. It serves as a real-world example of how investment firms are interpreting this data point. Navigating the Opportunity: Risks and Considerations While the potential for a short squeeze is exciting, it’s crucial to approach this information with a balanced perspective. Here are a few points to consider: Shorts Can Persist: Short sellers, especially large institutional ones, can sometimes maintain their positions for extended periods if they believe the price will eventually fall. Market Sentiment: A short squeeze typically requires a trigger – often positive news or a general uptick in market sentiment – to start pushing the price up initially and put pressure on shorts. Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. While a squeeze can drive prices up fast, market conditions can change rapidly. One Data Point: The $5B shorts are a significant factor highlighted by LD Capital, but they are just one piece of the complex puzzle that influences Ethereum’s price. For investors, this analysis from LD Capital provides valuable insight into a potential near-term catalyst. It highlights the importance of looking beyond just fundamental developments and considering market structure and positioning. As always, conducting your own research and managing risk are paramount. Conclusion: Is a Giant ETH Squeeze on the Horizon? The analysis from LD Capital founder Jack Yi regarding the estimated $5 billion in Ethereum short positions presents a compelling case for a potential bullish surge. A short squeeze fueled by such a massive amount of ‘anti-ETH’ bets being forced to cover could indeed propel the ETH price towards and potentially past the $4,000 mark. While the timing and magnitude are never guaranteed, the presence of this significant short interest is a notable technical factor that could dramatically influence the near-term trajectory of Ethereum in the crypto market.

Ripple (XRP) has surged back into the spotlight, boasting strong fundamentals and renewed optimism from recent regulatory clarity. Trading around $0.52, XRP remains a solid contender among top summer cryptocurrencies. But savvy investors know that chasing just one coin won’t cut it this season. Ethereum (ETH), steadily advancing toward $3,000, is a proven powerhouse, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an under-$1 DeFi token, is turning heads as the next big cryptocurrency poised for explosive growth. If you want to avoid missing out on the best crypto to buy in 2025, these top tokens are the ones to watch before June ends. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Blazing Ahead — Secure Tokens at $0.03 Before They Double Mutuum Finance is heating up fast in the DeFi space, now in Phase 5 of its presale with tokens priced at only $0.03—half the expected listing price of $0.06. That means early Phase 5 investors stand to gain 100% immediately once MUTM launches. With over $10.3 million raised and a growing community of 11,800+ investors, MUTM is proving itself a rising star in decentralized finance. Plus, the next presale round jumps to $0.035, meaning if you buy now, you lock in an instant 16.67% profit before prices climb. Mutuum’s Hybrid Lending Model: Combining Peer-to-Contract & Peer-to-Peer for Maximum Gains Mutuum Finance’s edge lies in its innovative hybrid lending system that merges two powerful DeFi models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users stake stablecoins like USDT into automated liquidity pools governed by smart contracts, earning passive income effortlessly.

He outlined unilateral tariff rates and offered what he described as a “take it or leave it” trade proposition. “At a certain point, we’re just going to send letters out,” Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center. “And I think you understand that, saying this is the deal, you can take it or leave it.” Tariff deadline nears as US weighs extensions Trump’s comments arrive just days before a July 9 deadline, when a temporary pause on the president’s steepest tariffs is set to expire. While the pause had initially provided markets with a measure of stability, Trump’s latest remarks injected fresh uncertainty into the outlook for global trade. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the House Ways and Means Committee that it is “highly likely” the administration will extend the tariff freeze for nations negotiating in “good faith.” “There are 18 important trading partners — we are working toward deals on those,” Bessent said. “It is highly likely that those countries…will see the date rolled forward.” In a significant development, the US and China reached a tentative framework for easing trade tensions, including an implementation plan. Trump called the deal “done,” pending formal approval by both him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The agreement reportedly addresses long-standing concerns over China’s export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, though sources later clarified China would only relax restrictions for six months. In a notable concession, Trump also announced the US would continue allowing Chinese students to study at American universities — a contentious point in recent talks. Tariff policy sparks legal battles Trump said that the total tariffs on Chinese imports would reach 55%, a figure that reportedly includes existing tariffs rather than any new levies. According to Yahoo Finance’s Ben Werschkul, the number was derived by aggregating the full scope of current duties. While Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda has faced legal challenges, the administration scored a legal win this week. A federal appeals court overturned a lower court’s ruling that had blocked the tariffs, allowing them to remain in place temporarily. The US Court of International Trade had earlier declared the methods used to enact the tariffs as “unlawful.” As the July 9 deadline approaches, pressure is mounting on foreign governments and global markets to interpret Trump’s mixed signals. The threat of unilateral action and the uncertain fate of ongoing trade negotiations leaves little clarity on what US policy will look like in the coming weeks. For now, all eyes are on Washington and the letters Trump has promised to send. Whether they open a new chapter in international trade relations or trigger a wider backlash remains to be seen.

While cryptocurrencies often grab headlines, the stability and direction of traditional currencies like the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD) have significant implications for global markets, capital flows, and even investor sentiment. A recent analysis from investment bank UBS has caught attention, projecting a notable move for the USD/INR forecast . They anticipate the pair could reach 85, a level driven primarily by expectations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) potentially implementing rate cuts sooner than many expect. What is Driving the UBS USD/INR Forecast? UBS’s projection of the USD/INR forecast reaching 85 is rooted in a specific macroeconomic view: the likelihood of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) front-loading its interest rate cuts. Central banks use interest rates as a key tool to manage inflation and stimulate economic growth. Higher rates can attract foreign investment seeking better returns, strengthening a currency. Conversely, lower rates can make a currency less attractive relative to others, potentially leading to depreciation. Here’s a breakdown of the core argument: Expected RBI Action: UBS believes the RBI may begin cutting its benchmark interest rate earlier in the cycle compared to previous expectations or potentially before the U.S. Federal Reserve makes significant moves. Interest Rate Differential: If India’s interest rates fall while U.S. rates remain steady or fall at a slower pace, the gap between returns offered in India versus the U.S. narrows. This makes holding Rupee-denominated assets less appealing to international investors compared to Dollar-denominated assets. Impact on Currency Value: Reduced demand for the Indian Rupee from foreign investors, coupled with potentially increased demand for the Dollar (as it offers relatively better returns or perceived safety), can lead to the Rupee weakening against the Dollar. A higher USD/INR forecast number means it takes more Rupees to buy one Dollar. Why Would the RBI Cut Rates Early? Central banks like the RBI typically consider several factors before adjusting interest rates. While UBS’s specific reasoning wasn’t fully detailed in the initial note, common drivers for early rate cuts can include: Cooling Inflation: If inflation shows a consistent downward trend and is projected to reach or stay within the central bank’s target range, it provides room to lower rates without risking price stability. Supporting Economic Growth: Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which can stimulate investment, spending, and overall economic activity. If growth shows signs of slowing, rate cuts can be used as a boost. Global Economic Conditions: Actions by other major central banks (like the Fed or the European Central Bank) and the global economic outlook can influence the RBI’s decisions to maintain competitiveness or respond to shifts in global capital flows. Fiscal Policy Coordination: Sometimes, monetary policy (interest rates) is coordinated with fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) to achieve broader economic goals. Understanding the Indian Rupee and Forex Market Dynamics The Forex market India , specifically the USD/INR pair, is influenced by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. Beyond interest rates, key elements include: Capital Flows: Foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) into and out of India significantly impact Rupee demand. Strong inflows strengthen the Rupee; outflows weaken it. Trade Balance: The difference between India’s exports and imports affects the supply and demand for the Rupee. A trade deficit (imports greater than exports) typically puts downward pressure on the currency. Oil Prices: India is a major importer of oil. Higher oil prices mean India needs more Dollars to pay for imports, increasing Dollar demand and potentially weakening the Rupee. Global Risk Sentiment: In times of global uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar, leading to depreciation in emerging market currencies like the Rupee. RBI Intervention: The RBI actively manages the Rupee’s volatility, buying or selling Dollars to prevent sharp movements that could harm the economy. UBS’s analysis places significant weight on the interest rate differential, suggesting it will become a primary driver for the Indian Rupee ‘s movement against the Dollar in the near to medium term. How Does UBS Analysis Fit into the Bigger Picture? UBS analysis is just one perspective in the diverse world of Forex forecasting. Different institutions and analysts will have varying views based on their economic models, data interpretation, and assumptions about future central bank actions and global events. However, a forecast from a major global bank like UBS carries weight and is closely watched by market participants. It’s important to remember that Forex forecasts are not guarantees. They are projections based on current information and expected future developments. Unexpected economic data, geopolitical events, or shifts in central bank communication can quickly alter the outlook. What Are the Potential Challenges and Opportunities? A weaker Indian Rupee , as suggested by the USD/INR forecast of 85, presents both challenges and opportunities for different segments of the economy and market participants. Challenges: Imports Become More Expensive: Businesses and consumers importing goods or raw materials will face higher costs in Rupee terms, potentially leading to imported inflation. Foreign Travel/Education Costs: Sending money abroad for education or funding foreign travel becomes more expensive. Servicing Dollar Debt: Indian companies or the government with outstanding debt denominated in US Dollars will find it more expensive to repay in Rupee terms. Opportunities: Exports Become More Competitive: Indian goods and services become cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially boosting export volumes and earnings for businesses. Boost for IT and Services Exports: The large Indian IT and services sector, which earns significant revenue in Dollars, benefits from converting those Dollars into more Rupees. Attracting Foreign Investment (Rupee Assets): While the interest rate differential might narrow, a potentially undervalued Rupee could attract investors looking for entry points into Indian assets, especially if they believe the depreciation is temporary or overdone. Actionable Insights for Navigating the USD/INR Movement Given the USD/INR forecast and the potential for volatility, what steps can businesses and investors consider? Monitor RBI Communications: Pay close attention to the RBI’s monetary policy statements, press conferences, and any forward guidance on inflation and growth outlooks. These provide clues about potential rate decisions. Track Inflation Data: Keep an eye on India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. A sustained drop in inflation increases the probability of rate cuts. Follow Global Central Banks: Monitor the actions and statements of major central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, as their policies impact the interest rate differential and global capital flows. Consider Hedging Strategies: Businesses with significant Dollar exposure (either receivables or payables) might consider hedging strategies using forwards, futures, or options to lock in exchange rates and mitigate currency risk. Diversify Portfolios: For investors, understanding currency risk is part of broader portfolio management. Diversification across asset classes and geographies can help manage this risk. Consult Financial Advisors: For specific financial situations, consulting with a qualified financial advisor who understands Forex markets and macroeconomic trends is advisable. This UBS analysis serves as a reminder that even in a world captivated by digital assets, the fundamentals of traditional finance, like central bank policy and currency dynamics in the Forex market India , continue to play a vital role in the global economic landscape. Summary: What Does This Mean for USD/INR? In essence, UBS is calling for a potential move towards 85 for the USD/INR forecast . This outlook is heavily predicated on their view that the Reserve Bank of India is likely to initiate interest rate cuts earlier than generally anticipated. Such a move would narrow the interest rate differential between India and the US, potentially reducing the attractiveness of Rupee-denominated assets and leading to a weaker Indian Rupee against the strong US Dollar. While this presents challenges like more expensive imports, it could also offer opportunities, particularly for Indian exporters. Navigating the Forex market India requires careful monitoring of central bank actions, economic data, and global sentiment, as highlighted by this significant UBS analysis .

This article dives into four standout names making headlines. Monero (XMR) is reclaiming attention as privacy concerns resurface. Binance Coin (BNB) stays relevant through steady ecosystem utility. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining due to speed-focused design. But the one grabbing major traction is BlockDAG. With fresh developments, a growing user base, and presale strength, it’s building momentum fast. For anyone following top movers and promising names, these are the highest potential cryptos in 2025 worth examining. Now, let’s break down the details. 1. BlockDAG: Utility Growth with Strong Presale Numbers BlockDAG is gaining attention across the crypto market as one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. It has already raised $294.5 million in presale funds and sold 22.3 billion BDAG coins. The project is in Batch 29, offering a low price of $0.0018 per coin. With its confirmed launch price set at $0.05, the estimated ROI sits at 2,660%. What sets BlockDAG apart is its large and engaged user base. The X1 Miner mobile app attracts 1.5 million daily users mining BDAG using smartphones. This platform offers benefits like zero gas fees, daily login rewards, and referral bonuses. Security remains a focus with a completed CertiK audit and strict audit processes. Partnerships are also making headlines. BlockDAG is linked with Inter Milan and hints at an NBA deal. With the GO LIVE reveal approaching, many are closely watching its next steps. Unlike others in early stages, BlockDAG is building a system that encourages everyday participation and provides long-term usability. All signs suggest it is one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. 2. Monero (XMR): The Comeback of a Privacy Leader Privacy continues to be a leading concern in 2025, helping Monero return to the list of highest potential cryptos in 2025. With digital monitoring increasing globally, Monero’s total focus on privacy makes it valuable again. This year, its price has risen near $165 from early-year lows of around $110. Behind this momentum is improved tech. The update to the Bulletproofs++ protocol has made transactions faster and less costly while keeping them secure. Unlike other privacy coins that fade, Monero keeps evolving and growing its base. Although mainstream traction is difficult due to regulation, XMR remains a reliable pick for those looking for privacy-based performance. It’s one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 for people wanting safer, private digital usage. 3. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and Simple Design Pay Off Kaspa has gained momentum because it focuses on speed. Priced at roughly $0.17, it’s getting noticed due to its blockDAG tech that lets multiple blocks be confirmed every second. It’s not overloaded with features; it focuses purely on being fast and efficient, and that focus is paying off. Its market cap has now exceeded $4 billion, with active trading volumes and increasing miner interest. Kaspa’s structure allows anyone to use or support it without deep tech knowledge. There’s no need for special steps or holding certain assets. With a low inflation rate and a clear development plan, it stands out. The team avoids hype and focuses on reliability. With this approach, it’s seen as one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Those who want usability with real-time advantages are turning to Kaspa. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Stability Through Ongoing Use BNB doesn’t rely on newness or sudden popularity; it remains strong due to long-standing usage. This year, it holds a spot among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Trading at about $638, BNB powers a wide range of functions, including fee discounts, DeFi apps, and NFT tools within the Binance network. One reason BNB holds steady is supply control. A recent quarterly burn took 1.6 million BNB out of circulation, easing price pressure during dips. The coin is also expanding into tech tools like AI-driven trading and business-facing blockchain support. Despite stricter rules in some countries, Binance’s wide reach keeps BNB relevant. Instead of hype-driven spikes, it offers ongoing use and liquidity, making it a solid pick among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Summing Up! By mid-2025, choosing the highest potential cryptos in 2025 means looking at use cases, community, and reliability. BlockDAG stands out for its massive presale progress, real app usage, and active user rewards. Monero keeps serving as a reliable privacy solution. Kaspa wins with fast, simple blockchain action, and BNB remains useful through every market phase. Together, they each offer something different, whether it’s mobile participation, private transactions, ultra-fast proof-of-work, or full ecosystem access. If you’re keeping tabs on the highest potential cryptos in 2025 , this group delivers a strong blend of ongoing use, performance, and steady growth.
