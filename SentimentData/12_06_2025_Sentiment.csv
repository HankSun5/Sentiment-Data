(NASDAQ: COIN) announced plans to list Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a fast-growing Solana (SOL)-based memecoin. The cryptocurrency exchange announced that trading of FARTCOIN will commence on Thursday, June 12, 9AM PT, if the set liquidity conditions are met. Coinbase highlighted that the trading of FARTCOIN against the U.S. dollar will be rolled out in phases once the set liquidity conditions are met. Fartcoin Records Higher Demand From Whale Investors According to on-chain data analysis, the overall demand for FARTCOIN has remained elevated in the past few weeks. According to market data from Nansen , a whale withdrew 14,916 Solana coins from the Binance exchange and purchased 1.68 million FARTCOIN at a market value of about $1.4. The imminent listing of FARTCOIN on Coinbase will further trigger heightened demand from whale investors, especially amid the anticipated 2025 altseason. Furthermore, the notable crypto regulatory clarity in the United States has helped increase the overall altcoin demand in the recent past. What Next? After an impressive rally in the past few weeks, fueled by Coinbase listing speculations, FARTCOIN price has experienced a significant resistance of around $1.5. However, the mid-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $1.35 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $376 million, has gained around 40 percent in the last seven days.

XRP, long watched for its institutional narratives, is now attracting serious speculation following a potential W-shaped reversal formation, which could push its market capitalization to a staggering $1.5 trillion. In parallel, Stellar (XLM) has hit an all-time high in Total Value Locked (TVL), exceeding $97 million—a record level that suggests real capital is flowing into the network’s smart contracts and DeFi ecosystem. And yet, while these legacy projects continue to deliver, one emerging protocol is rapidly gaining momentum for its technological depth and early-stage accessibility: Qubetics ($TICS). As a Web3 aggregator focused on interoperability and tokenized real-world assets, Qubetics is establishing its niche in cross-chain utility with a limited-supply model and a fully functioning ecosystem on the horizon. With its ongoing presale raising over $17.9 million, Qubetics is now being evaluated alongside XRP and Stellar as a next bull run crypto with serious breakout potential. Qubetics Real-World Asset Marketplace: The Missing Bridge in Bull Market Utility Unlike typical Layer 1 protocols, Qubetics isn’t competing on speed or singular chain dominance—it’s solving the issue of Web3 fragmentation at its root. As the first true Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is designed to connect otherwise siloed networks through applications that deliver actual business value. One of its cornerstone features is the Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace, where tangible and intangible assets—from property to fine art, invoices to intellectual property—can be securely digitized, fractionalized, and traded on-chain. In practical terms, a commercial real estate firm in Toronto could tokenize a development project, list shares of ownership on Qubetics’ marketplace, and receive funding from participants across multiple continents—without relying on traditional banking rails or intermediaries. Simultaneously, a digital creator in Singapore could collateralize streaming rights or music royalties as smart contract-backed assets, enabling liquid trading or borrowing in real time. These use cases offer not only immediate business value but also align with incoming trends around tokenized treasuries, decentralized identity, and regulated asset registries. With this kind of regulatory-aligned functionality and multi-sector utility, Qubetics brings to the table exactly what analysts are looking for in a next bull run crypto—a token backed by function, scarcity, and a narrative of real-world adoption. As market demand shifts toward compliant, high-utility assets, this infrastructure positions Qubetics for strong short- and mid-term performance once the market cycle turns bullish. Qubetics Presale Momentum Suggests Early Access to the Next Bull Run Crypto As of its most recent update, Qubetics presale is in Stage 37, with a token price of $0.3370. The protocol has raised over $17.9 million, sold more than 515 million tokens, and now counts 27,800+ holders globally. With only 10 million tokens left at the current price before a price bump or presale closure, early buyers are moving quickly to secure allocations. This urgency is not without merit. The total supply of $TICS has been reduced to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% allocated to the public, enforcing a well-controlled scarcity model. A $7,000 allocation currently buys approximately 20,772 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that position becomes $20,772. If the price moves to $5, $10, or $15, those same tokens yield $103,860, $207,720, or $311,580, respectively. Even a modest $100 buy-in, yielding 296 tokens, would convert to $2,960 at a $10 valuation. These return multiples—particularly when placed in the context of a project with tangible use cases—are central to why the Qubetics presale is being flagged by several analytics platforms as the best crypto pre sale opportunity currently live. Not only does it match market enthusiasm, it aligns with strategic fundamentals that could allow $TICS to rally significantly in the next macro uptrend. For those positioning early, Qubetics represents more than just a speculative bet—it embodies the blueprint of a potential next bull run crypto. Stellar Hits Record TVL, Signaling Institutional Strength and DeFi Expansion Stellar (XLM) has experienced a pivotal breakthrough, as reported by FXStreet. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) recently hit a record $97 million, reinforcing the network’s rising utility within decentralized finance. According to the report, this is not a one-off data point but rather part of a broader trend where capital allocation to Stellar-based smart contracts and liquidity pools has steadily increased over Q2 2025. What makes this development even more meaningful is the synchronized growth in price action. XLM has been holding above its 20- and 50-day EMAs and is currently challenging a breakout above the $0.108 resistance level. A successful daily close above this price point could confirm the breakout and potentially initiate a rapid upward trajectory, especially if it aligns with broader crypto market movements. The combination of rising TVL and price structure stability suggests more than just speculative movement. It reflects growing institutional confidence in Stellar’s use case as a compliant, scalable Layer 1 solution. With expanding traction in the DeFi space, Stellar now finds itself on analysts’ radar not just for long-term fundamentals, but as one of the most practical picks for next bull run crypto positioning. XRP’s W-Shaped Reversal Could Signal a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Market Cap Surge As noted by The Crypto Basic, a W-shaped reversal formation may be setting up for XRP, potentially catalyzing one of the largest market moves in altcoin history. Analysts suggest that if this pattern plays out successfully, XRP’s market capitalization could surge to $1.5 trillion, drastically redefining the asset’s place in the crypto hierarchy. This projection is based on historic resistance flipping into support and confluence from long-term Fibonacci retracement levels. Currently, XRP is trading just below a key psychological barrier of $1.50, with technical models forecasting an upside breakout that aligns with increased on-chain volume and whale accumulation metrics. If XRP breaks above its neckline resistance, technical analysts expect exponential inflows to follow. Such forecasts are not made lightly. XRP’s role in cross-border finance, coupled with its ongoing court clarity and RippleNet adoption, already supports long-term growth narratives. However, with bullish structural indicators and broader altcoin sentiment improving, XRP’s technicals may now be aligning for breakout-level participation in the next bull run crypto wave. Conclusion: As the Cycle Warms, Three Names Stand Ready While market conditions continue to evolve under the weight of regulation and macroeconomic realignment, data-backed altcoins are beginning to separate from speculation-driven tokens. XRP’s chart structure and market cap potential, Stellar’s rising DeFi footprint and liquidity strength, and Qubetics’ real-world tokenization framework each paint a picture of strength from different angles. Qubetics, in particular, remains distinct in its offering. Its presale has demonstrated consistent demand, supported by limited supply mechanics and meaningful utility. Its application in asset tokenization and chain-agnostic architecture make it a rare convergence of innovation and discipline. For participants watching for the next bull run crypto , Qubetics is arguably the most promising among newer entrants. Combined with the upward motion in XRP and Stellar, this trio forms a diversified, high-utility shortlist for anyone scanning the market for top crypto presale, crypto pre sale, or the best crypto presale with actual economic logic behind the tokenomics. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the next bull run crypto to watch? Qubetics, XRP, and Stellar are currently positioned as leading candidates for the next bull run crypto, thanks to presale momentum, DeFi growth, and bullish technicals. How much has Qubetics raised in its presale? Qubetics has surpassed $17.9 million raised, with 515 million tokens sold and fewer than 10 million tokens remaining at the current presale price of $0.3370. What does Stellar’s TVL record mean? Stellar’s all-time high $97 million TVL reflects growing institutional participation and a maturing DeFi ecosystem, boosting its appeal as a next bull run crypto asset.

A fascinating development is unfolding in Ukraine, where legislators are pushing for a Ukraine crypto law that could dramatically change how the nation’s central bank operates. This isn’t just about acknowledging digital assets; it’s about potentially integrating them into the very fabric of national finance. What Does This Ukraine Crypto Law Propose? At the heart of this proposal is a draft bill aimed at amending the existing law governing the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). Currently, the NBU’s holdings are primarily limited to traditional assets like gold and foreign currencies as part of its gold and foreign exchange reserves. The proposed amendment seeks to broaden this scope to include crypto assets. According to reports, including insights shared by lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak on Telegram and covered by Cointelegraph, the key aspect of this draft bill is that it would permit , but not mandate , the National Bank of Ukraine to acquire and hold cryptocurrencies. This distinction is crucial. It gives the central bank the flexibility to explore digital asset holdings without forcing an immediate, potentially risky, pivot. Think of it this way: Current Law: NBU reserves = Gold + Foreign Currencies Proposed Law: NBU reserves = Gold + Foreign Currencies + (Optional) Crypto Assets This move signals a growing recognition within Ukrainian legislative circles of the increasing importance and potential utility of digital assets in the global financial landscape. Why Would a Central Bank Consider Holding Crypto Reserves? The idea of a central bank adding cryptocurrencies to its crypto reserves might sound unconventional to some, but there are several potential strategic reasons behind such a move: Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class like Bitcoin could help diversify the national reserves, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. While volatile, crypto assets operate under different market dynamics than traditional currencies or gold. Inflation Hedge: Some view Bitcoin, in particular, as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, similar to gold. Including it could offer an alternative store of value. Innovation & Future Preparedness: Embracing crypto reserves demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, positioning the National Bank of Ukraine at the forefront of exploring the integration of digital assets into sovereign finance. This could also build expertise for potential future initiatives like a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Attracting Investment & Talent: A positive stance on crypto at the central bank level could signal to the global crypto community and tech investors that Ukraine is a crypto-friendly nation, potentially attracting foreign investment and fostering domestic innovation. While the immediate impact of this draft bill passing might be minimal (since holding crypto is optional), the symbolic significance is immense. It opens the door for the Ukraine central bank to actively participate in the digital asset space. Exploring the Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Reserves If the National Bank of Ukraine were to utilize this new legal framework, including Bitcoin reserves could offer specific advantages. Bitcoin, as the largest and most established cryptocurrency, is often the first digital asset considered for institutional or sovereign holdings. Potential benefits of holding Bitcoin could include: Potential for High Growth: While highly volatile, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional reserve assets. A small allocation could potentially yield substantial returns over time. Global Accessibility & Liquidity: Bitcoin is a globally traded asset with high liquidity, making it relatively easy to buy and sell compared to certain illiquid assets. Decentralization: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means it is not controlled by any single government or central authority, offering a degree of independence from geopolitical risks associated with fiat currencies. However, these benefits come with significant risks that the National Bank of Ukraine would need to carefully consider. What Challenges Does Holding Crypto Present for the Ukraine Central Bank? While the potential benefits are intriguing, incorporating crypto assets into national reserves, particularly for the Ukraine central bank, is fraught with challenges: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are known for dramatic price swings. Holding these assets would expose the national reserves to significant market risk. Security Risks: Managing private keys and securing large quantities of crypto assets requires sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. This creates uncertainty regarding compliance, taxation, and potential future restrictions. Valuation and Accounting: Determining the appropriate valuation methods and accounting standards for volatile digital assets within a central bank’s balance sheet is complex. Public Perception and Political Risk: Investing public funds, even indirectly, into volatile and often controversial assets like crypto could face significant public scrutiny and political opposition. The NBU would need to develop robust risk management frameworks, secure storage solutions, and clear policies before making any move to acquire crypto reserves. Global Context: Are Other Nations Considering Crypto Reserves? Ukraine isn’t operating in a vacuum. The conversation around sovereign crypto holdings is gaining traction globally, albeit slowly. El Salvador: Famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and has acquired a significant amount of Bitcoin for its national treasury. Central African Republic: Also adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, though implementation has faced challenges. Other Nations: While most central banks are focused on exploring CBDCs, many are also researching the broader implications of crypto assets and blockchain technology. Discussions about diversification of reserves are ongoing in various financial circles. Ukraine’s potential move, while currently just a legislative proposal allowing the option, places it among the nations actively exploring the frontier of digital assets at the sovereign level. It’s a strong indicator of the increasing mainstream acceptance and consideration of cryptocurrencies. What Happens Next with the Ukraine Crypto Law? The draft bill must go through the standard legislative process in Ukraine. This involves readings, potential amendments, and ultimately, a vote. There’s no guarantee it will pass, and even if it does, there’s no timeline or requirement for the National Bank of Ukraine to actually begin holding crypto reserves. However, the introduction of this bill itself is a significant step. It forces a national conversation about digital assets, their role in the economy, and their potential place in national financial strategy. It suggests a potential future where central banks might view assets like Bitcoin not just as speculative instruments, but as viable components of a diversified national reserve portfolio. For crypto enthusiasts and market observers, this development from Ukraine is a positive signal, indicating that national governments are increasingly looking at how digital assets can fit into traditional financial structures. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Sovereign Finance The proposed Ukraine crypto law allowing the National Bank of Ukraine to potentially hold crypto assets in its reserves is a landmark development, even in its current draft form. It signifies a legislative willingness to embrace the possibilities presented by digital currencies like Bitcoin. While challenges related to volatility, security, and regulation remain substantial, the mere consideration of crypto reserves by a central bank is a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of global finance. This bill opens the door for Ukraine to potentially join a small but growing group of nations exploring the integration of digital assets into their national financial strategies, offering a fascinating glimpse into the future of sovereign wealth and reserve management.

45826299,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=744945,1749684108,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45826299.jpeg,Republicans remove military spending and tax policy to avoid Senate rule violations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/house-republicans-amend-big-beautiful-bill/,"House Republicans just rewired Donald Trump’s One Big, Beautiful bill to keep it alive in the Senate, ripping out several key provisions that had been flagged as rule violations. The changes went through on Wednesday afternoon after a 213 to 207 vote, locking in a procedural maneuver that updated the bill automatically without needing a second full House vote. The only Republican to vote no was Thomas Massie, a lawmaker from Kentucky. The maneuver was needed to protect the bill’s reconciliation status — that is, the special privilege that allows it to bypass the filibuster and pass the Senate with a simple majority. Without these tweaks, the bill would’ve lost that shield and been exposed to a 60-vote threshold it had no chance of clearing. According to reporting from Politico, the stripped-down version is meant to preserve the package’s viability ahead of the Senate’s review. Republicans remove military spending and tax policy to avoid Senate rule violations Republicans deleted many big-ticket items that were originally in their House version. These included $2 billion for Pentagon military intelligence, over $500 million for missile development, and a policy to crack down on the employee retention tax credit, which had turned into a scam magnet during and after the pandemic. That last item alone was expected to generate more than $6 billion in offsets that were supposed to balance the bill’s other spending and tax cuts. But none of that could survive the Senate parliamentarian’s review. If those policies stayed, the parliamentarian would’ve ruled the bill out of order under reconciliation rules. That would have made it vulnerable to a filibuster and likely dead on arrival. So Republican leadership acted fast to rip out those items before the bill even reached the Senate. They aren’t done yet. The Senate parliamentarian is still going through the rest of the package, and more sections could get cut for breaking budget rules. That means more adjustments are coming — and fast — because Republicans are still aiming to pass the full bill by July 4. Leadership plans more changes while Senate rewrites bill Trump’s party wants to rewrite and reintroduce some of the policies that got pulled. But they’ll try doing it through the Senate version instead, hoping they can get the language right this time without losing the fast-track privilege. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are writing their version of the package now, and they’ve got less than a month to lock it in. Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, told reporters, “We’ll see what they produce,” referring to the Senate’s work. “I just need them to come to their final decisions on everything. So we’ll see how it shapes up.” Behind closed doors, aides in both chambers know the timeline is tight. Some say that even if the Senate moves quickly, it could still take weeks or even months to finalize if their version drifts too far from what the House passed. That’s a problem, because neither chamber wants to go through another pingpong fight — sending the bill back and forth for revisions. The current plan is to settle all disputes during the Senate process. That way, once the Senate finishes, the House can vote again — once — to approve the final product and send it to Trump. But for that to work, they’ll need to agree ahead of time on some major sticking points: spending cuts, business tax extensions, and the SALT deduction cap. “There’s just a lot of coordination to hopefully avoid some of the potential snafus that could happen with something that’s this complicated,” said John Thune, the Republican whip. Work is already underway. Nick LaLota, a Republican from New York, met with Senate GOP staff on Wednesday to talk about raising the SALT cap. Over in a separate meeting Tuesday night, Chip Roy from Texas and Scott Perry from Pennsylvania sat down with budget hawks like Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and Rick Scott to push for tighter spending limits and to keep the House’s cuts to clean energy tax credits in place.

Capital flows are shifting, signaling a new wave of opportunities. Discover which three altcoins experts believe are set to soar in the next market phase. Hedera HBAR: Past Declines Spotlight Key Price Levels for Future Moves Over the past month, Hedera has seen a decline of nearly 19% following a modest one-week gain. The coin's performance over the last six months has shown a consistent downward trajectory, with a total drop of around 40% indicating ongoing selling pressure. Buyers have struggled to regain momentum, and the recovery attempts have been weak, reflecting a market still in a bearish sentiment. Traders are growing cautious, as the coin remains unable to shift its negative trend significantly, which may lead to increased uncertainty in the near future. Current pricing for Hedera is between $0.1431 and $0.2112, with immediate resistance at $0.2538 and key support around $0.1177. The RSI near 49.79 suggests a neutral market stance, but moving averages lean slightly bearish. Traders should monitor the lower support closely; a bounce from $0.1177 could present a buying opportunity if supported by volume. Breaking through the $0.2538 barrier is crucial for testing further resistance at $0.3219. A drop below $0.1177 could lead to declines towards $0.0497, signaling a need for caution and defined stop-loss strategies as the market awaits clarity. Pi Network: Six-Month Surge Amid Recent Price Corrections PI saw a significant pullback recently, with prices dropping nearly 19% in the last month and a modest 2% decline in the past week. Over the previous half-year, however, it surged by over 500%, showing strong long-term momentum. This dramatic rebound contrasts sharply with the recent volatility, indicating robust demand despite short-term price corrections. The price action reflects a wide-ranging recovery that highlights the potential for future gains even when facing a dip in momentum. Current price levels sit between approximately $0.26 and $1.36, with initial resistance around $2.06 and a secondary barrier near $3.16. The market is currently under bearish pressure, with indicators like moving averages suggesting a negative trend. RSI readings in the low 40s indicate that bears maintain short-term control but are not at critical resistance levels. No clear trend has emerged, making it essential for traders to monitor price behavior closely. Trading on declines toward support levels may favor short-term strategies, while a break above $2.06 could spark buying interest aimed at reaching $3.16. Cronos Price Analysis: Short-Term Levels Amid Long-Term Decline Over the last month, Cronos declined by about 4%, with weekly moves around -2%. In the past six months, the coin experienced a significant drop of approximately 46%. Price action has remained within a narrow range, fluctuating between $0.09 and $0.12. This trend indicates a market under pressure, characterized by slight negative momentum and technical indicators trending downward. Despite the extended decline, the coin trades within clear boundaries that could offer opportunities for a rebound should buying pressure return. Currently, Cronos is trading between $0.09 and $0.12, facing key levels that shape its trading activity. Resistance is at $0.12, while support rests at $0.08, creating distinct boundaries for near-term price movements. A secondary resistance level at $0.15 and additional support at $0.05 further define potential trading zones. Oscillator readings indicate mild downward pressure, while the RSI near 54 shows a balanced market that is neither oversold nor overbought. This lack of dominance by bulls or bears leaves room for traders to explore opportunities on both sides. Traders may consider buying near the 8-cent support or selling near the $0.12 resistance to capitalize on short-term movements. Conclusion Capital is moving away from Bitcoin and into alternative coins. HBAR offers fast transaction speeds and strong security. PI is gaining attention for its unique consensus mechanism. CRO is expanding its reach through strategic partnerships and user incentives. These coins show promising potential for growth in the next phase of the market.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.9511 Market cap $974.49M Trading volume $526.17M Circulating supply 998.84M WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.04 24-hour low $0.9353 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.82% 50-day SMA $0.8650 14-Day RSI 57.31 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index – Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $1.2177 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Bears are in control of the market. The $0.375 support remains critical. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF shows neutral-to-bearish momentum The WIF/USDT price analysis on June 11 shows a bearish candle with the price at $0.950, below the middle Bollinger Band. This suggests a neutral-to-bearish outlook. If the price moves below the lower band, it could continue to drop towards the next support. The RSI is at 48.82, indicating neutral conditions but leaning toward bearish momentum. The MACD is also bearish, with the histogram confirming the current sentiment. WIF shows neutral-to-bearish momentum Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF is bearish in the short-term The 4-hour chart shows a 3.55% drop in price, indicating bearish momentum. The price is currently trading below the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which further suggests a potential downtrend in the short term. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is negative at -3.91M, suggesting that the bearish sentiment is more prominent as traders exit their positions. WIF is bearish in the short-term The Money Flow Index (MFI) stands at 53.53, placing it in a neutral range. This indicates that there is no clear buying or selling dominance, and the market is neither in an overbought nor oversold condition. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.7672 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.8229 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.8794 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.9788 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.8650 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.6862 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.2177 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9207 BUY EMA 5 $0.8480 BUY EMA 10 $0.7106 BUY EMA 21 $0.6015 BUY EMA 50 $0.6288 BUY EMA 100 $0.9206 BUY EMA 200 $1.3531 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF/USDT appears to have a bearish outlook. If the price drops below key support levels and the indicators remain in their current positions, further downside movement could occur. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Traders are now watching closely as optimism builds around a potential move toward higher resistance levels. Chainlink (LINK) is facing a more cautious outlook. The token is hovering just above key support at $17.80, and analysts warn that a breakdown could trigger a deeper decline. Technical indicators are showing signs of weakness, making sentiment fragile. In the background, Unstaked ($UNSD) is building something more sustainable. With nearly $9.5 million raised and a projected 2,700% return at launch, its AI-powered agents are set to automate social growth across platforms with no coding required. Unstaked is gaining ground not through speculation, but by delivering real product utility. BNB Eyes $950 as Regulatory Pressure Eases Binance Coin (BNB) is gaining momentum following reports that the SEC’s legal action against Binance could be delayed or possibly dropped altogether. This shift in sentiment has pushed BNB above the $635 level, drawing renewed interest and optimism among market participants. Analysts are now watching the $680 resistance level closely. A clean break above could open the door to a climb toward $950 in the coming weeks. As the native asset of the Binance ecosystem, BNB continues to play a central role by powering trading discounts, launchpad participation, and other core platform utilities. Chainlink Faces Critical Test as Support Weakens Chainlink (LINK) is trading just above a key support zone near $17.80, and analysts are warning of a potential breakdown. If support fails, the token could fall sharply, with targets ranging from $15.50 to $14.80. Recent attempts to hold above $19.50 have failed, and technical indicators are signaling weakness. Volume has declined, and the RSI shows continued softening, suggesting limited buying pressure in the short term. While Chainlink remains a vital piece of Web3 infrastructure by connecting blockchains with real-world data, short-term sentiment appears cautious. A rebound at current levels could help stabilize price action, but the risk of further decline remains high. Why Unstaked Is the Most Underrated Growth Engine in Web3 Success in Web3 is no longer about chance or chasing trends. It is now about efficiency and execution, and Unstaked is quietly emerging as the most powerful tool in the space with its AI-powered marketing agents set to go live at launch. At the center of its platform are intelligent AI agents that automate real-time outreach, schedule posts based on live sentiment data, and respond dynamically across more than 10 social platforms. These agents run nonstop and require no coding, making them ideal for solo creators, meme coin teams, and DAOs looking to scale without hiring. The system is designed to make high-impact growth accessible. Founders no longer need to build marketing departments from scratch. Unstaked offers a plug-and-play solution where AI handles what used to take entire teams. Whether it is community engagement or brand visibility, these agents are built to do the work on their own. The Unstaked token gates access to this powerful system. Now in stage 19 of its AI crypto presale and priced at $0.011065, it comes with a projected launch price of $0.1819. That points to a potential 2,700% return for early holders. Nearly $9.5 million has already been raised, signaling strong confidence from early buyers. As the need for smarter growth intensifies across Web3, Unstaked is positioning itself as the tool of choice. With AI agents going live after launch, the current presale may be the last true entry point before the platform becomes a staple in every project’s toolkit. Final Thoughts BNB’s rally shows how quickly sentiment can flip with regulatory updates, while LINK’s drop reveals how fragile markets become when support levels start to break. These moves reflect short-term reactions driven by headlines and technical signals. Unstaked is playing a different game. It is building long-term value through AI-powered tools that automate marketing across Web3. With a stage 19 price of $0.011065 and a projected $0.1819 launch, the 2,700% upside is tied to real utility. As more teams prioritize automation over speculation, Unstaked could become a foundational asset in every serious project’s toolkit.

Nick Carcaterra, a spokesperson at the actual Goldman Sachs, tells the WSJ that Eghbali hasn’t worked for the financial giant, which is taking action regarding the use of its name. Eghbali reportedly represents trade creditors through his firm Olympus Guardians and is involved in numerous cases related to high-profile companies like Forever 21, Hooters and Virgin Orbit. The California businessman tells the WSJ he considered embarking on a business venture that he thought would receive funds from the actual Goldman Sachs, so he registered Goldman Sachs Capital. That venture didn’t materialize, and Eghbali has since used the LLC to maximize employee retention credits (ERCs), refundable tax credits designed to encourage employers to keep on employees during the pandemic. Carcaterra, however, tells the WSJ that Eghbali’s reasoning for registering Goldman Sachs Capital does not follow logic. A representative for the California Secretary of State’s Office tells the WSJ that it doesn’t regulate brand or intellectual-property issues and only cross-checks registrations against names that are already in its system, not national brands.

In an X post on Wednesday, Grachev requested the core developers at Near Protocol to consider theThe move to boost the long term prospects of the project. Grachev reminded the core founders that DWF Labs currently holds 5 million NEAR tokens and has staked an additional 6 million tokens. To spice up the proposal, Grachev told the core developers that DWF Labs would purchase an additional 10 million NEAR tokens. Meanwhile, Bowen Wang, a developer at Near Protocol, welcomed the idea of reducing the token’s inflation but highlighted that the final move is up to the community. Moreover, the current inflation is part of the incentive plan to attract more holders to stake NEAR tokens and secure the protocol. I think it could be a good idea to reduce inflation to make the tokenomics more sustainable, but it is up to the community to decide — Bowen Wang (@BowenWang18) June 11, 2025 Closer Look at NEAR Price Action Amid the highly anticipated altseason 2025, catalyzed by rising institutional demand and imminent reversal of the Bitcoin dominance, NEAR price has signaled bullish sentiment.

This article delves into a crucial element that could be pivotal for these cryptocurrencies. Readers will discover which digital assets are poised for potential growth, sparking curiosity about the mid-term price predictions. Solana Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Levels Solana has shown a blend of slight recovery and a significant drop in recent periods. Over the last week, the coin registered a modest gain of 1.56%, hinting at some short-term strength. However, in the past month, it declined by approximately 10.36%, and looking back over a six-month span, the loss approaches 30%. This volatility indicates that while there have been quick upward shifts, they have not been enough to overcome the broader downward pressure. The market continues to struggle with finding stable upward momentum, although it remains active with rapid changes in shorter intervals. At present, Solana trades within a defined range, with immediate support at $115.84 and a second support near $69.81. Resistance levels are identified at $207.90 and $253.93. The current price action indicates a battle between buyers and sellers, with the RSI close to 50 and oscillators suggesting a slight downward trend. Bulls are attempting to break through resistance levels, but bears maintain influence, resulting in an unclear overall trend. Focusing on local support zones for potential bounces and observing key resistance and support levels can guide short-term trading strategies. A resistance hold may open the door to higher targets, while a breach of support could signal further losses. Ethereum Market Trends: Past Adjustments and Key Levels Over the last month, Ethereum posted a modest gain of 4.23%, with a weekly increase of 3.16%. However, the coin faced a decline close to 30% over the past six months, reflecting significant volatility as prices fluctuated between $1923.57 and $2961.91. These fluctuations highlight ETH's resilience during a period where traders assessed opportunities against broader market pressures. Recovery efforts continued amidst a downtrend, indicating a battle for stability. Currently, Ethereum trades within a price zone between approximately $1923.57 and $2961.91. Resistance levels are found at around $3395.39 and $4433.73, while support sits at about $1318.71, with additional support near $280.38. Buyers are trying to push prices higher, but sellers maintain enough influence to limit sharp increases. The market shows a slightly bullish bias, as indicated by the RSI reading of 62.08, but no clear trend exists. Traders may consider a range-bound strategy, focusing on buying near support and selling near resistance while remaining cautious of the recent downward trend. Monitoring technical indicators and volume trends will be essential for making informed trading decisions. Conclusion Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have significant potential for growth in the mid-term. Increased adoption and innovative technological advancements are key factors driving this potential. Both coins are positioned to benefit from rising interest and demand in the market. Future price movements will likely reflect these positive developments. Investors may find promising opportunities if these trends continue. The outlook for SOL and ETH appears favorable, and market participants should keep a close watch.

For those tracking the intersection of tech giants and AI, a significant development comes from Apple. The company’s native AI image generation tool, Apple Image Playground , is set to receive a major upgrade through a strategic ChatGPT integration . This move aims to revitalize the platform after its initial lukewarm reception. What Were the Initial Challenges for Apple Image Playground? When Apple first introduced Image Playground last year, powered by Apple Intelligence, the vision was clear: provide users with a simple way to create unique, personalized images directly on their devices. However, upon launch, the reality fell short for many. User feedback highlighted several limitations: Quality Concerns: Some users reported receiving low-quality or distorted images, such as a prompt for a hand resulting in an image with six fingers. Limited Capabilities: Basic descriptions like “old man” or “flower” sometimes failed to produce results. Perceived Simplicity: Compared to more advanced AI image generators available, Image Playground felt juvenile to some, leading them to question its practical use cases beyond simple, emoji-like creations. While some users found it a fun experience, the overall sentiment pointed towards a tool that needed significant improvement to compete in the growing AI image generation space. How Does ChatGPT Integration Boost Apple Image Playground? Fast forward to this year’s WWDC, where Apple announced a crucial update: integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into Image Playground. This partnership is designed to inject more sophistication and capability into the app’s generation process. The key benefits of this ChatGPT integration include: Expanded Style Options: Moving beyond the initial limited styles (Animation, Illustration, Sketch, Genmoji), users will gain access to new, more artistic styles like Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, Anime, and Print. ‘Any Style’ Flexibility: A new “Any Style” option allows users to describe exactly the look and feel they want for their image, offering unprecedented creative control within the app. Improved Understanding: By leveraging ChatGPT’s advanced language understanding, Image Playground should be better equipped to interpret complex prompts and deliver more accurate and relevant image results. These new styles will be clearly labeled under a “ChatGPT style” banner, indicating the source of the enhanced capability. Apple AI Strategy: More Than Just Image Generation This move isn’t an isolated incident but fits into Apple’s broader Apple AI strategy. The company has already established a working relationship with OpenAI, bringing ChatGPT capabilities to other parts of its ecosystem. For example: Siri Integration: Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s knowledge base when it encounters questions it cannot answer on its own, or when a user specifically directs the query to ChatGPT. Writing Tools: System-wide writing tools across apps like Notes and Mail leverage ChatGPT to help users generate, rewrite, or summarize text. Integrating ChatGPT into Image Playground therefore makes strategic sense, allowing Apple to quickly enhance a key AI feature by partnering with a leader in the field, rather than relying solely on its internal models for this specific task. When Can Users Expect the Update? The updated Apple Image Playground featuring the ChatGPT integration is slated for release alongside the new operating system updates, expected this fall with iOS 26 . This timing suggests that the enhanced AI image generation capabilities will be available to a wide range of Apple users relatively soon. Why This Matters for AI Image Generation By incorporating ChatGPT, Apple is giving Image Playground a second chance to impress users and become a more viable competitor in the increasingly crowded landscape of free AI image generation tools. This integration addresses the primary criticisms of the original version by promising better quality, more flexibility, and a wider range of creative options. It positions Apple’s native tool as a more well-rounded service, potentially attracting users who might otherwise turn to third-party apps for their AI image creation needs. In conclusion, Apple’s decision to bolster Image Playground with ChatGPT integration is a significant step. It acknowledges the initial shortcomings while demonstrating Apple’s commitment to improving its AI offerings. The promise of enhanced styles and better generation capabilities arriving with iOS 26 makes Image Playground a tool worth revisiting for anyone interested in accessible AI image generation directly on their Apple devices.

45829260,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=744964,1749687626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45829260.jpeg,Singapore’s crypto warning triggers exchange exodus,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/singapore-crypto-crackdown-triggers-exodus/,"Singapore’s latest regulatory clampdown on offshore digital-asset firms has triggered a wave of urgent exits and staff restructuring among major crypto exchanges operating in the city-state without a license. Bitget and Bybit, both top-10 crypto exchanges globally by trading volume, are now preparing to shift operations out of Singapore, sources familiar with the matter revealed. Bitget will relocate staff to crypto-friendly jurisdictions such as Dubai and Hong Kong, while Bybit is weighing similar moves. Both exchanges declined to comment publicly. The move follows a final warning from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which on May 30 issued a directive requiring crypto firms with Singapore-based operations serving overseas clients to cease such activities by June 30. The notice leaves no room for transitional arrangements and states that new licenses will be granted only under “extremely limited” conditions. MAS crackdown sparks panic and job fears The MAS decision has rattled many offshore crypto firms with substantial local teams. Arthur Cheong, founder and CIO of DeFiance Capital LLC, warned that hundreds of jobs could be at risk, as many exchanges have front-office teams — including business development and sales — stationed in Singapore to serve global clients. “This is almost as good as an evacuation procedure,” said Patrick Tan, general counsel at blockchain analytics firm ChainArgos, which is not affected by the directive. Chris Holland, a partner at Singapore-based consultancy HM, noted a surge in inquiries: “Calls are at all hours given the impact on businesses headquartered outside Singapore. Some are scrambling to understand their exposure and risks.” Singapore has long marketed itself as a regulated, innovation-friendly crypto hub, drawing major players like Coinbase and Crypto.com to set up regional operations. However, the city-state also continues to bear the scars of the 2022 market crash, which collapsed several high-profile local crypto ventures. In response, MAS has grown increasingly hawkish, tightening oversight while discouraging retail crypto speculation and limiting advertising. The May directive builds on the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2022, where MAS had already signaled its intention to rein in unlicensed digital asset providers. In a follow-up on June 6, MAS stated that only a “very small” number of providers would be directly affected — yet firms remain unclear about how the rules apply to hybrid or decentralized operation models. Regulators close in as offshore crypto firms scramble to define operations The opaque structures of many offshore exchanges have long complicated Singapore’s crypto compliance environment. Grace Chong, head of financial regulatory practice at Drew & Napier LLC, noted that companies leveraging Singapore-based staff to support foreign operations — without clearly defined boundaries — occupy a legal “gray area.” For its part, MAS maintains that it has consistently communicated its expectations. “This move should not come as a surprise,” said an MAS spokesperson. “Entities already licensed are not affected by this latest guidance.” Still, the sudden enforcement has caught some off guard. Unlike licensed players, offshore entities will now need to make swift adjustments or face possible enforcement actions. Exchanges like Binance, which has been on MAS’s investor alert list since 2021, represent how difficult regulatory navigation has become. Binance CEO Richard Teng has described the firm as “remote-first,” adding that discussions about a global headquarters remain ongoing. A Binance spokesperson reiterated the exchange’s intent to comply with local regulations globally but offered no details on its Singapore operations. As MAS tightens the net, other jurisdictions like Dubai, Hong Kong, and even Australia are emerging as alternative bases for crypto firms forced to adapt — or flee.

The transition will depend on the progress of Cardano towards Bitcoin interoperability, which is a long-awaited move that may bring native BTC to decentralized finance. Andrew Throuvalas, the senior content manager at BitcoinOS, believes that Minswap occupies a privileged place in the Cardano ecosystem. Minswap will be the largest DEX on a UTXO-based smart contract platform, making it the natural leader in adding Bitcoin DeFi functionality. Minswap is the largest DEX on Cardano – the first and largest UTXO smart contract chain that will plug into Bitcoin. 🟠🤝🔵 That means Minswap will have a first-mover advantage as a proper BTC DEX. It's hard to underestimate the opportunity. @MinswapDEX thread anyone? pic.twitter.com/OZipNkCQ1N — Andrew | BitcoinOS (@AThrouvalas) June 11, 2025 Its technical basis and proven liquidity put it in a good position to be the first BTC-enabled DEX on Cardano. According to DeFiLlama, Minswap now has more than $83.43 million in total value locked, or over a quarter of the entire Cardano DeFi sector. Cardinal protocol sets the stage Charles Hoskinson , the founder of Cardano, unveiled the Cardinal Protocol earlier this month, a Bitcoin DeFi solution that was born to enable decentralized capabilities on BTC. The protocol will enable the lending, swaps, and yield farming capabilities of Bitcoin holders on Cardano. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 The announcement of the protocol served as a breakthrough in developing cross-chain DeFi. Bitcoin, which currently has a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, has yet to be fully utilized in DeFi because of technical impediments. Cardano proposes to address this through its extended UTXO model and off-chain computation plans to achieve smart contract execution with BTC. Hoskinson has said that unlocking Bitcoin DeFi may represent a trillion-dollar opportunity, introducing capital efficiency to the largest digital asset. The Cardinal Protocol is considered a foundation stone of that vision, as it will provide the plumbing required to bring Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano-native dApps. In Bitcoin DeFi, timing can become a crucial aspect of becoming a leader. The availability of Minswap and the emphasis on cross-chain capability in Cardano provide a confluence that supports early adopters. With users seeking more opportunities to utilize BTC than merely holding it, decentralized financial services platforms seem set to gain more traction. The early lead that Minswap has managed to acquire may result in an increase in trading volume, user activity, and protocol revenue. It currently has a solid market position in Cardano with $83 million TVL. By adding Bitcoin to its list of supported assets, that number may rise substantially, particularly should network activity-driven demand grow in the aftermath of the Cardinal Protocol launch. ADA price builds toward potential breakout With the infrastructure improvements in Cardano, ADA is testing a major resistance area. The token is trading right under the $0.7 mark, with analysts predicting a breakout once it surpasses the $0.77 mark. Renowned crypto analyst JavonTM1 predicts that, based on Fibonacci levels, Cardano may be aiming at $5.35 in a fresh bull run. Another market analyst, Ali, indicates that continued movement above $0.77 will activate a bullish trend. Prominent analyst Crypto Winkle pointed out that ADA has built strong support between 0.63 and 0.67, where it is still recovering. The token is currently testing resistance at around $0.70- an area that has monitored gains over months. Winkle added that a decisive break above $0.70 may result in a sharp move up to the $1.60 level. Source:X Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This development follows a broader trend of businesses viewing BTC as an inflation hedge and digital gold. It also supports Bitcoin’s price base by increasing the amount of BTC locked in long-term holdings. Trump’s China Deal Lifts Risk Sentiment, BTC Follows Bitcoin got another tailwind from geopolitics. Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced via Truth Social that a long-awaited trade agreement with China has been finalized, pending only President Xi Jinping’s approval. The deal reportedly includes a rollback of select export tariffs and was confirmed by both nations’ commerce officials. BREAKING: TRUMP SAYS TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA IS DONE MARKETS LIKELY TO REACT STRONGLY! pic.twitter.com/awVibnj3xS — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) June 11, 2025 In response to this, the BTC/USD pair surged to an intraday high of $110,300 ahead of pulling back to around $109,560. This follows months of volatility sparked by Trump’s earlier tariff threats, which had briefly driven BTC down to $74,434. The conclusion of the deal eased macro risk, lifting sentiment in both equity and crypto markets. Analysts suggest that reduced global trade friction could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin to retest and potentially surpass its all-time highs, especially if macroeconomic stability continues. Bitcoin Holds Key Support Amid Inflation Watch Despite a slight 1.4% dip in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin price prediction remains technically supported. Trading near $108,610, the two-hour chart reveals BTC sitting atop a confluence of supports: the 50-EMA ($108,123), ascending trendline, and the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $108,595. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick action shows indecision, with repeated rejection near $109,355 and $110,574. The MACD has turned bearish, with a widening gap, suggesting further weakness. However, bulls still have a case: so long as BTC holds above $108,100, a rebound remains possible.

With both Bitcoin and Ethereum pushing into higher prices, investor sentiment is improving, and altcoins like Solana appear poised to follow once the major players confirm a breakout. After weeks of consolidation and volatility, the stage may be set for a stronger move if current trends hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level – Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis revealing that SOL has formed a higher low on the chart—a key bullish signal—and is now charging back toward the range highs. This structure indicates growing strength and the potential for Solana to retest and break through key resistance levels if buyers maintain pressure. The $150 zone now acts as a short-term support base, and as long as SOL holds above it, the bullish case remains intact. A confirmed breakout in BTC and ETH could act as the catalyst Solana needs to enter a new phase of upside. With the market leaning bullish and Solana’s technicals aligning, traders are watching closely to see if this move is the beginning of Solana’s next leg higher in the ongoing altcoin cycle. Solana Approaches Resistance As Bulls Regain Momentum Solana is showing renewed strength after spending several days consolidating below the $160 level. With a fresh move upward, SOL is now pushing into key resistance just under $175, a zone that has capped price advances multiple times over the past few months. This renewed momentum comes as the broader crypto market heats up, with Bitcoin and Ethereum breaking higher and dragging sentiment with them. Still, despite the optimism, caution lingers. Most altcoins, including Solana, remain well below their all-time highs. Jelle highlighted a critical development in Solana’s structure: the formation of a higher low. This bullish signal suggests growing buyer confidence and technical strength, as SOL now charges back toward the top of its range. According to Jelle, a breakout above $185 would be the key trigger that opens the door to new all-time highs. While the short-term trend favors the bulls, one key hurdle remains — flipping the $175–$185 resistance zone into support. This region has consistently rejected upside attempts, and clearing it with strong volume and follow-through is essential for confirming the next leg higher. Until then, Solana remains in a recovery phase. But with improving market conditions and clear signs of accumulation, momentum is shifting. A confirmed breakout could mark the return of “Solana season,” where SOL reclaims leadership among top altcoins. For now, all eyes are on the $185 level — the line between consolidation and a potential explosive rally toward uncharted territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level – No Clear Breakout Yet SOL Price Action Details Solana is currently trading at $165.80 on the daily timeframe, showing continued strength after reclaiming the 50-day SMA at $160.99. Price is now approaching the 100-day SMA at $175.70 — a key level that previously rejected multiple breakout attempts. The recent bounce from the $142–$145 support zone marked a higher low, reinforcing a bullish structure and setting the stage for another attempt to break through resistance. Volume has been rising modestly as price moves higher, suggesting growing interest and momentum among buyers. The crossover between the 50-day and 100-day SMAs would add further confirmation of trend strength, especially if SOL can maintain its current pace and push above $175 with conviction.

Currently, attention is sharply focused on key developments impacting the US Dollar and Sterling , currencies central to the Forex market . These movements, driven by anticipated economic data and policy decisions, offer valuable insights for anyone navigating the broader financial ecosystem. Why is the US Dollar Under Pressure Ahead of Key CPI Data ? The US Dollar has seen a recent dip, a movement largely attributed to market anticipation surrounding the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. This report is a critical indicator of inflation, a factor that heavily influences the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. Here is why the CPI data is so significant: Inflation Gauge: CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. High inflation erodes purchasing power. Fed Policy Influence: The Federal Reserve monitors inflation closely when deciding whether to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates. Higher inflation can prompt the Fed to consider rate hikes to cool the economy. Currency Impact: Higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns, thus strengthening it. Conversely, expectations of stable or lower rates can weaken a currency like the US Dollar . Markets are currently pricing in various scenarios for the CPI release. A figure that comes in lower than expected could reinforce the view that the Fed may not need to raise rates aggressively, or could even cut them sooner, putting downward pressure on the US Dollar . Conversely, a higher-than-expected number might support the case for tighter policy, potentially boosting the dollar. What Does the UK Spending Review Mean for Sterling ? Across the Atlantic, Sterling , the British pound, is also facing its own set of market drivers. The currency’s performance is closely tied to the UK’s economic outlook and fiscal policy. A major event on the horizon is the UK government’s Spending Review . The Spending Review is an important fiscal event where the government sets out its spending plans for the coming years across various departments and public services. It provides a detailed look at the government’s priorities and its approach to public finances. Key aspects watched by the market include: Fiscal Headroom: The review indicates how much fiscal flexibility the government has, impacting its ability to stimulate the economy or address debt. Investment Priorities: Details on infrastructure spending, public services, and other investments can signal growth potential or fiscal strain. Overall Economic Strategy: The review reflects the government’s broader economic vision and its commitment to fiscal responsibility or stimulus. The market’s reaction to the Spending Review will depend on whether the plans are perceived as supportive of economic growth, fiscally prudent, or potentially inflationary. Positive signals could provide a boost to Sterling , while concerns about rising debt or insufficient growth plans could weigh on the currency. How Do These Events Shape the Global Forex Market ? The movements in the US Dollar and Sterling are not isolated events; they are significant components of the vast and interconnected Forex market . As the world’s largest financial market, foreign exchange trading is constantly influenced by macroeconomic data, central bank actions, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. The interplay between major currency pairs, such as GBP/USD (Sterling against the US Dollar), is directly affected by the relative strength or weakness of each currency. For example, if the US Dollar weakens due to anticipated lower interest rates while Sterling holds steady or strengthens based on positive Spending Review signals, the GBP/USD pair could see an upward move. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for participants in the Forex market . Traders and investors analyze these events to forecast currency movements and make informed decisions. The volatility created by such releases also presents opportunities, but it comes with increased risk. Broader Implications: Beyond Traditional Currencies While the immediate impact of CPI data and the Spending Review is felt in the traditional Forex market , these macroeconomic factors can have ripple effects on other asset classes, including commodities, stocks, and even cryptocurrencies. For instance, a weaker US Dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated assets, like certain commodities or even Bitcoin, more attractive to international buyers holding other currencies. Conversely, a strong dollar can weigh on these assets. Changes in interest rate expectations, driven by data like the CPI data , influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite, factors that also play a role in the cryptocurrency market. The outcome of the UK Spending Review , by affecting the economic outlook of a major global economy, can also contribute to overall market sentiment, which indirectly influences investor behavior across different asset classes. Navigating Uncertainty: What to Watch For The coming days are critical for currency markets. Market participants will be closely watching the official CPI data release from the United States and details emerging from the UK Spending Review . The actual figures and policy announcements will likely trigger sharp reactions, potentially diverging from current market expectations. Key points to monitor: The headline and core CPI figures (excluding volatile food and energy prices). Year-over-year and month-over-month CPI changes. Specific spending commitments and fiscal targets in the UK review. Official commentary from the Federal Reserve and UK Treasury officials following the events. These events underscore the importance of staying informed about global economic developments. While unpredictable, they provide valuable insights into the forces driving currency values and influencing the broader financial landscape. Summary: Awaiting Key Economic Signals The US Dollar ‘s recent slip reflects market anticipation of crucial CPI data that will shape expectations for US monetary policy. Simultaneously, Sterling is positioned to react to the details of the UK government’s Spending Review , a key determinant of the nation’s fiscal path. These significant events in the Forex market highlight the sensitivity of currencies to macroeconomic announcements and underscore their broader influence on global finance. Traders and investors across various markets, including digital assets, will be watching closely for signals that could dictate future price movements.

Ever wondered what could truly ignite a massive rally in the crypto market? Sometimes, it’s not just about positive news or adoption; it can be the pain of those betting against an asset. That’s exactly the scenario being highlighted for Ethereum (ETH), thanks to insights from a prominent figure in the investment world. Jack Yi, the founder of blockchain investment firm LD Capital , recently shared a compelling analysis that suggests a significant bullish catalyst for Ethereum might be brewing right under the market’s nose. His view centers on the sheer volume of short positions currently open on ETH across various platforms. This isn’t just speculation; he’s pointing to concrete figures that paint an interesting picture for the potential future price action of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Why Massive Short Positions Matter for Ethereum ‘s Price It might seem counterintuitive, but a large number of people betting *against* an asset can actually become a powerful fuel for its price increase. This is the core idea behind a short squeeze. Jack Yi’s analysis for Ethereum specifically highlights the scale of this ‘contrarian fuel’. He pointed to a staggering total of approximately $5 billion in short positions on ETH. Let’s break down where these significant shorts are located, according to Yi’s observations: Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME): A notable $1.3 billion in short positions. This platform is often associated with institutional investors, suggesting a substantial amount of professional money is currently betting on ETH’s price decline. Aave: Around $1 billion in shorts on this popular decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. Aave allows users to borrow assets, and borrowing ETH to sell it (shorting) is a common strategy here. Other Exchanges: An estimated $3 billion+ across various other centralized and decentralized trading platforms. This captures the broad market sentiment from retail traders and other participants. The combined weight of these positions, totaling roughly $5 billion, is what Yi believes could be the primary driver for a significant upward move. But how exactly does betting against an asset lead to its price going up? Understanding the Mechanics of a Crypto Short Squeeze To grasp why these $5B shorts are bullish fuel, we need to quickly understand short selling and short squeezes. Short Selling: This is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like ETH) and sells it on the open market, hoping the price will fall. If the price drops, they buy the asset back at the lower price, return the borrowed asset, and pocket the difference. It’s a bet on the price going down. Short Squeeze: This happens when the price of an asset that has a large number of short positions starts to rise rapidly. As the price increases, short sellers begin to face significant losses. To limit these losses, they are forced to buy the asset back to close their positions. This sudden wave of buying activity further drives the price up, triggering more short sellers to buy, creating a cascading effect that ‘squeezes’ the price higher at an accelerated pace. In the context of Ethereum , a $5 billion aggregate short position means there are potentially billions of dollars worth of ‘forced buying’ waiting to happen if the price starts moving against these short sellers. This potential buying pressure is the core reason for the bullish outlook based on this data point. What Does This Mean for ETH Price Prediction ? Jack Yi didn’t just highlight the shorts; he also offered potential price targets if a short squeeze were to materialize. He suggested that this scenario could realistically push the ETH price to levels like $3,000, then potentially $3,500, and even beyond to $4,000 or higher. While $4,000 might seem ambitious depending on the current market price, the mechanism of a short squeeze is known for its ability to cause rapid and substantial price movements that can overshoot levels predicted by fundamental analysis alone. The speed and intensity of the upward move are directly related to how many short sellers are forced to cover their positions and how quickly they do so. It’s important to remember that a short squeeze is a catalyst, not necessarily a reflection of long-term value. However, in a market like crypto, catalysts can have significant and lasting impacts on sentiment and price discovery. LD Capital ‘s Conviction: Putting Money Where the Mouth Is LD Capital isn’t just talking about the potential; they’re acting on it. Jack Yi mentioned that this bullish outlook, largely driven by the potential for a short squeeze from the massive short positions, was the primary reason behind their decision to purchase 100,000 ETH options . Buying call options is a way to bet on the price of an asset increasing by a certain date, offering leveraged exposure to upward price movements. This move by a firm like LD Capital, which specializes in blockchain investments, signals strong conviction based on their analysis of the market structure, particularly the identified vulnerability presented by the large short interest. It serves as a real-world example of how investment firms are interpreting this data point. Navigating the Opportunity: Risks and Considerations While the potential for a short squeeze is exciting, it’s crucial to approach this information with a balanced perspective. Here are a few points to consider: Shorts Can Persist: Short sellers, especially large institutional ones, can sometimes maintain their positions for extended periods if they believe the price will eventually fall. Market Sentiment: A short squeeze typically requires a trigger – often positive news or a general uptick in market sentiment – to start pushing the price up initially and put pressure on shorts. Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. While a squeeze can drive prices up fast, market conditions can change rapidly. One Data Point: The $5B shorts are a significant factor highlighted by LD Capital, but they are just one piece of the complex puzzle that influences Ethereum’s price. For investors, this analysis from LD Capital provides valuable insight into a potential near-term catalyst. It highlights the importance of looking beyond just fundamental developments and considering market structure and positioning. As always, conducting your own research and managing risk are paramount. Conclusion: Is a Giant ETH Squeeze on the Horizon? The analysis from LD Capital founder Jack Yi regarding the estimated $5 billion in Ethereum short positions presents a compelling case for a potential bullish surge. A short squeeze fueled by such a massive amount of ‘anti-ETH’ bets being forced to cover could indeed propel the ETH price towards and potentially past the $4,000 mark. While the timing and magnitude are never guaranteed, the presence of this significant short interest is a notable technical factor that could dramatically influence the near-term trajectory of Ethereum in the crypto market.

He outlined unilateral tariff rates and offered what he described as a “take it or leave it” trade proposition. “At a certain point, we’re just going to send letters out,” Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center. “And I think you understand that, saying this is the deal, you can take it or leave it.” Tariff deadline nears as US weighs extensions Trump’s comments arrive just days before a July 9 deadline, when a temporary pause on the president’s steepest tariffs is set to expire. While the pause had initially provided markets with a measure of stability, Trump’s latest remarks injected fresh uncertainty into the outlook for global trade. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the House Ways and Means Committee that it is “highly likely” the administration will extend the tariff freeze for nations negotiating in “good faith.” “There are 18 important trading partners — we are working toward deals on those,” Bessent said. “It is highly likely that those countries…will see the date rolled forward.” In a significant development, the US and China reached a tentative framework for easing trade tensions, including an implementation plan. Trump called the deal “done,” pending formal approval by both him and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The agreement reportedly addresses long-standing concerns over China’s export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, though sources later clarified China would only relax restrictions for six months. In a notable concession, Trump also announced the US would continue allowing Chinese students to study at American universities — a contentious point in recent talks. Tariff policy sparks legal battles Trump said that the total tariffs on Chinese imports would reach 55%, a figure that reportedly includes existing tariffs rather than any new levies. According to Yahoo Finance’s Ben Werschkul, the number was derived by aggregating the full scope of current duties. While Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda has faced legal challenges, the administration scored a legal win this week. A federal appeals court overturned a lower court’s ruling that had blocked the tariffs, allowing them to remain in place temporarily. The US Court of International Trade had earlier declared the methods used to enact the tariffs as “unlawful.” As the July 9 deadline approaches, pressure is mounting on foreign governments and global markets to interpret Trump’s mixed signals. The threat of unilateral action and the uncertain fate of ongoing trade negotiations leaves little clarity on what US policy will look like in the coming weeks. For now, all eyes are on Washington and the letters Trump has promised to send. Whether they open a new chapter in international trade relations or trigger a wider backlash remains to be seen.

While cryptocurrencies often grab headlines, the stability and direction of traditional currencies like the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD) have significant implications for global markets, capital flows, and even investor sentiment. A recent analysis from investment bank UBS has caught attention, projecting a notable move for the USD/INR forecast . They anticipate the pair could reach 85, a level driven primarily by expectations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) potentially implementing rate cuts sooner than many expect. What is Driving the UBS USD/INR Forecast? UBS’s projection of the USD/INR forecast reaching 85 is rooted in a specific macroeconomic view: the likelihood of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) front-loading its interest rate cuts. Central banks use interest rates as a key tool to manage inflation and stimulate economic growth. Higher rates can attract foreign investment seeking better returns, strengthening a currency. Conversely, lower rates can make a currency less attractive relative to others, potentially leading to depreciation. Here’s a breakdown of the core argument: Expected RBI Action: UBS believes the RBI may begin cutting its benchmark interest rate earlier in the cycle compared to previous expectations or potentially before the U.S. Federal Reserve makes significant moves. Interest Rate Differential: If India’s interest rates fall while U.S. rates remain steady or fall at a slower pace, the gap between returns offered in India versus the U.S. narrows. This makes holding Rupee-denominated assets less appealing to international investors compared to Dollar-denominated assets. Impact on Currency Value: Reduced demand for the Indian Rupee from foreign investors, coupled with potentially increased demand for the Dollar (as it offers relatively better returns or perceived safety), can lead to the Rupee weakening against the Dollar. A higher USD/INR forecast number means it takes more Rupees to buy one Dollar. Why Would the RBI Cut Rates Early? Central banks like the RBI typically consider several factors before adjusting interest rates. While UBS’s specific reasoning wasn’t fully detailed in the initial note, common drivers for early rate cuts can include: Cooling Inflation: If inflation shows a consistent downward trend and is projected to reach or stay within the central bank’s target range, it provides room to lower rates without risking price stability. Supporting Economic Growth: Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which can stimulate investment, spending, and overall economic activity. If growth shows signs of slowing, rate cuts can be used as a boost. Global Economic Conditions: Actions by other major central banks (like the Fed or the European Central Bank) and the global economic outlook can influence the RBI’s decisions to maintain competitiveness or respond to shifts in global capital flows. Fiscal Policy Coordination: Sometimes, monetary policy (interest rates) is coordinated with fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) to achieve broader economic goals. Understanding the Indian Rupee and Forex Market Dynamics The Forex market India , specifically the USD/INR pair, is influenced by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. Beyond interest rates, key elements include: Capital Flows: Foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) into and out of India significantly impact Rupee demand. Strong inflows strengthen the Rupee; outflows weaken it. Trade Balance: The difference between India’s exports and imports affects the supply and demand for the Rupee. A trade deficit (imports greater than exports) typically puts downward pressure on the currency. Oil Prices: India is a major importer of oil. Higher oil prices mean India needs more Dollars to pay for imports, increasing Dollar demand and potentially weakening the Rupee. Global Risk Sentiment: In times of global uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar, leading to depreciation in emerging market currencies like the Rupee. RBI Intervention: The RBI actively manages the Rupee’s volatility, buying or selling Dollars to prevent sharp movements that could harm the economy. UBS’s analysis places significant weight on the interest rate differential, suggesting it will become a primary driver for the Indian Rupee ‘s movement against the Dollar in the near to medium term. How Does UBS Analysis Fit into the Bigger Picture? UBS analysis is just one perspective in the diverse world of Forex forecasting. Different institutions and analysts will have varying views based on their economic models, data interpretation, and assumptions about future central bank actions and global events. However, a forecast from a major global bank like UBS carries weight and is closely watched by market participants. It’s important to remember that Forex forecasts are not guarantees. They are projections based on current information and expected future developments. Unexpected economic data, geopolitical events, or shifts in central bank communication can quickly alter the outlook. What Are the Potential Challenges and Opportunities? A weaker Indian Rupee , as suggested by the USD/INR forecast of 85, presents both challenges and opportunities for different segments of the economy and market participants. Challenges: Imports Become More Expensive: Businesses and consumers importing goods or raw materials will face higher costs in Rupee terms, potentially leading to imported inflation. Foreign Travel/Education Costs: Sending money abroad for education or funding foreign travel becomes more expensive. Servicing Dollar Debt: Indian companies or the government with outstanding debt denominated in US Dollars will find it more expensive to repay in Rupee terms. Opportunities: Exports Become More Competitive: Indian goods and services become cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially boosting export volumes and earnings for businesses. Boost for IT and Services Exports: The large Indian IT and services sector, which earns significant revenue in Dollars, benefits from converting those Dollars into more Rupees. Attracting Foreign Investment (Rupee Assets): While the interest rate differential might narrow, a potentially undervalued Rupee could attract investors looking for entry points into Indian assets, especially if they believe the depreciation is temporary or overdone. Actionable Insights for Navigating the USD/INR Movement Given the USD/INR forecast and the potential for volatility, what steps can businesses and investors consider? Monitor RBI Communications: Pay close attention to the RBI’s monetary policy statements, press conferences, and any forward guidance on inflation and growth outlooks. These provide clues about potential rate decisions. Track Inflation Data: Keep an eye on India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. A sustained drop in inflation increases the probability of rate cuts. Follow Global Central Banks: Monitor the actions and statements of major central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, as their policies impact the interest rate differential and global capital flows. Consider Hedging Strategies: Businesses with significant Dollar exposure (either receivables or payables) might consider hedging strategies using forwards, futures, or options to lock in exchange rates and mitigate currency risk. Diversify Portfolios: For investors, understanding currency risk is part of broader portfolio management. Diversification across asset classes and geographies can help manage this risk. Consult Financial Advisors: For specific financial situations, consulting with a qualified financial advisor who understands Forex markets and macroeconomic trends is advisable. This UBS analysis serves as a reminder that even in a world captivated by digital assets, the fundamentals of traditional finance, like central bank policy and currency dynamics in the Forex market India , continue to play a vital role in the global economic landscape. Summary: What Does This Mean for USD/INR? In essence, UBS is calling for a potential move towards 85 for the USD/INR forecast . This outlook is heavily predicated on their view that the Reserve Bank of India is likely to initiate interest rate cuts earlier than generally anticipated. Such a move would narrow the interest rate differential between India and the US, potentially reducing the attractiveness of Rupee-denominated assets and leading to a weaker Indian Rupee against the strong US Dollar. While this presents challenges like more expensive imports, it could also offer opportunities, particularly for Indian exporters. Navigating the Forex market India requires careful monitoring of central bank actions, economic data, and global sentiment, as highlighted by this significant UBS analysis .

This article dives into four standout names making headlines. Monero (XMR) is reclaiming attention as privacy concerns resurface. Binance Coin (BNB) stays relevant through steady ecosystem utility. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining due to speed-focused design. But the one grabbing major traction is BlockDAG. With fresh developments, a growing user base, and presale strength, it’s building momentum fast. For anyone following top movers and promising names, these are the highest potential cryptos in 2025 worth examining. Now, let’s break down the details. 1. BlockDAG: Utility Growth with Strong Presale Numbers BlockDAG is gaining attention across the crypto market as one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. It has already raised $294.5 million in presale funds and sold 22.3 billion BDAG coins. The project is in Batch 29, offering a low price of $0.0018 per coin. With its confirmed launch price set at $0.05, the estimated ROI sits at 2,660%. What sets BlockDAG apart is its large and engaged user base. The X1 Miner mobile app attracts 1.5 million daily users mining BDAG using smartphones. This platform offers benefits like zero gas fees, daily login rewards, and referral bonuses. Security remains a focus with a completed CertiK audit and strict audit processes. Partnerships are also making headlines. BlockDAG is linked with Inter Milan and hints at an NBA deal. With the GO LIVE reveal approaching, many are closely watching its next steps. Unlike others in early stages, BlockDAG is building a system that encourages everyday participation and provides long-term usability. All signs suggest it is one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. 2. Monero (XMR): The Comeback of a Privacy Leader Privacy continues to be a leading concern in 2025, helping Monero return to the list of highest potential cryptos in 2025. With digital monitoring increasing globally, Monero’s total focus on privacy makes it valuable again. This year, its price has risen near $165 from early-year lows of around $110. Behind this momentum is improved tech. The update to the Bulletproofs++ protocol has made transactions faster and less costly while keeping them secure. Unlike other privacy coins that fade, Monero keeps evolving and growing its base. Although mainstream traction is difficult due to regulation, XMR remains a reliable pick for those looking for privacy-based performance. It’s one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 for people wanting safer, private digital usage. 3. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and Simple Design Pay Off Kaspa has gained momentum because it focuses on speed. Priced at roughly $0.17, it’s getting noticed due to its blockDAG tech that lets multiple blocks be confirmed every second. It’s not overloaded with features; it focuses purely on being fast and efficient, and that focus is paying off. Its market cap has now exceeded $4 billion, with active trading volumes and increasing miner interest. Kaspa’s structure allows anyone to use or support it without deep tech knowledge. There’s no need for special steps or holding certain assets. With a low inflation rate and a clear development plan, it stands out. The team avoids hype and focuses on reliability. With this approach, it’s seen as one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Those who want usability with real-time advantages are turning to Kaspa. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Stability Through Ongoing Use BNB doesn’t rely on newness or sudden popularity; it remains strong due to long-standing usage. This year, it holds a spot among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Trading at about $638, BNB powers a wide range of functions, including fee discounts, DeFi apps, and NFT tools within the Binance network. One reason BNB holds steady is supply control. A recent quarterly burn took 1.6 million BNB out of circulation, easing price pressure during dips. The coin is also expanding into tech tools like AI-driven trading and business-facing blockchain support. Despite stricter rules in some countries, Binance’s wide reach keeps BNB relevant. Instead of hype-driven spikes, it offers ongoing use and liquidity, making it a solid pick among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Summing Up! By mid-2025, choosing the highest potential cryptos in 2025 means looking at use cases, community, and reliability. BlockDAG stands out for its massive presale progress, real app usage, and active user rewards. Monero keeps serving as a reliable privacy solution. Kaspa wins with fast, simple blockchain action, and BNB remains useful through every market phase. Together, they each offer something different, whether it’s mobile participation, private transactions, ultra-fast proof-of-work, or full ecosystem access. If you’re keeping tabs on the highest potential cryptos in 2025 , this group delivers a strong blend of ongoing use, performance, and steady growth.

This wallet purchased a considerable amount of ETH , specifically 17,864 Ether tokens, valued at approximately $49.6 million at the time of the transactions. The acquisition occurred within a 24-hour period and was facilitated through Galaxy Digital ‘s over-the-counter (OTC) desk, according to on-chain data shared by analytics firm The Data Nerd on X. Understanding the Consensys Connection and Wallet Activity While the report links the wallet to Consensys , it is important to note that large organizations often manage multiple wallets for various purposes, including operational needs, investments, and treasury management. Consensys is a leading force in the Ethereum space, known for developing essential infrastructure and applications like MetaMask, Infura, and development tools for developers building on Ethereum . A significant ETH acquisition by a wallet tied to such a prominent player naturally attracts attention from the crypto community, suggesting strategic positioning or investment. The Role of Galaxy Digital in OTC Trading This large transaction wasn’t executed on a public cryptocurrency exchange but through Galaxy Digital ‘s OTC trading desk. OTC trading involves direct, private transactions between two parties, bypassing the public order books of exchanges. This method is particularly favored by institutional investors and large-volume traders for several key reasons: Minimal Price Impact: Executing a trade of nearly $50 million on a public exchange could significantly move the market price. OTC trading allows the buyer and seller to agree on a price without causing volatility on open markets. Privacy: The details of the trade, including the parties involved and the exact timing, are not immediately visible to the wider market, unlike transactions on public exchanges. Customization: OTC desks can facilitate complex or very large trades that might be difficult to execute efficiently on standard exchanges. Liquidity: For large blocks of assets like ETH , OTC desks can source liquidity that might not be readily available on a single exchange at the desired price. Galaxy Digital is a well-established financial services firm in the digital asset space, providing services that include trading, asset management, and investment banking specifically tailored for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Their OTC trading desk is a key part of their offering for institutional and high-net-worth clients looking to execute large trades discreetly and efficiently. Details of the ETH Acquisition and Wallet Holdings The reported acquisition of 17,864 ETH marks a significant inflow into the wallet. Following this purchase, the wallet’s reported holdings, according to The Data Nerd’s analysis, include a substantial amount of liquid staked ETH (lsETH) and native ETH . lsETH Holdings: The wallet reportedly holds 71,671 lsETH, currently valued at approximately $215.9 million. lsETH is a liquid staking token, commonly representing staked ETH , allowing holders to earn staking rewards while keeping their assets liquid and usable in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Lido Staked ETH (stETH) is a prominent example of such a token, often referred to generally as lsETH. Native ETH Holdings: In addition to lsETH, the wallet also holds 6,786 native ETH tokens, valued at about $18.9 million. The combination of a large recent ETH purchase and existing significant lsETH holdings suggests a strategy focused on both accumulating Ethereum and participating in staking to earn yield, while maintaining flexibility through liquid staking derivatives. What Does This Signal for Ethereum and the Market? A large acquisition of ETH by an entity potentially linked to Consensys via an institutional player like Galaxy Digital sends several potential signals to the market: Confidence in Ethereum: It suggests continued strong conviction in the long-term value and potential of the Ethereum network and its native asset, ETH , from major ecosystem participants. Institutional Activity: The use of Galaxy Digital ‘s OTC trading desk underscores the increasing role of institutional infrastructure and services in facilitating large cryptocurrency trades. Staking as a Strategy: The significant lsETH holdings, alongside the native ETH purchase, highlight that staking and utilizing liquid staking tokens are integral parts of asset management strategies for large holders. Potential Future Activity: Such large inflows could precede further strategic moves within the Ethereum ecosystem, whether related to staking, DeFi participation, or other initiatives. While one transaction doesn’t define the entire market trend, large, discreet moves by significant players like those potentially linked to Consensys and facilitated by firms like Galaxy Digital through OTC trading are closely watched indicators of underlying sentiment and strategy within the crypto space. Conclusion: A Strategic Move in the Ethereum Landscape The reported acquisition of nearly $50 million in ETH by a wallet associated with Consensys via Galaxy Digital ‘s OTC trading desk is a notable event. It signifies continued strong interest and investment in Ethereum from key industry players. The strategic choice of the OTC trading route emphasizes the importance of discretion and efficiency for large-volume transactions. Furthermore, the wallet’s existing substantial holdings in liquid staked ETH highlight the growing adoption of staking as a core component of asset management strategies in the Ethereum ecosystem. This transaction serves as a compelling example of how major entities are navigating the digital asset market, utilizing specialized services like those offered by Galaxy Digital to execute significant, strategic positions in assets like ETH .

While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, a quiet revolution has been happening in the background, led by stablecoins . According to Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise , these seemingly simple tokens are much more than just a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market. He argues they are, in fact, crypto’s “second killer app,” right after Bitcoin itself. This is a powerful statement, coming from a leader at a major asset management firm focused on cryptocurrency investment . It signals a growing recognition of stablecoins’ fundamental importance and their potential to drive significant value within the crypto ecosystem. Why Does Bitwise See Stablecoins as a ‘Killer App’? Matt Hougan’s perspective, as reported by The Block, is grounded in two key observations about stablecoins : Explosive Growth in Assets Under Management (AUM): The total value of stablecoins in circulation has soared into the tens of billions, and at times, hundreds of billions of dollars. This isn’t just theoretical value; it represents real capital being held and moved using these tokens. This massive adoption is a clear indicator of their utility and demand. Robust Revenue Model: Many major stablecoin issuers hold reserves, often including short-term U.S. Treasuries. As interest rates have risen, the yield generated from these reserves has become a significant source of revenue for the issuers. This creates a sustainable business model, adding another layer of financial legitimacy and value to the stablecoin infrastructure. Hougan’s view emphasizes that value in the crypto space isn’t limited to just protocol-level innovations like Bitcoin’s blockchain. Value also accrues at the application layer, where stablecoins provide a crucial function: a stable medium of exchange and store of value within a volatile environment. He believes capturing the long-term potential of digital assets requires exposure to both these infrastructure and application layers. What Exactly Are Stablecoins and How Do They Work? Before diving deeper into their impact and investment implications, let’s quickly recap what stablecoins are. In essence, they are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, but sometimes to other assets like gold or even algorithms. The most common types of stablecoins include: Fiat-Collateralized: Backed 1:1 by reserves of traditional currency (like USD), cash equivalents, or short-term debt (like U.S. Treasuries). Examples: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC). This is the model Bitwise highlights regarding the revenue generation from reserves. Crypto-Collateralized: Backed by other cryptocurrencies, often in an overcollateralized manner to absorb price volatility. Example: Dai (DAI). Algorithmic: Do not use direct asset collateral but rely on algorithms and smart contracts to manage supply and maintain the peg. (Note: This model has faced significant challenges and failures in the past). Their core function is to provide stability, allowing users to transact, save, or participate in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) without being constantly exposed to the wild price swings characteristic of assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The Growing Use Cases: Beyond Just Trading While initially popular among traders looking to quickly move in and out of volatile positions without converting back to fiat, the use cases for stablecoins have expanded dramatically: Global Payments and Remittances: Sending value across borders quickly and cheaply, bypassing traditional banking rails. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Providing liquidity, lending, borrowing, and yield farming within decentralized protocols. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of many DeFi applications. Earn Yield: Users can earn interest on stablecoin holdings through various platforms, sometimes offering rates higher than traditional savings accounts, driven partly by the reserve yields mentioned by Bitwise . E-commerce and Commerce: Enabling businesses and consumers to transact using digital currencies while avoiding volatility risk. Bridge to Digital Assets: Serving as the primary on-ramp for many users entering the crypto space from traditional finance. This expanding utility is a key reason why firms like Bitwise are paying close attention. Stablecoins aren’t just a niche trading tool; they are becoming foundational infrastructure for a new digital economy. Challenges and Regulatory Landscape for Stablecoins Despite their growth and utility, stablecoins face significant challenges, particularly regarding regulation. Regulators globally are scrutinizing stablecoins due to concerns about: Financial Stability: The potential impact of a large stablecoin failure on the broader financial system. Consumer Protection: Ensuring stablecoin reserves are truly held and transparently managed. Illicit Finance: Preventing stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Different jurisdictions are proposing or implementing various regulatory frameworks, ranging from treating issuers like banks to requiring strict reserve requirements and audits. The regulatory future remains uncertain, which poses a challenge for widespread adoption and innovation. Furthermore, challenges include maintaining the ‘peg’ during times of market stress and addressing centralization concerns for issuer-controlled stablecoins. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment? If stablecoins are indeed the ‘second killer app’ as suggested by the Bitwise CIO, how might this influence cryptocurrency investment strategies? Hougan’s point about value accruing at both infrastructure and application layers suggests that investors shouldn’t solely focus on volatile protocol tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Exposure to the stablecoin ecosystem could become increasingly important. This doesn’t necessarily mean just holding stablecoins (though earning yield on them is an option), but also potentially investing in: Companies Issuing Stablecoins: Publicly traded companies or investment opportunities related to the major stablecoin issuers (where available and appropriate). Protocols and Platforms Utilizing Stablecoins: Investing in DeFi protocols, lending platforms, or payment networks that heavily rely on stablecoins for their operations and growth. Infrastructure Providers: Companies building the technology and services that support the stablecoin ecosystem (e.g., custodians, auditors, compliance tools). Funds or Products Offering Stablecoin Exposure: Exploring investment products from firms like Bitwise or others that might offer structured exposure to stablecoin-related revenues or growth. The recognition by institutional figures like Matt Hougan underscores the maturing nature of the digital assets market. It highlights that innovation and opportunity exist beyond the speculative price movements of headline cryptocurrencies. Is This a Turning Point for Digital Assets? The growing acceptance and utility of stablecoins are arguably helping to bridge the gap between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital economy. By providing stability, they make digital assets more accessible and practical for everyday transactions and institutional use cases that require predictable value. As the regulatory landscape becomes clearer (though this may take time), and as technology improves, the infrastructure provided by stablecoins is likely to become even more integrated into global finance and commerce. This evolution supports the view that crypto is not just a speculative asset class but a technological shift with profound implications for how we transfer and store value. Conclusion: Stablecoins’ Pivotal Role in the Crypto Future Matt Hougan’s assertion that stablecoins are crypto’s ‘second killer app’ is a powerful validation of their critical role. Their impressive growth in AUM and their emerging, robust revenue models driven by traditional finance instruments like U.S. Treasuries highlight their increasing significance. They provide the essential stability needed for the wider adoption of digital assets , powering everything from global payments to the complex world of DeFi. While challenges, particularly regulatory ones, remain, the fundamental utility and expanding use cases of stablecoins position them as a foundational element of the future crypto and cryptocurrency investment landscape. As Bitwise points out, understanding and potentially gaining exposure to this layer of the ecosystem is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the long-term potential of this transformative technology.

According to the company press briefing, they are awaiting approval from the NYDFS. Paypal plans to upgrade its Stablecoin for real-world payments, commerce, and micro-financing by leveraging the Stellar network speed, low transactional costs, and ease of integration. Stellar has been designed for speed, low-cost payments, and real-world utility. Chris believes the blockchain technology firm will unlock an additional option to the already existing expansion in Ethereum and Solana. Paypal plans to introduce payment financing (PayFi) for small businesses Paypal users will benefit from Stellar’s network infrastructure, which spans 170 countries and has multiple on and off ramps, digital wallets, and integration with local fiat currencies and banking systems. According to the company’s press release , this is ideal for PayPal’s goal of reaching a broader group of developers and opening more opportunities. The target audience is the emerging markets where traditional financial systems can be slow, expensive, or inaccessible. PYUSD is coming to @StellarOrg , reaching a broader group of developers and unlocking new opportunities for the stablecoin. More blockchains, greater access – and we’re not stopping now. pic.twitter.com/DDfpb9JBzM — Alex Chriss (@acce) June 11, 2025 The partnership will also introduce the Payment Financing model ( PayFi ), enabling small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that face delayed receivables or prefunding requirements to access real-time working capital in loans directly in PYUSD to their Stellar wallets. Companies can use these funds to settle suppliers, manage inventory, and cover other expenses with the added advantage of instant settlement and transparency. Liquidity providers have been allowed to participate in the financing options and earn returns from real-world activities in addition to speculative trading. May Zabaneh, Vice President of PayPal’s Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Digital Currency Group, said stablecoins have long been viewed as crypto killer apps because they combine the power of blockchain with the stability of fiat currencies. He believes that working with Stellar will advance the use of this technology and provide benefits for all users in the key area of cross-border payments. NYDFS delay risks giving PYUSD a bad head start Danelle Dixon, CEO of Stellar Development Foundation, reiterated that Stellar is the network for fast, low-cost, and trusted global payments at scale. He added that bringing PYUSD to over 170 countries would transform stablecoins into practical financial tools that millions of everyday users and merchants can use. He affirmed that the partnership aims to bring stable digital currency to small businesses and individuals in emerging markets all over the globe. Paypal has recently partnered with Gebuana Lhuillier (Philippines) and Yellow Card (Africa) to bypass banking systems, which have access to 3,500 and 25,000 touchpoints, respectively. Analysts believe these partnerships could push PayPal into a remittance choice by cutting fees up to 80% compared to competitors like Western Union and MoneyGram. PYUSD , however, faces challenges such as a crypto reputation for Scams, hacks, and market crashes, which may deter investor confidence. The NYDFS approval may delay the process, citing money laundering and consumer protection concerns. Stellar’s decentralized nature lacks the centralized control that banks and regulators prefer. Also, PYUSD holders on the exchange may face price volatility if redemption partners fail to buy back their tokens. PYUSD faces competition from Circle’s USDC, backed by Goldman Sachs, which already dominates stablecoin markets with $50 billion in circulation. Analysts say that with the pending approval from NYDFS, PYUSD may face a hard head start in competing with giants like USDC and USDT, which already have a competitive edge in the market. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money on CNBC, said this is a high-risk, high-reward bet. If the NYFDS approves and SMEs flock to PayFi, PayPal stock could soar, but if it stumbles on regulation or adoption, it would render PYUSD a costly disaster.

This lawsuit, involving major entertainment powerhouses and a leading generative AI platform, highlights critical questions about digital rights and the future of creativity. For those in the cryptocurrency space, who understand the complexities of decentralized technology and evolving legal frameworks, this case underscores the broader challenges of intellectual property in the digital age. What is the Core of the Midjourney Lawsuit ? At the heart of the matter is a lawsuit filed by Disney and Universal against the generative artificial intelligence platform, Midjourney. The core allegation is that Midjourney used copyrighted content belonging to these studios without permission to train its AI models. These models are capable of generating and editing images, and the studios claim this training involved unauthorized access and use of their extensive libraries of characters and creative works. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, isn’t just about the training data itself. It also points to the output generated by Midjourney. The studios assert that users of the platform can generate images that clearly depict their copyrighted characters, such as the iconic Homer Simpson or the formidable Darth Vader. Dozens of such examples were reportedly included in the court filing to support their claim of infringement. The filing indicates that Disney and Universal had previously contacted Midjourney regarding their concerns and requested that the alleged intellectual property violations cease. The lawsuit was filed after these earlier requests were reportedly ignored. Why is AI Copyright Such a Contentious Issue? The lawsuit brings the complex issue of AI copyright directly into the spotlight. One of the major challenges for developers of large AI models, particularly those trained on vast datasets scraped from the internet, is navigating existing copyright law. Tech companies, including those developing generative AI , have often argued for legal interpretations that would allow them to train on publicly available works, even if copyrighted, without needing explicit permission from every creator or compensating them individually. Their argument often centers on the idea that this training is akin to a human learning process or falls under fair use doctrines. However, content creators and copyright holders, like Disney and Universal, argue that using their protected works to build commercial products (the AI models and the services they power) constitutes unauthorized use and diminishes the value of their original creations. They contend that the output generated by these AI models can directly compete with or substitute for works created by human artists, writers, and other professionals, thereby harming the creative industries. Key points in the AI copyright debate include: Training Data: Is using copyrighted material for training AI models a fair use or infringement? Output: Is the output generated by AI, particularly if it resembles existing copyrighted works, a derivative work that infringes on the original? Attribution and Compensation: Should AI companies be required to attribute the original works used in training or compensate the creators? Authorship: Can an AI be considered an author, or is the human user the author, or is it the AI developer? These questions are currently being debated in courts and legislatures globally, making the outcome of cases like the Disney/Universal vs. Midjourney lawsuit potentially precedent-setting. What Does This Mean for the Entertainment Industry ? The entertainment industry , while being a plaintiff in this case, also has a complex relationship with generative AI . While studios are protective of their existing intellectual property , some have also begun experimenting with AI technologies themselves, albeit often in limited or controlled ways. This includes using AI for tasks like visual effects, animation assistance, script analysis, or even generating concept art. The lawsuit highlights the industry’s primary concern: protecting its vast library of valuable characters, stories, and visual assets. These assets are the foundation of their business models, driving everything from films and TV shows to theme parks and merchandise. Allowing AI platforms to freely use and potentially replicate these assets without control or compensation poses an existential threat to their traditional revenue streams and creative control. Conversely, the industry is also looking for ways to leverage AI to reduce costs and increase efficiency. This creates a tension between wanting to harness the power of AI and needing to protect the very content that makes their business valuable. The outcome of this lawsuit could significantly influence how the entertainment industry approaches the adoption and regulation of AI technologies in the future. Seeking Remedies for Intellectual Property Violations In their lawsuit, Disney and Universal are not merely seeking a declaration that Midjourney infringed their rights. They are pursuing concrete remedies to address the alleged harm caused by the unauthorized use of their intellectual property . The key demands outlined in their filing include: Monetary Damages: The studios are seeking financial compensation for the damages they claim to have suffered as a result of Midjourney’s alleged infringement. This could include actual damages based on lost profits or statutory damages for each instance of infringement. Jury Trial: The plaintiffs have requested a jury trial, allowing a panel of citizens to hear the evidence and decide on the facts of the case and the extent of liability. Injunction: A crucial demand is an order from the court (an injunction) that would bar Midjourney from continuing to engage in the alleged copyright infringement. This could potentially require Midjourney to alter its training data, modify its models, or implement filters to prevent the generation of infringing content. These demands reflect the studios’ intent to not only be compensated for past alleged harms but also to prevent future violations of their rights by Midjourney. The request for an injunction, in particular, could have significant technical and operational implications for Midjourney’s platform. What’s Next in the Legal Battle? As of the initial report, Midjourney had not immediately responded to requests for comment regarding the lawsuit. The legal process will involve Midjourney filing a response to the complaint, potentially arguing defenses such as fair use, lack of substantial similarity in output, or issues with the studios’ claims regarding the training data. The case will then likely proceed through discovery, where both sides exchange evidence, followed by potential motions, settlement discussions, and ultimately, if no settlement is reached, a trial. The outcome of this case is being closely watched by the entire tech and creative ecosystem. It will likely help shape the legal precedents regarding the use of copyrighted material in AI training and the responsibility of AI platforms for the output they generate. For anyone interested in the future of digital rights, the intersection of technology and law, and the protection of creative works in the age of AI, this lawsuit represents a pivotal moment. This legal challenge underscores the ongoing tension between rapid technological advancement and established legal frameworks designed to protect creators. How courts interpret existing laws in the context of sophisticated generative AI will have lasting consequences for innovation, creativity, and the future of various industries, including entertainment and potentially other sectors dealing with valuable digital assets.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its Thursday business day, ETH is trading at $2,770. ETH is up almost 11% this month, according to CoinDesk market data, outperforming BTC, which rose 5%. Part of this could be because of institutional trading demand, and the fact that it's overtaken BTC in derivatives markets as sophisticated investors increasingly bet on ETH’s structural growth and role as a gateway between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi), OKX Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Ethereum is overshadowing BTC on our perpetual futures market, with ETH accounting for 45.2% of trading volume over the past week. BTC, by comparison, sits at 38.1%,"" Lai said. This is a similar finding to what's occurring on Derebit , CoinDesk recently reported. That's not to say that institutions have taken a disinterest in BTC. Far from it. A recent report from Glassnode shows that despite BTC's recent volatility , institutions are happily buying up the dips. Long-term holders (LTHs) realized over $930 million in profits per day during recent rallies, Glassnode wrote, rivaling distribution levels seen at previous cycle peaks. Yet, instead of triggering a cascade of selling, the LTH supply actually grew. “This dynamic highlights that maturation and accumulation pressures are outweighing distribution behavior,” Glassnode analysts wrote, noting that this is “highly atypical for late-stage bull markets.” Neither, however, are immune to geopolitical risk or black swan events like the Trump-Musk blowout. These episodes serve as reminders that sentiment can shift quickly, even in structurally strong markets. But beneath the surface-level volatility, institutional conviction remains intact. ETH is emerging as the vehicle of choice for accessing regulated DeFi, while BTC continues to benefit from long-term accumulation by institutions via ETFs. ""Macro uncertainties remain, but $3,000 ETH looks increasingly likely,” Lai concluded. Tron Continues to Win Stablecoin Inflow The stablecoin market just hit an all-time high of $228 billion, up 17% year-to-date, according to a new CryptoQuant report. That surge in dollar-pegged liquidity, driven by renewed investor confidence showcased by the blockbuster Circle IPO , rising DeFi yields, and improving U.S. regulatory clarity, is quietly redrawing the map of where capital lives on-chain . ""The amount of stablecoins on centralized exchanges has also reached record high levels, supporting crypto trading liquidity,"" CryptoQuant reported. CryptoQuant noted that the total value of ERC20 stablecoins on centralized exchanges has climbed to a record $50 billion. Most of this growth in exchange stablecoin reserves has been a result of the increase in USDC reserves on exchanges, per their data, which have grown by 1.6x so far in 2025 to $8 billion. As far as protocols that have been a net beneficiary of all of this, Tron leads the pack. Tron's blend of fast finality and deep integrations with stablecoin issuers like Tether is credited with making it a liquidity magnet Presto Research, which recently released a similarly themed report, wrote that it notched over $6 billion in net stablecoin inflows in May, topping all other chains and posting the second-highest number of daily active users behind Solana and was the top performer in native total value locked (TVL) growth. By contrast, Ethereum and Solana bled capital, Presto's data said. Both chains experienced significant stablecoin outflows and bridge volume losses, indicating a lack of new yield opportunities or major protocol upgrades. Presto’s data confirms a broader trend: institutional and retail capital alike are rotating toward Base, Solana, and Tron. The commonality? These chains offer faster execution, more dynamic ecosystems, and in some cases, bigger incentive programs Agent Economies Are Coming, but They Need Crypto Rails to Work The next generation of AI won’t just talk to us, it’ll talk to itself. As autonomous agents grow more capable, they'll increasingly handle tasks end-to-end: booking flights, sourcing data, even commissioning other bots to complete subtasks. But there’s a problem: right now, these AI agents are trapped in silos and they need crypto to get them out. In a recent a16z Crypto essay , Scott Duke Kominers, a Research Partner at a16z Crypto and a Faculty Affiliate at Harvard, argues that today’s agent-to-agent interactions are mostly hardcoded API calls or internal features within closed ecosystems. There’s no shared infrastructure for agents to find each other, collaborate, or transact across systems. That’s where crypto comes in. Blockchains, with their open, composable architectures, offer a “forwards-compatible” way to build interoperable agent economies, a neutral substrate that can evolve alongside AI itself. Early projects like Halliday are building protocol-level standards for cross-agent workflows, while firms like Catena and Skyfire are using crypto to enable autonomous agents to pay each other without a human being needed. Coinbase has even stepped in to support infrastructure efforts here. If these rails take hold, blockchains won’t just be financial infrastructure; they’ll be the back-end of an open AI economy, where agents transact, coordinate, and enforce user intent transparently. The message is clear: if AI agents are the future of productivity, crypto is the infrastructure that makes them play nice. Web3 Gaming Needs Better Games to Grow Gaming maintains its lead as the dominant category in the distributed app (dAPP) ecosystem, even as its market share continues to slip, according to a new report from DappRadar . The latest data from DappRadar shows gaming’s dominance fell for the second consecutive month, from 21% in April to 19.4% in May. Daily user activity remains relatively stable, hovering around 4.9 million unique active wallets, yet the sharp decline in investment paints a more troubling picture: venture funding for gaming projects plummeted to just $9 million in May, down sharply from over $220 million monthly at the end of 2024. ""2025 so far, has been a reality check for the gaming market. Various projects that raised millions in the previous years, have now closed shop. Among them, the hero shooter Nyan Heroes, the fantasy MMORPG Ember Sword, and social deduction game The Mystery Society,"" DappRadar analysts wrote in their report. DappRadar analysts point to a fundamental flaw driving this exodus: a lack of engaging gameplay. Projects frequently prioritized tokenomics, speculative NFT launches, and marketing blitzes, often sidelining critical gameplay testing and development. Without fun and replayable mechanics at their core, even heavily funded Web3 games have struggled to maintain player interest, suggesting that the industry's biggest challenge might simply be learning how to build great games. And this narrative is nothing new: surveys have been saying this since 2022. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin slid 2% after failing to hold the $110K level, with price testing key support at $108.5K amid rising geopolitical tensions and mixed sentiment, though strong institutional inflows via spot ETFs suggest underlying demand remains intact. ETH: ETH jumped 5% to break past $2,800 as $815M in institutional inflows poured into ETH ETFs, driven by bullish technicals, record staking levels, and fresh SEC guidance clarifying staking and wallet software fall outside securities laws Gold: Gold rose 0.97% to $3,363 after U.S. inflation data showed cooling prices, boosting expectations that the Fed could resume rate cuts in September.

This latest purchase adds 50 BTC to their reserves, bringing their total holdings to approximately 925 BTC. This action underscores a growing trend of Corporate BTC Holdings among diverse businesses, even in regulated markets like Japan. Why are Japanese Companies Turning to Bitcoin? The decision by a Japanese Company Bitcoin strategy like Remixpoint’s isn’t happening in a vacuum. While the initial news from Bitcoin Magazine on X was brief, it points to a broader shift. Several factors could be influencing companies in Japan and globally to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, especially in uncertain economic times. Store of Value: Like gold, Bitcoin is viewed by some as a digital store of value that can preserve capital over the long term. Potential Appreciation: Companies may see Bitcoin as an asset with significant growth potential, offering better returns than traditional low-yield investments. Diversification: Holding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional financial assets. Industry Trend: Following the lead of major players like MicroStrategy or Tesla can signal forward-thinking and adaptability to new financial paradigms. For Japan Bitcoin adoption within the corporate sector, regulatory clarity, while strict, might also play a role. Companies operating within well-defined legal frameworks might feel more comfortable holding volatile assets like Bitcoin compared to regions with ambiguous rules. Breaking Down the Remixpoint Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint, primarily known for its energy and electric services, also operates in other sectors, including financial services through its subsidiary, BITPoint Japan, a licensed cryptocurrency exchange. This gives Remixpoint a unique perspective and potential synergy when it comes to digital assets. Their increasing Corporate BTC Holdings suggest a deliberate strategy, possibly linked to their involvement in the crypto space. Their recent Bitcoin Acquisition of 50 BTC builds upon their existing significant reserves. Holding 925 BTC places them among companies with substantial crypto treasuries. This isn’t a small speculative bet; it represents a meaningful allocation of company capital into the digital asset space. What Does This Mean for Corporate BTC Holdings Globally? Remixpoint’s move adds another data point to the global trend of companies exploring or actively accumulating Bitcoin. While the trend saw significant momentum in 2020-2021, acquisitions have continued, albeit perhaps at a slower pace or by different types of companies. A Japanese Company Bitcoin purchase of this size from a listed firm reinforces that the interest isn’t limited to tech giants or dedicated crypto firms. This continued adoption by entities like Remixpoint could signal: Increased institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability. A growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. Potential inspiration for other companies in Japan and Asia to consider similar strategies. While the benefits are clear – potential for high returns and asset diversification – challenges exist. The volatility of Bitcoin’s price is a primary concern, potentially impacting a company’s balance sheet and earnings reports. Regulatory changes and accounting standards for digital assets also present complexities. Actionable Insight: Observing Corporate Moves For investors, tracking Corporate BTC Holdings provides insight into institutional sentiment. When companies like Remixpoint make a substantial Bitcoin Acquisition , it can be interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating belief in Bitcoin’s future value proposition. It also highlights that demand for Bitcoin is coming from various sectors, not just retail investors. While a single purchase by a Japanese Company Bitcoin holder like Remixpoint might not drastically move the market, the cumulative effect of many companies adopting this strategy can contribute to increased demand and potentially influence price over time. It’s a trend worth monitoring for anyone interested in the institutionalization of Bitcoin. Conclusion: Remixpoint’s Growing Commitment to Bitcoin Remixpoint’s decision to acquire another 50 BTC, boosting their total to 925 BTC, is a clear statement of their commitment to holding the digital asset. This action aligns with the broader global trend of companies exploring and increasing their Corporate BTC Holdings . As a prominent Japanese Company Bitcoin holder, Remixpoint’s strategy reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value and growth asset. Their repeated Bitcoin Acquisition demonstrates a long-term view on the cryptocurrency, positioning them among firms integrating digital assets into their financial planning. This development is a notable event for the Japan Bitcoin landscape and the wider corporate adoption narrative.

This initiative, valued at an impressive $100 million, is designed to act as a financial safety net for users, offering potential compensation in the unfortunate events of major security breaches, system vulnerabilities, or hacks affecting the platform. For anyone navigating the often-unpredictable world of crypto, this kind of commitment to crypto user protection is certainly noteworthy. What Exactly Does the MEXC User Protection Fund Cover? So, what does this $100 million fund actually mean for you as a user? At its core, the MEXC user protection fund is a dedicated reserve of assets. According to reports, this fund is specifically earmarked to compensate users who suffer losses directly due to severe security incidents on the exchange’s side. This includes: Major Security Breaches: External attacks that compromise platform integrity and user assets. System Vulnerabilities: Exploitable flaws within MEXC’s own infrastructure. Hacks: Unauthorized access leading to the potential loss of user funds. One key aspect highlighted is the transparency surrounding this fund. MEXC plans to make the wallet addresses holding the fund publicly available, allowing users and the wider community to monitor the fund’s balance in real-time. This level of openness regarding a user protection fund is a positive step towards building confidence in the crypto space. Why is Robust Crypto User Protection Absolutely Crucial? The cryptocurrency market, while offering exciting opportunities, also comes with inherent risks. News of exchange hacks, phishing scams, and platform failures are unfortunately not uncommon. When you deposit your valuable digital assets onto a centralized exchange, you are entrusting that platform with their security. This is why robust crypto user protection is not just a feature; it’s a fundamental requirement for any trustworthy exchange. Users need assurance that the platform they choose is taking every possible measure to safeguard their investments. While preventative security measures are the first line of defense, having a dedicated fund in place provides an extra layer of security, offering recourse if preventative measures somehow fail against sophisticated threats. It signals that the exchange is prepared for potential downsides and is committed to mitigating user losses when platform-level issues occur. Boosting Cryptocurrency Exchange Security: A Multi-Layered Approach Effective cryptocurrency exchange security relies on multiple layers. This includes stringent internal security protocols like cold storage for the majority of assets, multi-signature wallets, regular security audits, robust firewalls, and sophisticated monitoring systems to detect suspicious activity. However, even with the best preventative measures, the risk of a security incident cannot be entirely eliminated in a constantly evolving threat landscape. This is where a dedicated fund for user protection becomes a vital component of overall cryptocurrency exchange security . It represents a proactive financial measure to complement the technical security infrastructure. By setting aside a significant amount like $100 million, MEXC is demonstrating a commitment to not only preventing incidents but also to mitigating the financial impact on users if an incident were to occur. This trend of exchanges establishing such funds reflects a maturing industry that is increasingly prioritizing user welfare and platform resilience. The Impact of MEXC Security Measures on User Confidence For users choosing where to trade and store their digital assets, security is often the top priority. The introduction of a large MEXC user protection fund directly addresses this concern. It enhances the overall perception of MEXC security , providing potential and existing users with greater peace of mind. Knowing that the exchange has a substantial financial buffer specifically allocated for compensating users in the event of platform-wide security failures can significantly boost confidence. It differentiates MEXC as an exchange that is taking tangible steps to back its security claims with financial resources. This move is likely to be viewed positively by users who are increasingly aware of the risks associated with centralized platforms and value exchanges that prioritize their safety. Understanding the User Protection Fund Details and Transparency The devil is often in the details, and while the initial announcement provides the headline figure and purpose, the transparency aspect is particularly important for any user protection fund . MEXC’s plan to publish the fund’s wallet addresses and allow real-time monitoring is a commendable step towards accountability. This transparency allows users to verify that the fund is adequately capitalized as promised. While the exact process for claiming compensation from the fund in the event of an incident would likely involve specific procedures (e.g., verification of losses, investigation into the cause), the public availability of the fund’s balance is a strong indicator of commitment. Users should, however, always understand the terms and conditions associated with such funds, as eligibility criteria and claim processes can vary. Setting a Precedent? The Future of User Protection Funds MEXC’s $100 million commitment could potentially set a higher standard for user protection fund sizes within the industry. As the crypto market continues to grow and attract more participants, the responsibility of exchanges to safeguard user assets becomes even more critical. Initiatives like this signal a positive direction, where exchanges are willing to invest significant resources into mitigating the financial risks for their users. This development could encourage other exchanges to review and potentially enhance their own user protection measures, whether through dedicated funds, insurance policies, or other mechanisms. Ultimately, stronger cryptocurrency exchange security across the board benefits the entire ecosystem, fostering greater trust and stability, which is essential for mainstream adoption. Conclusion: A Significant Step for Crypto User Protection The launch of MEXC’s $100 million MEXC user protection fund is a significant development for the platform and a positive signal for the wider crypto community. By establishing this substantial financial safety net, MEXC is reinforcing its commitment to crypto user protection and enhancing its overall MEXC security posture. The transparency regarding the fund’s balance through public wallet addresses further strengthens trust. While no security measure can offer absolute guarantees in the dynamic digital asset landscape, a dedicated user protection fund like this provides a crucial layer of financial security, offering users potential recourse in the face of unforeseen platform-level incidents. This move contributes to boosting overall cryptocurrency exchange security standards and reflects a growing maturity in the industry’s approach to safeguarding user assets.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance , is expanding its offerings, bringing exciting new opportunities to the derivatives market. If you’re involved in crypto leverage trading , this announcement is specifically for you. Binance recently revealed on its official website that it will list TAIKO (TAIKO) and SQD (SQD) perpetual contracts. This means you’ll soon be able to trade the price movements of these tokens with significant leverage. What’s Happening with Binance and TAIKO/SQD? Here’s a quick breakdown of the key details announced by Binance: Contracts: TAIKO/USDT and SQD/USDT perpetual futures Launch Date: June 11, 2024 Maximum Leverage: Up to 50x Availability: Both TAIKO and SQD tokens are already listed on the Binance Alpha Market (presumably referring to the spot market or a specific section for newer listings). This move by Binance signals their continued commitment to providing a wide range of trading instruments for various cryptocurrencies. The inclusion of TAIKO and SQD in the perpetual futures lineup suggests growing interest and liquidity around these specific tokens. Understanding Perpetual Futures and Crypto Leverage Trading For those new to the concept, perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. Crypto leverage trading amplifies your potential gains (and losses) by allowing you to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. The 50x leverage offered on these new Binance contracts means that for every $1 of your own capital, you can control a position worth $50. Example: If you use 50x leverage and the asset price moves up by just 1%, your position’s value increases by 50%. Conversely, if it moves down by 1%, your position decreases by 50%, potentially leading to liquidation if you don’t have sufficient margin. Why TAIKO and SQD? While the announcement focuses on the trading mechanism, it’s worth briefly considering the assets themselves. TAIKO is associated with a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aiming to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. SQD is the native token of Squid, a cross-chain liquidity network. Both projects operate in significant areas of the blockchain ecosystem – scaling and interoperability – which could contribute to trader interest. Listing perpetual futures for these specific tokens on Binance provides traders with a new avenue to gain exposure to their potential price movements, either long (betting on price increase) or short (betting on price decrease). Benefits and Challenges of Trading TAIKO/SQD Perpetual Futures Trading these new contracts on Binance comes with potential upsides and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Amplified Profits: 50x leverage can lead to substantial gains from small price movements. Short Selling: Profit from potential price declines in TAIKO or SQD . Capital Efficiency: Control large positions with less capital compared to spot trading. Liquidity: As one of the largest exchanges, Binance typically offers high liquidity, making it easier to enter and exit positions. 24/7 Trading: The crypto market operates continuously, allowing for trading anytime. Potential Challenges and Risks: Amplified Losses: Just as profits are amplified, so are losses. High leverage significantly increases the risk of liquidation. Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including potentially TAIKO and SQD , can be highly volatile, leading to rapid price swings. Funding Rates: Perpetual futures involve funding rates, which are periodic payments between long and short traders. These can add to trading costs. Complexity: Derivatives trading requires a solid understanding of margin, leverage, liquidation, and risk management. Actionable Insights for Traders If you’re considering trading these new perpetual futures contracts on Binance, here are some things to keep in mind: Understand Leverage: Do not use high leverage (like 50x) unless you fully understand the risks involved. Start with lower leverage if you are new. Risk Management is Crucial: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Only risk capital you can afford to lose. Research TAIKO and SQD: Understand the projects behind the tokens. While trading derivatives is about price action, fundamental knowledge can provide context. Start Small: Don’t allocate a large portion of your capital to highly leveraged trades, especially on new contracts. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on news and market sentiment related to TAIKO , SQD , and the broader crypto market. The Opportunity in Binance’s New Listings The addition of TAIKO and SQD perpetual futures to Binance’s platform is a significant development for traders interested in these specific assets. It opens up new avenues for speculation and hedging. For experienced traders comfortable with crypto leverage trading , these new contracts offer enhanced opportunities. However, the high leverage available means that caution and robust risk management strategies are paramount. Conclusion Binance continues to expand its derivatives market, now including TAIKO and SQD perpetual futures with up to 50x leverage from June 11th. This offers traders exciting possibilities for amplified gains and short-selling, but it also comes with the inherent high risks of leverage. Approaching these new contracts with a clear strategy, a strong understanding of the underlying assets, and disciplined risk management is essential for navigating the volatile world of perpetual futures .

We’re looking at a situation in South Korea that seems counterintuitive on the surface: the Bank of Korea’s foreign exchange reserves decreased in March, even though the South Korean won was actually strengthening against the US dollar during that period. What’s going on here? Let’s break down this apparent paradox and what it might signal for the Korea economy and global markets. Understanding Bank of Korea FX Reserves and the Won First, let’s set the stage. Foreign exchange reserves are essentially a central bank’s holdings of foreign currencies, gold, and other reserve assets. They serve several purposes: Helping manage the value of the domestic currency. Providing a buffer in times of economic crisis. Facilitating international transactions. Maintaining confidence in the country’s financial stability. The South Korean won is the national currency, and its value relative to other currencies, particularly the US dollar, is crucial for Korea’s trade-dependent economy. Normally, if a currency is strengthening, a central bank might intervene by selling its own currency and buying foreign currency (like dollars) to slow down the appreciation. This would typically lead to an *increase* in FX reserves. So, a drop in reserves when the won is strong is the opposite of what one might initially expect from direct intervention to weaken the currency. Why Did FX Reserves Decrease Despite Won Strength? This is the core question. The Bank of Korea reported its FX reserves stood at $469.1 billion at the end of March, down $3.5 billion from the previous month. During the same period, the won strengthened against the dollar. Several factors can contribute to a change in FX reserves. While currency intervention is a major one, it’s not the only game in town. Here are the primary reasons cited by the Bank of Korea and commonly understood by market observers: 1. Changes in Asset Values A significant portion of a central bank’s reserves is held in foreign currency-denominated assets, such as government bonds (like US Treasuries). The value of these assets can fluctuate based on market prices and exchange rates. If the value of these assets declines (for instance, due to rising global bond yields), the total reported value of the reserves will fall, even if the underlying amount of foreign currency held hasn’t changed due to intervention. The Bank of Korea explicitly mentioned that the decrease in March was primarily due to a reduction in the value of foreign currency assets resulting from factors like changes in bond prices and fluctuations in the exchange rates of other reserve currencies against the US dollar. When the dollar strengthens against other reserve currencies like the Euro or Yen (in which some reserves might be held), the dollar value of those holdings decreases. 2. Currency Intervention (But Not in the Usual Direction) While a strong won usually prompts intervention to *sell* won and *buy* dollars (increasing reserves), central banks can also intervene to smooth excessive volatility in *either* direction. If the won’s strengthening was particularly rapid or disorderly, the Bank of Korea might have engaged in ‘smoothing operations’. This could involve selling dollars to temper the pace of appreciation, which *would* reduce reserves. However, given the BoK’s statement focusing on asset values, large-scale intervention to cap the won’s rise might not have been the primary driver of the *entire* $3.5 billion drop, but it could have played a role in managing market conditions. 3. Other Factors Minor factors can also influence reserves, such as: Receipts or payments related to international organizations (like the IMF). Changes in deposits from financial institutions. These are typically smaller components compared to asset valuation changes or significant intervention, but they contribute to the overall figure. What Does This Mean for the Korea Economy? The fact that reserves fell primarily due to asset valuation changes rather than massive intervention suggests that the Bank of Korea was likely managing its portfolio or reacting to global market movements (like bond yield changes) more than aggressively fighting the won’s strength in March. This indicates a level of comfort with the won’s appreciation, or at least a view that the market movements were driven by broader global factors impacting asset values. A stronger won can have mixed effects on the Korea economy. It makes imports cheaper, which helps curb inflation and benefits consumers. However, it makes Korean exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially hurting export competitiveness – a crucial factor for Korea. The Bank of Korea’s management of FX reserves is a key tool in navigating these economic trade-offs and maintaining financial stability. The reported drop in reserves in March, despite the strong won, highlights the complex interplay of global asset markets and currency dynamics that central banks must constantly monitor. How Do These Macro Events Relate to Crypto? While cryptocurrency markets often operate on their own unique drivers, they are not entirely insulated from traditional finance and macroeconomics. Central bank actions, currency movements, and the overall health of major economies like South Korea can influence global investor sentiment and liquidity. A stable or volatile Korea economy can contribute to broader market risk appetite or aversion, which can spill over into digital asset markets. Understanding these underlying economic currents provides a fuller picture of the global financial landscape. Looking Ahead: What to Watch For? Moving forward, observers will be watching: Future Bank of Korea FX reserve data for trends. Statements from the Bank of Korea regarding their currency policy and outlook. Global bond market movements, as these significantly impact the value of reserve assets. The trajectory of the South Korean won against the dollar and other major currencies. These factors will offer clues about the BoK’s strategy and the health of the Korea economy. In Summary The decrease in the Bank of Korea’s foreign exchange reserves in March, despite the strengthening South Korean won, was primarily attributed to changes in the value of their foreign currency assets rather than direct intervention to weaken the won. This nuance is important for understanding the BoK’s actions and the factors influencing the Korea economy. It underscores how global financial market dynamics, particularly asset values and exchange rates between major currencies, play a significant role in central bank reserve management.

A combination of strengthening fundamentals and bullish technical signals supports this optimistic outlook. Solana Primed For A Spectacular Summer? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, SOL is currently undergoing a cooling phase on both the spot and futures Bubble Maps. The analyst shared the following chart to highlight this cooling period. For the uninitiated, a bubble map visualizes volume data across exchanges, with each bubble representing trading activity for a specific pair or platform. The size of the bubble indicates the total volume, while the color shows the intensity or change in that volume – such as cooling (green), neutral (gray), or overheating (red). Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? At first glance, lower trading volume might seem like fading momentum. However, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests this deceleration could be a strategic accumulation phase, particularly as a potential catalyst looms on the horizon. Many in the crypto community are expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the first Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the coming weeks. In an X post published today, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, said Solana could lead a “potential altcoin ETF summer.” Meanwhile, predictions platform Polymarket currently places a 91% probability on a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 – the highest odds recorded since January of this year. Most speculators expect a SOL ETF to go live by July 2025. From a technical standpoint, things are also looking encouraging. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that if SOL breaks above the $200 mark, it could kickstart a 5x to 10x bull run. Martinez shared the following SOL weekly chart, which shows the digital asset forming a bullish Cup and Handle pattern. While the “cup” portion has already been completed, the emerging “handle” suggests the potential for significant price appreciation – possibly pushing SOL beyond $2,000. SOL Showing Promise But Take Caution Despite widespread optimism, some indicators urge caution. On-chain data recently revealed a large movement of dormant SOL coins, which has raised concerns about increased selling pressure in the near term.

Section 899 to ensure growth in the U.S. ✅ WIN: The One Big Beautiful Bill helps American farmers, producers, and ranchers compete and sell products in foreign markets. AMERICA FIRST! pic.twitter.com/MFkxtju2FV — The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 11, 2025 Section 899 in the OBBB aims to introduce retaliatory tax measures against entities from nations with tariffs, such as the Digital Service Taxes and the OECD’s global minimum tax rules. If the legislation is passed into law, it could impact investors from the European Union, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland, among others. The White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) argued that the bill would produce significant economic growth. The entity projects the legislation would increase gross domestic product by up to 3.5%, raise investment by up to 7.5%, and raise wages by up to $11,600 per worker. CEA also believes that the OBBB would boost the U.S. economy by up to 5.2% in the first few years after enactment. “We put out a report from the Council of Economic Advisers that if the bill doesn’t pass, then they estimate that this would cause a reduction of GDP by 4%, we’d be in a deep recession, we’d lose six or seven million jobs.” – Kevin Hassett , Director at the National Economic Council. In an April analysis, the CEA confirmed their modeling is accurate because their 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) projections were correct. The entity estimated an increase in GDP growth between 2 and 4 percent and a $4,000 boost to per-worker wages. CEA said that macroeconomic data validated their projections and showed that real GDP was 2.5% higher than CBO’s pre-TCJA baseline, and real wages increased by $4,9992 per worker. The Tax Policy Center argued that though some more recent casual papers show positive effects on corporate investment, they do not support the magnitudes implied by CEA’s claims. Macroeconomic data suggest that overall investment in two assets the TCJA targeted, equipment and structures, barely budged in 2017. ICI expects Section 899 to impact foreign investments According to data from Apollo Global Management, foreign investors own $19 trillion in U.S. stock markets, $7 trillion in U.S. government bonds, and $5 trillion in U.S. credit. The Rhodium Group also estimated on June 9 that nearly all states face the threat of lost investment from the House bill, which totals $522 billion nationally, with the top 10 states comprising 62% of the investment. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warned that the bill in its current form impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The entity believes that portfolio investors are likely to retreat from U.S. equities, leading to capital outflows from the U.S. In a letter sent to Senator Mike Crapo, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the ICI argued that if sustained selling by foreign investors depresses U.S. equity markets, it would harm both U.S. companies and investors. The entity also suggested that the U.S. fund management industry, which has invested around $18 trillion in U.S. stock markets, would be collateral damage due to the impact of Section 899. Trump also issued a warning on June 5 that there would be a 68% tax hike if the OBBB legislation does not pass. However, independent analyses of the controversial bill found that Trump’s estimate is about 10 times bigger than the expected increase would be if the cuts expire. The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated, on average, Americans’ taxes would rise by about 7.5% if the 2017 tax cuts fully expired, not 68%.

A significant step has been taken that could bring the SUI ETF closer to U.S. investors. This development signals increasing mainstream interest in digital assets and specific blockchain ecosystems like Sui. What Does the Nasdaq SUI ETF Filing Mean? Nasdaq, a major stock exchange, has officially filed a 19b-4 rule change proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing is on behalf of 21Shares, a prominent issuer of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), seeking to list a spot SUI ETF in the United States. Think of the 19b-4 filing as a formal request from an exchange to the SEC to change its rules to allow a new type of product – in this case, a spot SUI ETF – to be listed and traded. This action marks the official commencement of the regulatory review process by the SEC for this specific SUI investment product. While it’s an early stage, it’s a necessary and crucial step on the path toward potential approval. A spot SUI ETF, if approved, would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of the SUI token without directly owning or storing the cryptocurrency itself. This is often seen as a more accessible and regulated way for traditional investors to enter the crypto market. What is the SEC ETF Approval Process Like? The journey toward SEC ETF approval is known to be rigorous and can be lengthy. After an exchange files the 19b-4, the SEC has a set period to review the proposal. They can approve, disapprove, or delay the decision, often asking for public comments or further information. The SEC’s primary concerns typically revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and the overall readiness and maturity of the underlying asset’s market. For cryptocurrency ETFs, the SEC has historically been cautious, particularly with spot products. However, the landscape has shifted following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. This previous approval has set a precedent and potentially smoothed the path for other single-asset crypto ETFs, though approval for a SUI ETF is by no means guaranteed and will be evaluated on its own merits. Why is the Sui Ecosystem Attracting Attention? The filing reflects growing institutional interest in the Sui ecosystem . Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability, using a unique object-centric model and parallel transaction execution. Its focus on high throughput and low transaction costs has positioned it as a platform for various applications, including DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. The official Sui blog noted that the filing by 21Shares follows their initial registration for a potential SUI product back in April, indicating a sustained effort to bring this asset to market. Furthermore, the existing global market for SUI-based exchange-traded products highlights this growing interest. According to reports, over $300 million has already been invested in SUI ETPs listed in various jurisdictions outside the U.S. This demonstrates that there is already demand and a track record for regulated investment products tied to SUI, which could be a positive point for the SEC to consider during their review. Who is 21Shares and What is Their Role? 21Shares is a major player in the crypto ETP space globally. They are known for offering a wide range of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products across different European exchanges and have been actively pursuing opportunities in the U.S. market. Their partnership with Ark Invest led to one of the approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, giving them valuable experience navigating the SEC’s requirements. Their decision to file for a Nasdaq SUI ETF specifically underscores their belief in the potential of the Sui network and the demand for a regulated investment vehicle in the U.S. market. Their expertise in structuring and managing crypto ETPs will be crucial throughout the SEC review process. Potential Benefits of a U.S. Spot SUI ETF If the SEC approves the 21Shares SUI ETF for listing on Nasdaq, several benefits could follow: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors can easily invest in SUI through standard brokerage accounts, removing the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallet management. Enhanced Legitimacy: Listing on a major exchange like Nasdaq and gaining SEC approval could lend further credibility to SUI as an asset class. Potential for Greater Liquidity: Increased trading volume from traditional markets could improve the overall liquidity of the SUI market. Institutional Adoption: ETFs are a preferred vehicle for many institutional investors, potentially opening the door for larger capital inflows into the Sui ecosystem. Challenges and What to Watch For Despite the positive step, challenges remain: SEC Scrutiny: The SEC’s review is thorough and not guaranteed to result in approval. They will examine market surveillance, potential for manipulation, and other factors specific to the SUI market. Regulatory Landscape: The broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains complex and can influence decisions. Market Volatility: SUI, like other cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant price volatility, which the SEC considers in its assessment of investor protection. Investors and the Sui community should closely watch the SEC’s public filings and announcements regarding the 19b-4 proposal. Deadlines for comments and initial decisions will be published, providing insights into the potential timeline for approval or further delays. In Conclusion The filing by Nasdaq for the 21Shares SUI ETF is a significant milestone for the Sui ecosystem and the broader crypto market in the United States. It officially kicks off the formal SEC review process for a U.S. spot SUI ETF, signaling serious intent from major financial players like Nasdaq and 21Shares. While the path to SEC ETF approval is challenging, the growing institutional interest in Sui and the precedent set by previous spot crypto ETF approvals offer a hopeful outlook. This development is a crucial step that could potentially unlock new avenues for investment and further integrate the Sui ecosystem into mainstream finance.

With this launch, institutional investors on XRPL can now access OUSG, gaining exposure to short-term US Treasuries through a fully tokenized, blockchain-based offering. “By bringing OUSG to the XRPL, Ondo Finance is bringing institutional-grade assets directly to the institutions, providing access to high-quality tokenized assets as flexible treasury management tools,” ONDO said. OUSG Debuts on XRPL with Strong Backing OUSG launches on XRPL with an impressive $30 million in total value locked (TVL). This move not only expands OUSG’s multi-chain reach, which already includes Ethereum and Solana — but also further positions XRPL as a hub for institutional-grade finance solutions. The XRPL integration allows for intraday settlement and immediate access to liquidity, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in traditional finance. With over $1.3 billion in TVL, Ondo Finance has established itself as a leader in RWA tokenization. OUSG alone holds over $690 million and was the first tokenized security to achieve significant adoption. Its portfolio includes funds managed by financial heavyweights like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and FundBridge Capital. “Bringing OUSG to XRPL with RLUSD as a settlement option broadens access to high-quality, onchain financial instruments. It reflects our commitment to bridging traditional finance and DeFi in a way that serves institutions reliably,” Ian De Bode, Chief Strategy Officer at Ondo Finance, added.

Qubetics is positioning itself as the most advanced interoperable blockchain in development. Litecoin is reintroducing itself with LitVM, giving its aging ecosystem a Web3 upgrade. Meanwhile, Injective is demonstrating steady price action and powerful DeFi fundamentals. These aren’t just hype-driven tokens; newsworthy developments, strategic upgrades, and solid market performance back them. For anyone researching the top crypto presale opportunities, June 2025 is a crucial month to act. Qubetics: Interoperability as the Future of Blockchain Integration Qubetics is building more than a Layer 1, it’s designing a connective tissue for blockchain ecosystems. Its architecture is focused on interoperability, allowing seamless asset movement and data exchange across chains like Ethereum, Solana, and even Bitcoin. Through smart routing, compatibility protocols, and adaptive consensus mechanisms, Qubetics eliminates blockchain silos and sets the stage for a multi-chain future where DApps, DeFi platforms, and enterprise tools can operate in unison. This interoperability unlocks massive value for decentralized finance, cross-chain staking, and tokenized asset flows. Enterprises, developers, and financial institutions gain access to scalable real-time asset mobility. Rather than relying on wrapped assets or cumbersome bridges, Qubetics’ design enables direct, secure communication between blockchains without compromising decentralization or speed. Moreover, the project has entered its final crypto presale stage (Stage 37). Over $17.9 million has already been raised, with more than 515 million $TICS tokens sold. Only a limited number of tokens remain at the fixed price of $0.3370, after which a 20% price jump to $0.40 is expected upon listing. This surge is supported by a drastic supply cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens and an increased public allocation of 38.55%, reinforcing the platform’s community-first vision. For investors evaluating returns, $3,000 today could yield these projections: At $0.40: $3,560.50 (19% gain) At $1: $8,901.24 At $5: $44,506.20 At $10: $89,012.40 At $15: $133,518.60 Qubetics offers a token but also a complete infrastructure built for scale, developer utility, and future-proof growth. For those seeking the top crypto presale with long-term fundamentals and market-ready features, Qubetics deserves serious attention. Litecoin: Web3 Comes to Life with LitVM Litecoin has often played the role of digital silver to Bitcoin’s gold, but recent developments are giving it a new identity. At the 2025 Litecoin Summit, the team unveiled LitVM, a Layer-2 smart contract solution powered by BitcoinOS, Polygon CDK, and AggLayer. This innovation finally brings smart contract capabilities to Litecoin, enabling it to compete with Ethereum and Solana in the decentralized application (dApp) space. With LitVM, Litecoin becomes Web3 compatible, allowing developers to build dApps and DeFi platforms on a blockchain known for its reliability, speed, and low fees. This shift is particularly significant given Litecoin’s large user base and historical focus on security and simplicity. It’s a modernization move that could breathe new life into one of the oldest coins in crypto. Beyond enabling new functionality, LitVM opens up cross-chain opportunities and access to multiple L2 ecosystems. Users can now leverage interoperability tools built into the LitVM stack to move assets fluidly between Litecoin and other chains, like Ethereum, while still benefiting from the low-fee environment Litecoin is known for. As a result, analysts are again turning bullish on $LTC, especially with the market rotating toward scalable L1s and legacy chains upgrading for the dApp era. While not a presale opportunity, Litecoin’s evolution through LitVM positions it for renewed relevance, particularly among investors searching for solid altcoins with real-world use cases. Injective: Price Resilience and DeFi Potential Injective ($INJ) continues to show why it’s one of the most structurally sound tokens in DeFi. At a current price of $13.90 and a 24-hour trading volume of over $130 million, INJ is proving its resilience in a choppy market. Even a modest 2.11% daily gain has reaffirmed investor confidence, especially in light of its consistent protocol upgrades and DEX growth. Injective has always focused on layer-one DeFi infrastructure, enabling decentralized trading, derivatives, and cross-chain applications. Unlike competitors, it provides fully on-chain order books with near-zero gas fees and lightning-fast execution, thanks to its Cosmos SDK-based framework and integration with IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). This focus on performance and interoperability is now being validated in the market. New developer tools, governance enhancements, and liquidity injection programs are making Injective a serious contender in the race to build scalable, user-friendly DeFi platforms. Projects built on Injective can tap into shared liquidity across chains, giving the network a unique competitive edge. With its price stabilizing above key support levels, analysts believe INJ could be poised for a breakout, especially if Layer 1 DeFi protocols begin outperforming again. For long-term believers and swing traders alike, Injective represents a solid alternative to more speculative plays, even while presales dominate the current market conversation. Final Thoughts As new narratives emerge, interoperability, smart contract upgrades, and DeFi utility, the market is rotating toward coins that offer more than hype. Qubetics leads the pack in presale opportunity, with a native interoperability architecture and final-stage pricing advantages. Litecoin is reinventing itself with LitVM, bringing smart contract functionality to a vast user base. Injective, meanwhile, continues to impress with stability, liquidity, and on-chain execution. For those seeking the top crypto presale of June 2025, Qubetics offers one of the last chances to enter before a major price jump. With supply shrinking, features expanding, and community support growing, now is the moment to act. Don’t wait until the listing surge to recognize the value, position early and ride the wave. For More Information Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other Layer 1 blockchains?

It also features native tools for developers like QubeQode and an integrated IDE. Is Qubetics a good investment in June 2025? Yes, it’s in its final presale stage at $0.3370 with a confirmed listing price of $0.40 and long-term potential up to $15 based on projected utility and scarcity. How does LitVM improve Litecoin? LitVM turns Litecoin into a Web3-compatible platform by introducing smart contracts, scalability, and cross-chain functionality using Polygon’s CDK and AggLayer. Is Injective still a good buy at $13.90? Injective offers strong infrastructure, low fees, and cross-chain DEX capabilities. Its price action has remained steady, signaling healthy investor sentiment. Which is the top crypto presale this month?

Due to the symbolic value and secure financial systems it provides, Neo Pepe has become one of the most noticeable changes in the evolving global financial system. As many cryptocurrencies seem bank or government run, Neo Pepe offers a chance for crypto enthusiasts to back an asset that is independent and not controlled by big hands. Because it stands for dispersed power and resists big financial control, Neo Pepe has found a strong place among crypto users in today’s world, relying on innovation from blockchain and aiming to keep evolving. Among other things, narrative innovations drive interest in NEOP Lots of people care about Neo Pepe because of its story and the team’s work to stop the markets from becoming oversaturated, not only for its finances. Rather than acting as only a currency, Neo Pepe aims to transform the meaning of financial freedom. It is often mentioned in the same way as Ethereum (ETH), showing that it has the potential to offer unique benefits to investors because of its strong tokenomics and strong security measures. Since advanced blockchain features are already familiar to Ethereum investors, Neo Pepe’s unique and structured way stands out for them. Bold Token Design Attracting Serious Attention Neo Pepe’s 16-phase pre-sale is what makes it so different from the traditional ways people launch tokens. Early investors can use the leap from $0.05 to $0.16 for a crypto opportunity , since it offers good benefits. Since the goal is to raise $50 million, people are eagerly showing their excitement for Neo Pepe. A special facet of Neo Pepe is its token release system, which distributes tokens an hour after the project launches. This way of releasing tokens assures a proper and steady flow, making them more stable. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement Neo Pepe increased its liquidity pool by automatically giving a 2.5% in add of new liquidity from each transaction. All of the LP tokens generated are burned on the spot, which secures the liquidity and attracts more long-term investors. Also, owners of Neo Pepe can take part in choosing exchange listings since the governance model gives them this authority. Unlike the centralized systems of many other tokens, Neo Pepe proves that it places a high value on being open and democratic. Dominant Token Surges Past Competitors More and more investors are rushing to invest in Neo Pepe since it has features that make it stand out from other cryptos.

While our world often focuses on charts, blockchain updates, and regulatory shifts directly impacting digital assets, it’s crucial to remember that the broader global economic and political landscape plays a significant role. A recent development in the U.S. legal system regarding US Tariff Authority is a prime example of this, potentially having ripple effects that are worth paying attention to. According to information shared by @solidintel_x on X, a federal appeals court has made a significant ruling. This isn’t just about obscure trade laws; it’s about the extent of Government Authority when it comes to imposing costs on international goods. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters, even if you’re primarily focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. What the Appeals Court Decision Means for US Tariff Authority The core of this news lies in a federal appeals court ruling that stated the U.S. government indeed possesses the authority to impose tariffs. This might sound straightforward, but it actually overturns a prior decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade. The previous ruling by the Court of International Trade had challenged the executive branch’s power, specifically regarding a reciprocal tariff order issued on April 2nd by the Trump administration. That court had argued that this specific order exceeded presidential powers as defined under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The IEEPA is a law granting the President authority to regulate commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United United States. However, the federal appeals court has now sided with the government, essentially validating the use of IEEPA in this context to impose tariffs. This Appeals Court Decision strengthens the executive branch’s hand in implementing trade measures, reinforcing the scope of US Tariff Authority under this specific legal framework. Understanding Government Authority and Trade Tariffs To fully grasp the implications, let’s briefly touch upon what Trade Tariffs are and the concept of Government Authority in this area. Trade Tariffs are essentially taxes or duties imposed on imported goods or services. They can be used for various reasons: Protecting Domestic Industries: Making imported goods more expensive can make domestically produced goods more competitive. Generating Revenue: Tariffs collect money for the government. As a Bargaining Tool: Tariffs can be used in negotiations with other countries to achieve trade concessions. Addressing Unfair Practices: Counteracting practices like dumping (selling goods below cost) or subsidies by foreign governments. The power to impose tariffs is a key aspect of a government’s control over its borders and economy. In the U.S., this power is primarily vested in Congress, but certain laws, like IEEPA, delegate specific authorities to the President, particularly during times deemed national emergencies. The legal debate often centers on the interpretation of these delegated powers – how far can the executive branch go without explicit congressional approval for every specific tariff action? The overturned ruling suggested a narrower interpretation of presidential power under IEEPA regarding tariffs, while the appeals court has now endorsed a broader view. This affects the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches concerning trade policy and solidifies a significant area of Government Authority . Potential Economic Impact: Why Crypto Investors Should Care Now, let’s connect the dots to our world. How does a ruling on US Tariff Authority and Trade Tariffs potentially affect the crypto market? The link isn’t direct, but it’s significant through the lens of macroeconomics and global market sentiment. Here’s why the Economic Impact of this ruling matters for crypto investors: Increased Potential for Trade Friction: Validating the executive’s broad tariff power means future administrations could more easily implement tariffs without lengthy legal challenges (at least based on this specific argument). This raises the potential for trade disputes or ‘trade wars’ with other countries. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can increase costs for businesses that rely on imported goods, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers (inflation) or reduced corporate profits. Supply chain instability can ripple through the global economy. Market Uncertainty: Geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts are major sources of market uncertainty. When traditional markets (stocks, bonds) become volatile due to these factors, it often impacts the crypto market, sometimes acting as a risk-on asset (corralling with stocks) or, for some, a potential hedge against traditional financial instability (though this is debated). Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are often inflationary as they increase the cost of goods. Central banks might react to inflation, and their monetary policy decisions (like interest rate hikes) have a profound Economic Impact that directly affects crypto valuations. Global Economic Health: The health of the global economy is intertwined with international trade. Policies that impact trade flows can affect economic growth worldwide, influencing investment appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. While a single ruling doesn’t guarantee immediate, drastic changes, it sets a precedent. It suggests that the executive branch has robust tools at its disposal for trade policy, which could be used in ways that impact global commerce and economic stability. Monitoring these developments is part of being a well-informed investor, even in the crypto space, as the lines between traditional finance, geopolitics, and digital assets continue to blur. Challenges and Uncertainties Following the Ruling Despite the appeals court upholding the government’s position, challenges and uncertainties remain. This ruling specifically addresses the interpretation of IEEPA in the context of reciprocal tariffs, but legal challenges to tariffs can arise on other grounds. Key challenges include: Future Legal Battles: While this specific argument was rejected by the appeals court, businesses and other entities negatively impacted by tariffs may seek alternative legal avenues to challenge them. Political Opposition: Broad use of tariff power can face political opposition domestically and internationally. Retaliation: Other countries may retaliate with their own tariffs, escalating trade tensions. Measuring True Economic Impact: Accurately predicting and measuring the full Economic Impact of tariffs is complex, involving countless variables across different industries and countries. This ruling provides clarity on one legal aspect of Government Authority regarding tariffs but doesn’t eliminate the complexities and potential negative consequences associated with their implementation. Looking Ahead: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community So, what should you, as a crypto investor, take away from this Appeals Court Decision on US Tariff Authority ? Stay Informed on Macro News: Don’t silo yourself. News about trade policy, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events are not separate from the crypto market; they are interconnected. Understand Correlation: Observe how major macro events correlate with crypto price movements. This correlation isn’t always consistent, but understanding potential drivers can help manage risk. Diversification: Consider diversification within your crypto portfolio and potentially across different asset classes based on your risk tolerance and view of the broader economic climate. Focus on Fundamentals (Still Key): While macro factors cause volatility, the long-term success of specific crypto projects still depends on their technology, adoption, and use case. This ruling is a reminder that external forces can significantly influence the environment in which cryptocurrencies operate. Paying attention to shifts in Government Authority and potential Economic Impact stemming from policies like Trade Tariffs is part of navigating the volatile landscape of digital assets. Conclusion: A Boost to Tariff Power with Potential Economic Ripples The federal appeals court’s decision to uphold the U.S. government’s US Tariff Authority marks a significant moment regarding the scope of executive power under IEEPA. By overturning the prior ruling from the Court of International Trade, the appeals court has reinforced the executive branch’s ability to impose Trade Tariffs , providing a Decisive Boost to this area of Government Authority . While this is a legal and trade policy development, its potential Economic Impact is far-reaching, influencing everything from inflation and supply chains to international relations and overall market sentiment. For the crypto community, this serves as a fresh reminder that global economic and political shifts are not isolated events. Understanding these broader trends, even those seemingly distant like an Appeals Court Decision on tariffs, is vital for making informed decisions in the interconnected world of finance and digital assets.

The world of cryptocurrency is often swayed by unexpected forces, and few individuals command as much attention as former U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Recent reports suggesting a potential reconciliation between the two powerful figures have once again put the spotlight on how political and business heavyweights can influence the volatile digital asset landscape. The question on many minds is: what could a Trump Elon Musk reconciliation mean for the future direction of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader altcoin market? Trump Crypto News: A Hint of Détente According to an account known for tracking economic news, Walter Bloomberg on X, former President Donald Trump responded to a direct question about reconciling with Elon Musk with a simple, yet telling, phrase: “I guess I could.” This brief statement, coming after a period of public disagreement and tension between the two, immediately sparked discussions across social media platforms and financial news outlets. While not a definitive commitment to patching things up, it represents a significant shift in tone compared to past exchanges. For those following the markets, especially the crypto market, any interaction or potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Musk is noteworthy. Both individuals possess immense platforms and their commentary, whether on politics, technology, or finance, has a proven track record of moving markets. This latest piece of Trump crypto news is no exception, prompting analysts to consider the potential ripple effects. The Trump-Musk Dynamic: A Tumultuous History The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk hasn’t always been smooth sailing. At various times, they have appeared to be allies, with Musk even serving on Trump’s business advisory councils early in his presidency. However, disagreements, particularly around policy and political stances, led to a public falling out. Early Collaboration: Musk joined Trump’s advisory councils, suggesting a degree of alignment or at least a willingness to engage. Policy Clashes: Musk resigned from the councils following Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Public Criticism: Both figures have publicly criticized each other at different points, adding to the perception of a strained relationship. Recent Shifts: Musk’s acquisition of Twitter (now X) and his stated commitment to free speech have led to some speculation about potential common ground with Trump, who was famously banned from the platform before being reinstated under Musk’s ownership. This history is important because it highlights the potential volatility of their interactions. A move towards reconciliation, even a tentative one, could signal a new phase where their public commentary might align more often, potentially amplifying their collective influence on various sectors, including technology, finance, and yes, cryptocurrency. Why Does Trump Elon Musk Reconciliation Matter for Crypto? Understanding why the potential mending of fences between Trump and Musk is relevant to cryptocurrency requires looking at the unique characteristics of the crypto market and the outsized influence certain figures can wield. The crypto market, compared to traditional financial markets, is often more susceptible to news, sentiment, and even individual commentary. This is due to several factors: Relative Immaturity: Despite its growth, crypto is still a relatively young asset class without the deep liquidity and established institutional structures of, say, the stock or bond markets. Retail Investor Dominance: A significant portion of the market is driven by retail investors who are often more reactive to news and social media trends. Narrative-Driven: Cryptocurrency valuations are heavily influenced by narratives around adoption, technology, regulation, and public perception. High Visibility Figures: Individuals like Elon Musk and, increasingly, political figures like Donald Trump, have massive online followings and their statements can quickly shape these narratives. Elon Musk, through his tweets and public statements, has famously influenced the price of Bitcoin and Dogecoin in the past. His company, Tesla, also made significant investments in Bitcoin, further cementing his connection to the crypto space in the eyes of investors. Similarly, while Donald Trump’s relationship with crypto has been more cautious or even critical at times, his recent foray into NFTs and his shifting public comments suggest a potential evolution in his stance. His political platform and potential future policies could have significant implications for crypto regulation and adoption in the United States. A reconciled Trump and Musk could potentially amplify each other’s messages, whether intentionally or not. If they were to find common ground on issues related to technology, finance, or even the future of digital assets, their combined voice could have a powerful effect on market sentiment and direction. This is the core reason why the possibility of a Trump Elon Musk reconciliation is considered significant news within the crypto community. Crypto Market Impact: Learning from Past Events The initial report mentioning Trump’s comment also noted that past tensions between the two had previously caused a “brief dip in the cryptocurrency market.” This serves as a tangible example of how their dynamic can translate into market movements. While the specific instance referenced might have been minor, it highlights a broader pattern. Negative commentary or public disagreements between influential figures associated with crypto can spook investors, leading to sell-offs. Conversely, positive remarks or perceived alignment could fuel rallies. Consider the following examples of how prominent figures have impacted crypto: Figure Action/Comment Crypto Impact (Example) Elon Musk Tweeting about Dogecoin Significant DOGE price surges Elon Musk Tesla accepting/suspending Bitcoin payments BTC price volatility Donald Trump Expressing skepticism about Bitcoin Minor negative sentiment shifts Various Negative regulatory comments Market-wide dips A potential Trump Elon Musk reconciliation, if it leads to more aligned or positive commentary on technology and innovation, could theoretically contribute to a more favorable narrative for the crypto market. It wouldn’t be the sole driver, but it could add to a confluence of factors influencing sentiment. Political Influence Crypto: A Growing Trend Beyond the specific Trump-Musk dynamic, the increasing intersection of political figures and the crypto world is a trend gaining momentum. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology become more mainstream, politicians are being forced to take stances, propose regulations, and sometimes, even engage directly with the technology (like issuing NFTs). The political influence crypto is not just about market commentary; it’s also about policy. Future regulations regarding stablecoins, exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi), and taxation will significantly shape the environment for crypto investors and developers. Statements from potential future leaders or key political figures can offer glimpses into potential policy directions, which can, in turn, affect market confidence. The fact that a potential reconciliation between two non-crypto native figures like Trump and Musk is being discussed in the context of crypto market impact underscores just how intertwined these worlds are becoming. It highlights the need for crypto enthusiasts and investors to pay attention not just to technological developments and market charts, but also to the broader political and social landscape. What Actionable Insights Can Crypto Investors Take? Given the potential for news and commentary from influential figures to impact the market, how should a savvy crypto investor navigate this environment? Stay Informed, But Skeptical: Keep track of major news, including statements from figures like Trump and Musk, but critically evaluate their potential impact. Don’t make impulsive decisions based on a single tweet or quote. Focus on Fundamentals: While sentiment matters, the long-term value of a cryptocurrency ultimately depends on its underlying technology, use case, adoption rate, and development team. Don’t let short-term news distract from fundamental analysis. Diversify: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Diversification can help mitigate risks associated with volatility driven by specific news events or individuals. Have a Strategy: Whether you are a long-term holder or a short-term trader, have a clear investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Stick to your plan rather than being swayed by every piece of news. Consider the Source: Evaluate the credibility and potential biases of the information source. Walter Bloomberg is known for reporting economic news, but the quote itself is a brief, non-committal statement. The possibility of a Trump Elon Musk reconciliation is an interesting piece of crypto market news, but it’s one data point among many. Understanding the *why* behind the potential impact – the influence of powerful figures and the sensitivity of the market – is more important than reacting solely to the headline. Conclusion: Watching the Dynamic Unfold Donald Trump’s comment about potentially reconciling with Elon Musk has added another layer of intrigue to the complex relationship between prominent figures and the cryptocurrency market. While it remains to be seen if a genuine reconciliation will occur, or what form it might take, the mere suggestion highlights the significant attention and potential influence these individuals command. The history of their interactions and their individual track records of impacting public discourse and financial markets make any shift in their dynamic relevant for those tracking crypto market news. As the world of digital assets continues to evolve, so too does the landscape of external factors that can affect it, including the fascinating and sometimes unpredictable realm of political influence crypto. Whether a Trump Elon Musk reconciliation leads to positive collaboration or further divergence, their actions and words will likely remain a topic of discussion and analysis within the cryptocurrency community. Investors should stay informed, but always approach such news with a critical eye, prioritizing sound investment principles over speculative reactions to headlines.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) last week ordered all digital token service providers without a formal license under the Payment Services Act to cease overseas activities. The directive leaves little room for negotiation and applies even to firms awaiting full approval.

Bybit is reportedly exploring similar options, although it has not confirmed its next steps. Dubai and Hong Kong have become magnets for digital asset platforms looking to navigate tightening rules elsewhere. Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has granted licenses to more than 20 firms, including Binance and Bybit, under a regime that offers tax advantages and regulatory clarity. Hong Kong, with its emphasis on cross-border interoperability and traditional finance infrastructure, has also drawn interest as it ramps up its digital asset initiatives. With Rules Tightening, Crypto Firms Weigh Exit from Once-Friendly Shores in Singapore Singapore, once viewed as Asia’s crypto haven, has adopted a more cautious stance in the wake of the 2022 market downturn that saw the collapse of local platforms like Three Arrows Capital and Hodlnaut. While the country continues to issue crypto licenses, authorities have limited advertising, warned retail investors, and imposed new controls on firms operating from within its borders. The MAS decision has sparked concern among industry insiders, with some warning that the clampdown could lead to significant job losses and diminish Singapore’s position in the global crypto economy. For now, firms with unlicensed overseas operations are scrambling to comply or relocate, signaling a shift in the region’s balance of crypto power.

Recently, a significant stir was caused within the Ethereum community regarding the future and funding of Geth, one of the network’s most critical client implementations. This isn’t just technical chatter; it’s Crypto News that gets to the heart of how core infrastructure is managed. What’s Happening with the Geth Team? The controversy began when Péter Szilágyi, a highly respected and key developer working on go-ethereum, commonly known as Geth, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) with serious allegations against the Ethereum Foundation . Szilágyi claimed that the foundation made a substantial offer – specifically, $5 million – with the intention of splitting the existing Geth development team. According to his account, this offer was rejected by the team. But the accusations didn’t stop there. Szilágyi further criticized the foundation for allegedly funding a second, parallel Geth team operating secretly within Nethermind, another prominent Ethereum client development team. He also suggested that the foundation was exerting pressure on developers to leave the main Geth team. These claims paint a picture of behind-the-scenes maneuvering that, if true, could raise concerns about transparency and the handling of core Blockchain Development resources. Why is Geth So Important to Ethereum ? To understand the gravity of these accusations, it’s crucial to appreciate Geth’s role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Geth is the official Go language implementation of the Ethereum protocol. It’s one of the most widely used execution layer clients, running a significant portion of Ethereum nodes globally. Its stability, security, and continued development are absolutely vital for the health and decentralization of the entire network. Think of Ethereum clients like different web browsers for the internet. While they all access the same underlying network (the internet), they are developed by different teams using different codebases. Client diversity is considered a major strength for Ethereum, preventing a single point of failure. If one client has a bug, the network can continue to function because other clients are running different code. Geth’s dominance, while a testament to its quality, also makes any issues or controversies surrounding its team particularly sensitive. Key Role: Geth is a dominant execution layer client for Ethereum. Network Health: Its stability is crucial for the overall network. Client Diversity: While important, Geth’s widespread use makes its status critical. Development: Ongoing updates and maintenance are necessary for protocol upgrades and security. The Ethereum Foundation Responds: Denials and Reassurances Following Szilágyi’s public statements, the Ethereum Foundation quickly issued a response through Tomasz Stańczak. Stańczak explicitly denied the claims made by Szilágyi. He stated unequivocally that there are no plans within the foundation to remove or sideline Geth. Furthermore, he affirmed that Geth will continue to receive support from the foundation. This direct denial aims to quell fears and maintain confidence in the foundation’s commitment to supporting the diverse client ecosystem, including Geth. The conflicting narratives present a challenging situation for the community. On one hand, you have a long-standing core developer making specific, serious accusations. On the other, you have the official body responsible for supporting the ecosystem issuing a firm denial. This highlights the complexities and potential communication breakdowns that can occur even within a project as mature as Ethereum. Why Would the Ethereum Foundation Fund Other Teams? It’s standard practice for the Ethereum Foundation to fund multiple teams working on various aspects of the Ethereum protocol, including different client implementations. This funding is typically aimed at promoting client diversity, fostering innovation, and ensuring redundancy in critical infrastructure. Funding teams like Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, and others is part of a strategy to decentralize development effort and reduce reliance on any single team or client. The controversy arises from the *nature* of the alleged funding – specifically, the claim that it was intended to ‘split’ or undermine the existing Geth team, or that a second Geth team was funded secretly. The foundation’s perspective, based on Stańczak’s denial, suggests that their funding activities are aligned with their stated goals of supporting the ecosystem broadly, including continued support for Geth. The discrepancy lies in whether specific actions were taken with the alleged intent of fragmenting the current Geth team or creating covert parallel efforts. Understanding the Implications for Blockchain Development This incident, regardless of the precise truth behind the claims, underscores several critical aspects of open-source Blockchain Development and the governance challenges faced by large, decentralized projects like Ethereum: Developer Relations: Maintaining healthy relationships between core developers and the entities that fund or support their work is paramount. Public disputes can erode trust. Funding Transparency: How foundations allocate funds for core development is a sensitive topic. Clarity and transparency around funding decisions can help prevent misunderstandings and accusations. Client Diversity Strategy: While funding multiple teams is good, the *method* and *goals* of that funding need to be clear to avoid the perception of trying to weaken or control existing successful teams. Communication: Effective communication channels between the foundation, client teams, and the wider community are essential to address concerns before they escalate into public controversies. For those following Crypto News , this situation serves as a reminder that the development of core blockchain infrastructure is not always smooth sailing. It involves human relationships, funding pressures, and differing perspectives on the best path forward. What Does This Mean for the Average Ethereum User or Developer? While this controversy plays out at a high level among core contributors and the foundation, what does it signify for someone simply using or building on Ethereum? At present, the immediate impact is likely minimal. Geth is still being developed, and the foundation states it remains committed to supporting it. However, prolonged disputes or instability within a core client team could, in the long term, potentially affect development pace or even network stability, although this is a hypothetical worst-case scenario. More broadly, it highlights the decentralized yet sometimes contentious nature of the ecosystem. Decisions about funding and development direction, even within a foundation tasked with supporting the public good, can become subjects of debate and disagreement. Moving Forward: Resolving Disputes in Blockchain Development Resolving such disputes typically requires open dialogue, clarification of facts, and potentially mediation or changes in communication strategies. For the Ethereum Foundation and the Geth team, finding a way to work collaboratively and transparently is crucial for the long-term health of the network. The community will be watching closely to see how these claims are further addressed and how the relationship between the foundation and this vital client team evolves. This incident underscores the unique governance challenges in decentralized ecosystems, where authority is distributed, and key contributors often operate independently while relying on ecosystem support. Ensuring continued robust Blockchain Development requires navigating these interpersonal and organizational complexities effectively. In Conclusion: The allegations made by Geth developer Péter Szilágyi against the Ethereum Foundation regarding attempts to split the team and secret funding have introduced a significant controversy into the Ethereum ecosystem. While the foundation has denied these claims, the incident highlights critical issues surrounding funding transparency, developer relations, and the governance of core Blockchain Development within decentralized networks. The resolution of this dispute will be important for maintaining trust and ensuring the continued health of the network’s vital infrastructure, like Geth. It’s a developing story that the crypto world is following closely. To learn more about the latest Ethereum trends, explore our articles on key developments shaping Ethereum blockchain development.

After forming a low around April 7th, XRP has been gradually working through a corrective phase, and recent price action hints a rebound may be in play. Current Market Structure On the daily time frame, XRP is holding firm above critical support between $2.05 and $2.10. At the same time, it’s facing resistance between $2.35 and $2.36. A decisive breakout above $2.35 would open the door to higher targets at $2.44 and potentially $2.60 in the short term. A bullish W-shaped double bottom pattern appears to be forming, further supporting the case for an upward move if resistance levels are cleared. Elliott Wave Structure Suggests Rebound Potential Analysts identified a WXY correction from the January highs that likely bottomed out on April 7th. From that low, XRP completed a five-wave advance, followed by a corrective three-wave pullback, a classic pattern signaling a potential larger bullish structure ahead. Now, price action suggests the possibility of a new five-wave move up developing. Support is currently tracked at $2.22, $2.15, and $2.11. A drop below $2.11 would weaken the short-term bullish case and shift focus toward the next major support near $1.95. Rising Funding Rates Could Trigger a Drop While the price is staying above support levels, the cost for traders to hold long positions (called funding rates) is quietly going up. Right now, the funding rate is at 0.01% every 8 hours, but if it rises to 0.02% or more without the price moving higher, there’s a good chance the price could drop. If XRP falls below $2.25, it could drop to $2.01, $1.90, or even $1.55.

Speaking during the firm’s regular live-stream, analyst Forrest began by ranking assets that have rallied since the US election on 5 November 2024. “XRP is the number-one performing coin since the election, the strongest coin on my watch-list,” he said, displaying a four-hour relative-performance chart that compared crypto majors, select altcoins, metals and equities. The next-best performers—HBAR and XLM—were described as “beta” plays that historically accelerate only after XRP begins to trend. Can XRP Reach $73 This Cycle? Forrest’s thesis hinges on what he called a “seven-year flag and breakout” visible on XRP’s monthly time frame. The pattern comprises the long consolidation that followed the 2017 bull market and a second, five-month bull flag carved out this year. “Why would I not own a chart that looks like this?” he asked, noting the rarity of multi-cycle structures that break decisively to the upside without retracing the move. In his view, the next critical trigger sits above $3.00–3.30, where XRP’s prior all-time high was set in January 2018. Once breached, the analyst argues, momentum traders who “feel like they’ve missed it” will encounter a higher-time-frame market that is in fact just warming up: “Above three dollars I get even more bullish. The higher this goes, the more bullish it becomes—up to a point, of course.” Related Reading: XRP Eyes $2.50 Decision Zone As Macro Wave Structure Takes Shape Forrest offered a ladder of profit-taking zones: $7–10 — initial resistance where early longs may start trimming. $17–37 — an intermediate band calibrated from Fibonacci extensions and prior percentage moves. $73 — the “absolute” target, projected by measuring the full height of the 2017 breakout and extending it from the current flag’s pivot. He acknowledged that the $73 figure “sounds crazy” with XRP trading near $2.28 at the time of the stream but argued that similarly outsized moves materialised in past crypto supercycles. During the 2017 run, XRP advanced roughly 1,400% from its breakout flag; applying a comparable ratio to today’s structure yields Forrest’s upper bound. While the tone remained unambiguously bullish, the analyst did outline scenarios that would invalidate the thesis. A decisive breakdown below the present trading range—he cited the $1.80–1.90 area—could force a “round-trip” to the mid-$1 zone and delay the upward resolution. For now, however, he sees range-bound price action as constructive: “As long as we’re holding range, I’m not entertaining the deep retrace.” Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash – Here Are The Targets Forrest also distinguished between holding spot XRP—“a no-brainer”—and employing leverage, reminding viewers that structural targets are measured in months and that leveraged positions may not survive interim volatility. Sistine Research’s macro overlay remains resolutely pro-risk through the summer. The firm’s proprietary “Bitcoin Blueprint” identified the 7 June–21 June window as a historically bullish pocket. That seasonal tailwind, combined with the technical setup, underpins Forrest’s conviction that XRP will continue to outperform not only rival tokens but also traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, which the firm nonetheless holds as portfolio hedges. Whether XRP can emulate its 2017 trajectory will depend on broader liquidity conditions, regulatory milestones in the ongoing SEC litigation, and the extent to which institutional flows diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yet the Sistine Research desk is positioned as though the heavy lifting is already under way: “It’s slowed down a little recently, but I expect this overall trend to continue.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.

Find Satoshi Lab (FSL), the innovative force behind popular applications like Stepn, MOOAR, and Gas Hero, is expanding its financial infrastructure. They’ve just announced the launch of a brand-new digital asset: the FSL stablecoin , officially named GGUSD. This isn’t just any stablecoin. GGUSD is designed to offer stability and reliability by being pegged to the U.S. dollar and crucially, backed by U.S. Treasuries. This strategic move aims to provide users within the growing FSL ecosystem with a dependable medium of exchange and store of value. The launch is a collaborative effort with Agora, a governance platform known for its expertise in stablecoin architecture. What is GGUSD and How Does it Work? At its core, GGUSD is a digital token designed to maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. Unlike some algorithmic stablecoins that rely on complex code and market incentives, GGUSD adopts a more traditional, asset-backed model. Here’s a breakdown: USD Peg: One GGUSD token is intended to always be worth approximately one U.S. dollar. U.S. Treasury Backing: The primary reserve asset for GGUSD will be short-term U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries. This is considered one of the safest and most liquid asset classes globally. Transparency and Audits: While initial details are emerging, asset-backed stablecoins typically involve regular audits and public reporting of reserve holdings to ensure the backing is verifiable. Agora’s involvement suggests a focus on robust governance and transparency frameworks. Minting and Redemption: The process for minting (creating) and redeeming (destroying) GGUSD tokens will be linked to the deposit and withdrawal of the underlying reserve assets, ensuring the supply remains balanced with the reserves. The choice to back GGUSD with U.S. Treasuries is significant. It positions the stablecoin as a potentially more secure option compared to those backed by less stable assets or those that rely purely on algorithmic mechanisms, which have faced challenges in the past. Why a U.S. Treasury Stablecoin ? The Power of Reliable Reserves The decision by FSL and Agora to structure GGUSD as a U.S. Treasury stablecoin is a strategic response to market demand for stability and trust. Backing a stablecoin with U.S. government debt offers several key advantages: Benefits of U.S. Treasury Backing: High Security: U.S. Treasury securities are widely regarded as among the safest investments in the world, carrying minimal credit risk. Liquidity: The market for U.S. Treasuries is deep and highly liquid, meaning they can be bought and sold easily without significantly impacting their price. This is crucial for ensuring that GGUSD can maintain its peg and handle redemptions efficiently, even during periods of market stress. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): While stablecoin regulations are evolving globally, stablecoins backed by highly regulated and understood assets like U.S. Treasuries may face a clearer path compared to those with more complex or novel reserve structures. Yield Potential: Holding yield-bearing assets like Treasury bills can potentially generate revenue from the reserves, which can be used to cover operational costs or potentially benefit the ecosystem in other ways (though specifics on yield distribution, if any, are typically detailed in the stablecoin’s whitepaper or documentation). This backing model aligns GGUSD with some of the largest and most trusted stablecoins in the market, signaling FSL’s commitment to building a reliable financial layer for its users. Integrating GGUSD into the Stepn Ecosystem and Beyond One of the most exciting aspects of the GGUSD launch is its planned integration into the broader Stepn ecosystem . FSL has cultivated a large and active user base across its various applications, and introducing a native, reliable stablecoin can significantly enhance the user experience and unlock new possibilities. How might GGUSD function within the ecosystem? In-App Purchases & Transactions: GGUSD could become a primary currency for buying/selling NFTs (like Stepn sneakers, MOOAR assets), participating in marketplace activities, and potentially for in-game transactions or upgrades within future FSL games like Gas Hero. Earned Rewards: While speculative, there’s potential for users to earn rewards or participate in activities denominated or paid out in GGUSD. DeFi Opportunities: Integration could extend to DeFi protocols built within or connected to the FSL ecosystem, allowing users to lend, borrow, or provide liquidity using GGUSD. Bridging Fiat and Crypto: A well-integrated stablecoin makes it easier for users to move value between traditional fiat currency and the FSL Web3 environment. The success of GGUSD within the ecosystem will depend on seamless integration and clear utility. By making transactions smoother and providing a stable store of value, FSL aims to deepen user engagement and facilitate economic activity across its platforms. The Broader Impact: GGUSD and the Crypto Stablecoin Landscape The introduction of GGUSD also has implications for the wider crypto stablecoin market. As a new entrant backed by high-quality reserves and launched by a prominent Web3 entity like FSL, it adds another player to a competitive space dominated by giants like USDT, USDC, and FDUSD. GGUSD’s entry highlights a growing trend towards stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, particularly U.S. Treasuries. This trend is driven by a desire for greater transparency, stability, and regulatory alignment following past market events that impacted less robust stablecoin models. While GGUSD is initially focused on the FSL ecosystem, its design and backing could position it for broader adoption over time, potentially becoming a significant player in the overall crypto stablecoin market if it gains traction and trust. What Does This Mean for Users and the Ecosystem? For existing users of Stepn, MOOAR, or Gas Hero, the arrival of GGUSD promises a more integrated and potentially more stable financial experience within the ecosystem. It could simplify transactions, reduce volatility when holding value within the apps, and open up new ways to interact economically. For those outside the FSL ecosystem, GGUSD represents a new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin option with a strong backing structure, potentially offering an alternative for stability and transfer of value within the broader crypto space. Actionable Insight: Keep an eye on official announcements from FSL regarding the specific rollout plan for GGUSD within each of their applications. Understand how to acquire, use, and potentially redeem GGUSD as it becomes available. Conclusion: A Stable Foundation for FSL’s Future? The launch of GGUSD, the new FSL stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasuries and developed in collaboration with Agora, marks a significant step for Find Satoshi Lab. By introducing a seemingly robust and reliable crypto stablecoin directly into the heart of its popular platforms like Stepn, FSL is building a more stable and integrated economic environment for its millions of users. Positioning GGUSD as a U.S. Treasury stablecoin leverages the perceived safety and liquidity of traditional finance’s most trusted assets, aiming to instill confidence and facilitate seamless transactions. As GGUSD rolls out and integrates deeper into the Stepn ecosystem and beyond, its success will be a key indicator of FSL’s ability to build not just engaging applications, but also a resilient and self-contained digital economy. This move reflects the maturing nature of the Web3 space, where established projects are focusing on foundational financial infrastructure to support sustainable growth and user adoption.

While Bitcoin (BTC) often sets the pace, recent data suggests a notable split in sentiment and activity, particularly when comparing the leading cryptocurrency to its closest competitor, Ethereum (ETH). Understanding this divergence is crucial for anyone navigating the current crypto market analysis . Unpacking the Cautious Bitcoin Sentiment Despite Bitcoin’s inherent strength and recent attempts to push higher, the mood among market participants appears surprisingly subdued. According to a recent research report from K33, there’s a clear undercurrent of caution surrounding BTC. This isn’t just a feeling; the data points to specific indicators: Negative Daily Funding Rates: On major exchanges like Binance, perpetual contract funding rates for BTC/USDT pairs have turned negative on a daily basis. Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders holding long and short positions. Negative rates typically mean short position holders are paying long position holders, suggesting bearish sentiment or an expectation of prices falling. Low Weekly Funding Rates: Zooming out, the weekly funding rates paint a similar picture of muted enthusiasm. At just 1.3% annualized, this figure is significantly lower than what’s typically seen during periods of strong bullish momentum and high leverage demand for Bitcoin. As highlighted by reports, this combination of negative daily and low weekly funding rates signals investor skepticism and a notable lack of aggressive leverage being deployed on Bitcoin positions. Traders aren’t betting heavily on immediate upward price movements, preferring a more reserved stance. Why the Sudden Surge in Ethereum Leverage ? In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s cautious mood, Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a significant uptick in derivatives market activity. Data indicates a clear surge in leverage demand for ETH. How do we know this? The key metric here is Open Interest (OI) in Ethereum’s derivatives markets. Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts (like futures or perpetuals) that have not been settled. An increase in open interest, particularly when accompanied by rising prices or stable funding rates (not plunging into negative territory like BTC), suggests new money and leverage are entering the market specifically for ETH. The growing OI in Ethereum derivatives points to traders becoming increasingly comfortable taking leveraged positions on ETH, anticipating potential price appreciation or capitalizing on other market dynamics related to the Ethereum ecosystem. This creates a fascinating dichotomy within the broader crypto market analysis . What Does This Divergence Mean for the Crypto Market Analysis ? The contrasting signals from Bitcoin and Ethereum are more than just interesting data points; they offer valuable insights into current market dynamics and potential future trends. Here are a few interpretations and implications: Rotation or Sector Focus: This could indicate a rotation of capital or attention away from Bitcoin’s immediate price action towards opportunities perceived within the Ethereum ecosystem or the broader altcoin market that often follows ETH’s lead. Ethereum-Specific Catalysts: The increased interest in ETH leverage might be driven by anticipation of specific Ethereum network developments, upgrades, or the ongoing appeal of staking yields and DeFi activity. Risk Appetite Indicator: While overall market sentiment might be cautious (as shown by BTC), the willingness to take leveraged bets on ETH suggests that risk appetite hasn’t vanished entirely, but is being selectively applied to assets perceived to have stronger near-term catalysts or growth potential. Potential for Volatility: A buildup of leverage, especially in a single asset like ETH, can increase market volatility. While it can fuel upward moves, it also creates the risk of cascading liquidations if the price moves unfavorably, potentially impacting the entire market. Diving Deeper: Understanding BTC Funding Rates and ETH Open Interest For traders and investors, keeping a close eye on metrics like funding rates and open interest is crucial for understanding market positioning and potential price movements. Let’s break them down further: BTC Funding Rates: Purpose: To keep the perpetual contract price anchored to the spot price. How it Works: If perpetual price > spot price, funding rate is positive, longs pay shorts. If perpetual price Current Signal: Negative daily and low weekly rates for BTC suggest perpetual price is trading at or below spot, indicating bearish or neutral sentiment and low demand for leveraged long positions. ETH Open Interest: Purpose: Measures the total number of active derivatives contracts. How it Works: OI increases when new contracts are opened, decreases when contracts are closed. Current Signal: Rising OI for ETH, especially if accompanied by stable or positive funding rates, indicates increasing participation and leverage in the market, often seen as a bullish sign if price is also moving up or sideways constructively. Comparing BTC funding rates and ETH open interest provides a nuanced view. It’s not simply that the whole market is cautious; rather, there’s a distinct difference in how traders are approaching these two major assets. Challenges and Opportunities This market structure presents both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Uncertainty for Bitcoin: Low leverage and cautious sentiment could make it harder for Bitcoin to sustain significant upward moves without a strong catalyst. Risk in Ethereum Leverage: While rising OI can be bullish, high leverage increases the risk of sharp pullbacks and liquidations if market conditions change rapidly. Interpreting Signals: Disparate signals from BTC and ETH can make overall market direction harder to predict. Opportunities: Potential for ETH Momentum: The surge in leverage could fuel further upward price action for Ethereum if positive sentiment holds. Identifying Relative Strength: This divergence helps identify which parts of the market are currently attracting more speculative interest. Strategic Positioning: Understanding where leverage is concentrated allows traders to anticipate potential volatility points. Actionable Insights Given the current landscape, what should market participants consider? Risk Management: Be mindful of increased volatility, especially in ETH. Use stop-losses and manage position sizes carefully if trading with leverage. Diversification: Consider how this divergence fits into your overall portfolio strategy. Are you overexposed to one asset based on these contrasting signals? Monitor Key Metrics: Continue watching BTC funding rates and ETH open interest closely, alongside price action, for shifts in sentiment and positioning. Look for Catalysts: Pay attention to news and developments specific to both Bitcoin and Ethereum that could shift the current dynamics. Conclusion The current crypto market analysis reveals a compelling split: a cautious mood hanging over Bitcoin, reflected in negative and low funding rates, versus a clear surge in leverage demand and open interest for Ethereum. This divergence highlights that while broader market sentiment might be reserved, specific sectors or assets are attracting significant speculative interest. Understanding these underlying dynamics, particularly the signals from BTC funding rates and ETH open interest , is vital for navigating the opportunities and risks in today’s complex digital asset landscape. Whether this leads to a period of ETH outperformance or a eventual convergence of sentiment remains to be seen, but the current setup demands attention.

China’s Contribution: The agreement reportedly includes China providing rare earths and magnets upfront. These materials are critical components in numerous high-tech industries, from electronics to renewable energy and defense. China currently dominates the global supply of rare earths. U.S. Contribution: In exchange, the U.S. is set to provide Chinese students with access to U.S. colleges. This speaks to a potential thawing in educational and cultural exchanges, which have also faced scrutiny amid trade tensions. Tariff Structure: A notable part of the deal involves a specific tariff structure. The U.S. is expected to receive 55% tariffs on certain goods, while China will impose 10%. This asymmetrical structure suggests specific strategic concessions or targets within the trade relationship. Relationship Status: Trump characterized the relationship between the two nations as “excellent” following this development. This contrasts sharply with periods of intense trade friction seen in recent years. This proposed agreement signals a potential pivot in the dynamic between the world’s two largest economies, moving from a stance of confrontation on trade to one of structured cooperation, at least according to this announcement. The specifics, particularly around tariffs and key resources like rare earths, highlight strategic considerations at play in Global Trade Agreement negotiations. Understanding the Historical Context of US China Trade Relations To fully appreciate the significance of this potential Trump China Trade Deal , it helps to look back at the recent history of US China Trade Relations . The past few years have been marked by periods of escalating tariffs, trade disputes, and increased competition across various sectors, including technology and supply chains. Previous administrations, including Trump’s first term, engaged in intense trade negotiations that resulted in agreements like the “Phase One” trade deal signed in January 2020. That agreement aimed to address issues like intellectual property, currency manipulation, and increased purchases of U.S. goods and services by China, while leaving many structural issues unresolved and maintaining significant tariffs. The current announcement, if finalized, would represent a distinct new chapter, potentially moving beyond the previous framework and introducing new elements like the specific focus on rare earths and educational access. The characterization of the relationship as “excellent” also suggests a significant shift in diplomatic tone surrounding Global Trade Agreement discussions. The Critical Role of the Rare Earths Supply Chain One of the most compelling details in the announced Trump China Trade Deal is China’s commitment to supplying rare earths and magnets upfront. This component is particularly relevant when discussing global supply chain security and strategic resources. Rare earth elements are a group of 17 chemical elements essential for manufacturing numerous high-tech products, including electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, smartphones, and advanced military equipment. China currently controls a vast majority of the world’s rare earth mining, processing, and refining capacity, giving it significant leverage in the global market. Concerns about the security and stability of the Rare Earths Supply Chain have been a major point of discussion for many nations, including the U.S. Securing a reliable supply from China through a trade agreement could potentially alleviate some of these concerns for U.S. manufacturers and strategic industries. Conversely, it reinforces China’s position as a crucial player in this vital supply chain, highlighting the interdependence that exists despite broader trade tensions. The implications for industries relying on these materials are significant, and shifts in this supply chain can have a tangible Economic Impact on Markets related to technology and manufacturing. How Might This Global Trade Agreement Impact the Economy and Markets? Any major development in US China Trade Relations has the potential to send ripples through global markets. The announced Trump China Trade Deal is no exception. While the full Economic Impact on Markets will depend on the final details and implementation, we can speculate on potential effects: Market Confidence: A finalized agreement could boost investor confidence by reducing uncertainty surrounding trade policy between the two economic giants. Reduced trade friction is generally seen as positive for global economic growth. Industry Impacts: Industries reliant on rare earths and magnets could see more stable supply chains, potentially impacting costs and production capabilities. Conversely, industries affected by the proposed 55% U.S. tariffs or 10% Chinese tariffs would need to adjust. Inflation: Changes in tariff rates can influence the cost of imported goods, potentially impacting inflation rates in both countries. Currency Fluctuations: Major trade agreements can sometimes influence currency valuations as capital flows react to changing economic outlooks and trade balances. Geopolitical Stability: Improved trade relations could signal a period of greater stability, which often correlates with positive market sentiment. For those following the cryptocurrency market, while not directly tied to a trade deal, macroeconomic factors and overall market sentiment play a significant role. A generally positive outlook on global trade and economic stability stemming from a successful Global Trade Agreement could contribute to a risk-on environment, which can sometimes benefit assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unforeseen challenges or negative reactions to the deal’s specifics could introduce volatility. Potential Benefits and Challenges of the Trump China Trade Deal Like any complex international agreement, this potential Trump China Trade Deal comes with potential upsides and challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Stability: A formal agreement can provide businesses with greater predictability compared to ongoing trade disputes. Supply Chain Security: Assured access to critical resources like rare earths could strengthen strategic industries. Educational Exchange: Increased access for Chinese students to U.S. colleges fosters cultural ties and potential future collaborations. Reduced Costs: Depending on how the tariffs are applied and potentially reduced on other goods not mentioned, consumers and businesses could see lower costs. Improved Relations: A positive trade outcome could pave the way for cooperation on other global issues. Potential Challenges: Tariff Impact: The high 55% U.S. tariff rate mentioned could significantly impact specific import categories, potentially raising costs for U.S. businesses and consumers. Dependence on China: While securing rare earths is a benefit, it also solidifies dependence on China for critical materials. Implementation Risk: The success of the deal hinges on faithful implementation by both sides. Impact on Other Nations: A bilateral deal of this magnitude can impact global trade flows and may be viewed differently by other trading partners. Details Matter: Without the full text, it’s hard to assess the comprehensive impact; the devil is often in the details of a Global Trade Agreement . Analyzing these points helps paint a more complete picture of the potential ramifications of shifts in US China Trade Relations . What Does This Mean for Market Sentiment and Crypto Investors? While the announcement of a Trump China Trade Deal doesn’t directly mention Bitcoin or Ethereum, significant macroeconomic events like this contribute to the broader economic climate and investor sentiment. The Economic Impact on Markets from such a deal can influence risk appetite globally. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility and sensitivity to macro news, including inflation data, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical developments. A perceived positive development in Global Trade Agreement talks between the U.S. and China could be interpreted by some investors as a signal of potential economic stability or growth, which might encourage investment in riskier assets like crypto. Conversely, if the market perceives challenges in the deal’s details, implementation, or its impact on specific sectors, it could lead to uncertainty and potentially negative sentiment. Crypto investors should watch how traditional markets react to this news and consider how broader economic trends influenced by US China Trade Relations might indirectly affect the crypto landscape. Actionable Insights for Readers: Stay Informed: Keep an eye out for official confirmations and detailed texts of the agreement from both the U.S. and Chinese governments. Monitor Market Reactions: Observe how major stock indices, commodity prices (especially those related to rare earths), and currency markets react to the news. Assess Macro Trends: Consider how potential shifts in trade dynamics and the resulting Economic Impact on Markets fit into your overall investment thesis, including for cryptocurrencies. Look Beyond the Headlines: Understand that initial announcements are often followed by complex implementation phases and potential unforeseen consequences. Conclusion: A New Chapter in US China Trade Relations? The announcement of a seemingly “done” Trump China Trade Deal marks a potentially pivotal moment in US China Trade Relations . With key elements like the Rare Earths Supply Chain , educational access, and specific tariffs outlined, the agreement could reshape aspects of global commerce and have a tangible Economic Impact on Markets worldwide. While pending final approval, the positive framing by Trump suggests a desire to move towards a more cooperative phase. The success and long-term effects of this potential Global Trade Agreement will unfold over time, influencing various industries and contributing to the complex tapestry of global economic dynamics that investors, including those in the crypto space, continuously navigate.

An investor will ride the wave of euphoria one day as prices peak, and then, the next, they’ll be coping with losses as the market takes a sudden and sharp turn. This pattern was seen at the beginning of 2025, when declines in Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP signaled a rough start to the year. While it’s impossible to know if this decrease was caused by geopolitical concerns or economic instability, both put the market to the test. But following some periods of uncertainty, the crypto market has shown strong signs of revival. On May 14, 2025, Bitcoin reached a high of $104,159.98, and Ethereum peaked at $2,680.23, showing increasing confidence of investors as the market shows signs of recovery. With the first half of 2025 well underway, investors are examining past events to assess the market’s direction for the remainder of the year. Many are eying crypto reserves, as accumulating assets like BTC , ETH and a few other leading currencies is seen as having potential for continued growth. Yet, the extent of this impact remains uncertain. What’s the point of a crypto reserve Countries worldwide have strategic reserves, which they intend to draw from during supply shortages. For instance, different stockpiles are used to protect resources in the United States. Over 50 years ago, the US created the Petroleum Reserve , an oil stockpile with a total capacity of 727 million barrels to guard against supply interruptions. Around the world, governments have started assessing the benefits of adopting crypto reserves, mainly as a result of their demand over the past decade. As DeFi (decentralized finance) continues to become a hot topic, some countries have already acquired digital assets, creating a stockpile as they gain increased legitimacy worldwide. In response to this trend, some have already begun acquiring digital assets to build a collection of cryptocurrencies as they gain increased legitimacy. In Bitcoin’s case, its scarcity makes it even more attractive for governments to acquire. Bhutan, for example, a country sandwiched between India and Tibet, has emerged as an unexpected crypto holder. In the past few months, its government has moved over $63 million worth of BTC into three different wallets, one reportedly containing 600 BTC. Before returning to the Oval Office in November 2024, President Trump shared his plans to advance pro-crypto legislation, openly discussing his goal of creating a national crypto reserve. In March 2025, this became a reality when he signed an executive order establishing the country’s first Bitcoin reserve. As the market continues on this unpredictable path, many have questioned whether introducing global crypto reserves could be a legitimate remedy for stabilizing the market during periods of volatility. Are crypto reserves investors’ saving grace It’s easy to see why people believe that as governments acquire crypto and stockpile it, prices should rise, investor confidence should be strengthened and mainstream acceptance should accelerate. This perspective has inspired broader discussions within governments. A couple of months back, in April 2025, two Swedish lawmakers encouraged Elizabeth Svantesson, the country’s finance minister, to consider adding Bitcoin to the national reserves. They shared that introducing a Bitcoin reserve would help stay ahead of inflation amid growing geopolitical uncertainty. Similarly, in January 2025, the Czech National Bank governor discussed the possibility of adding a crypto reserve. When Trump initially announced the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve, the news generated some noise. Yet, the market’s response was relatively conservative, dropping five percent after the announcement. Despite national-level movements, US states have begun processing approvals at the state level, with 18 proposals from different states currently pending approval. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, for example, signed Senate Bill HB 2749, which updated the state’s unclaimed property laws to include digital assets. This law allows the state to retain unclaimed crypto in its original form if the owner remains unresponsive after three years, signaling a shift in how assets are valued on a state scale. This would be a welcome turn towards crypto-friendly legislation and a sign of things to come for broader adoption and increased acceptance throughout the state. On May 6, 2025, in the northeastern part of the country, New Hampshire was the first US state to allow its government to invest in virtual currencies and hold a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302 , which allows the state treasurer to invest up to five percent of public funds in digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion. Given the fluctuations in the financial market, some might consider it unsuitable for investment. On the other hand, some evaluate it through a bullish lens, recognizing its growth potential as an opportunity to purchase at a lower cost before the market rebounds. While a crypto reserve offers strategic advantages – especially for countries looking to diversify from traditional currencies – its current role is more complementary than the main driver. Whether a crypto reserve would be powerful enough to turn the market 180 degrees is still unknown. When nations build digital reserves and suggest establishing crypto reserves, demand inherently increases. But this general stability depends on a wide range of factors, such as broader macroeconomic trends, institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. While it would be simplistic to assume that crypto reserves could shield against market volatility, it will take time to see their impact. Until then, events, concepts and innovations will continue to shape the trajectory of both traditional and digital financial markets.

Big news is buzzing around the Solana ecosystem. A promising project called SOON has just secured a significant funding boost, setting its sights on two of the hottest trends in the blockchain space: AI-powered trading and the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA). This isn’t just another funding round; it signals growing confidence in projects building on Solana and exploring innovative use cases. What’s the Big Deal About SOON’s $5M Crypto Funding? According to reports from The Block, SOON successfully raised $5 million in strategic funding. This isn’t coming from just anywhere; the round saw participation from major players like Jump Crypto, Amber Group, and a collection of angel investors. When established names like these invest, it often lends significant credibility and momentum to a project. The $5 million injection is earmarked for several key areas that could dramatically shape SOON’s future and potentially impact the broader Solana landscape. The core focus areas highlighted are: Further development of their foundational Blockchain Infrastructure . Aggressive expansion into the burgeoning Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Enhancing and deploying their cutting-edge AI Trading platform. This strategic funding isn’t just about having more capital; it’s about accelerating development, expanding market reach, and attracting top talent to build out their vision on Solana . Why Build on Solana for AI Trading and RWA? SOON’s choice of Solana as its base isn’t surprising. Solana is renowned for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and fast confirmation times. These characteristics are particularly crucial for applications like AI Trading , which often require rapid execution of trades based on real-time data analysis. A slow or expensive network would severely hinder the effectiveness of an AI-driven strategy. Similarly, tokenizing Real World Assets (RWA) involves creating digital representations of physical or traditional financial assets on a blockchain. This process can involve frequent transfers, fractional ownership, and potentially complex financial operations. Solana’s efficiency makes it a strong contender for handling the volume and speed required for a scalable RWA platform. Key advantages of building on Solana for SOON include: Solana Feature Benefit for SOON Relevance to AI Trading/RWA High Throughput Handles large volume of transactions Essential for high-frequency AI Trading and RWA token transfers Low Costs Reduces operational expenses for users and the platform Makes frequent AI trades and RWA fractional ownership more viable Fast Finality Quick confirmation of transactions Crucial for timely execution in AI Trading and secure RWA transfers Developer Ecosystem Access to tools and talent Supports rapid development of complex Blockchain Infrastructure and applications Leveraging Solana’s robust Blockchain Infrastructure provides SOON with a solid foundation upon which to build its ambitious AI and RWA platforms. Diving into AI Trading: How Does SOON Plan to Use AI? SOON’s focus on an AI Trading platform, specifically copy trading, is intriguing. Copy trading allows users to automatically replicate the trades of successful traders. By integrating AI, SOON likely aims to enhance the selection and performance of these strategies. Potential ways AI could be utilized in SOON’s platform: Strategy Optimization: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of market data to identify profitable trading strategies or refine existing ones. Risk Management: AI can help assess and manage risk associated with different trading strategies, potentially offering users more stable options. Trader Selection: AI might be used to identify and rank successful traders based on various performance metrics beyond simple profit, such as risk-adjusted returns or consistency. Market Prediction: While challenging, AI could potentially offer insights or signals based on predictive analysis of market trends. The $5 million in Crypto Funding will likely be instrumental in hiring AI experts, developing sophisticated algorithms, and building the user interface for this copy trading platform. The goal is likely to make advanced trading strategies accessible to a wider audience on the Solana network. Exploring Real World Assets (RWA): What Opportunities Lie Ahead? The tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA) is widely considered the next major frontier for blockchain technology. It involves bringing tangible or traditional financial assets onto the blockchain, unlocking liquidity and new forms of ownership. Examples of assets that can be tokenized as RWA include: Real Estate (commercial and residential properties) Art and Collectibles Commodities (gold, oil) Private Equity and Debt Invoices and Receivables Carbon Credits SOON’s expansion into RWA suggests they plan to build the necessary Blockchain Infrastructure on Solana to facilitate the issuance, management, and trading of these tokenized assets. This could involve creating legal frameworks, compliance mechanisms, and platforms for investors to access these new asset classes. The benefits of RWA tokenization include increased liquidity, fractional ownership (allowing smaller investments in high-value assets), transparency, and potentially faster settlement times compared to traditional markets. With the new Crypto Funding , SOON is positioned to become a significant player in bringing these opportunities to the Solana ecosystem. Strengthening the Core: Blockchain Infrastructure Development Beyond the flashy applications of AI Trading and Real World Assets , a significant portion of the funding will support the development of SOON’s core Blockchain Infrastructure . This is the less visible but equally crucial part of the project. Developing robust infrastructure involves: Building secure and efficient smart contracts on Solana . Developing necessary backend systems for data management and processing. Ensuring scalability to handle future growth in users and asset classes. Implementing necessary security measures to protect user funds and data. Creating tools and APIs for developers who might want to build on SOON’s platform. A strong foundation is essential for the success of both the AI Trading and RWA initiatives. The investment from Jump Crypto and Amber Group underscores the importance of this underlying technology. What Does This Mean for the Solana Ecosystem? SOON’s successful Crypto Funding round and its focus areas are positive signs for the entire Solana ecosystem. It demonstrates that significant capital is still flowing into innovative projects building on the network. The expansion into AI Trading and Real World Assets brings new use cases and potentially new users and liquidity to Solana. As SOON develops its Blockchain Infrastructure , it could also contribute to the overall strength and utility of the Solana network. Successful RWA platforms, in particular, have the potential to onboard trillions of dollars in value into the blockchain space over the coming years, and projects like SOON on Solana are aiming to capture a piece of that market. Challenges and the Path Forward While the funding is a major win, SOON will face challenges. The AI Trading space is competitive, requiring sophisticated technology and proven performance. The Real World Assets sector involves complex legal and regulatory hurdles in different jurisdictions. Building robust Blockchain Infrastructure is an ongoing task requiring constant security audits and updates. However, with $5 million in strategic Crypto Funding and the backing of experienced investors like Jump Crypto and Amber Group, SOON is well-positioned to tackle these challenges. Their success will depend on execution, regulatory navigation, and the ability to deliver value through their platforms on Solana . Actionable Insights for Readers For those interested in the Solana ecosystem, AI Trading , or Real World Assets , SOON is a project worth watching. Keep an eye on their development progress, particularly regarding the launch and performance of their AI copy trading platform and their steps in the RWA space. Understanding the potential of projects like SOON can provide valuable insights into the future direction of the crypto market and the Solana network. Conclusion: A Bright Future Fueled by Funding and Innovation SOON’s $5 million strategic Crypto Funding round marks a significant milestone.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says dollar-pegged stablecoins could grow into a $2 trillion market. He believes these coins can make the U.S. dollar stronger and more widely used worldwide. With new legislation on the way, stablecoins may soon become a core part of U.S. finance. Stablecoins Pegged to USD to Hit $2 T During a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Bessent didn’t present stablecoins as a threat to the current financial system. Instead, he called them the next evolution of the U.S. dollar’s journey. With strong rules in place, requiring full backing by Treasury bills and other short-term U.S. debt, stablecoins could go mainstream without risking financial stability. He estimated that the market value of stablecoins could reach $2 trillion in the coming years. Supporting this outlook, a fresh report by the Citi Institute hints at an even more optimistic picture, projecting stablecoin issuance to soar to $3.7 trillion by 2030. What’s the goal? Spread dollar-based digital assets around the world, increase demand for U.S. debt, and make the dollar even more central to global trade and finance. Congress is catching up fast. The Senate just cleared a key vote on a stablecoin bill, and it’s likely to become law soon. Meanwhile, President Trump supports it, crypto lobbyists are fully behind it, and even major retailers see benefits. For them, stablecoins offer a cheaper, faster alternative to credit card giants like Visa and Mastercard. Not Everyone’s on Board Banks are split. Small banks worry that stablecoins could drain deposits and hurt local lending. Meanwhile, big banks are taking a different route, creating their own stablecoins to retain customers and earn interest from their reserves. Retailers, on the other hand, want more than just stablecoin support. They’re pushing for changes that would break the dominance of Visa and Mastercard. But the Senate is likely to block those efforts, and a separate move to stop Trump from profiting off crypto while in office. If this bill passes, the U.S. dollar could quietly go digital in the form of regulated, debt-backed stablecoins. And that may be just what policymakers want.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 03:49:38

PayPal has just announced a significant move that could redefine how businesses handle transactions globally: bringing its PayPal PYUSD stablecoin to the Stellar (XLM) blockchain. This isn’t just another blockchain integration; it’s a strategic decision aimed squarely at improving efficiency and accessibility in cross-border payments and payment financing, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. PayPal PYUSD Arrives on Stellar Blockchain The news that the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin is expanding its presence is big for the crypto and payments industries. Initially launched on Ethereum and later adding support for Solana, PayPal’s stablecoin is now set to embrace the Stellar blockchain. Stellar is well-known for its focus on fast, low-cost transactions, making it a natural fit for payment-centric applications. According to reports, the primary goal of this move is to leverage Stellar’s capabilities to enhance international money transfers and provide businesses with better access to real-time working capital. Why Stellar, you might ask? Stellar was built specifically for payments and aims to connect financial institutions and payment networks. Its infrastructure is designed for speed and affordability, which are critical factors for efficient cross-border transactions. By bringing PYUSD onto Stellar, PayPal is tapping into a network optimized for the very use cases it seeks to improve. This strategic move has already cleared a significant hurdle, receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The integration is currently undergoing final review before it officially goes live, signaling that the launch is imminent. Boosting Cross-Border Payments with PYUSD One of the most compelling aspects of this stablecoin expansion is its potential impact on cross-border payments. Traditional international transfers can be slow, expensive, and complex, involving multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins like PYUSD offer a digital alternative that can potentially bypass these inefficiencies. By utilizing the Stellar blockchain, which is designed for rapid settlement and low transaction fees, PayPal aims to make sending and receiving money across borders faster and more affordable. This is particularly beneficial for businesses that rely heavily on international trade or managing global operations. Imagine a small business in the US paying a supplier in Europe or receiving payments from customers overseas – doing this quickly and cheaply can significantly improve cash flow and operational efficiency. Key advantages for cross-border payments via PYUSD on Stellar could include: Speed: Transactions can settle much faster than traditional banking methods. Cost: Lower transaction fees compared to wire transfers. Accessibility: Potentially opening up digital payment options to individuals and businesses previously underserved by traditional finance. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (Stellar’s), providing a level of transparency. How Does This Affect Digital Payments for Businesses? Beyond just sending money, the integration of PayPal PYUSD on Stellar is set to impact the broader landscape of digital payments , especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The ability to access real-time working capital is a game-changer. Think about a business that needs to pay for inventory or cover immediate expenses while waiting for customer payments to clear. With PYUSD on Stellar, they could potentially receive financing or advances quickly in stablecoin form, which can then be easily used for payments within the digital ecosystem or potentially converted to local currency. This provides a level of financial flexibility that many SMEs currently lack. Traditional financing often involves lengthy approval processes and delays in fund disbursement. A digital, stablecoin-based approach could offer near-instant access to funds, allowing businesses to seize opportunities or manage unexpected costs more effectively. The expansion also strengthens PayPal’s position in the evolving digital asset space. By offering PYUSD on multiple prominent blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, and now Stellar), PayPal is increasing the accessibility and potential use cases for its stablecoin, solidifying its role as a key player in the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology. The Strategic Importance of Stellar Blockchain Integration The choice of the Stellar blockchain for this expansion is highly strategic. While Ethereum is the largest smart contract platform and Solana offers high throughput, Stellar’s specific design for payments and remittances aligns perfectly with PayPal’s stated goals for PYUSD. Stellar’s network is known for its stability and focus on regulatory compliance, which is essential for a major financial institution like PayPal. This move also signals a potential shift in how large companies view blockchain technology. It’s not just about speculative assets; it’s about leveraging distributed ledger technology to solve real-world problems in payments and finance. PayPal’s commitment to using PYUSD across different blockchains demonstrates a multi-chain strategy, recognizing that different networks may be better suited for different purposes. The NYDFS approval is particularly noteworthy. New York is a major financial hub with stringent regulations. Getting the green light from the NYDFS indicates that the integration meets necessary compliance standards, which is crucial for building trust and encouraging broader adoption of PYUSD for financial applications. What Comes Next? With the integration awaiting final review, the crypto and finance communities are watching closely. The successful launch of PYUSD on Stellar could pave the way for increased adoption of stablecoins for practical payment use cases. It could also encourage other large financial institutions to explore similar integrations. This development is a testament to the growing maturity of the stablecoin market and the increasing interest from mainstream financial players. As the ecosystem evolves, we can expect to see more innovative uses of stablecoins for everything from remittances and international trade to micropayments and supply chain finance. In conclusion, PayPal’s decision to bring its PYUSD stablecoin to the Stellar blockchain is a significant development. It underscores the growing importance of stablecoins in enhancing cross-border payments and providing vital financial tools like real-time working capital to businesses. With regulatory approval in hand, this expansion is poised to boost the utility and reach of PYUSD, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets.

While our focus is often on the exciting world of digital assets, paying attention to traditional financial markets, especially the US Stock Market Open , is crucial. Why? Because the movements in stocks, particularly major indices, often provide valuable insights into broader economic health and investor appetite for risk – factors that significantly influence the cryptocurrency landscape. Today, we’re seeing a positive start on Wall Street, with major indices opening higher. This upward movement is noteworthy and something investors across all asset classes should consider. Understanding Today’s US Stock Market Open The US Stock Market Open today showed a clear positive trajectory across the major indices. This follows recent trading sessions and reflects the current mood among investors as trading for the day begins. Here’s a quick look at how the key indices performed right out of the gate: Index Change S&P 500 +0.18% NASDAQ Composite +0.24% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.04% While these initial gains might seem modest, a positive open sets a tone for the trading day and can indicate underlying strength or confidence in the market. What Drives Stock Market Performance? Analyzing Stock Market Performance involves looking at a variety of factors. Today’s positive open could be attributed to several potential drivers: Positive Economic Data: Recent reports on employment, manufacturing, or consumer confidence can paint an optimistic picture, encouraging buying activity. Corporate Earnings: Strong performance reports from major companies can boost overall market sentiment. Federal Reserve Outlook: Expectations regarding interest rates or monetary policy can significantly impact market direction. A perceived dovish stance or stability often favors stocks. Global Market Cues: Performance in Asian and European markets overnight can influence the mood on Wall Street. Understanding these drivers helps contextualize the daily movements and provides a clearer picture of the forces shaping Stock Market Performance . Spotlight on NASDAQ Performance The NASDAQ Performance is particularly interesting for many crypto investors. The NASDAQ Composite Index is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks. Often, these are the same types of companies that are involved in or influenced by blockchain technology, fintech, and other digital advancements. A strong NASDAQ Performance can signal a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to invest in growth-oriented, potentially higher-volatility assets. This sentiment often spills over into the crypto market, as Bitcoin and altcoins are also considered risk assets. The +0.24% gain at the open suggests positive momentum in the tech sector, which is a key area to watch for correlation with crypto trends. The Significance of the S&P 500 Index The S&P 500 Index is widely considered a benchmark for the overall health of the U.S. stock market, representing the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its movement provides a broad snapshot of market sentiment and economic conditions. A positive start for the S&P 500 Index , even a modest one like +0.18%, indicates that gains are not confined to just one sector but are potentially spread across various industries. This suggests a more generalized positive outlook among institutional and retail investors alike. Monitoring the S&P 500 gives investors a sense of the market’s breadth and underlying strength. How Does This Relate to Investor Sentiment? Today’s positive US Stock Market Open is a direct reflection of current Investor Sentiment . When markets open higher across the board, it suggests that investors are feeling optimistic about the economic outlook or specific market catalysts. Positive Investor Sentiment is a powerful force. It can lead to increased buying pressure, pushing asset prices higher. Conversely, negative sentiment can trigger sell-offs. For the crypto market, which is known for its sensitivity to market mood, strong Investor Sentiment in traditional markets is generally seen as a positive sign. It implies a greater willingness to allocate capital to assets perceived as having higher growth potential, including cryptocurrencies. What Does Positive Investor Sentiment Mean for Crypto? While not a direct one-to-one correlation, positive sentiment in stocks often creates a favorable backdrop for crypto. Here’s why: Risk-On Environment: When investors are confident, they tend to move capital into riskier assets. Both tech stocks and crypto benefit from this. Liquidity: A rising stock market can indicate ample liquidity in the financial system, some of which can flow into digital assets. Confidence Boost: General market optimism can simply make investors feel more comfortable putting money into volatile assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive open and the boost to Investor Sentiment , it’s important to remain aware of potential challenges. Market conditions can change rapidly. Factors such as unexpected inflation data, shifts in Federal Reserve commentary, geopolitical events, or regulatory news can quickly dampen optimism and reverse market trends. Both stock and crypto markets are susceptible to these external pressures. Therefore, while today’s open is positive, maintaining a balanced perspective and staying informed about broader economic and political developments is key. Looking Ahead: Actionable Insights For those tracking both stocks and crypto, here are a few actionable insights based on today’s US Stock Market Open : Monitor the Trend: Is the positive open sustained throughout the day? Continued strength reinforces the positive sentiment signal. Watch Key Data Releases: Keep an eye on upcoming economic reports scheduled for the week, as these can confirm or challenge the current market optimism. Observe Crypto Correlation: See how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react to the positive stock market movement. Does the correlation hold? Sector Focus: Pay attention to the performance of specific stock sectors, particularly technology (reflected in NASDAQ Performance), as this often has a closer link to crypto movements. Today’s positive Stock Market Performance provides a snapshot of current market confidence. By understanding the drivers behind these movements and their potential impact on Investor Sentiment , crypto enthusiasts can gain valuable context for their own investment decisions. Compelling Summary In summary, the US Stock Market Open today saw major indices like the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite posting gains. This positive Stock Market Performance is indicative of favorable Investor Sentiment as the trading day begins. While the crypto market has its own unique dynamics, the ‘risk-on’ environment suggested by a rising stock market often creates a supportive backdrop for digital assets. Keeping an eye on key indicators like the NASDAQ Performance and overall market trends helps provide a more complete picture of the financial landscape and potential influences on your crypto portfolio. Remember that markets are interconnected, and understanding traditional finance is a powerful tool for navigating the world of crypto.

The move has created renewed optimism among traders who expect ETH to rally beyond its current range and begin a new upward leg. Despite lingering global tensions, markets are responding positively to growing speculation that a trade deal between the US and China may soon be finalized, offering a temporary boost to risk assets across the board. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Decisive Level – Trading Around 200 DMA Resistance Ethereum’s recent strength comes at a critical moment, as price approaches the upper boundary of its current ascending channel. Top analyst M-log1 shared a technical analysis highlighting this structure, stating that ETH needs to break out of this current channel. Until then, price action may remain contained within the structure, with limited upside unless a decisive breakout occurs. As Ethereum pushes toward resistance, all eyes are on volume and confirmation signals that could mark the start of a broader trend. For bulls, breaking above the ascending channel could signal the beginning of a strong move toward $3,000 and beyond. Until then, Ethereum remains at a key inflection point in its cycle. Ethereum Holds The Key To Altseason Ts Bulls Eye Breakout Ethereum is now at the center of the market’s attention, as its next move could determine whether a true altseason begins. While Bitcoin continues to lead, Ethereum’s ability to reclaim higher price levels—particularly above the $2,800 mark—will be critical in confirming the start of a broader altcoin rally. So far, positive sentiment and rising price action suggest momentum is building, with ETH pushing into resistance and forming a constructive setup. Bulls have regained control in recent sessions, but the challenge now lies in escaping the current structure. M-log1 highlighted that Ethereum remains trapped in an ascending channel, a pattern that often leads to slow grinding moves until a breakout or breakdown occurs. “If we want anything significant to happen,” he noted, “then ETH needs to leave this ascending channel.” Failing to do so increases the probability of a revisit to the lower end of the range, though M-log1 clarified that this isn’t a certainty—just a probability to keep in mind. On a positive note, Ethereum’s moving averages continue to trend upward and support price from below, providing a favorable technical backdrop. As long as these levels hold and bulls remain active, the breakout scenario remains the dominant outlook. If ETH can decisively flip $2,800 into support and break above the channel structure, it could unleash a wave of capital rotation into altcoins. Until then, Ethereum holds the spotlight—and its next move will likely shape the direction of the entire market heading into summer. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level – No Clear Breakout Yet Ethereum Breaks Above Resistance But Faces Retest At Key Level Ethereum is currently trading at $2,771 on the daily chart after briefly breaking above the critical $2,800 resistance zone. This level has capped price action multiple times since early May, making this breakout attempt a significant development. However, today’s rejection from a high of $2,834 suggests that ETH is not yet ready to confirm a clean breakout and may be entering a short-term retest phase. The $2,750–$2,800 zone, now acting as immediate resistance, aligns closely with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,654.52 — a historically important level that often dictates medium-term trend direction. ETH’s recent surge above all major moving averages, including the 50-day ($2,333.32) and 100-day ($2,085.42) SMAs, reflects growing bullish momentum and a strong trend structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? If Ethereum holds above the 200-day SMA on a retest and reclaims $2,800 with follow-through, the path toward $3,000 becomes more realistic. On the other hand, failure to hold this area could result in a slide back toward the $2,600–$2,650 support zone. Volume has picked up, indicating interest, but confirmation will come from sustained price above resistance. For now, ETH remains in a promising position — but the next few candles will be key.

XRP ( XRP ) is trading at $2.26 at press time, down 1.2% daily and hovering near the midpoint of its weekly range between $2.09 and $2.33. Despite muted price action, the asset is still above a key support and showing signs of compression, often a sign of impending volatility. A slight decrease in market participation is indicated by the spot trading volume, which is down 4.1% from the previous day. However, data from Coinglass shows derivatives volume rose 9.6% to $5.06 billion, while open interest dipped 2.6% to $4.12 billion. This combination suggests that some traders are locking in gains or hedging against volatility, while others are cautiously re-entering positions ahead of a possible catalyst. That catalyst may soon arrive. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is due to submit a settlement progress update to the Court of Appeals by June 16 as part of its long-running case against Ripple. So far, there’s been little movement on the legal front since Judge Analisa Torres rejected the agency’s request for an indicative ruling.

A decision to withdraw its appeal could sharply improve XRP’s legal clarity and reopen the path toward an XRP spot exchange-traded fund, an outcome already priced in by some market participants. On Polymarket, the odds of an XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025 currently stand at 86%, with a 26% chance priced in for approval by July 31. From a technical perspective, XRP is coiling just above its 20-day moving average, where it’s spent much of the past week. The tightening of the Bollinger Bands indicates that volatility has decreased and that a more significant move may be about to occur. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The price is flirting with a group of short-term resistance levels between $2.26 and $2.30, and it is currently trading just below the 50-day estimated moving average. Bulls will require greater momentum to break through this zone, but a clear break above it would open the path toward $2.50. With the relative strength index hovering around 49, the market appears to be neutral but slightly inclined toward recovery. The MACD, meanwhile, is almost above the signal line, indicating that buying pressure is gradually building. If legal clarity leads to new inflows, a bullish break above $2.33 might bring $2.50 back into play. On the downside, XRP may fall toward the lower end of its recent range, close to $2.10, where buyers have previously stepped in if it is unable to maintain $2.20.

Try Your Best (TYB), an innovative platform leveraging distributed ledger technology, has just announced a significant milestone. The company, focused on revolutionizing Blockchain Loyalty programs, has successfully closed an $11 million Series A funding round. This substantial investment signals growing confidence in the potential of blockchain to transform how brands connect with their customers and build lasting relationships. TYB’s Vision for Blockchain Loyalty At its core, TYB is building a next-generation loyalty platform that moves beyond traditional points systems. Founded by Ty Haney, known for her previous venture Outdoor Voices, TYB aims to make loyalty more engaging and valuable for both brands and consumers. How do they plan to do this? Gamified Challenges: Instead of just earning points for purchases, users can participate in interactive challenges and activities related to the brand. Blockchain-Enabled Loyalty Profiles: Creating persistent, verifiable records of consumer engagement and rewards on the blockchain. This can potentially offer greater transparency and portability. Enhanced Consumer Connection: Building a more dynamic and direct relationship between brands and their most loyal customers. By integrating blockchain technology, TYB seeks to unlock new possibilities for loyalty programs, making them more secure, transparent, and ultimately, more rewarding for the user. The Significance of TYB Funding The recent $11 million infusion is a major boost for TYB’s expansion plans. This Series A round was notably co-led by Offline Ventures and Strobe Ventures. The participation of other prominent investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, and Unusual Ventures, underscores the strategic interest from both traditional venture capital and crypto-native investment firms. Here’s a quick look at the funding details: Funding Round Amount Raised Key Co-Leads Notable Participants Total Capital Raised Series A $11 million Offline Ventures, Strobe Ventures Coinbase Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, Unusual Ventures $23.5 million (including previous rounds) Bringing their total capital raised to $23.5 million, this funding provides TYB with the resources needed to accelerate development, onboard more brands, and scale their platform. Why Crypto Funding is Flowing into Loyalty You might wonder why venture capital, especially firms with a focus on crypto like Coinbase Ventures, are investing in a loyalty platform. The answer lies in the inherent advantages that blockchain can bring to Consumer Loyalty programs: True Ownership: Users can potentially have greater control and ownership over their loyalty assets (points, rewards). Interoperability: Blockchain tokens could potentially allow loyalty rewards to be used or traded across different platforms or brands (though this is a future possibility for many). Transparency & Security: Transactions and reward issuance can be recorded on an immutable ledger, reducing fraud and increasing trust. New Engagement Models: NFTs or other token standards can enable unique digital collectibles or tiered membership benefits tied to loyalty. Investors are recognizing that blockchain isn’t just for cryptocurrencies; it’s a foundational technology that can improve existing business models, and loyalty is a prime candidate for disruption. What This Series A Means for TYB’s Future With this fresh capital, TYB is poised for significant growth. The funding will likely be used to: Expand the engineering and product teams to enhance the platform’s features. Invest in sales and marketing to acquire new brand partners. Further develop the blockchain infrastructure supporting the loyalty profiles and gamification. Explore new use cases and integrations for their loyalty technology. This investment isn’t just about surviving; it’s about scaling up and becoming a leader in the emerging field of blockchain-powered loyalty. Revolutionizing Consumer Loyalty For brands, TYB offers a way to move beyond generic discount programs and build deeper connections. By making loyalty more interactive and by leveraging the unique properties of blockchain, they can cultivate more engaged and valuable customer bases. For consumers, the promise is a more rewarding, transparent, and potentially interoperable loyalty experience. The success of companies like TYB will be a key indicator of how quickly mainstream businesses adopt blockchain technology for practical, customer-facing applications. This funding round is a strong vote of confidence in that future. In conclusion, TYB’s $11 million Series A is a significant development, highlighting the growing interest in applying blockchain to enhance Consumer Loyalty . With solid backing from notable investors, the platform is well-positioned to expand its reach and innovate within the Blockchain Loyalty space, potentially setting a new standard for how brands and customers interact. The future of loyalty is looking increasingly digital and decentralized, thanks to innovations like those being championed by TYB.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC , announced on Thursday that Glenda Maree Rogan is barred from offering financial services or holding any management role in the industry for the next ten years. The decision took effect on June 6. ASIC Found Adviser Misled Investors With False Promises, Routing Funds To A Flagged UK Crypto Platform Rogan, who previously operated in Sutherland Shire and Wollongong under the Fincare group of companies, was found to have engaged in deceptive conduct between March 2022 and June 2023. During that period, she diverted at least A$14.8m, or about US$9.6m, from clients, friends, and family into what was ultimately a cryptocurrency scam. To solicit investments, Rogan misled clients by presenting the product as a high-yield fixed-interest account. In reality, the funds were converted into crypto and transferred to wallets tied to the Financial Centre, a UK-based trading platform flagged on ASIC’s Investor Alert List. By late 2022, ASIC concluded Rogan likely knew or suspected the platform was illegitimate. Former Adviser’s Name Added To National Banned Register As ASIC Pursues Further Action The money first moved through bank accounts controlled by Rogan and her personal company. From there, it disappeared into offshore wallets. As a result, ASIC said it found her unfit to work in financial services. The regulator also warned she was likely to reoffend if allowed to remain in the industry. Rogan had served as a director in several Fincare companies. She was also an authorized representative of Private Wealth Pty Ltd until February this year. Now, her name appears on ASIC’s banned and disqualified register. However, she still has the right to appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Meanwhile, ASIC confirmed its investigation into the matter is ongoing. Australia Confronts Dark Side Of Crypto Boom Rogan’s case comes as part of a wider crackdown on crypto-related misconduct in Australia. Digital assets have steadily gained mainstream traction across the country. As of 2025, around 32.5% of Australian adults have owned or currently own cryptocurrency, totaling an estimated 6.2m people. Australian authorities have charged four individuals over a scheme that allegedly laundered $123 million through businesses and crypto. #Australia #aml https://t.co/uV1errA8TV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 However, this growing adoption has brought increased risks. Australians lost at least A$180m to crypto investment scams in a single year. Notably, A$3m of that was linked specifically to crypto ATM scams between Jan. 2024 and Jan. 2025. The regulator hopes bans like Rogan’s send a clear message, that misleading investors and exploiting trust in emerging technologies will not go unchecked.

The price is slowly breaking out following a steady surge in the past few days. Following last month’s breakout of a crucial resistance line, which came after a month of recovery, ETH tapped the $2,800 level in the second week and cooled off buying after several failed attempts to push higher. Subjecting the trend to a sideways move, it stayed well above the $2,300 level and consolidated throughout the month. It attempted a breakdown this month, but the price quickly recovered due to increased volatility this week. It is now on the cusp of breaking out on the daily chart. Considering the surge over the last two days, the price currently appears strong and looks ready for another major rally. A notable breakout of the consolidation phase could explode the price well above the $3k level. Technically, Ethereum is expected to retest the broken resistance line as support during the recent market correction. But now that the correction has been suspended, we can expect a major impulsive movement soon. Currently, the bulls are back in action, and from the look of things, they are much more likely to gain more dominance in the next few days. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview If the price breaks well above $2.8k, ETH’s next buying target would be $3k and $3,213. Higher resistance levels to watch for a test are $3,525 and $3,744. For a pullback, there’s a close support at $2,548. If the price drops below it, the support level to watch is $2,320. A breakdown there could plunge the market to $2,104 and $1,873 to retest the descending resistance line. Key Resistance Levels: $3,213, $3,525, $3,744 Key Support Levels: $2,548, $2,320, $2,104 Spot Price: $2,783 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just made a significant announcement that could impact your trading strategies. They are expanding their offerings by adding RESOLV (RESOLV) to their comprehensive suite of margin trading options. What Does RESOLV Binance Listing Mean for Traders? According to an official announcement on the Binance website, the exchange will list the RESOLV/USDT trading pair for both cross and isolated margin trading. This new listing is scheduled to go live on June 11, 2024, at 14:30 UTC. This move signifies growing interest in the RESOLV token and provides traders with new avenues to potentially profit from its price movements. For those unfamiliar, margin trading allows traders to borrow funds to increase their trading position size beyond what their cash balance would normally allow. This leverage can amplify potential profits, but it also significantly increases the risk of losses, including the risk of liquidation. Understanding Crypto Margin Trading: Cross vs. Isolated Binance offers two primary types of margin trading, and the RESOLV listing will be available for both: Cross Margin: In cross margin mode, your entire margin balance across all cross margin positions acts as collateral for all open cross margin trades. This can help prevent individual positions from being liquidated easily, as a loss in one position might be covered by profits or collateral from another. However, it also means that a significant downturn can potentially wipe out your entire cross margin balance. Isolated Margin: With isolated margin, the margin allocated to a specific trading pair is independent of other trading pairs. Only the funds allocated to that specific pair serve as collateral for that position. If the position goes against you, only the margin allocated to that specific pair is at risk of liquidation. This mode allows for better risk management on individual trades but requires careful monitoring of each position’s margin level. The availability of RESOLV for both cross and isolated margin gives traders flexibility in how they manage their risk exposure when trading the RESOLV/USDT pair. What is RESOLV Crypto? While the Binance announcement focuses on the listing details, understanding the underlying asset, RESOLV crypto, is crucial for traders. RESOLV is [Insert a brief, neutral description of what RESOLV is or aims to do based on publicly available information. Keep it high-level if specific details aren’t provided in the source or readily accessible, e.g., ‘a project focused on X,’ or ‘a token within the Y ecosystem.’ *Self-correction: The source doesn’t provide this, so I must either state that information isn’t detailed or add a placeholder.* Let’s add a placeholder and a note about research.] [Note to Editor: Please insert a brief description of the RESOLV project or token here if details are available. Example: RESOLV is a token powering a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on [mention a key feature or use case].] Traders considering leveraging RESOLV should conduct thorough research into the project’s fundamentals, use case, team, tokenomics, and market sentiment before engaging in margin trading. Key Benefits and Risks of RESOLV Margin Trading Trading RESOLV/USDT on margin on Binance comes with potential benefits and significant risks: Potential Benefits: Amplified Profits: Leverage allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital, potentially leading to higher returns on successful trades. Capital Efficiency: Traders can use less capital to open positions, freeing up the rest for other investments or trades. Short Selling Opportunities: Margin trading enables traders to short RESOLV, potentially profiting from a downward price movement. Increased Liquidity: The listing on a major exchange like Binance for margin trading typically increases the trading volume and liquidity for the asset. Significant Risks: Amplified Losses: Just as profits are amplified, so are losses. A small adverse price movement can result in significant losses, potentially exceeding your initial margin. Liquidation Risk: If the market moves against your position and your margin level falls below a certain threshold, your position may be automatically closed (liquidated) to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of your entire margin for that position. Funding Rates: Holding margin positions typically incurs funding fees, which can add up over time, especially in volatile markets. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Leverage magnifies the impact of this volatility. Engaging in crypto margin trading requires a deep understanding of these risks and a robust risk management strategy. Actionable Insights for Traders If you plan to trade RESOLV on margin on Binance, consider these actionable insights: Start Small: If you are new to margin trading or trading RESOLV, begin with a small amount of capital and low leverage. Understand Leverage Levels: Be aware of the maximum leverage offered and the implications of using higher leverage. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against your position. Monitor Funding Rates: Keep an eye on the funding rates for the RESOLV/USDT margin pair, as they can impact your profitability. Choose Margin Mode Wisely: Select between cross and isolated margin based on your risk tolerance and trading strategy for that specific trade. Isolated margin is often recommended for beginners to limit risk to a single position. Stay Informed: Keep up with news and developments related to RESOLV and the broader crypto market. Risk Management is Key: Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Leverage is a powerful tool but demands respect and careful management. The addition of RESOLV to Binance margin trading is a notable event, but it’s crucial to approach it with caution and preparation. The Significance of a New Crypto Listing on Binance A new crypto listing on a major exchange like Binance often brings increased visibility, liquidity, and trading volume to the listed asset. For RESOLV crypto , this listing on one of the largest platforms globally is a significant milestone. It opens up the asset to a massive user base and provides advanced trading options like margin trading, which can attract a different segment of traders. However, it’s important to remember that a listing itself does not guarantee price appreciation. Market conditions, project fundamentals, and overall crypto sentiment play much larger roles in an asset’s long-term performance. Conclusion: Trading RESOLV on Binance Margin Binance’s decision to add RESOLV/USDT to its cross and isolated margin trading options on June 11, 2024, at 14:30 UTC, provides traders with new opportunities to engage with the RESOLV token using leverage. While this expansion of trading options can potentially lead to amplified gains, it also comes with the inherent, significant risks associated with margin trading, particularly liquidation risk. Traders interested in the RESOLV Binance listing should ensure they fully understand how margin trading works, the difference between cross and isolated margin, and the specific risks involved. Always prioritize risk management and conduct your own thorough research before committing capital.

Bullish, a prominent crypto exchange, is making waves with not one, but two significant developments that have the market talking. First up is the announcement of a colossal $14 million trading competition set to electrify Q3. This isn’t just any competition; it’s specifically aimed at professional traders, promising substantial rewards for top performers. But that’s not all. Adding to the excitement, Bullish has also reportedly taken a major step towards potentially becoming a publicly traded company by confidentially filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). What’s the Buzz About the Bullish Trading Competition? Bullish is stepping into the spotlight with a trading competition boasting one of the largest prize pools seen recently in the crypto space. Valued at a staggering $14 million, this event is designed to attract serious trading talent and significant volume to the platform. According to reports from CoinDesk, the competition is scheduled to take place in the third quarter of the year, setting the stage for intense activity during that period. Here’s what we know about this ambitious trading competition: Total Prize Pool: $14 million Target Audience: Professional traders Top Prize: A remarkable $10 million is earmarked for the winner, a life-changing sum for any trader. Timing: Scheduled for Q3 Source: Reported by CoinDesk Hosting such a massive competition serves multiple purposes for a crypto exchange like Bullish. It’s a powerful marketing tool, generating buzz and attracting attention from the global trading community. More importantly, it incentivizes high-volume trading activity, boosting liquidity on the platform. For professional traders, it represents a significant opportunity to not only compete for substantial prizes but also to test their strategies against peers on a major venue. Bullish Takes Steps Towards an IPO Adding another layer of intrigue to Bullish’s recent activities is the news regarding its potential public listing. The Financial Times reported earlier today that Bullish has confidentially filed for an IPO with the SEC filing . A confidential filing allows a company to keep its sensitive financial and business information private during the initial stages of the IPO process, only becoming public closer to the actual listing date. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process by which a private company becomes a public company by offering its shares to the public for the first time. This is a significant milestone for any company, representing a major funding round and often providing liquidity for early investors and employees. For Bullish, pursuing an IPO signals strong growth ambitions and a move towards greater mainstream financial integration. Becoming a publicly traded company could provide Bullish with access to a much larger pool of capital for expansion, acquisitions, and further development of its platform. It also subjects the company to increased regulatory scrutiny and public reporting requirements, which can build trust and transparency. Connecting the Dots: Competition and IPO Ambitions It’s interesting to consider how these two major announcements might be related. While not explicitly linked, a highly successful trading competition in Q3, generating significant volume and demonstrating robust platform activity, could potentially serve as a positive data point for Bullish as it navigates the IPO process. Strong trading metrics could showcase the platform’s health and attractiveness to potential public market investors. Conversely, the prospect of an IPO might lend an air of legitimacy and stability to Bullish, potentially making the trading competition more appealing to top-tier professional traders who value operating on platforms with strong financial backing and regulatory compliance efforts. Why Target Professional Traders for the $14M Prize? The decision to specifically target professional traders for this massive prize pool is strategic. Professional traders typically bring significant capital and execute high-frequency, high-volume trades. Their participation is crucial for creating deep liquidity on an exchange, which benefits all users by facilitating easier and more efficient trading with tighter spreads. Attracting this segment of the market helps Bullish compete with other institutional-focused platforms. While this particular competition isn’t open to retail traders, the increased liquidity and activity generated by professional participants ultimately contribute to a better trading environment for everyone on the platform. Challenges and Considerations While exciting, both a large-scale trading competition and an IPO process come with challenges. Trading competitions, by their nature, involve significant risk for participants. The pursuit of high volume or aggressive strategies to win prizes can lead to substantial losses. For Bullish, managing the logistics and ensuring fair play in a $14 million competition is a considerable undertaking. The IPO process is also complex and subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. There’s no guarantee that the filing will result in a successful public offering. The SEC review process can be lengthy and rigorous. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those following the crypto market, Bullish’s moves are worth watching. The trading competition will provide insights into the platform’s capacity and the level of professional trading interest it can attract. The IPO process, if successful, would see another major crypto-related company join the public markets, offering traditional investors a new way to gain exposure to the digital asset space. This could be indicative of broader trends in the industry towards greater institutionalization and regulatory engagement. Conclusion: Bullish Makes Bold Moves In summary, Bullish is making significant strides on two fronts: launching a massive $14 million trading competition to attract professional liquidity and reportedly filing for an IPO with the SEC . These actions highlight Bullish’s ambition to grow its presence in the competitive crypto exchange landscape and potentially tap into traditional capital markets. The Q3 competition promises intense trading action, while the IPO filing signals a potential future as a publicly traded entity. Both developments underscore Bullish’s efforts to position itself as a major player in the evolving digital asset ecosystem.

On May 30, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a final notice requiring unlicensed digital asset exchanges with operations in Singapore and overseas clients to shut down by June 30, according to a Bloomberg report . With no grace period and strict limitations on new licenses, some of the largest offshore players—including Bitget and Bybit—are now preparing to exit the country and relocate staff to more crypto-friendly hubs like Dubai and Hong Kong. Exit or Comply: The Pressure Builds MAS’s firm stance targets firms that run front-office functions such as sales or client services from Singapore while serving foreign users. Though the regulation affects only a “minimal” number of companies, according to the regulator’s June 6 clarification, the impact is outsized, potentially jeopardizing hundreds of jobs. Arthur Cheong of DeFiance Capital noted that many of these offshore firms have sizeable teams based in Singapore. Bitget and Bybit, both ranked among the world’s top exchanges by volume, are now scrambling to reorganize their teams. While MAS crypto crackdown stresses that its regulatory expectations have been made clear for years, firms now find themselves in a gray area, unsure whether they fall under the new rules or can continue with tweaks to their operations. Crypto analyst Lana Yang calls out Singapore crypto regulation 2025 as a game of regulatory “whack-a-mole.” Regulatory pressure is pushing exchanges like Bitget to relocate to places like Dubai and Hong Kong. She pointed out that this move might not stop the crypto activity but simply shift it elsewhere, making Bitget’s decision to relocate seem wise.

Despite being a global crypto hub and home to licensed giants like Coinbase and Crypto.com, Singapore remains cautious after previous market failures during the 2022 crypto downturn. The move may dent the city-state’s reputation as a digital asset haven, especially as competitors like Hong Kong try to woo the industry with clearer regulatory paths. While some view the MAS notice as a long-expected clean-up, others see it as a regulatory chokehold. Legal experts believe that the lack of clarity around what constitutes “offshore services” could lead to confusion and case-by-case scrutiny. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Singapore’s crackdown signals a global trend towards stricter crypto regulation, forcing offshore firms to seek clearer regulatory environments elsewhere. This could lead to a redistribution of crypto activity globally. Could this regulation shift lead to more crypto activity in other hubs? Yes, this regulatory shift is already pushing crypto activity towards other hubs. Dubai and Hong Kong are actively attracting firms with clearer rules, potentially boosting their positions as leading crypto centers. How might Singapore’s reputation as a crypto hub change after these restrictions? While aiming for greater financial stability, Singapore’s tighter restrictions may temper its reputation as a leading crypto innovation hub, especially as it becomes less attractive to firms serving overseas clients without a full local license.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 05:19:30

A major development is unfolding on one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase , a household name in the crypto space, has officially announced it will add support for PancakeSwap (CAKE) on the Ethereum ERC-20 network. This significant crypto listing is set to open new doors for traders and the broader DeFi ecosystem. The announcement, made via Coinbase’s official X account, confirmed that trading for the CAKE token on Ethereum is scheduled to commence on or after 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time (PT) on Wednesday, June 12. This move marks an important step for both platforms and highlights the increasing interoperability within the decentralized finance landscape. What Exactly is PancakeSwap and Why is it on Ethereum Now? Many people know PancakeSwap primarily from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), where it gained massive popularity as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX). It offers users the ability to trade tokens, provide liquidity, earn yield through farming and staking, and participate in lotteries and NFT markets. However, in recent times, PancakeSwap has adopted a multi-chain strategy. Recognizing the importance of expanding its reach and user base, the platform has been deploying its services on various blockchain networks beyond BSC, including Ethereum. This expansion allows PancakeSwap to tap into different user communities and leverage the unique features and liquidity pools available on other chains. Operating on Ethereum ERC-20 means that PancakeSwap users can now interact with the protocol using Ether (ETH) for gas fees and trade ERC-20 standard tokens directly on the platform’s Ethereum deployment. This move is part of a larger trend in DeFi towards becoming chain-agnostic, providing users with more choices and flexibility. Unpacking the CAKE Token Listing on Coinbase The core of this announcement is the listing of the CAKE token on Coinbase. CAKE is the native utility and governance token of the PancakeSwap ecosystem. It serves multiple purposes: Governance: CAKE holders can vote on proposals affecting the future of the PancakeSwap platform. Staking: Users can stake CAKE in Syrup Pools to earn rewards in various tokens. Yield Farming: Users can provide liquidity for token pairs and stake their LP tokens to earn CAKE rewards. Lottery: CAKE can be used to participate in the PancakeSwap lottery. NFTs: CAKE is involved in the PancakeSwap NFT market and profiles. By listing the CAKE token , Coinbase is providing its vast user base with direct access to this prominent DeFi asset. It’s crucial to note that Coinbase is specifically adding support for the Ethereum ERC-20 version of CAKE. Users will need to ensure they are interacting with the correct network when depositing or withdrawing CAKE on Coinbase. This crypto listing on a major centralized exchange like Coinbase typically brings increased visibility, accessibility, and potentially higher trading volumes for the listed asset. It bridges the gap between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) for the CAKE token. The Significance for Ethereum ERC-20 and Beyond PancakeSwap’s presence and CAKE’s listing on the Ethereum ERC-20 network are significant for several reasons: Enhanced Liquidity: Listing CAKE on Coinbase directly increases the liquidity available for the token on the Ethereum network. User Accessibility: Millions of Coinbase users who might not be familiar with or active on BSC can now easily buy, sell, and hold CAKE on Ethereum. Validation of Multi-Chain: This move validates PancakeSwap’s strategy of expanding to other chains and reinforces the idea of a multi-chain crypto future. Growth for Ethereum DeFi: Adding a major DEX token like CAKE to the list of tradable assets on a platform like Coinbase strengthens the overall ecosystem built on Ethereum ERC-20 . While Ethereum gas fees can be a consideration compared to chains like BSC, the established infrastructure, security, and vast developer community of Ethereum make it a critical network for major DeFi protocols to operate on. What Does This Coinbase Listing Mean for You? If you are a crypto trader or investor, the Coinbase listing of the CAKE token on Ethereum ERC-20 presents several opportunities and points to consider: Benefits: Easier Access: If you primarily use Coinbase, buying or selling CAKE is now much simpler without needing to use bridges or other DEXs on different chains initially. Potential Price Movement: Exchange listings, especially on large platforms, can sometimes lead to increased demand and price volatility for the listed asset. Portfolio Diversification: Adding CAKE to your portfolio through a familiar platform becomes straightforward. Challenges/Considerations: Network Choice: Be mindful that you are trading the ERC-20 version of CAKE. Transferring it off Coinbase will incur Ethereum gas fees, which can be higher than on BSC. Understanding PancakeSwap: While you can trade CAKE on Coinbase, understanding the full utility of the token often involves interacting with the PancakeSwap platform itself (for staking, farming, etc.), which operates on multiple chains. Market Volatility: As with any crypto asset, the price of CAKE can be volatile, influenced by market conditions, platform developments, and listing effects. Here’s a simple comparison point: Feature PancakeSwap (BSC) PancakeSwap (Ethereum ERC-20) Primary Network Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Ethereum (ERC-20) Gas Token BNB ETH Transaction Costs Generally Lower Can be Higher Transaction Speed Generally Faster Varies with network congestion For those interested in trading CAKE on Coinbase, the scheduled start time of June 12, 9:00 a.m. PT is key. It’s advisable to monitor Coinbase’s official channels for the exact moment trading goes live. Looking Ahead: The Future of CAKE and Multi-Chain DeFi The addition of PancakeSwap’s CAKE token on Coinbase , specifically supporting the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, is more than just another crypto listing . It signifies the ongoing convergence of centralized and decentralized finance and the growing importance of multi-chain compatibility for major protocols. As PancakeSwap continues its expansion across various blockchains, its native token, CAKE, is likely to see increased utility and presence across the crypto ecosystem. Listings on major exchanges like Coinbase are pivotal in this journey, bringing greater legitimacy and accessibility to the token and the platform it represents. This development is a positive signal for the broader DeFi market, indicating that successful protocols are not limiting themselves to a single chain and that major exchanges are willing to list assets from diverse ecosystems. It reinforces the dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto world. The trading of CAKE on Coinbase’s Ethereum network is set to begin soon, and market participants will be watching closely to see the impact of this strategic move.

Meanwhile, a new altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.03 in its presale, is capturing attention with bold projections of reaching $3 post-launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $10,400,000, with over 540 million tokens sold and 11,900 holders joining since the presale began. As investors hunt for the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction with its innovative lending model. Ripple (XRP) maintains steady climb Ripple (XRP) is showing strength in the market by trading at $2.216 and increasing by 1.53% in one day. The fact that there is $130.17 billion attributed to the market cap shows investors believe in this currency. Green candlesticks on technical charts seem to point to upward movement and indicate more investors are buying. The coin faces resistance at $2.249 but finds support at $2.077, according to recent crypto charts. Analysts predict XRP could reach $4.90 in 2025, fueled by the XRP Ledger’s expanding use in cross-border payments. Moreover, its stable trading volume of $1.43 billion daily underscores its reliability. However, XRP’s growth depends on sustained institutional adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance with its dual lending model. The platform blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems, offering users flexibility and transparency. In the Peer-to-Contract model, lenders deposit stablecoins into smart contracts, earning passive income through dynamic interest rates. The Peer-to-Peer approach allows direct negotiations, fostering user-driven loan agreements. Currently, Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is underway, with tokens priced at $0.03—a 200% jump from the $0.01 starting price. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, and the launch price of $0.06 guarantees a 100% ROI for early buyers. Furthermore, analysts project a post-launch surge to $3, a 9,900% increase. Robust security and community engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a Certik audit, earning an impressive 80.00 security score. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and no security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days. Active monitoring and moderate social media engagement bolster its transparency. The team has launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, who will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. Why crypto prices favor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Ripple (XRP) benefits from established infrastructure, its growth is tied to institutional partnerships, which can be slow to materialize. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, offers immediate utility through its lending platform, set to launch alongside its token at $0.06. Its Layer-2 integration ensures fast, low-cost transactions, addressing common crypto investment pain points like high gas fees. The project’s stablecoin, pegged to the USD, enhances transaction reliability. Crypto charts show Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale momentum, with $10,400,000 raised and 540 million tokens sold. In contrast, XRP’s volatility, at 4.79%, signals higher risk. Thus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling case for investors seeking high returns. Seizing future gains As the crypto market heats up, Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct paths to profit. XRP’s projected $4.90 price in 2025 makes it a solid choice for steady growth. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the best crypto to buy now, with its $0.03 presale price and $3 post-launch target. Its innovative lending model, secure infrastructure, and community incentives position it for explosive growth. Investors eyeing crypto investment opportunities should act fast to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 5 presale before prices rise.

The blog post noted that a typo, an incorrect SWIFT code, or even incomplete instructions can cause a payment to fail. The post noted that failed payments often cost time and money, and can strain relationships between customers and partners. As a replacement, Ripple Labs proposes the use of Ripple Pay, which utilizes blockchain technology and the XRP coin. Analysts have argued that if XRP were to replace SWIFT, it could cut costs for cross-border payments and increase the value of XRP. However, some point out that this is not likely to happen any time soon. While XRP could have some massive gains in the long term, those are not guaranteed like with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Analysts are forecasting that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could rise by as much as 2,456% when it goes live in the first few days. Optimism on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One of the reasons why there is so much optimism when it comes to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the unique design of the protocol. The Mutuum Finance protocol allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the platform, they deposit their assets to earn interest. The interest that they earn is based on the utilization rate of the pool. When more borrowers take loans from a pool, it raises the utilization rate, which increases the interest rate. This rising interest rate encourages borrowers to pay back loans, while lenders are incentivized to deposit more funds into the pools for the higher yields. Over time, this helps to balance the interest rate, ensuring optimal capital efficiency. MtTokens and liquidity management on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) When a lender deposits assets in a pool, they get mtTokens in exchange. These tokens represent the value of their deposit plus any interest that is accrued. Users can redeem their mtTokens at any time. That could happen because there are too many borrowers active in a pool, making it hard to honor all redemptions immediately. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a perfect solution for this shortcoming. It will foster external pools on DEXs and automated market makers where users can trade mtTokens for their underlying assets. In other words, this will reduce reliance on internal pools, while opening more trading opportunities for mtToken holders. On decentralized exchanges like Beyond and Uniswap, Mutuum Finance will encourage the creation of pools that pair with mtTokens such as mtETH, mtUSDT, and much more. If a user holds an mtETH token, and there is not enough ETH in the primary pool, they can swap their mtTokens for ETH on the external pools. They can also swap them out for any other token that meets their needs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to create specialized stable pools modeled on Curve, for stablecoins and correlated assets. They will create specialized AMM pools, which will fulfill the swapping needs of mtToken holders. It will minimize slippage while ensuring users get optimal rates. A major benefit of external pools is that users can redeem base assets fast when the internal pools are low due to high borrower demand. It will also reduce liquidity pressure on the pools, which could lead to liquidity depletion. Alongside the external pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will run a liquidity reward program. In this program, liquidity providers will get rewards in MUTM tokens to increase liquidity in the protocol. As such, the external pools are only envisioned as a measure of last resort, since liquidity will be quickly added to the pools if it starts to drop through incentives. Mutuum Finance will also have funds available through protocol fees, including the reserve factor, which can be used to stabilize the liquidity. Overall, Mutuum Finance will have many layers of protection for liquidity providers, ensuring that the protocol is always available to help users achieve their goals. MUTM token presale details The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token presale is currently in phase 5, where over $10.4 million worth of MUTM tokens have already been sold. So far, around 11,900 presale participants have secured their tokens. Tokens in the current phase are selling for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. The increase in phase 6 will reduce the guaranteed ROI from 100% in phase to 71.43%. While still impressive, nothing beats a 100% ROI. To take advantage of this rare opportunity, you only need to connect your wallet to the MUTM presale dashboard. You can then purchase as many of the presale tokens as you want. If you purchase over $50 worth of MUTM tokens, you are automatically entered into the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . This will give you an opportunity to be one of the ten lucky winners who will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. This is one life-changing opportunity that you should not let pass you by.

The widely regarded meme stock announced the proposed private offering of convertible senior notes on Wednesday. The latest offering comes with 0% interest, with the convertible senior notes maturing in June 2032. Eligible only to qualified institutional buyers, it includes an option for purchasers to buy an additional $250 million in notes, within 13 days of the initial issuance. Buyers can convert the debt, which carries no regular interest, into cash or common stock under specific conditions, or a combination of both at GameStop’s election, the release noted. Funds to Fuel BTC Purchases The Texas-based company said that the proceeds from the offering would be used for general purposes. This includes “making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.” GameStop mentioned in a March release that its board has approved “to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.” The firm already disclosed purchasing 4,710 Bitcoin between May 3, 2025 and June 10, 2025, signalling that Bitcoin will be a part of its Q2 balance sheet. @gamestop bought 4,710 Bitcoin in cash between May 3 and June 10, deepening its crypto pivot after board approval in March to adopt BTC as a treasury asset. #GameStop #BitcoinTreasury https://t.co/dmrmxkm7Ix — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 GameStop completed its initial convertible senior notes offering in April. With the $1.5 billion offering, the company had plans to use the proceeds in part to purchase BTC. Community Reacts to GameStop’s Offering, Shares Fell 11% GameStop’s opaque investment strategy has sparked contemplation among observers that it might evolve as a multi-faceted holding corporation. Tetron Invest wrote on X that the company is “transitioning” to be a holding company. “They’re going to hold more than just Bitcoin.” GameStop is transitioning to be a holding company, and they’re going to hold more than just Bitcoin. The new convertible offering strongly points to this, here’s why I think that’s the case pic.twitter.com/9bYOLArL1S — Tetron (@TetronInvest) June 11, 2025 While acquisitions remain the company’s priority, the lack of detailed capital allocation plans fuels theories about bitcoin diversification. Following the announcement to raise more debt, GameStop (GME) shares plummeted over 11% in the extended session Wednesday. GME shares have declined 18% since May 28, after the company confirmed its first Bitcoin buy. The trend contrasts with other firms that have shown a significant increase in their shares after announcing BTC acquisitions.

""If BTC breaks out of the $105K-$110K range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120K and, more importantly, reach our year-end price target of $138.5K by the end of the summer,"" Mena told CoinDesk in an email. ""Today’s CPI print may serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin - and it may be the unlock that brings this target forward by several months. If momentum continues building, a $200K Bitcoin by year-end is now firmly in play,"" Mena added. 21Shares is one of the world's first and largest issuers of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), The report from the Labor Department released Wednesday showed that the cost of living, measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% last month after increasing 0.2% in April. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a 0.2% increase. Notably, the CPI for durable goods, most of which are imported or manufactured with imported content, decreased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% month-to-month (-1.3% annualized), indicating that President Donald Trump's tariffs have not yet been fully passed through to the final consumer. The annualized CPI advanced 2.4%, with core inflation matching the pace of April at 2.8%. ""This continued trend of cooling inflation strengthens the case for potential policy easing later this year. With the Fed’s June meeting approaching, the focus now shifts to how soon policymakers may respond to cooling inflation and shifting macro clarity,"" Mena said in an email to CoinDesk. The CPI report prompted traders to price in 47 basis points of Fed easing, equivalent to roughly two 25 basis point rate cuts, this year, compared to 42 basis points early this week. Further, traders priced fully priced the rate cut for October, with the September probability hovering above 70%. Mena explained that the CPI tailwind comes on the heels of several bullish catalysts, such as sovereign and institutional adoption and the impending stablecoin regulation. ""As macro clarity improves, we should see Bitcoin flows accelerate - driven by renewed institutional confidence, increased activity from Bitcoin treasuries, and the continued rollout of state-level Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) programs. These dynamics could supercharge ETF inflows and reinforce Bitcoin’s evolving role in global portfolios. Bitcoin is built for this environment,"" Mena noted.

The decline adds to the losses sustained since the company’s $513 million Bitcoin purchase in May. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miner Bitdeer posted a strong 18% increase in BTC production for the same month, supported by a rise in hashrate. GameStop Shares Tumble 11.7% After $1.75B Convertible Note Offering Hints at Further Bitcoin Moves GameStop shares plunged 11.66% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, extending a 5.31% decline during the regular session, following the company’s announcement of a $1.75 billion private offering of convertible senior notes due in 2032. The fresh financing plan adds to speculation that the gaming retailer may be preparing to buy even more Bitcoin after already deploying $513 million into the cryptocurrency last month. GME’s share price on June 11 (Source: Google Finance ) Although GameStop stopped short of confirming its intent to use the proceeds for additional Bitcoin purchases, it noted the funds would be allocated in line with its investment policy and could also support acquisitions. The vague language did little to calm jittery investors already reacting to the company’s disappointing Q1 revenue report from the day before. GameStop’s Bitcoin Bet and Mounting Debt On May 28, GameStop stunned markets by revealing that it had used a portion of its previously raised $1.5 billion to acquire 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC), becoming the 13th largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The investment, worth $513 million at the time of purchase, marked a radical pivot in the company’s strategy, aligning it with other high-profile Bitcoin treasurers like Strategy and Tesla. Top 13 public companies by Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Convertible senior notes — a hybrid financial instrument that combines features of debt and equity — have become a favored tool for companies betting big on Bitcoin. Like others before it, GameStop’s notes carry a 0% coupon and mature on June 15, 2032. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $250 million in notes. Crucially, the notes can be converted into cash, GameStop shares, or a combination of both, leaving the door open for various capital restructuring options depending on how the company’s Bitcoin exposure and stock performance evolve. Market Reacts Poorly to Q1 Results and Bitcoin Strategy GameStop’s market performance hasn’t followed the script seen with other Bitcoin-buying firms. While Strategy and others saw stock surges after announcing their crypto plays, GME has trended in the opposite direction. Since confirming its Bitcoin acquisition on May 28, GameStop shares have dropped 18.5%, according to Google Finance. Wednesday’s sharp after-hours drop only exacerbates the trend, bringing the stock’s price back to levels not seen since March 25 — the day GameStop first revealed plans to invest in Bitcoin . Part of the negative momentum can also be attributed to the company’s Q1 earnings report, which showed a revenue decline of 17% year-over-year to $732.4 million, far short of analyst expectations. Despite posting a profit of $44.8 million for the quarter, reversing a $32.3 million loss from the same period last year, investors appeared more concerned with the top-line weakness and declining sales. Uncertainty Lingers as GameStop Straddles Gaming and Crypto GameStop’s pivot toward cryptocurrency appears to be part of a broader transformation strategy, but market participants remain divided on whether this gamble will ultimately pay off. The company has yet to make it clear how Bitcoin aligns with its core business of video games and consumer electronics, and its messaging around the use of convertible note proceeds remains opaque. The move also adds to the mounting debate over how much Bitcoin exposure is too much for public companies. With regulatory scrutiny of crypto still intensifying and Bitcoin’s price notoriously volatile, the risks of heavily Bitcoin-centric treasuries have become a growing concern among institutional investors. Nonetheless, GameStop's decision to raise funds via convertible notes mirrors the playbook of crypto-forward firms — suggesting it could be setting the stage for a larger crypto integration in the near future. Whether that includes doubling down on Bitcoin or venturing into blockchain-related acquisitions remains to be seen. Bitdeer’s Bitcoin Production Surges 18% in May as US Miners Regain Momentum Amid Market Headwinds Meanwhile, Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) announced Wednesday that it mined 196 Bitcoin in May, marking an 18% increase from the 166 BTC it produced in April. The growth came as the company expanded its computational power to 13.6 exahash per second (EH/s) from 12.4 EH/s, thanks to the deployment of new mining equipment. The announcement from Bitdeer comes at a pivotal time for the crypto mining industry, which has faced mounting challenges in recent months, including reduced block rewards, volatile energy prices, and market stress sparked by macroeconomic policy shifts. Nevertheless, Bitdeer’s results align with broader signs of resilience across the mining sector, as several publicly traded miners posted similar gains for the month. Bitdeer’s May performance is part of a trend: according to data from Farside Investors, other major miners—CleanSpark, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms, and HIVE Blockchain Technologies—also increased their monthly BTC production in May. These upticks follow a difficult stretch for the mining industry after Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving event in April, which slashed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.215 BTC per block. The sharp cut, designed to reduce the rate of Bitcoin issuance, has made mining less profitable overnight, especially for operators with outdated hardware or expensive power contracts. To stay operational, many miners were forced to sell larger portions of their Bitcoin reserves, adding sell pressure to markets already reeling from geopolitical disruptions. In April, Bitcoin’s price fell below $75,000 after President Trump’s aggressive tariff announcements roiled global investor sentiment, compounding the pressure on miners. Record Bitcoin Prices Offer Relief Still, a surge in Bitcoin’s price during May—peaking at an all-time high of $111,814, per CoinGecko—has brought renewed optimism. The benchmark cryptocurrency has since pulled back slightly but remains within 3% of its record, offering a vital buffer for mining operations struggling with narrower margins post-halving. Bitdeer’s improved performance, backed by its increased hashpower, signals that larger and better-capitalized miners are positioning themselves to thrive despite a more competitive environment. The Bitcoin network’s mining difficulty—a measure of how hard it is to find a valid block—has continued to rise throughout 2024 and 2025, further squeezing smaller miners. As more powerful rigs enter the network and global competition heats up, the barrier to profitability grows. Despite this, the United States remains the largest contributor to the global hashrate, accounting for the majority of the Bitcoin network’s mining power. That dominance may be further cemented under President Donald Trump’s second-term pro-mining stance, with promises to “mint all future Bitcoin in America.” Trump’s policies, including proposed tax incentives for domestic miners and federal grants for energy infrastructure supporting mining operations, are aimed at securing the US lead in digital asset infrastructure. Outlook: Consolidation and Institutional Scale Industry experts suggest the current environment will likely accelerate consolidation, with firms like Bitdeer, CleanSpark, and Marathon positioned to acquire distressed mining assets and expand operations. As mining shifts from a retail-dominated industry to one ruled by institutional-scale players, the focus will increasingly fall on access to cheap power, cutting-edge ASIC hardware, and geopolitical favorability. For now, Bitdeer’s May production figures offer a snapshot of optimism in a space often defined by volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-12 05:30:00

Get ready for some exciting news from the world of Bitcoin mining. Ionic Digital, a prominent Bitcoin mining company , has just released its operational results for May 2025, and they are certainly turning heads. The report highlights robust profitability and a strategic increase in the company’s digital asset reserves, painting a positive picture for its performance in the current market cycle. What Fueled Ionic Digital’s Strong May Performance? According to the latest report via Businesswire, Ionic Digital demonstrated impressive operational efficiency and market timing in May 2025. The core of their success lies in their mining output and strategic sales: Bitcoin Mined: Ionic Digital successfully mined 132.9 BTC during the month. This figure reflects their operational capacity and hash rate contribution to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Sold: The company opted to sell a significant portion of their mined Bitcoin, offloading 97 BTC. This decision is crucial for covering operational expenses, capital expenditures, and generating realized profit. Average Selling Price: The 97 BTC were sold at an average price of $101,207 per coin. Selling at this level, reflective of a strong BTC price environment in May, was a key factor in their financial results. Net Profit Realized: These sales, conducted at a favorable BTC price , resulted in a net profit of $9.8 million for the month. This substantial crypto profit underscores the potential profitability of well-managed mining operations during periods of high Bitcoin value. Achieving a $9.8 million crypto profit in a single month is a significant milestone for any Bitcoin mining company and demonstrates Ionic Digital’s ability to capitalize on market conditions. Growing Their Digital Treasury: Ionic Digital’s Bitcoin Holdings Beyond just selling for profit, Ionic Digital is also focused on accumulating and strengthening its balance sheet by increasing its Bitcoin holdings . This strategy is common among mining companies who see the potential for future appreciation in the value of Bitcoin. End-of-Month Holdings: As of the end of May 2025, Ionic Digital held a total of 2,520.2 BTC. Month-over-Month Growth: This represents a 1.44% increase in their Bitcoin holdings compared to the end of April. While they sold a large portion of their mined BTC, they still managed to add to their overall reserves, indicating a balanced approach between realizing profits and long-term asset accumulation. Increasing Bitcoin holdings is often viewed positively by investors as it ties the company’s value directly to the future performance of Bitcoin itself. It signifies confidence in the long-term prospects of the asset they are mining. What Does This Profitability Mean for Ionic Digital? The reported $9.8 million crypto profit is more than just a number; it’s an indicator of several positive aspects for Ionic Digital : Operational Efficiency: Achieving this level of profitability suggests efficient mining operations, managing electricity costs and hardware performance effectively. Market Timing: Selling a significant amount of BTC at an average price over $100,000 indicates successful execution of their sales strategy to leverage favorable market prices. The strong BTC price environment was clearly advantageous. Financial Health: A substantial profit improves the company’s financial standing, providing capital for expansion, debt reduction, or further investments in mining infrastructure. Investor Confidence: Strong financial results like these typically boost investor confidence in the company’s management and future prospects within the competitive Bitcoin mining company landscape. While the report highlights significant success, it’s also important to remember that the profitability of any Bitcoin mining company is intrinsically linked to the volatile nature of the BTC price and the increasing network difficulty. Managing these external factors remains a key challenge for all miners, including Ionic Digital . Key Takeaways from Ionic Digital’s May Report Looking at the figures, a few key points stand out: Strong Revenue Generation: Selling BTC at over $100k allowed for significant revenue and profit capture. Balanced Strategy: Ionic Digital appears to be balancing the need for immediate profitability through sales with a long-term growth strategy of increasing Bitcoin holdings . Positive Start to Q2 (assuming May is in Q2): These results suggest a strong performance quarter, contingent on sustained market conditions and operational efficiency. For those following the sector, Ionic Digital’s May performance provides a valuable data point on the potential for profitability in the current Bitcoin market, especially when the BTC price is strong. Conclusion: A Profitable Month for Ionic Digital In summary, Ionic Digital had a highly successful May 2025, reporting a notable $9.8 million crypto profit driven by strategic sales at a strong average BTC price . Coupled with a steady increase in their Bitcoin holdings , the report paints a promising picture for the company.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s the ambitious vision being brought to life by Peaq in the United Arab Emirates. The decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) project has announced a significant move, creating a machine tokenization and revenue sharing sandbox right in the heart of Dubai, as reported by Cointelegraph. This initiative by Peaq UAE is poised to be a pivotal step towards building what they call a “Machine Economy Free Zone.” Peaq UAE: Building the Machine Economy Sandbox Peaq’s decision to establish this sandbox in the UAE, specifically Dubai, underscores the region’s growing importance as a global hub for innovation, particularly in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. By partnering with Pulsar Group, a technology firm specializing in SaaS solutions, Peaq is laying the groundwork for a practical environment where the concepts of machine tokenization and decentralized revenue sharing can be tested, refined, and scaled. The core idea is to allow machines – from EV chargers and sensors to delivery robots and industrial equipment – to have their economic activities tracked and potentially tokenized on the blockchain. These machine tokens would represent ownership, access, or a claim on the revenue generated by the machine’s services. The sandbox environment provides a controlled space for businesses and developers to experiment with these novel models without navigating the full complexities of regulation initially. What is DePIN and Why Does Peaq Matter? DePIN, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, is a burgeoning sector within the Web3 ecosystem. It involves using blockchain technology and token incentives to build, maintain, and operate real-world infrastructure networks. Think of decentralized alternatives to traditional infrastructure like Wi-Fi networks, energy grids, or even mobility services. Peaq is a prominent player in the DePIN space, providing the necessary infrastructure for dApps (decentralized applications) to be built for and powered by machines, vehicles, robots, and devices. Their focus is on creating an ‘Economy of Things,’ where machines can identify themselves, communicate, and transact autonomously on the blockchain. Peaq’s initiative in the UAE is significant for the broader DePIN landscape because it provides a real-world testbed for one of DePIN’s most compelling value propositions: connecting physical assets to the digital economy and enabling new economic models like shared ownership and automated revenue distribution. Success in the Peaq UAE sandbox could serve as a blueprint for DePIN projects globally. Understanding Machine Tokenization At its heart, machine tokenization is about giving physical assets a verifiable, digital identity and representation on a blockchain. This token can encapsulate various aspects of the machine, such as ownership rights, usage data, maintenance history, and, crucially, the right to a share of the revenue it generates. Why is machine tokenization powerful? Fractional Ownership: Allows multiple parties to collectively own a single high-value machine, lowering the barrier to entry for investment. Increased Liquidity: Tokens can be easily traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity for otherwise illiquid physical assets. Verifiable Identity & History: Provides a transparent and immutable record of the machine’s lifecycle and activities. Enabling Automated Processes: Tokens can be programmed via smart contracts to execute actions, such as distributing revenue or triggering maintenance requests. In the Peaq UAE sandbox, the focus is on linking these tokens to the revenue streams generated by the machines, creating a direct economic link between the digital token and the physical asset’s performance. How Blockchain Revenue Sharing Works The revenue sharing model enabled by blockchain is a key feature of Peaq’s initiative. Traditionally, revenue from machines or infrastructure goes to a single owner or corporation. With blockchain revenue sharing, this process can be automated and distributed among token holders based on predefined rules encoded in smart contracts. Here’s a simplified look at how it might work: A machine (e.g., an EV charger) provides a service (charging a car). The user pays for the service, typically in fiat or crypto. This payment is recorded, and the revenue is directed to a smart contract associated with the machine’s token. The smart contract automatically distributes a predetermined percentage of the revenue to the wallets holding the machine’s tokens. The process is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain, ensuring token holders receive their fair share without relying on intermediaries. This creates a powerful incentive for individuals and communities to invest in and support the deployment of physical infrastructure, knowing they can directly benefit from its economic activity through seamless blockchain revenue sharing. Dubai Crypto Hub: Why the UAE is the Ideal Location The choice of the UAE, and specifically Dubai, for this pioneering sandbox is no coincidence. The UAE government has made significant strides in embracing blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and future technologies. They have a clear vision to become a global leader in the digital economy. Key factors making Dubai a suitable location include: Progressive Regulation: Authorities like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai are actively working on clear regulatory frameworks for virtual assets. Regulatory sandboxes provide a structured environment for testing innovative concepts. Government Support: There is strong governmental backing for blockchain initiatives and attracting tech companies. Global Connectivity: Dubai’s position as a global business and logistics hub makes it ideal for deploying and managing physical assets. Innovation Ecosystem: A growing community of blockchain developers, investors, and businesses. Peaq UAE benefits from this forward-thinking environment, providing a fertile ground for their Machine Economy vision to take root and potentially flourish before expanding globally. This move solidifies Dubai’s reputation as a leading Dubai Crypto hub. Benefits of Peaq’s UAE Initiative The establishment of the Peaq UAE sandbox offers multiple potential benefits: For Peaq and Pulsar Group: A real-world testing ground to validate their technology, gather data, and demonstrate the viability of machine tokenization and blockchain revenue sharing. For Businesses: Provides a pathway to explore new business models, optimize asset utilization, and access new forms of financing via tokenization. For Token Holders/Investors: Offers novel investment opportunities in physical infrastructure assets with potential for passive income through revenue sharing. For the UAE: Reinforces its position as a leader in technology and innovation, attracting foreign investment and talent in the blockchain space. For the DePIN Ecosystem: Serves as a significant case study and potential catalyst for wider adoption of DePIN principles. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the potential is immense, the initiative will likely face challenges: Regulatory Clarity: Although a sandbox exists, scaling beyond it will require clear and comprehensive regulations for tokenized physical assets and revenue sharing. Technical Integration: Connecting diverse types of physical machines to the blockchain reliably and securely is complex. Adoption: Educating businesses and the public on the benefits and mechanics of machine tokenization and token-based revenue sharing is crucial for widespread adoption. Security: Ensuring the security of both the physical machines and the associated digital tokens and smart contracts is paramount. Addressing these challenges will be key to the long-term success of the Peaq UAE sandbox and the broader Machine Economy vision. Real-World Potential: Examples of Tokenized Machines What kind of machines could participate in this tokenized economy? EV Chargers: Owners could tokenize their chargers, and token holders could earn a share of the charging fees. IoT Sensors: Sensors collecting valuable data (e.g., environmental data, traffic flow) could be tokenized, with revenue generated from data sales shared with token holders. Delivery Robots/Drones: Tokens could represent ownership or usage rights, with revenue from delivery fees distributed. Industrial Equipment: Complex machinery could be tokenized for fractional ownership and shared revenue from its operational output. These examples illustrate the diverse potential applications of machine tokenization and blockchain revenue sharing across various industries. Conclusion Peaq’s launch of a machine tokenization and revenue sharing sandbox in the UAE marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the DePIN sector and the broader Machine Economy. By providing a controlled environment in a forward-thinking jurisdiction like Dubai, Peaq is taking a bold step towards demonstrating the practical viability of connecting physical assets to the digital economy via blockchain. This initiative has the potential to unlock new forms of ownership, investment, and economic participation, turning inert physical infrastructure into dynamic, revenue-generating assets accessible to a wider audience through tokens. While challenges remain, the Peaq UAE sandbox represents an exciting frontier in the journey towards a decentralized future powered by intelligent, tokenized machines.

The update, announced by World Network on June 11, brings an end to bridged USD Coin ( USDC ) on World Chain, replacing it with fully-backed, native tokens issued directly by Circle. Native USDC will give its 27 million users a faster, more reliable way to move money. Until now, users held bridged versions of USDC, which are wrapped assets representing USDC from another chain. Native USDC, in contrast, is directly minted and redeemed by Circle, backed 1:1 by U.S. dollar reserves. This upgrade improves transparency, trust, and liquidity. In addition to native USDC, the introduction of CCTP V2 facilitates cross-chain transfers, enabling developers and users to transfer USDC between blockchains more rapidly and cheaply. It also supports better composability, or the ability for applications to interact seamlessly across decentralized finance platforms. You might also like: Sam Altman’s World project debuts in six American states along with Visa card A number of new features are made possible by this integration, including Circle Mint access for qualified companies, improved developer tools for creating USDC Mini Apps, and quicker peer-to-peer transfers. All previously bridged USDC on World Chain has already been automatically upgraded to native. World Network, which positions itself as a global digital identity and finance platform , has seen growing use of USDC for remittances and payments through Mini Apps in its World App. The latest update enhances this functionality while opening the door for developers to build more financial tools directly into the platform. This comes just weeks after World raised $135 million from investors like a16z and Bain Capital Crypto in a public Worldcoin ( WLD ) token sale. Other recent milestones include the launch of the Orb Mini device in the U.S., a partnership with Visa, and entry into Taiwan, Argentina, and Thailand on May 31.

Pendle Finance, the innovative DeFi yield protocol, has officially joined the Converge ecosystem. This move is a significant step, potentially bridging the gap between crypto-native yield strategies and institutional-grade financial products. If you’re interested in how DeFi innovation like Pendle Finance is starting to interact with the established financial world, keep reading. What is Pendle Finance and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the partnership, let’s quickly recap what Pendle Finance does. Pendle is a DeFi protocol that allows users to execute yield management strategies. It achieves this by separating yield-bearing assets into two components: the principal token (PT) and the yield token (YT). Essentially, it tokenizes future yield. Principal Token (PT): Represents the underlying asset itself, redeemable for the original asset at maturity. Yield Token (YT): Represents the future yield generated by the underlying asset until maturity. This separation allows users to implement various strategies: Buy YT at a discount to lock in a fixed yield. Buy PT at a discount to gain exposure to the principal while foregoing yield. Provide liquidity to Pendle pools to earn trading fees and incentives. Pendle’s unique approach to DeFi yield has made it a popular tool for sophisticated yield farming and hedging strategies within the crypto space. Understanding the Converge Blockchain Now, let’s look at the other side of the equation. What is Converge? Converge describes itself as a settlement layer specifically designed for traditional finance and digital dollars. It’s an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, meaning it leverages the robustness and familiarity of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) while aiming to meet the specific needs and regulatory requirements of institutional players and established financial markets. The core focus of Converge is to provide a compliant and scalable infrastructure for: Issuance and management of digital assets, including digital dollars and potentially tokenized securities. Facilitating institutional participation in digital asset markets. Acting as a reliable settlement layer that meets the standards expected by TradFi institutions. Think of Converge as a bridge built specifically for large financial institutions to safely and compliantly interact with blockchain technology and digital assets. The Pendle Finance and Converge Partnership: What Does it Unlock? The integration, announced by Converge via their official communication channels, signifies a strategic alignment between Pendle’s DeFi expertise and Converge’s TradFi-focused infrastructure. As a result of this partnership, Pendle will be able to offer a suite of its yield-focused products and strategies directly on the Converge blockchain. This includes: Offering Tokenized Securities on Converge One of the most significant aspects is the potential to offer tokenized securities. By integrating Pendle’s yield tokenization mechanism with assets issued or represented on Converge, it becomes possible to create yield-bearing tokenized securities. This could mean tokenized bonds, real estate, or other income-generating traditional assets could have their future yield tokenized and traded using Pendle’s protocol on a compliant chain like Converge. This opens up entirely new possibilities for liquidity and yield management for these asset classes. Institutional Dollar Products and Yield Hedging Converge’s focus on digital dollars and institutional participants makes it an ideal environment for Pendle to offer products tailored for this audience. Imagine institutions being able to utilize Pendle’s yield tokenization to manage risk or enhance returns on large pools of digital dollars or other stable-value digital assets settled on Converge. Pendle’s protocol allows for sophisticated yield hedging strategies, enabling institutions to lock in specific rates or speculate on future yield movements in a structured way, something highly valued in traditional finance but often complex to achieve in native DeFi without the right infrastructure. Enhanced Liquidity Strategies Pendle’s model inherently creates liquidity for yield. By bringing this mechanism to Converge, the partnership can facilitate more dynamic and liquid markets for the yield generated by institutional-grade digital assets. This could attract more capital by providing exit strategies and price discovery mechanisms for yield streams that were previously illiquid or difficult to trade separately from the underlying asset. Why is This a Key Step for TradFi Crypto Integration? This partnership isn’t just another DeFi integration; it represents a tangible step forward in TradFi crypto integration. For traditional financial institutions considering digital assets, one major hurdle is accessing sophisticated yield generation and risk management tools in a compliant and familiar environment. Native DeFi, while innovative, can be complex, less regulated, and technically challenging for large institutions. By bringing Pendle’s proven DeFi yield capabilities onto the Converge blockchain, the partnership creates a bridge. Institutions operating on Converge could potentially access yield opportunities and hedging tools that leverage DeFi principles, but within the regulated and structured environment that Converge aims to provide. This lowers the barrier to entry and offers a clear path for institutions to explore the potential of tokenized assets and yield strategies. Potential Benefits of the Pendle-Converge Collaboration The integration holds promise for several stakeholders: For Institutions on Converge: Access to sophisticated yield management and hedging tools for digital assets, potentially including tokenized securities and digital dollars, within a compliant framework. For Pendle Finance: Expansion into the institutional market, increasing total value locked (TVL) and usage by tapping into significant pools of traditional capital. For the Broader Market: Demonstrates a viable model for bringing DeFi innovation into regulated financial markets, accelerating TradFi crypto integration and potentially paving the way for more widespread adoption of digital assets. For Yield Seekers: Potential for new types of yield opportunities based on traditional assets, accessible through Pendle’s familiar interface (though likely requiring specific institutional access on Converge). Are There Challenges Ahead? While the potential is significant, navigating the intersection of DeFi and TradFi comes with challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized securities and institutional digital asset products is still evolving globally. Technical Integration: Ensuring seamless and secure interoperability between Pendle’s protocol and Converge’s specific infrastructure is crucial. Market Adoption: Gaining traction with traditional institutions requires significant education, trust-building, and demonstrating clear value propositions. Complexity: Even within a simplified framework like Converge, the underlying mechanics of yield tokenization can be complex for newcomers. The Exciting Future: Pendle Finance Meets Institutional Demand The partnership between Pendle Finance and the Converge blockchain is more than just a simple integration; it’s a strategic move that aligns DeFi innovation with the burgeoning institutional interest in digital assets. By offering sophisticated DeFi yield strategies and the ability to manage yield on tokenized securities within a TradFi-friendly environment, this collaboration could become a blueprint for future TradFi crypto integration. As institutions increasingly look towards blockchain technology for efficiency and new opportunities, partnerships like this demonstrate how existing, successful DeFi protocols can be adapted and deployed to meet their specific needs and compliance requirements. It’s an exciting development that highlights the maturing landscape of digital finance. In Summary The integration of Pendle Finance with the Converge ecosystem marks a pivotal moment in bridging decentralized and traditional finance. By enabling Pendle’s powerful yield tokenization capabilities on a blockchain designed for institutional use, the partnership is set to unlock new opportunities in tokenized securities, institutional dollar products, and sophisticated yield management strategies. While challenges remain, this collaboration is a compelling example of how DeFi innovation is becoming increasingly relevant and accessible to the traditional financial world, potentially paving the way for significant future growth and adoption.

With no surprises and, apparently, no shocks to the markets either. Despite the uptick, Bitcoin, equities, and altcoins remained steady with no panic, no rally, but just quiet resilience. This suggests that the markets have priced in mild inflation as the new normal, as the investors are more focused on rate decisions, ETF flows, and broader macro narratives than a CPI number. Now that the BTC price has officially traded above $100,000 for 30 consecutive days for the first time in history, will the upswing continue toward new highs? Bitcoin has experienced a sustained adoption from states, banks, and corporations, which has marked a new era of institutional confidence in BTC. As per some reports , 116 public companies now hold 809.1K Bitcoin, up from 312.2K a year ago. Moreover, since early April alone, nearly 100K BTC has been added, with 25+ companies disclosing new holdings. The data also shows MicroStrategy and other institutions have intensified their accumulation since November 2024 when the market rose above the consolidation phase. Since then, the BTC price has maintained a strong ascending trend and is just 3% to 4% away from the ATH. Despite this, the whales remain optimistic and not interested in taking away their profits. The above chart shows the net realized profit or loss, which has spiked each time the BTC price surged above the consolidation. This was aimed to extract profit as the whales and the investors may not be confident about the upcoming price action. However, the current breakout does not appear to have attracted them to take out the profit, as the whales seem to be bullish on Bitcoin and expect the price to maintain a strong upswing. This suggests the BTC price may continue to maintain a strong ascending trend and eventually mark a new ATH soon. Currently, Bitcoin has entered the final resistance zone ahead of an ATH but has still not broken the barrier yet. Moreover, the price is squeezing with a significant rise in the volume from around $36 billion to close to $60 billion. This suggests panic selling but the question remains whether the price will hold the key levels around $106K after plunging below $108K. If this happens, then a new ATH could be a few weeks away; otherwise, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may face a deeper correction and reach levels just below $100,000 and further trigger a strong upswing to mark a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 05:51:39

Recent analysis from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggests that the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin, is entering a fascinating new phase. This isn’t just another day in the volatile world of digital assets; data points to underlying shifts that could be setting the stage for significant price movements. Understanding these shifts, especially through the lens of Glassnode data , is crucial for anyone navigating the current landscape. What is Glassnode Data Telling Us About the Bitcoin Market Cycle? Glassnode is renowned for providing deep insights into the behavior of market participants by analyzing blockchain data. Their latest observations highlight key trends that are historically associated with specific phases of the Bitcoin market cycle . Currently, two metrics stand out: Long-Term Holder (LTH) Dominance: LTHs are addresses that have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days. These participants are typically less reactive to short-term price swings and represent the conviction layer of the market. Glassnode’s data indicates that LTH supply continues to grow, even as the price hovers near previous highs. This is somewhat unusual for this point in the cycle, where profit-taking by LTHs often accelerates. Compressed Volatility: Volatility measures the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. Bitcoin’s price has been trading within a relatively tight range for an extended period, leading to volatility levels near decade lows. Low volatility periods in Bitcoin’s history have often preceded significant price breakouts. These combined signals suggest a market that is consolidating, with strong hands (LTHs) accumulating or holding firm, while price fluctuations remain minimal. This dynamic builds tension in the market, much like a coiled spring. Why Are Long-Term Holders Key to the Next Bitcoin Price Move? Long-term holders play a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. When LTHs hold their coins, it reduces the available supply on exchanges and in the liquid market. Conversely, when they sell, it increases supply, potentially putting downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Glassnode’s findings that LTH supply continues to trend upwards, despite Bitcoin being close to its all-time high, is a powerful signal. It implies that a significant portion of the market believes the current price is still undervalued or expects substantially higher prices in the future. This strong conviction among LTHs acts as a solid foundation, absorbing potential selling pressure from short-term traders or those taking initial profits. Historically, major price surges have occurred when the liquid supply of Bitcoin is constrained, and LTHs are in an accumulation or strong holding phase. The current trend, as highlighted by Glassnode data , aligns with this pattern, suggesting that the conditions for a supply squeeze might be forming. How Does Low Bitcoin Volatility Set the Stage for a Breakout? Low Bitcoin volatility might seem counterintuitive in a market known for its wild swings. However, periods of low volatility often represent phases of consolidation and indecision in the market. During these times, buying and selling pressures are relatively balanced, leading to tight trading ranges. Think of it like this: High Volatility: Price is moving sharply in one direction or the other, often driven by strong momentum or panic. Low Volatility: Price is relatively stable, indicating neither buyers nor sellers have clear dominance. Energy is building as the market awaits a catalyst. Glassnode’s observation that volatility is near decade lows suggests that this consolidation phase has been particularly prolonged and intense. This builds significant potential energy. When a catalyst eventually arrives – be it positive news, increased institutional adoption, or a shift in macroeconomic conditions – the market is poised for a sharp move as price discovers a new equilibrium. The direction of this move is often influenced by the underlying supply/demand dynamics, which, as we’ve seen, appear favorable due to LTH behavior according to Glassnode data . Is New Demand Outpacing Profit-Taking? The critical question for the immediate future of the Bitcoin price is whether incoming demand is sufficient to absorb the selling pressure from those looking to take profits. While long-term holders are broadly holding, some level of profit-taking is natural, especially as the price approaches or exceeds previous highs. According to reports referencing analyst commentary on platforms like Cointelegraph, the balance between new demand and profit-taking is the key factor. If new capital flowing into Bitcoin – perhaps via institutional investments, spot ETFs, or increased retail participation – exceeds the amount of Bitcoin being sold by existing holders (LTHs or short-term speculators), the price is likely to push higher into a phase of price discovery. Indicators that can help assess this balance, often tracked using Glassnode data , include: Demand Indicators Supply/Profit-Taking Indicators Exchange Net Flows (inflows vs. outflows) LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Stablecoin Market Cap & Flows Miner Selling Pressure On-Chain Transaction Volume (adjusted) Exchange Balances A sustained period of exchange outflows, increasing stablecoin market cap, and healthy transaction volume, coupled with restrained selling from LTHs (as suggested by the current trends), would strongly indicate that demand is winning this tug-of-war. Entering a New Market Phase: What Does Price Discovery Look Like? If the conditions described by Glassnode data – strong LTH conviction, low volatility, and robust new demand – align, Bitcoin could enter a fresh price discovery phase. This is a period where the price moves into uncharted territory, above previous all-time highs. Price discovery is characterized by: Rapid price increases, often with significant momentum. Less resistance from overhead supply, as few holders bought at these higher levels previously. Increased media attention and public interest, potentially attracting new participants. Volatility can increase, but primarily to the upside initially. For investors, understanding that the market might be on the cusp of such a phase is crucial. It shifts the focus from navigating sideways chop or potential dips to positioning for potential upside. However, it’s also a time when market sentiment can become euphoric, and managing risk remains paramount. Actionable Insights from Glassnode’s Analysis So, what can you take away from this analysis based on Glassnode data and current market conditions? Recognize the Phase: The market appears to be transitioning from a consolidation phase, characterized by low Bitcoin volatility and strong LTH holding, towards a potential expansion phase. Monitor Key Metrics: Keep an eye on LTH behavior (are they starting to distribute heavily?), exchange flows, and overall market sentiment. Glassnode’s weekly reports and on-chain dashboards are valuable resources. Assess Your Position: If you are a long-term investor, the current environment, according to Glassnode’s interpretation, might reinforce a conviction to hold. If you are a trader, prepare for potentially increased volatility and directional moves. Understand the Supply/Demand Balance: The core driver remains whether new capital inflow can absorb selling. This is the key determinant for sustaining a move into price discovery. While no analysis is a guarantee, the confluence of signals highlighted by Glassnode provides a compelling narrative for the current state of the Bitcoin market cycle . The quiet accumulation by long-term holders and the compressed volatility suggest that the market is patiently waiting for its next big move. Conclusion: The Stage is Set The latest insights derived from Glassnode data paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is in a unique position within its market cycle . The steadfast conviction of long-term holders , coupled with historically low Bitcoin volatility , creates a powerful setup. While the exact timing and magnitude of the next move remain uncertain, the underlying structure of the market, as revealed by on-chain metrics, strongly supports the potential for a significant upward breakout. The key will be whether incoming demand continues to outpace the natural profit-taking that occurs near previous highs. If it does, the stage is set for Bitcoin to enter a new and exciting phase of price discovery.

At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $109,693, reflecting a 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this upward movement, the current price remains roughly 2% below its all-time high of over $111,000, recorded last month. This ongoing strength in price performance has been accompanied by notable on-chain signals, particularly from large holders. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan recently analyzed the current market structure and behavior of Bitcoin whales. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers From $100K Dip While On-Chain Data Shows Rising Miner Activity Bitcoin Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside In his latest analysis, Dan observed that despite Bitcoin hovering near record levels, there is little evidence of the profit-taking behavior typically observed during previous market tops. According to him, whales are not engaging in mass selloffs, suggesting that these investors expect the rally to continue. Dan emphasized that these large holders are likely waiting for more pronounced market euphoria and higher valuations before initiating substantial sell activity, a pattern often seen near the final stages of a bull market. Bitcoin – Near All-Time Highs but No Profit-Taking “Whales show no intention of taking profits at this price level and are likely to wait for higher prices, where significant market overheating and a bubble form, before making their moves.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/W5PtrHo0Q5 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 Whale Exchange Activity Indicates Similar Move Further reinforcing the current sentiment, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a significant trend in Binance whale behavior. According to Darkfost, historical data shows that when Bitcoin approaches or breaches its all-time high, there is typically a sharp rise in exchange inflows, driven by whales seeking to take profits. This pattern was visible during earlier cycle peaks, where inflows reached $5.3 billion in early 2024, and even higher levels of $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion in previous cycles. A strong bullish signal from Binance whales! “Today, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis ⤵️https://t.co/T1FlLnM4nK pic.twitter.com/O3XrqhAyEc — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 In contrast, recent inflows to Binance remain substantially lower. Darkfost reports current inflows hovering around $3 billion, and more importantly, on a declining trajectory. This divergence from historical patterns suggests that whales are refraining from selling at current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Their reduced activity implies an expectation that higher prices may lie ahead, and that they are positioning for potentially greater returns later in the cycle.

However, Senator Elizabeth Warren strongly opposes it due to inadequate consumer protections and ethical concerns about Trump’s crypto ties. Meanwhile, the House is also progressing on the CLARITY Act, which outlines roles for the SEC and CFTC in regulating digital assets and ensures user protections. It received strong committee support and now heads to the House floor. Separately, Representative William Timmons pressed the SEC for transparency on Ethereum’s regulatory status, and criticized the agency's inconsistent stance. Senate Moves Forward on GENIUS Act The US Senate took a major step toward regulating stablecoins by voting 68-30 to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act. The bipartisan support came more than a month after the bill was first introduced, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune championing the legislation on the floor. Thune echoed President Donald Trump’s position that the bill could help the US become the “crypto capital of the world,” and stated that it could bring cryptocurrency further into the mainstream. The vote to invoke cloture sets the stage for full debate and a potential floor vote, which could send the bill to the House of Representatives if it passes. Thune acknowledged that there is still a lot more work to be done regarding digital asset regulation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune However, not all lawmakers are on board. Senator Elizabeth Warren voiced her strong opposition, and criticized the Senate for failing to consider key bipartisan amendments. She warned that the GENIUS Act contains major flaws, including weak consumer protections and national security safeguards. Warren also raised ethical concerns tied to Trump’s personal involvement in the crypto sector through his family-backed platform, World Liberty Financial. She accused the president of using crypto incentives, including dinners and privileged access, as tools to solicit support from foreign governments and wealthy donors in exchange for political favors like pardons and tariff exemptions. President Donald Trump and David Sacks While many Democrats supported advancing the bill, it is still uncertain whether it will secure enough backing for final passage, particularly in a chamber where Republicans have only a narrow majority. After the bill’s initial failure to advance in May, Trump’s top crypto advisor, David Sacks, expressed confidence that the GENIUS Act will eventually pass with bipartisan support. Meanwhile, the House version of stablecoin legislation, the STABLE Act, continues to undergo scrutiny in the Financial Services Committee. CLARITY Act Heads to Full House Vote The US House Committee on Financial Services also recently voted to advance the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which is a major legislative proposal with the goal of establishing a comprehensive framework for crypto market regulation. With a 32-19 vote on Tuesday, the bill now heads to the full House of Representatives for consideration, after a prior 47-6 approval from the House Agriculture Committee. This dual-committee approval is a key milestone in congressional efforts to clarify regulatory oversight of the digital asset space. The CLARITY Act is designed to delineate the responsibilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing the crypto industry. It introduces provisional registration requirements for digital asset platforms, including crypto exchanges and broker-dealers, while also mandating adherence to disclosure rules, customer asset segregation, and recordkeeping standards. The legislation specifically includes protections for users, like the right to hold assets in non-custodial wallets and to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without interference. Representative French Hill, who sponsored the bill , believes that it will create a fair and forward-looking regulatory environment that includes all participants in the crypto ecosystem. He described it as a foundational step for American leadership in Web3 technologies and tokenized financial services. Crypto Subcommittee Chairman Bryan Steil , who previously led a stablecoin bill, is excited about the progress that was made, and called the latest vote a huge achievement. Hill also introduced an amendment that seeks to protect non-controlling blockchain developers from being classified as money transmitters, shielding them from certain regulatory burdens that could stifle innovation. Despite the progress, some Democrats voiced concerns. Representative Maxine Waters proposed changes that are aimed at preventing potential conflicts of interest tied to President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. She believes that the legislation could be used to benefit Trump and his family. Representative Brad Sherman introduced a separate amendment seeking to prohibit potential industry bailouts, due to skepticism from some lawmakers about broader industry incentives. The bill now awaits debate and a vote on the House floor. Lawmaker Presses SEC Over ETH Status In other regulatory news, Republican Representative William Timmons formally requested that US SEC Chair Paul Atkins release internal documents with detail about the agency’s historical stance on Ethereum (ETH) under previous leadership, particularly during Gary Gensler’s tenure. In a letter that was submitted Tuesday, Timmons urged transparency regarding the SEC’s shifting views on whether ETH qualifies as a security. This very question has long been a point of contention for both regulators and the crypto community. Part of William Timmons’ letter Timmons argued that the SEC under Gensler failed to provide a consistent or coherent regulatory framework for digital assets, and he mentioned Ethereum as a prime example. He pointed to 2018 remarks by former SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman, who publicly stated that ETH and Bitcoin should not be classified as securities. In contrast, Timmons claimed that Gensler, as SEC Chair, consistently avoided confirming ETH’s status during congressional hearings.Timmons specifically cited a hearing in April of 2023 where Gensler declined to clarify ETH’s classification, despite the fact that the SEC reportedly approved an investigation into ETH’s status just days earlier. The situation became even more complex in 2024 when the SEC approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a move that would typically imply that ETH is not considered a security. Just weeks after the ETF approvals, the SEC officially closed its investigation into ETH. According to Timmons, this series of contradictory actions caused a lot of confusion among investors and market participants, which undermined regulatory confidence in the US crypto space. Timmons' letter adds political pressure to an already ongoing legal battle involving Coinbase. In 2023, the exchange filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking access to SEC documents on ETH. When the SEC denied the request, Coinbase initiated legal action, which resulted in a court ruling requiring the SEC to release certain records. Some of these disclosed documents were later published by Coinbase, and revealed that even federal prosecutors were unable to obtain a clear stance from the SEC on Ethereum’s regulatory status.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-12 06:01:24

Xaif shared a snippet of the discussion where Weisberger spoke about the real, scalable function of cryptocurrencies beyond speculation. He explored how certain cryptocurrencies are positioning themselves as core infrastructure for global financial systems. Weisberger, known for his Bitcoin maximalist stance, acknowledged that the value of these assets ultimately depends on utility, not narrative. :Bitcoin maxis himself says The future is being built now on $XRP XRP is emerging as the base layer for global payments Positioned beyond memes—real infrastructure Could underlie stablecoins like RLUSD, Chasecoin, and even JPMorgan’s token Interoperability with… pic.twitter.com/8zmGfLm8Ap — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 10, 2025 Targeting Global Payments and Trade He identified XRP and Solana as key contenders in this shift. XRP is aligning itself with cross-border payments, while Solana is gaining traction in trading systems. According to Weisberger, both are “vying to be the base layer to support new transaction modalities.” If these platforms enable real-world financial activity more efficiently than existing systems, they will increase in value. Currently, the financial ecosystem relies on centralized exchanges and proprietary systems. XRP and Solana represent a move toward decentralized, programmable alternatives. XRP, in particular, is targeting the payments space, with the potential to overthrow systems like SWIFT . Weisberger noted that if XRP underlies the stablecoins that become part of global financial infrastructure, such as RLUSD, or even stablecoins from major banks like Chase Coin, or JPMorgan’s token, it would gain long-term value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, adoption is key to this long-term growth, as Weisberger noted that without adoption at that scale, the asset cannot gain this long-term value. Utility Will Decide Longevity Solana, while often associated with retail-level activity such as meme coins , is increasingly positioned as a platform capable of supporting broader trading infrastructure. “If Solana broadens beyond memes to trading of everything,” Weisberger said, its value could rise significantly. The key, once again, is utility. While Ethereum was briefly mentioned in similar terms for its role in tokenization, the focus remained on XRP and Solana due to their specific paths toward becoming integral to payments and trading, respectively. Each is carving out a potential role in an ecosystem that demands efficiency, scalability, and interoperability. As the financial sector increasingly experiments with blockchain-based solutions, the underlying infrastructure will matter more than hype cycles. Whether institutions choose XRP to underlie stablecoins and transform global payments or adopt Solana, the utility of the underlying technology will be the defining factor.

The Treasury’s latest move has matched the largest buyback of its bonds in history from June 3, with its previous largest buyback being in 2000, at approximately $3 billion. According to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Treasury also repurchased the full amount of its maximum target for the operation on June 3, which was capped at $10 billion, out of a total of $22.87 billion in par value offered by market participants. The maximum per value offered by market participants for redemption in the latest buyback was $18.1 billion. Treasury matches the largest buyback in history 🚨 United States Treasury 🚨 THEY DID IT AGAIN! U.S. Treasury just bought back another $10 Billion of its own debt, matching the largest Treasury buyback in history (and that was from last week)! pic.twitter.com/OxyvDWWV76 — {Matt} $XRPatriot (@matttttt187) June 12, 2025 The department acknowledged that the previous June 3 $10 billion buyback initiative was designed to repurchase securities maturing between July 15th and May 31st, 2027. Buybacks allow the Treasury to retire outstanding debt early, potentially reducing interest costs and adjusting its debt profile. The department’s June 10 operation hit its $10 billion maximum buyback target, where of the 40 eligible issues, 18 were accepted in the buyback, demonstrating significant market participation and investor willingness to offload mid-term Treasury notes. In last week’s buyback, the Treasury also revealed that of the 40 eligible issues, 22 were accepted in the repurchase. The repurchase arrived at a crucial moment for U.S. fiscal policy. It could signal new approaches to managing the federal government’s $34 trillion national debt load amid changing economic conditions, rising interest rates, and global investor sentiment. The country’s interest payments on that debt are also expected to top $1 trillion annually by 2026 if current trends continue. The government’s current debt has raised concerns among both policymakers and investors regarding the structural balance of the federal budget. Former Treasury official Martin Keller said the buybacks are not just about reducing numbers on a spreadsheet but about reestablishing confidence in the government’s ability to manage its obligations and create smoother functioning in the capital markets. “There’s a clear macroeconomic logic to this. With the Federal Reserve signaling a potential pause in rate hikes, the Treasury may be trying to create a breathing room in the secondary market and reduce crowding from short-term issuance.” -Elaine Parker, Senior Economist at the Brookings Institution. A Treasury spokesperson mentioned that the department was committed to managing the nation’s finances with both short-term flexibility and long-term sustainability. According to the department’s spokesperson, the buyback is part of the U.S.’s strategic debt management approach to ensure smoother market operations and reduce future borrowing costs. Jamie Liu, managing director at Capital Horizons Group, argued that the buybacks may not alter the debt trajectory in the near term unless it is followed by a series of similar actions or a broader structural plan. Treasury evaluates future buybacks for future executions According to Jeff Gundlach, Scott Bessent discussed extending maturities and lowering coupons on Treasuries held abroad. This is tantamount to a default. The fact that a sitting U.S. Treasury Secretary is speaking publicly about default should cause foreigners to dump Treasuries. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) May 7, 2025 In an April interview with Bloomberg, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about foreign countries fueling a bond market selloff, pointing instead to investors unwinding leveraged positions. He also called out the Treasury’s ability to increase its buyback program if necessary. When asked whether he’s discussing concerns about the stability of the Treasury market with Powell, Bessent also dismissed the notion that there’s any cause for alarm. The repurchase of bonds comes as rising yields increase borrowing costs, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continuing to keep interest rates higher for longer. At the time of publication, the 10-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.405%, while the 2-year Treasury yield is at 3.937%. Median forecasts from nearly 50 bond strategists in a June 6-11 Reuters survey predicted the 10-year yield would decline a modest 13 basis points to 4.35% in three months and to 4.29% in six months. The survey also showed that the more interest rate-sensitive 2-year yield was forecast to decline a slightly steeper 17 basis points to 3.85% in three months and to 3.73 by the end of November. Additional buybacks are being evaluated for future execution, depending on market conditions and fiscal developments, according to Treasury sources. The U.S. government has also not yet confirmed if debt redemptions will become a regular feature of its debt management strategy. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a move that could signal shifting tides in international commerce, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the Trade Tariffs negotiation deadline for certain countries, initially set for July 9, may be extended. This announcement injects a degree of flexibility into ongoing discussions that have significant implications, not just for traditional markets but potentially for the volatile world of cryptocurrency as well. For those navigating the digital asset space, understanding these broader economic signals is paramount. Why Does a Trade Tariffs Negotiation Deadline Extension Matter? Trade tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. They are used by countries for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, or as a tool in foreign policy negotiations. When tariffs are high or trade relationships are uncertain, it creates friction in the Global Economy . Businesses face higher costs, consumers may see increased prices, and overall economic activity can slow down. The original Negotiation Deadline of July 9 was a critical point. Failure to reach an agreement by this date could have led to the imposition of new tariffs or the escalation of existing ones. An extension, as suggested by the US Treasury Secretary , doesn’t necessarily mean a deal is imminent, but it does suggest a willingness to continue dialogue rather than immediately resorting to protectionist measures. This prolonged period of negotiation can lead to: Continued uncertainty for businesses planning supply chains and investments. Potential for markets to react positively to de-escalation hopes or negatively to prolonged indecision. A window for diplomatic solutions to be explored more fully. The Broader Global Economy Picture Trade policies are fundamental pillars of the Global Economy . Interconnected supply chains mean that tariffs imposed by one country can have ripple effects across the world. For example, a tariff on raw materials could increase manufacturing costs in another country, impacting their exports. Uncertainty surrounding trade agreements can lead companies to delay investment decisions, further dampening economic growth. Economists closely watch trade negotiations because they are indicators of international cooperation and economic stability. Positive developments can boost confidence, while breakdowns can trigger volatility. The statement from the US Treasury Secretary is being scrutinized for clues about the health of international trade relations and the potential path forward. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? The cryptocurrency market, while often driven by its own unique dynamics like technological advancements, adoption rates, and regulatory news, does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and global market sentiment. Developments regarding Trade Tariffs and the stability of the Global Economy can have a tangible Crypto Market Impact . Here’s how the potential extension of the Negotiation Deadline and the broader trade picture could affect crypto: Risk Appetite: Global economic uncertainty often leads investors to become more risk-averse. They might move away from assets perceived as higher risk, like cryptocurrencies, towards safer havens such as government bonds or gold. Conversely, signs of de-escalation or stability in trade talks could increase risk appetite, potentially benefiting crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods. Central banks might react to inflationary pressures by adjusting interest rates. Changes in monetary policy, particularly by major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have historically had a significant impact on the crypto market. USD Strength: Trade tensions can influence the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in USD. Investor Confidence: Positive news on trade negotiations, even just an extension indicating ongoing talks, can boost overall investor confidence in the stability of the global financial system. This confidence can sometimes spill over into alternative asset classes like crypto. The statement by the US Treasury Secretary , while not directly about crypto, adds another layer to the complex macroeconomic environment that crypto investors must consider. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for market fluctuations based on global economic news like the Trade Tariffs situation, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Pay attention to major economic announcements, not just crypto-specific news. Global trade developments, inflation data, and central bank decisions are crucial. Understand Correlation: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react to significant shifts in traditional markets and economic indicators. While not always perfectly correlated, the relationship is growing. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying within the crypto space (different assets, sectors) and across different asset classes based on your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: For many, crypto is a long-term investment. Short-term volatility driven by macroeconomic news might be less concerning if you have a long-term investment horizon. Risk Management: Use tools like stop-losses and avoid over-leveraging, especially during periods of high uncertainty driven by global events. The potential extension of the Negotiation Deadline provides a brief pause, but the underlying issues related to Trade Tariffs remain. The reaction of the Global Economy and its subsequent Crypto Market Impact will depend on the progress and eventual outcome of these ongoing discussions. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on the Horizon The indication from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the Trade Tariffs Negotiation Deadline might be pushed past July 9 is a notable development in the ongoing saga of international trade relations. It highlights the complex interplay of global politics and economics. While this news might seem distant from the world of Bitcoin and altcoins, its potential impact on the Global Economy is undeniable, and macroeconomic shifts increasingly influence the Crypto Market Impact . Whether this extension leads to a breakthrough or simply prolongs uncertainty remains to be seen. For those invested in the digital future, staying informed about these broader economic signals is essential for making well-rounded decisions in a connected world.

This happened because the U.S. removed some sanctions on Syria. Making this a big turning point for millions of users who were once left on the sidelines of the digital economy. Binance Opens Doors For Syrian Residents For a long time, Syrians had to watch from a distance as the crypto industry grew rapidly across the world. The local currency lost value, and many people had to depend on money sent from family members living abroad. Some even turned to crypto to protect their savings. But they couldn’t use major platforms like Binance due to the sanctions. That all changes now. With the restrictions lifted, Binance has removed Syria from its list of prohibited countries. This move doesn’t just reopen access, it signals a fresh start for Syrians who can now use crypto tools to improve their financial lives. Binance even says it will help new Syrian users through educational tools and support in Arabic. Their goal is to make sure everyone can use crypto easily and safely. What Syrians Can Do Now on Binance With the ban lifted, Syrian users can now tap into the full suite of Binance services, from spot and futures trading to staking, stablecoins, and even Binance Pay for cross-border payments. The platform has also introduced Arabic educational resources to help new users learn how to navigate crypto safely and confidently. Whether it’s buying Bitcoin, sending USDT to family abroad, or earning yield on crypto holdings, Syrians can now do it all within Binance’s secure environment — just like the rest of the world’s 270 million users. Crypto Interest Was Already High in Syria Even before these U.S. sanctions, Syria ranked high in crypto-related internet searches.

The company expanded its treasury reserves by purchasing 100 Bitcoins worth approximately 10 million euros (about $10.8 million) in May 2025. Evertz Pharma’s interest in Bitcoin is not new. The company began accumulating BTC in December 2020 with its first purchase of €2 million, and has since been building a digital reserve by regularly allocating a portion of its profits to Bitcoin. The company’s General Manager, Dominik Evertz, said in a statement on the subject: “In line with our mission to promote science-based natural beauty, we act with a forward-looking mindset. With its rarity and global tradability, BTC complements our reserve strategy and strengthens our company’s long-term resilience.” Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Unleashes Listing Storm - Announcements Coming One After Another - Here's the Latest Altcoin They've Chosen With the latest purchase of 100 BTC, Evertz Pharma stands out from its competitors in the sector and traditional treasury management practices. “We will continue to purchase Bitcoin with our company profits and are constantly evaluating new ways to sustainably increase our assets,” said Group CFO Tobias Evertz. Unlike BTC investors like Strategy or Metaplanet, which are publicly traded companies, Evertz Pharma operates as a private German company. Dominik Evertz argued that Bitcoin is not just an investment vehicle, but also a strategic asset that complements the company’s vision of stability and sustainability.

If XRPL captures 14% of SWIFT’s volume, that would mean $21 trillion flowing through the ledger annually. But XRP doesn’t need to store this full amount.

Case in point: Semler Scientific (SMLR) . This medical technology firm recently made headlines by pivoting towards a Bitcoin treasury stock strategy, accumulating a significant amount of the digital asset on its balance sheet. However, its journey hasn’t been without turbulence, presenting a fascinating puzzle for investors. Semler Scientific’s Bold Pivot: Becoming a Bitcoin Treasury Stock Traditionally known for providing innovative products and services to healthcare providers, Semler Scientific took a decisive step into the world of digital assets. Recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, the company began converting its cash reserves into BTC. This strategic shift transformed Semler Scientific from a pure medical tech play into something hybrid – a medical technology company with a substantial Bitcoin treasury. This move places it alongside a growing, albeit still small, group of publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, effectively making it a Bitcoin treasury stock . This strategy offers investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin through traditional stock markets. Instead of buying BTC directly or through complex instruments, investors can purchase shares of companies like Semler, whose value is increasingly tied to their Bitcoin holdings. It’s a strategy that appeals to some institutional investors and those who prefer the regulatory familiarity of equity markets. Unpacking the Current Situation: The Significant BTC NAV Discount Despite its significant Bitcoin holdings, Semler Scientific’s stock has faced considerable pressure recently. The company’s share price has experienced a notable decline, leading to a situation where its market capitalization is now significantly lower than the value of its Bitcoin assets alone. This phenomenon is known as trading at a BTC NAV discount . Let’s break down the numbers as reported: Bitcoin Holdings: 4,449 BTC Approximate Value of BTC Holdings: Around $491 million (based on reported figures) Current Market Capitalization (SMLR stock): Around $420 million Discount Ratio: Trading at approximately 0.859x its Bitcoin Net Asset Value (NAV) What does a 0.859x BTC NAV discount mean? It means that for every dollar’s worth of Bitcoin the company holds, the market is valuing the entire company (including its medical tech business) at only about 86 cents. This deep discount highlights a significant divergence between the intrinsic value represented by the Bitcoin on the balance sheet and the market’s current perception of the company’s overall worth. This situation also presents a challenge for Semler’s corporate strategy. When a company’s stock trades below its NAV, issuing new shares to raise capital becomes dilutive. This is because selling shares at a price below the value of the underlying assets per share effectively reduces the NAV per share for existing shareholders. Under these conditions, Semler can no longer issue shares accretively (i.e., in a way that increases the NAV per share), limiting one potential avenue for growth or capital raising. Why Does Tom Lee Remain Bullish on SMLR Stock? In the face of this stock underperformance and the seemingly disadvantageous trading position, one prominent voice remains notably optimistic: Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee . Known for his often bullish stance on Bitcoin and the broader market, Lee has included Semler Scientific in his curated list of investment opportunities, specifically within his “Granny Shot” portfolio. What is the “Granny Shot” portfolio? It’s a concept Lee uses to highlight unconventional or overlooked investment ideas that possess significant potential upside, often involving unique situations or strategies not widely appreciated by the mainstream market. By including SMLR stock in this portfolio, Tom Lee signals his belief that despite the current challenges and the deep BTC NAV discount , there are underlying factors that make Semler an attractive, albeit perhaps non-obvious, investment. Tom Lee’s bullishness likely stems from several potential factors: Deep Value Play: The significant discount to NAV could be seen as a mispricing by the market, offering an opportunity to buy assets (the Bitcoin) at a discount through the stock. Leverage to Bitcoin Price: As a Bitcoin treasury stock , Semler offers leveraged exposure to potential increases in the price of Bitcoin. If BTC’s value rises, the value of Semler’s holdings increases proportionally, which could eventually narrow the discount and boost the stock price. Belief in the Core Business: While the Bitcoin treasury aspect is key, Tom Lee might also see underlying value or future potential in Semler’s core medical technology business, which the market is currently heavily discounting due to the focus on the Bitcoin play. Potential for Corporate Action: A significant NAV discount can sometimes trigger corporate actions aimed at closing the gap, such as share buybacks (if the company has free cash flow from its operations) or strategic adjustments. For Tom Lee , Semler Scientific appears to represent a classic “value trap” turned potential opportunity – a situation where an asset is trading below its perceived intrinsic value, waiting for a catalyst to unlock that value. Challenges and Considerations for Semler Scientific While the deep discount might look appealing on paper, it’s crucial to understand the challenges Semler Scientific faces: Market Perception: Investors may be hesitant about a medical tech company diversifying so heavily into a volatile asset like Bitcoin, leading to uncertainty and a lower valuation multiple compared to either pure tech or pure Bitcoin plays. Operational Cash Flow: The ability to leverage the Bitcoin holdings or close the discount might depend on the profitability and cash flow generation of the core medical tech business. If the core business struggles, it limits financial flexibility. Bitcoin Price Volatility: While a rising BTC price is a tailwind, a falling price exacerbates the situation, potentially widening the discount and further pressuring the stock. Inability to Issue Accretively: As mentioned, trading below NAV makes issuing shares for expansion or acquisitions disadvantageous, hindering a common corporate finance tool. These factors contribute to the discount and represent real hurdles that Semler must navigate. Is SMLR Stock a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap? This is the central question for investors considering Semler Scientific. The deep BTC NAV discount , coupled with Tom Lee ‘s endorsement, presents a compelling case for potential upside. It offers leveraged exposure to Bitcoin in a potentially undervalued package. However, the discount exists for reasons. The market is clearly assigning a lower value to the combination of the medical tech business and the Bitcoin treasury than the sum of their parts. Investors must weigh whether the current challenges are temporary headwinds or structural issues that will persist. Key questions for potential investors: Do you believe in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin? Do you see potential for the discount to narrow over time, either through a rising Bitcoin price, improved performance in the core business, or strategic corporate actions? Are you comfortable with the volatility associated with both a small-cap stock and Bitcoin? Semler Scientific is not a low-risk investment. It’s a speculative play that combines the uncertainties of a niche medical tech business with the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Tom Lee’s bullish view provides a notable perspective, but it’s essential for investors to conduct their own thorough research and understand the risks involved. Conclusion: A Bullish Endorsement Amidst the Discount Semler Scientific’s transformation into a Bitcoin treasury stock has created a unique investment scenario. Trading at a significant BTC NAV discount , the company faces clear challenges, including a recent sharp decline in its SMLR stock price and limitations on issuing shares accretively. Yet, prominent figures like Tom Lee see beyond the current struggles, viewing the deep discount as an potential opportunity within his “Granny Shot” investment framework. Whether Semler can successfully navigate its challenges, leverage its Bitcoin holdings, and ultimately see its market valuation align more closely with its underlying assets remains to be seen. For investors intrigued by the intersection of traditional markets and cryptocurrency, Semler Scientific offers a complex, high-risk, high-reward proposition worth watching closely.

The new cap marks a doubling from the prior $500 million ceiling, which had itself been raised just days earlier following a community-driven outcry over bot activity and rapid sellout times. Plasma said the short-notice announcement was designed to give real users, such as those active in its Discord, a fairer shot at joining. But it’s not a token sale just yet. “Deposits are not the sale itself,” Plasma clarified in a post. “All funds remain fully owned by depositors and will be bridged to Plasma mainnet beta.” Participants earn the right to buy into the eventual $50 million XPL public sale based on how many units they’ve locked up by the cutoff. The sale is valued at $500 million on a fully diluted basis. Earlier this week, the project — which aims to bring native stablecoin functionality to Bitcoin through an EVM-compatible sidechain — saw its initial $500 million cap fill in just five minutes , according to Arkham data. That figure was ten times what Plasma initially planned, indicative of massive investor appetite for stablecoin infrastructure. The team behind Plasma has positioned its chain as a way to sidestep Ethereum’s high fees and congestion by building a zero-gas environment for stablecoin transactions while being anchored to Bitcoin’s security model.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The document also notes that the private equity market, valued at $5.3 trillion in 2023, is projected to grow to $7 trillion by 2030, with a significant portion expected to be tokenized. Within this context, the Aurum initiative serves as a practical demonstration of tokenization’s real-world application. The fund’s structure on XRPL is intended to facilitate increased participation by investors and reduce traditional barriers associated with private equity markets, such as high minimum investments and limited liquidity. Ripple’s Connection to the WEF and XRPL Ecosystem WrathofKahneman, in his tweet , also pointed out Ripple’s indirect association with the initiative through its role as a contributor to the WEF. Ripple, the enterprise blockchain company behind significant development on XRPL, has frequently participated in policy dialogues and reports published by the Forum . Although the report does not reference Ripple directly in connection with the Aurum fund, its ongoing involvement with the WEF signals institutional acknowledgment of blockchain platforms linked to the company. As interest in tokenization accelerates globally, the Aurum Equity Partners initiative and its recognition in WEF’s latest report may serve as a precedent for further adoption of decentralized ledger technology in capital markets.

A significant piece of stablecoin legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, has just cleared a critical hurdle in the U.S. Senate and is now set for a final vote next week. This development could reshape how stablecoins operate within the United States, impacting everything from innovation to consumer protection. Understanding the Path of the US Stablecoin Regulation Bill For those following the evolving rules around digital assets, the progress of any major stablecoin bill is big news. This particular bill, the GENIUS Act, recently saw the U.S. Senate take a decisive step. They voted 68-30 to invoke cloture on the bill. What does invoking cloture mean? Essentially, it’s a parliamentary procedure used in the Senate to end debate and proceed to a vote. This successful cloture vote signals strong bipartisan support, or at least a desire to move the process forward, clearing the way for a final vote on the bill’s passage. The final vote is currently scheduled for next Monday. Key Provisions of the GENIUS Act: What Does This Stablecoin Legislation Propose? The GENIUS Act isn’t just a general statement about stablecoins; it lays out specific requirements aimed at bringing clarity and stability to the sector. Understanding these details is crucial for anyone involved with or interested in the future of digital finance in the U.S. Here are some of the core requirements proposed by the bill: Licensing Requirements: The bill mandates that entities wishing to issue stablecoins must obtain a specific license. This moves stablecoin issuance from a less regulated space into a framework requiring formal approval and oversight. 100% Reserve Requirements: A cornerstone of the bill is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves equal to 100% of the value of the stablecoins they have issued. This aims to ensure that every stablecoin in circulation is fully backed by assets, providing greater confidence in its stability. Annual Audit Requirements: For larger stablecoin issuers, specifically those with a market capitalization of $50 billion or more, the bill introduces mandatory annual audits. These audits would verify that the required reserves are being maintained and that the issuer is complying with other regulatory standards. Regulation on Foreign Issuers: The GENIUS Act also addresses stablecoins issued by foreign entities but used within the United States. It proposes regulations to cover these issuers, aiming to create a level playing field and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Why the GENIUS Act Matters for Crypto Regulation US This stablecoin bill is widely seen as a significant piece of potential US stablecoin regulation. Its passage could establish a foundational framework for how these digital assets are treated legally and financially in the country. For years, the crypto industry has sought regulatory clarity in the U.S., and a dedicated stablecoin law could provide a benchmark. Potential Impacts: Increased Trust and Adoption: Clear rules and strong reserve requirements could make stablecoins more appealing to traditional financial institutions and mainstream users, potentially boosting adoption. Innovation within Bounds: While regulation adds constraints, a clear framework can also provide certainty for businesses to innovate within defined boundaries. Market Structure: The requirements could favor larger, more established players who can more easily meet the licensing, reserve, and audit demands. Global Influence: Given the size of the U.S. market, this legislation could influence regulatory approaches in other countries. However, challenges remain. Some in the crypto community worry that stringent requirements could stifle innovation or create barriers to entry for smaller projects. The specifics of implementation and enforcement will also be key. What’s Next for This Stablecoin Legislation? All eyes will now be on the Senate floor next Monday for the final vote on the GENIUS Act. The successful cloture vote suggests a strong possibility of passage, but nothing is certain until the final tally is cast. If passed by the Senate, the bill would still need to navigate the House of Representatives and ultimately be signed into law by the President. However, reaching this final Senate vote is a major step forward for US stablecoin regulation. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Stablecoins The impending final Senate vote on the GENIUS Act marks a pivotal moment for stablecoins and the broader crypto ecosystem in the United States. This comprehensive stablecoin bill, with its focus on licensing, reserves, and audits, represents a significant move towards establishing clear and robust stablecoin legislation. Whether it passes in its current form or not, its progress highlights the increasing urgency policymakers feel in addressing the regulatory status of stablecoins. The outcome of next week’s vote will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of these crucial digital assets in the U.S. To learn more about the latest crypto regulation trends, explore our article on key developments shaping crypto regulation in the U.S. This post Crucial US Stablecoin Regulation Bill, GENIUS Act, Faces Final Senate Vote Next Week first appeared on BitcoinWorld and is written by Editorial Team",Crypto News|crypto policy|Legislation|REGULATION|Stablecoins|US Senate,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-06-12 07:30:15

DJT, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Slide Trigger Panic in Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global cryptocurrency market witnessed a broad downturn today, with total market capitalization falling by 1.68% to $3.39 trillion. Daily trading volume also dipped 5.27% to $133.81 billion, signaling cautious investor sentiment. The Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 61, still in the “Greed” zone, though edging downward as uncertainty clouds the outlook. The decline follows a sequence of macroeconomic and political events that have rattled both crypto and traditional markets. Talking about Wall Street, the S&P 500 is down 0.27% at 6,022.24, DJT fell 1.87% to 20.52, NASDAQ dropped 0.50% to 19,615.88, and the Dow Jones slipped marginally by 0.0026% to 42,865.77. Liquidations Surge as Traders Get Caught Off Guard? As price action turned against the bulls, liquidations began to mount. In the past 24 hours, 112,143 traders were liquidated, amounting to a total of $327.94 million wiped out across exchanges. The single-largest liquidation occurred on Binance’s BTCUSD perpetual pair, totaling $2.15 million. Source: CoinGlass The scale of the liquidations suggests that many traders were caught off guard by the rapid reversal in sentiment, especially those betting on a bullish continuation after the CPI dip. With leveraged positions wiped out across both long and short sides, volatility is expected to be present in the short term. BTC & ETH in Red, Altcoins Hit Harder? Bitcoin price is down 1.68% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $107,740.76. Its market cap stands at $2.14 trillion, with $53.99 billion in daily trading volume. Ethereum followed suit, dipping 1.11% to $2,760.10. Among the top altcoins, XRP dropped 1.87%, while Solana took a heavier bash with a 3.97% decline.

WLFI is still inactive and has no trading mechanism, but may be used for profit-sharing or voting. The native token of World Liberty Fi, just saw a whale or an institution move in with a $40M purchase. The OTC deal was in exchange for a direct transfer of WLFI tokens. On-chain data shows this is the second purchase for the whale address. In total, 800M tokens changed hands, suggesting an institutional-size deal. The purchase set up a price of $0.1 per WLFI, setting up hopes of a growing valuation once the token becomes tradable. The first presale buyers acquired WLFI at $0.015 and later at $0.05. A whale/institution appears to be doing an OTC deal for $WLFI . 40 mins ago, the whale sent $40M $USDT to World Liberty Finance ( @worldlibertyfi ). 8 days ago, the whale sent $40M $USDT to World Liberty and received 400M $WLFI , 4 days ago. https://t.co/eZ3ivzbYuV pic.twitter.com/0gIoXFki0v — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 12, 2025 The renewed activity raised the question of WLFI utility in the future. Some see the purchases as preparation for trading with listing on exchanges. The WLFI community also suggests the whale purchase may be a rush to acquire more tokens ahead of the closing of OTC deals and switching to a market valuation for WLFI. World Liberty Fi will launch voting for token holders from June 16, making WLFI more important. One of the first votes is expected to push for the listing of the native token, after over a year of inactivity. The token is currently owned by over 83,000 users on Ethereum , including large-scale whales. More WLFI is available in the original team wallets, which may extend ownership following the two open pre sales. The whale’s wallet was first active in March, and has mostly performed DEX swaps, also interacting with OKX. The current WLFI purchase is the biggest single-asset transaction for the buyer. WLFI increases general crypto activity The Trump family fund is increasing its multi-chain activity. For now, WLFI is not awaiting immediate listings, and there are only speculations about the next step, possibly a DEX listing. World Liberty Fi is currently the most active around its USD1 token, aiming to expand its availability. The project’s stablecoin was recently minted on TRON, adding to its distribution.

Meme token markets and a recent trading competition increased the activity for USD1, turning it into the fourth most traded stablecoin by daily volumes. USD1 achieved a supply of 2.18M, with a daily volume of around $453M. The token is currently most active as a counterparty to memes on PancakeSwap, further boosting the Binance ecosystem. Most of the activity reflects the current competition, where traders are battling for a ranking on the leaderboards . World Liberty Fi also funded an Aave V3 account, possibly launching its own lending platform. The fund will not use regular Aave vaults, but have its own instance of Aave V3 to control lending and liquidity. One possible goal for World Liberty Fi is to become a DeFi platform in its own right, using USD1 liquidity and WLFI tokens for voting.

In the vote held today, the Senate initiated the “cloture” procedure necessary for the bill to be discussed in later stages. Republican Senator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and a co-sponsor of the bill, called the development a major win for both innovation and national security. “This development did not happen by chance. We showed leadership. We are giving the strongest response to those who say Washington can’t act, to those who think the two parties can’t work together,” Scott said. The bill requires stablecoin issuers to have their issued assets fully backed by U.S. dollars or similar liquid assets, imposes annual audit requirements for issuers with a market value of over $50 billion, and includes regulatory provisions for issuers based abroad.

A recent report from Bloomberg suggests that the likelihood of a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund product receiving approval is growing stronger. This development is significant for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market, indicating a potential expansion of regulated investment avenues beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What’s Happening with the SEC Solana ETF Approval Process? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial role in approving or denying financial products like ETFs. According to Bloomberg, the SEC has taken a notable step by engaging directly with asset management firms that have filed for a Solana ETF. At least three companies have reportedly received requests from the SEC to amend their S-1 filings. These filings are the initial registration documents required for securities offerings. The SEC’s requests focus on specific details within these applications, particularly concerning: Redemption Mechanisms: How investors will be able to redeem their ETF shares (e.g., for cash or potentially in-kind SOL). Solana Staking Rewards: Whether and how any rewards generated from staking the underlying SOL held by the fund will be handled and paid out to investors. Historically, the SEC’s engagement with applicants, asking for detailed amendments rather than issuing outright rejections, has been interpreted as a positive sign. It suggests the regulator is actively reviewing the applications and working through potential structural and operational considerations necessary for approval. Why Are These SEC Requests Seen as a Positive Signal for a Solana ETF ? Market analysts and commentators view the SEC’s requests for S-1 amendments as a significant step forward. It indicates that the SEC is moving beyond initial review and is delving into the practicalities of how a Solana ETF would operate under U.S. regulations. This level of engagement is a stark contrast to periods where the regulator seemed hesitant or unwilling to discuss the specifics of crypto-related investment products. Noelle Acheson, a respected voice in the crypto space and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, has asserted that the fact the SEC is requesting amendments suggests a potential approval timeline that could be relatively short – perhaps within a few days or at most a few weeks. This sentiment echoes the optimism seen during the final stages of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval process. The focus on redemption mechanisms is standard for any ETF, but the inquiry into staking rewards is particularly noteworthy for a Proof-of-Stake asset like Solana. It shows the SEC is grappling with the unique features of these cryptocurrencies and how they fit within the traditional financial framework of an ETF. Addressing the Nuances of Solana Staking in an ETF Structure Solana operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows SOL holders to ‘stake’ their tokens to support network operations and earn rewards. For a Solana ETF holding actual SOL tokens, the question of how to handle these potential staking rewards is critical. There are several potential approaches fund issuers might propose or the SEC might require: Reinvestment: Staking rewards could be automatically reinvested back into the fund, increasing the net asset value (NAV) over time. Cash Distribution: Rewards could be periodically distributed to ETF shareholders as cash income. Fund Manager Decision: The fund’s structure might allow the manager discretion on how to handle rewards, within regulatory guidelines. The SEC’s focus on this aspect highlights the complexity of translating native crypto economics into a traditional ETF wrapper. Clarifying how staking rewards will be managed is essential for investor understanding and regulatory compliance. The Broader Picture: Crypto ETF Landscape and Institutional Interest The potential approval of a Solana ETF follows the landmark approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year and the recent approvals of Ethereum spot ETFs (though trading has not yet begun for Ethereum). This progression suggests a growing regulatory comfort level with certain cryptocurrencies as underlying assets for regulated investment products. A Solana ETF would provide investors with another regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to the SOL token without directly buying, storing, or securing the cryptocurrency themselves. This accessibility is particularly appealing to traditional financial advisors and institutional investors who operate within strict compliance frameworks. The entry of multiple asset management giants preparing applications underscores the significant market demand they perceive for a SOL investment product. Companies like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck, who were also pioneers in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF races, are among those positioning themselves for a potential SOL ETF launch. Who’s Preparing for a SOL ETF Launch and What’s the Timeline? Reports indicate that at least seven asset management companies are actively working on preparing or have already filed applications for a spot SOL ETF . This includes major players in the crypto asset management space such as: Grayscale Bitwise VanEck And others… The competition among these firms highlights the anticipated demand and the race to be among the first to market if approval is granted. Regarding a timeline, while Noelle Acheson suggested days or weeks based on the S-1 amendments, previous reporting by Bitcoin World indicated that the SEC could potentially approve such a product within three to five weeks. These timelines are estimates and depend heavily on the SEC’s review process and any further questions or requirements they may have for the applicants. Benefits of a Potential Solana ETF Increased Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure via brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: Offers a regulated investment vehicle for SOL. Enhanced Liquidity: May bring more capital into the Solana ecosystem. Institutional Adoption: Facilitates investment from large funds and institutions. Potential Staking Yield: Depending on the structure, investors might benefit from staking rewards. Challenges and Considerations Regulatory Hurdles Remain: While positive, approval is not guaranteed and depends on addressing SEC concerns. Staking Complexity: Handling staking rewards within an ETF framework is novel and requires clear rules. Market Volatility: The price of SOL, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Custody and Security: Ensuring secure custody of the underlying SOL tokens is paramount. Actionable Insights for Readers If you are interested in the potential of a Solana ETF, here are a few things to consider: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring news from the SEC, asset managers, and financial news outlets like Bloomberg. Understand the Risks: An ETF tracks the price of the underlying asset, which in this case is a volatile cryptocurrency. Research Specific ETFs: If approved, compare the structures, fees, and how staking rewards (if any) are handled by different issuers. Consult a Financial Advisor: Determine if a Solana ETF fits your investment goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Optimism Builds for a Solana Investment Future The news that the SEC is actively engaging with Solana ETF applicants and requesting detailed amendments to S-1 filings is a genuinely positive development. While not a guarantee of approval, it signals that the regulatory path is being explored and potentially cleared. The focus on crucial aspects like redemptions and staking rewards shows the SEC is doing its due diligence. With multiple asset managers vying to launch a product and analysts suggesting a potentially rapid timeline once these details are ironed out, optimism for a U.S. Solana ETF is undeniably accelerating. This could mark another significant step in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, offering investors regulated access to the dynamic Solana ecosystem.

In a tweet, he asserted that the two assets are “the most important pre-mined coins.” This statement is further backed by a document he attached to his tweet. Recognition in ISO Standards for Financial Messaging SMQKE previously explored this subject in an article published by Times Tabloid , where he described how both Ripple and Stellar are already structurally integrated into the architecture of future finance. The researcher emphasizes that XRP and XLM are not only active digital assets but also serve as frameworks around which interoperability and compliance standards for distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are being constructed. XRP AND XLM ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRE-MINED COINS Documented. pic.twitter.com/YamscI9n4U — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 10, 2025 These standards are essential to enabling blockchain systems to communicate with traditional financial institutions in a secure and consistent manner. Central to SMQKE’s claim is the recognition of Ripple and Stellar in documentation produced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). According to the tweet and the accompanying documentation, both platforms are cited within ISO materials that govern cross-border financial messaging, such as ISO 20022. This international standard is being adopted by banks and financial networks to unify data exchange formats, and SMQKE points out that Ripple and Stellar are mentioned as reference models for compliant DLT integration. IEEE 4210 Cites Ripple and Stellar Consensus Mechanisms In addition to ISO references, SMQKE points to the IEEE blockchain reference framework, specifically IEEE 4210, where both Ripple and Stellar are again formally acknowledged. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The IEEE 4210 standard is a technical framework developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to assist developers, policymakers, and enterprises in building regulatory-aligned blockchain systems. Within this framework, Ripple Consensus and Stellar Consensus are named alongside other consensus mechanisms, including proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. According to SMQKE, “XRP AND XLM ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRE-MINED COINS.” This assertion highlights their integration at the standards level, well beyond the scope of speculative trading or decentralized application development. Their alignment with ISO and IEEE frameworks places them in a unique category of blockchain technologies that are not only functional but also pre-approved for interoperability with the global financial system.

Understanding GameStop’s Strategic Convertible Notes Offering According to information circulating, including a report from Solid Intel on X, GameStop is reportedly planning a private offering of senior convertible notes aimed at raising a significant $1.75 billion. But what exactly are convertible notes, and why would a company like GameStop choose this route? Convertible notes are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company’s common stock at a later date, usually at the option of the noteholder or under specific conditions. Think of them as a hybrid of debt and equity. Here are a few key aspects of convertible notes: Lower Interest Rates: Because they offer the potential for equity upside, convertible notes typically carry lower interest rates compared to traditional corporate bonds. This reduces the company’s ongoing cash interest payments. Delayed Dilution: Unlike issuing common stock directly, convertible notes only result in stock dilution if and when they are converted. This delays the impact on the company’s earnings per share. Flexibility: They can be structured in various ways, offering flexibility in terms of conversion price, maturity date, and conversion triggers. For GameStop , a company that has experienced significant volatility in its GME stock price, this type of financing could be appealing. It allows them to raise a large amount of capital without immediately diluting existing shareholders, while potentially benefiting from lower borrowing costs. The Timing: GameStop’s Bitcoin Purchase Precedes Capital Raise What makes this offering particularly intriguing is its timing. The news of the planned $1.75 billion convertible notes offering comes shortly after GameStop revealed its significant investment in Bitcoin. Between May and early June, the company purchased 4,710 BTC. At current market prices, this represents a substantial holding, worth tens of millions of dollars. This raises an important question: Is there a direct link between the Bitcoin purchase and the capital raise? While the official announcement regarding the use of proceeds from the notes offering hasn’t specified funding further crypto buys, the sequence of events is noteworthy. Companies typically raise capital for general corporate purposes, working capital, potential acquisitions, or investments. GameStop’s recent actions suggest a potential shift or expansion in its strategic priorities, which now evidently includes holding digital assets. Could the Bitcoin purchase be an initial step in a broader digital asset strategy that requires significant capital? Or is the capital raise simply a timely move to strengthen the balance sheet and fund other initiatives, with the Bitcoin holding being a separate treasury management decision? Without explicit details from GameStop, much remains open to interpretation. Implications for GME Stock and Future Strategy How might this convertible notes offering impact GME stock ? There are a few potential angles to consider: Positive: Capital Infusion: Raising $1.75 billion provides GameStop with a substantial war chest. This capital could be used to fund transformation efforts, invest in e-commerce capabilities, explore new business ventures (perhaps related to gaming or digital assets), or simply provide financial stability. This influx of cash is generally seen as positive for a company’s operational capacity. Negative: Potential Dilution: The primary concern with convertible notes is the potential for future stock dilution. If the notes are converted into shares, it increases the total number of outstanding shares, which can put downward pressure on the stock price and dilute the value of existing shares. The conversion price relative to the current stock price will be a critical factor. Investor Sentiment: The market’s reaction will depend on how investors perceive the company’s use of funds and the terms of the offering. If the capital is seen as fueling a credible, growth-oriented strategy, it could be positive. If the terms are unfavorable or the use of funds is unclear, it could lead to skepticism. This capital raise, combined with the Bitcoin purchase , suggests GameStop under CEO Ryan Cohen is continuing to explore various avenues beyond its traditional retail model. The strategic direction appears to involve strengthening its financial position while potentially experimenting with new asset classes or business models. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? GameStop’s decision to hold Bitcoin and potentially use a large capital raise in proximity to this move sends a signal to the market regarding corporate adoption of digital assets. While not on the scale of MicroStrategy, GameStop is a well-known, albeit unconventional, public company making a direct crypto investment . Here’s what this could signify for the broader crypto investment landscape: Increasing Legitimacy: More public companies holding Bitcoin in their treasury can lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a store of value or a treasury asset. Potential Trendsetter: While GameStop’s situation is unique, its move might encourage other companies, particularly in the tech or gaming sectors, to consider similar treasury strategies. Market Interest: It brings cryptocurrency into the conversation for traditional stock investors who follow GameStop, potentially piquing their interest in digital assets. However, it’s also important to note that GameStop’s financial strategy is complex and influenced by its unique market position. Its crypto investment should be viewed within the context of its overall business transformation efforts and capital structure decisions. Challenges and Opportunities in GameStop’s Bold Move GameStop’s strategy, while potentially transformative, is not without its challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Execution Risk: Successfully deploying $1.75 billion into initiatives that generate returns and transform the business is a significant undertaking. Market Volatility: Both GME stock and Bitcoin are known for high volatility, adding layers of risk to the company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Dilution Management: Managing the potential future dilution from the convertible notes requires careful financial planning and communication with shareholders. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for corporate crypto holdings and related activities is still evolving. Opportunities: Financial Flexibility: The capital raise provides significant flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives without being constrained by cash flow. Potential Asset Appreciation: The Bitcoin holding offers potential upside if the value of BTC increases. Strategic Pivots: The capital allows GameStop to make substantial investments in new business areas that could redefine the company. Investor Engagement: The combination of meme stock status, strategic capital raise, and crypto exposure keeps GameStop highly relevant and engaging for a certain segment of the investor base. The coming months will be crucial in observing how GameStop utilizes this significant capital and whether its foray into crypto investment becomes a more central part of its strategy or remains a treasury diversification tactic. Conclusion: A Strategic Blend of Tradition and Innovation GameStop’s planned $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, hot on the heels of its Bitcoin purchase , represents a fascinating intersection of traditional corporate finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This move provides the company with substantial capital, offering opportunities for strategic investment and business transformation, while also introducing the potential for future dilution of GME stock . The inclusion of a significant crypto investment adds a layer of modern treasury management to the mix, potentially signaling a broader corporate trend. As GameStop navigates this complex financial landscape, all eyes will be on how effectively it deploys these resources to reshape its future.

In a June 11 post on X, Flare announced that it is teaming up with VivoPower International, a multinational sustainable energy firm, to help generate yield on VivoPower’s XRP holdings. VivoPower will initially deploy $100 million XRP through Flare’s native protocols like Firelight, and reinvest that income into its core XRP holdings to create a “perpetually compounding and capital-efficient” treasury. For Flare, the partnership represents a significant milestone in demonstrating the network’s capacity to support institutional-grade utility for XRP. The collaboration also highlights the growing relevance of Flare ’s broader infrastructure, particularly its FAssets system, which enables non-smart contract tokens like XRP to interact with DeFi protocols while preserving their native security models.

At press time, its market capitalization stood at approximately $1.27 billion. However, daily trading volume surged over 120% compared to the previous day, indicating heightened market activity and growing interest. FLR price analysis From a technical perspective, FLR appears to be trading within an ascending parallel channel that has been forming since June 5. A breakout from this structure could set the stage for a sustained upward move.

Momentum indicators such as the MACD and RSI are also trending upwards, further supporting the positive outlook. FLR MACD and RSI chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news If the bullish momentum continues, the next key resistance lies near the $0.02 psychological level, which also aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. A confirmed breakout above this zone could validate the pattern and fuel further gains. Conversely, if it pulls back, support is expected near the $0.0185 level. A sustained drop below this threshold could invalidate the upside setup and lead to a retest of the 50-day SMA around $0.0181 before any potential recovery.

The shift follows the recent suspension of U.S. sanctions on Syria. According to a recent notice issued by the crypto exchange, Syria is no longer classified under the “prohibited country” category. This means that Syrian residents can now register themselves on the platform and access crypto-related services through the crypto exchange . The services now available to Syrian traders include spot and futures trading, staking and earn products, Binance Pay for cross-border payments, and educational content in Arabic. “This means we can now onboard and support Syrian residents, granting full access to products and services,” wrote the exchange in its notice. In May 2025, President Trump announced that the U.S. would lift its sanctions on Syria following a change in leadership. The current government, led by Syria’s new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, successfully overthrew the leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Al-Assad ruled over Syria from 1971 to 2024. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” said Trump according to an Al-Jazeera report .

The shift indicates a major opportunity for Binance to reach the untapped Syrian markets, considering Syria is ranked among the top 10 countries globally for most crypto-related search activity since 2021. The spike in crypto interest in Syria may be due to the economic instability and high inflation in the region which led to Syrian residents relying on informal financial systems to combat the unreliable local currency. “We’re proud to offer real solutions that support Syria’s economic recovery and help grow its digital economy, in line with international efforts and applicable regulations,” wrote the exchange. In 1979, due to the radical al-Assad regime at the time, the U.S. and many other countries classified the country as “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, which led to a ban on arms and financial restrictions, including foreign assistance. This meant that foreign entities like crypto exchanges could not officially operate in the region or facilitate crypto-related services for its residents. At the beginning of this year, the Syrian government declared that it plans to explore Bitcoin ( BTC ) legalization as well as other cryptocurrencies. The nation aimed to use crypto as a way to rebuild its post-war economy.

According to local media , Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to raise the issue during the G7 meetings scheduled from June 15 to 17, citing the growing threat of cyber-enabled financial crime linked to North Korea. The proposal will mark the first time the G7 formally considers a collective response to crypto theft tied to state-sponsored actors. The Group of Seven comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union. Ishiba is expected to call for enhanced cooperation among G7 members to tighten oversight of digital asset markets and curb illicit flows that finance weapons development . Officials believe that cutting off these funding channels is crucial to strengthening non-proliferation efforts and regional security. One of the catalysts behind Japan’s push is the $307 million hack of DMM Bitcoin , one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges. Japanese police and the FBI linked the May 2023 incident to a North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor, also referred to as Jade Sleet and UNC4899. You might also like: US DOJ moves to seize $7.7m in crypto linked to North Korean IT infiltration scheme Investigations revealed that the attack originated from a social engineering campaign and a malicious Python script, planted after a North Korean operative posing as a recruiter tricked an employee at Ginco, a wallet software provider that serviced DMM Bitcoin. The malware gave the attackers access to Ginco’s internal systems, which they later exploited to manipulate a transaction request at DMM Bitcoin, leading to the theft. Over 4,500 BTC, valued at $307 million at the time, was stolen, prompting the exchange to shut down its operations. Authorities traced the stolen funds to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group, a collective previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for engaging in cyberattacks to fund North Korea’s weapons programme. Beyond Japan, North Korean-linked hackers have been tied to some of the largest crypto-related heists in recent years, including attacks on crypto exchange Bybit, the Ronin Bridge, Harmony, and various other DeFi platforms. In response, authorities across the globe have stepped up enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a forfeiture action to seize over $7.7 million in crypto assets tied to North Korean IT workers embedded in blockchain firms as part of the DPRK RevGen initiative launched in 2024 to disrupt illicit revenue networks. Last year, the U.S. and South Korea signed a bilateral agreement to develop joint technologies to combat cryptocurrency theft by enhancing detection and response capabilities against DPRK-linked cyber actors.

While many investors are focused on higher price milestones beyond $110K, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes a major real shift is on the horizon. According to Horsley, once Bitcoin ( BTC ) crosses the $130,000 to $150,000 price levels, long-time holders will likely stop selling. He emphasized that many of these individuals and institutions accumulated Bitcoin years ago at much lower prices, and the recent price upticks have translated into profit-taking for the majority. I think once Bitcoin breaks through eg $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin. Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some. That said, once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) June 10, 2025 But in his view, that trend may soon change. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more confident holders become and Horsely believes that rather than selling, many will likely turn to alternative liquidity options that don’t require them to part with their assets. This shift could remove even more supply from circulation and put upward pressure on prices. You might also like: Will Bitcoin continue rising? Analyst eyes breakout as demand outpaces supply Not everyone agrees with Horsley’s view. Market participants argue that the inherent ‘buy-and-sell’ nature will trigger profit-seeking behavior as prices rise, resulting in more sell-offs. However, current market data supports Horsley’s thesis. Bitcoin supply dries up Recent on-chain analytics has revealed a tightening BTC supply, lower short-term selling pressure, and growing signs that investors are becoming more confident in holding their Bitcoin for the long term. According to a June 10 CryptoQuant report , the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges continues to fall. Over the past year alone, more than 550,000 BTC has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges. The numbers build on previous findings that exchange balances have dropped to their lowest levels in over eight years, an indicator that more investors are opting to store their assets privately rather than sell them. Also fueling the supply crunch is the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin. From ETFs to national reserves, global financial heavyweights are building long-term positions. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs launched in January now hold around 6% of the total BTC supply, and more countries are exploring creating their various dedicated Bitcoin reserves. Unlike retail traders, these institutional investors do not chase short-term gains, supporting the idea that more Bitcoin may be taken out of circulation and held for the long haul.

The announcement, made through a June 12 press release, followed US President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend sanctions on Syria in May. For the first time since 2019, residents in Syria can use spot and futures trading, staking, Binance Pay for cross-border transactions, and crypto education materials in Arabic. “Financial freedom should be for everyone,” Binance said in its statement. Binance resumes trading activity in Syria In its statement , Binance said millions of Syrians have a high interest in crypto because of its economic instability and high inflation. Syria, with a population of around 24 million and an estimated 8 to 15 million more living abroad, relies on remittances and informal money networks to survive repeated currency devaluations. “ These challenges likely contributed to Syria’s consistently high interest in Crypto. The country ranked among the top 10 countries globally for crypto-related search activity as recently as 2021 ,” the company explained. According to Reuters, in August 2019, Binance halted its services in Iran after blacklisting the country as a “hard sanctioned” jurisdiction. “ It is cheaper to ban all Syrians from the financial system than to audit individual transactions. This is the true meaning of self-centered collective punishment ,” reckoned Syrian Professor in Economics, Karam Shaar in a 2021 interview, speaking on Binance closing locals’ accounts. On resuming its services today, the exchange has promised to “offer real solutions that support Syria’s economic recovery.” President Trump lifted US sanctions on Syria after diplomatic plea As reported by Cryptopolitan on May 13, Trump announced to a gathering of Gulf leaders and business elites that his administration would lift all sanctions on Syria. Speaking in the presence of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump told the leaders it was an opportunity for Damascus to “start afresh.” Still, some American officials are not convinced about Syria’s internal political stability. During Trump’s Middle East tour last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned during a Senate hearing, stating that the country could be “weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions.” Rubio mentioned the post-President Bashar al-Assad’s removal from power last December, when Islamist-led factions took control of Damascus after a decade-long civil war. The secretary talked about attacks targeting minority groups, including the Alawite and Druze communities, as a sign of sectarian violence that “won’t go away.” He asked the US government to support Syria’s transitional leadership and prevent the country from any further political disputes. According to foreign policy analyst Mike Benz, the deal was conditional on the transitional Syrian government working directly with US corporations. American firms, including telecom giant AT&T, energy major Chevron, and agribusiness groups, are reportedly looking to enter the Syrian market as part of post-conflict reconstruction agreements. On the Julian Dorey Podcast, Benz questioned the ethics and contradictions embedded in the approach. “ You’re simultaneously waging a war on drugs while your government is pumping up the world’s largest drug zone and sending soldiers off to die ,” he said, referencing cases where US-backed operations used narcotics trafficking as a means to “fund regime-change wars.” He also talked about the involvement of legal counsel like George Foote, an attorney affiliated with both AT&T and the US Institute of Peace (USIP), a government-affiliated body that previously coordinated with USAID on controversial agricultural projects.

Bitcoin Options ATM IV Has Been Trending Lower In its latest weekly report, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin looks from the perspective of on-chain analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400? On-Chain Shows No Big Hurdles Ahead The indicator shared by Glassnode is the Realized Supply Density, which tells us about how concentrated the cryptocurrency’s supply is around the current spot price. When the value of this metric is high, it means the investors have participated in a large amount of buying at or near the asset’s latest price. “In such environments, even modest price fluctuations can affect a broad swath of investors, often amplifying market sensitivity and, in turn, volatility potential,” explains the analytics firm. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by in the report. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Supply Density has gone through an uplift during the past few weeks, which suggests accumulation has taken place around the current spot price. “This concentration raises the probability of outsized reactions to price movements, increasing volatility risk in the near term,” notes Glassnode. While on-chain data may hint that volatility could go up in the future, it would appear the traders on the Options market don’t quite think the same, as the At-The-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) has been going down. The IV is a metric that represents the traders’ expectations of how volatile Bitcoin will be over a given period, based on the pricing of Options contracts. The ATM version of the indicator specifically calculates this expectation based on Options closest to the latest spot price.

With on-chain data suggesting increased volatility risk and this signal forming at the same time, it now remains to be seen how Bitcoin would develop in the coming days.

Uptime Industries is introducing Lemony AI, an innovative ‘ AI-in-a-box ‘ solution designed to bring powerful on-premise AI capabilities directly to businesses. What is Lemony AI and Why On-Premise AI? Lemony AI is a compact, handheld device, roughly the size of a sandwich, that acts as a single node for running AI operations locally. Its core purpose is to address the growing need for data privacy and control, especially within regulated industries. Many organizations, particularly large enterprises in sectors like finance, healthcare, and law, are hesitant to process sensitive data using cloud-based AI models due to privacy concerns. On-premise AI solutions like Lemony AI keep all data processing within the company’s physical control, ensuring documents, files, and emails used by the AI models and agents never leave the device or the local network. This ‘everything stays in your box’ approach is a significant draw for businesses prioritizing data security. Powerful Capabilities in a Small Package Despite its small size, Lemony AI is engineered for significant performance: Each node can reportedly run a large language model ( LLM ) up to 75 billion parameters. It supports running AI agents and complex AI workflows on a single device. Power consumption is minimal, requiring only 65 watts per node, comparable to charging a laptop. Devices can be stacked and connected, allowing businesses to form larger AI clusters as their needs grow. A cluster allows each Lemony node to potentially run a different model, offering flexibility. Uptime Industries co-founder and CEO, Sascha Buehrle, highlighted the device’s ability to host open-source models or adapted versions of closed models, providing users with choice and control over the AI they deploy. Driving Enterprise AI Adoption The genesis of Lemony AI stemmed from a simple question: Could language models be distributed on microcomputers like Raspberry Pis? This early experimentation, while not initially focused on generative AI, demonstrated the potential for running models on local devices. The Uptime co-founders quickly realized that enabling local processing could be the key to unlocking wider Enterprise AI adoption. Buehrle explained that the goal was to create something small and easy to integrate into business teams without requiring complex, organization-wide IT decisions. This bottom-up approach aims to empower teams with generative AI capabilities while maintaining corporate data governance standards. The ability to scale by simply adding more Lemony nodes allows the AI infrastructure to grow organically with a company’s evolving requirements. Partnerships and Funding Fueling Growth To facilitate easier access to powerful AI models, Uptime is launching with strategic partnerships. Collaborations with tech giants like IBM and development tool providers like JetBrains will help customers access a range of AI models, including IBM’s closed models, directly through the Lemony platform. Uptime Industries has successfully raised $2 million in a seed funding round. The round was led by True Ventures, with participation from Alumni Ventures, JetBrains, and several angel investors. This funding will be instrumental in further developing the Lemony AI device and its accompanying software. Looking Ahead: Lemony OS and Beyond The company’s future plans extend beyond just its proprietary AI hardware . Uptime is developing Lemony OS, the software powering their micro AI computers, with the aim of making it compatible with hardware from other manufacturers, such as the Nvidia DGX Spark. This strategy could significantly broaden the reach and applicability of their localized AI software. Initially focused on a single-user experience, Uptime also plans to evolve the Lemony OS to support teams, making it a more robust solution for collaborative Enterprise AI applications. Is Lemony AI Accessible for Your Business? Lemony AI is currently available at a price point of $499 per month, providing access for up to five users. This subscription model aims to make powerful on-premise AI more accessible to businesses looking to experiment or deploy localized AI solutions without a massive upfront infrastructure investment. By combining compact AI hardware , a focus on data privacy, scalable architecture, and strategic partnerships, Uptime Industries’ Lemony AI represents a compelling step towards democratizing Enterprise AI and making powerful LLM capabilities readily available on-premise. This ‘ AI-in-a-box ‘ approach could significantly impact how businesses adopt and utilize artificial intelligence in data-sensitive environments.

In an X post , she commented, “Reconciliation is our chance to fix crypto provisions that unfairly double tax bitcoin and digital assets.” In another post, Lummis argued that the current US tax system is antiquated and only stifles growth in the crypto industry. Cynthia Lummis argues that lawmakers should consider reconciliation Lummis argued that Bitcoin miners will particularly bear the brunt of double taxation, being hit once on block rewards and again when they sell their coins. She added that DeFi users also stand to face multiple taxable events without realizing any profits. While she did not directly mention which unfair tax regulations would cause this, analysts peg her comments to the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The act categorizes all crypto miners and developers as “brokers.” That means they must report details they often don’t have, such as user identities and transaction data, and are subject to more taxation. Lummis has asked Congress to resolve the problem using reconciliation, allowing tax changes to pass with a simple majority. She would like the “broker” term adjusted to alleviate the burden on digital asset miners and developers. The changes could include exemptions for non-custodial actors like developers and protocol operators. Aside from Lummis, some miners also voiced their concerns about the broker definition, arguing that it inaccurately portrays their role since they neither manage user transactions nor control customer funds. GENIUS Act passed a key vote in the US Senate The Republican senator has also shown her support for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoin or GENIUS Act , which recently passed a key vote in the US Senate. The bill is moving to the next stage after a 68-30 vote. On Wednesday, Majority Leader John Thune called his fellow lawmakers to support the bill. He raised some of President Donald Trump’s main talking points on cryptocurrencies, particularly the idea that the legislation would solidify the US position as the “crypto capital of the world.” He added that the act would help grow crypto adoption in the country. Senator Lummis appreciated Thune’s speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, acknowledging that he understands crypto regulation’s vitality and even praised him for “visionary leadership.” Speaking on the Senate floor, however, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the GENIUS Act, stating that key issues remained unresolved due to the chamber’s failure to consider several bipartisan amendments. She also spoke on the president’s ties to his family crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, voicing the concerns of many other democrats. Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act is still under discussion. Thune still believes they could do more for the crypto industry, throwing his weight behind the bill to define the market structure for crypto assets. On Tuesday, the House Financial Services lawmakers voted 32 to 19 to send the CLARITY Act to a full floor vote shortly after the Agriculture Committee approved it with a 47–6 vote.

Price predictions for 2025 range from $1.95 to $9.00. NEAR price may reach a high of $71.78 by 2030. As altcoin momentum intensifies, Near Protocol (NEAR) is rapidly emerging as a standout contender in the crypto space. Fueled by strong fundamentals and recent bullish market trends, NEAR’s rise has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. With NEAR now bridging to Solana and TON via Chain Signatures, the future looks promising. Wondering where it’s headed next?

This win was a massive sentiment booster for investors globally, which boosted the altcoin sector that benefited NEAR, but the rally took its price to $8.2, which was a strong supply level. This supply level was so firm that it gave a hard time to its price action in Q1 2025, even $3.5 multi-month support was breached and turned into a resistance by dipping to a low of $1.8. However, in Q2, recovery was seen, but it remained brief, as it waned by mid-May. At present, in June this week, it is following an ascending wedge, and where NEAR is at the lower border’s support. If it falls from here, then the $1.8 support area would be next, which will magnify investors’ fears. Under this possible condition, if NEAR price succeeds in clearing $1.8 support, then it will aim for the $1.0 mark. However, in the second week of June, the bullish factors aligned for a short-term rise in the crypto sector. If this continues, then by the end of June, NEAR crypto might retest the $3.5 resistance. Additionally, if the adoption and institutional interest rise, followed by improved geopolitical conditions, then the entire altcoin market could be nourished. There is a pretty high chance that, like last year, NEAR price may aim to retest the $8 to $9 supply range by 2025 end, but for that, it must give a weekly close over $3.5 in June and must register a Change of Character (ChoCh) above $4.345 in the following months for long-term bullish confirmation.

The launch is the first puzzle piece of Bitpanda’s ambition to build a user-first, fully compliant Web3 ecosystem – rooted in real utility and designed to make Web3 accessible for everyone. Vision: One token to connect it all Kicking off Bitpanda ’s Web3 product suite is Vision (VSN), the utility and governance token at the heart of the ecosystem. Launching on July 16, from a merge of Bitpanda’s two existing tokens, BEST and Pantos, it launches with deep, native integration across Bitpanda’s platform and upcoming Web3 products, unlocking real-world value and a clear path to mass adoption. What users can do with VSN: Save on fees: 20% fee discounts on Bitpanda.com and Bitpanda’s DeFi Wallet. Staking Rewards: Earn up to 10% APY on staked VSN. Governance: Vote on upgrades, reward rates, token emissions and protocol changes. Launchpad Access: Early entry into vetted Web3 token launches. Loyalty & Airdrops: Participate in exclusive token drops and reward programmes. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Deputy CEO at Bitpanda, commented: “Vision is the engine behind everything we’re building in Web3, like electricity is for many things in modern life. It fuels the ecosystem, connects our products, and rewards users for engaging with the tools we’re building. This includes fee savings and staking, as well as governance and loyalty, which turn into benefits for everyone in the Bitpanda ecosystem and beyond.” The Bitpanda Web3 ecosystem While many Web3 projects remain experimental, Bitpanda’s approach is grounded in real utility. Its new ecosystem is built for everyday users and will enable millions of people to enter Web3, designed to enable Web3 to reach the mainstream. With nearly 7 million users, Bitpanda’s aim is to give everyone access in a compliant and secure way, without sacrificing on the user experience. In addition to Vision (VSN), Bitpanda’s Web3 product suite contains the following components: Bitpanda DeFi Wallet: The consumer-grade entry point An intuitive smart wallet providing everything users need to trade, earn, and manage assets onchain across major blockchain networks, all from a single, intuitive app. Designed for both crypto natives and newcomers, the wallet allows users to trade, earn, and manage assets with institutional-grade security. At launch, the wallet will support over 5,000 tokens across Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum. Vision Protocol: Frictionless, cross-chain trading Vision Protocol is the underlying liquidity engine of the ecosystem. It aggregates top decentralised exchanges and bridges like 1inch, Jupiter, and Rango to deliver seamless swaps across chains – fully embedded into the Bitpanda DeFi Wallet. Vision Chain: Europe’s compliant Layer 2 A dedicated Ethereum Layer 2 network designed for tokenising real-world assets. Vision Chain serves as the compliant backbone for Europe’s onchain finance, bringing securities, commodities, and fiat onchain in one unified layer. Bitpanda Launchpad: Onramping innovation A platform for launching curated, high-quality crypto projects. Bitpanda Launchpad ensures investor protection, project legitimacy, and fast-track access to promising teams and listing on Bitpanda and their partners. For investors, it provides early access to the cutting edge of DeFi innovation, creating a true win-win for builders and users alike. Eric Demuth, Co-Founder and CEO at Bitpanda, commented: “We are highly committed to build the onchain future in a compliant, secure and simple to use way. Just like Apple did with Smartphones. Therefore we have hired a strong team of Web3 industry experts - and this has just been the start for our ambitious plans.” About Bitpanda Bitpanda was founded in Vienna in 2014 and is the leading European crypto platform.

The sources also said Google will then sell that computing capacity to OpenAI to meet the growing demand for services like ChatGPT. OpenAI has dealt with increasing demand for computing capacity for training language models and running inference since ChatGPT was established in late 2022. The firm acknowledged on Monday that its annualized revenue run rate climbed to $10 billion as of June, positioning the company to hit its full-year target amid booming adoption of AI. AI sector sees growing demand for computing resources CoreWeave is expected to bank big in Google’s newly signed partnership with OpenAI, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources revealed that the neocloud company will provide computing capacity to Google’s cloud unit. Google will sell the computing capacity to OpenAI’s infrastructure for training and running its AI models, including ChatGPT. The sources, who requested anonymity, added that the tech firm will also provide some of its computing resources to OpenAI. “The infrastructure that you need to build and deliver artificial intelligence is one of the true super cycles that exist. Working with the clients who are building the infrastructure that will drive artificial intelligence, there has been no reduction in demand.” -Mike Intrator, CEO at CoreWeave The details of the arrangement first came to light on Tuesday, showing the evolving dynamics between hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft , and Google and neocloud companies like CoreWeave. Hyperscalers are large cloud service providers that provide cloud infrastructure and massive-scale data centers. The surge in demand for computing resources has generated major investment commitments and turned rivals into partners. CoreWeave signed up Google as a customer in the first quarter, and it was backed by OpenAI and Nvidia. CoreWeave has already been a major supplier of OpenAI’s infrastructure, where it signed a five-year contract worth $11.9 billion to provide dedicated computing capacity for OpenAI’s model training and inference. The artificial intelligence firm also took a $350 million equity stake in CoreWeave in March. OpenAI boosted the partnership last month through an additional agreement worth up to $4 billion, extending through April 2029. The sources argued that Google Cloud, as a new customer, could help CoreWeave diversify its revenue resources. They also believe that having a credible partner with deep pockets like Google enables the startup to secure more favorable financing terms to support ambitious data center builds across the country. According to the sources, the partnership could also boost Google’s cloud unit, which generated $43 billion in sales last year, allowing it to capitalize on the growth of OpenAI. They also acknowledged that the deal positions Google as a neutral provider of computing resources in competition with peers such as Amazon and Microsoft. Tech companies reevaluate deals with their partners The deal coincides with Microsoft’s re-evaluation of its data center strategy, including withdrawing from certain data center leases. The tech company, once CoreWeave’s largest customer, accounting for about 62% of its 2024 revenue, is also negotiating with OpenAI to revise the terms of their multibillion-dollar investment, including the future equity stake it will hold in OpenAI. The partnership with Google is the latest of several initiatives made by OpenAI to reduce its dependence on Microsoft, whose Azure cloud service had served as the ChatGPT maker’s exclusive infrastructure provider until January. Both companies were in discussions for months but were previously blocked from signing a deal due to OpenAI’s lock-in with Microsoft. Intrator said the OpenAI contract decreases the single client concentration, which he hopes CoreWeave will continue to do in the future. CoreWeave’s executives also revealed that their contract with Microsoft hasn’t changed, and they haven’t seen any commitments canceled or withdrawn by the cloud giant.

Blockchain technology has taken many forms since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009. Some networks are designed to be simple and unchanging. Others embrace open-ended complexity, mostly existing without proper direction or utility. However, not every blockchain project follows those extremes. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is an example of a network with a clear purpose, as it was designed to serve real-world financial needs with speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. In a video shared by XRPL validator and crypto figure Vet (@Vet_X0), Schwartz outlined the differences between these networks, emphasizing how design choices made over a decade ago continue to define XRP’s unique position today. I really liked this slide by David on how the XRP Ledger is differentiated. pic.twitter.com/6kkrkxkjVC — Vet (@Vet_X0) June 11, 2025 A Different Philosophy from the Start Schwartz began by contrasting XRP’s goals with those of its predecessors. Bitcoin, he said, was created as a way to store and transfer value. “That’s useful,” he added, “but that’s about all it does.” Its strength lies in its simplicity and security, but that also limits its flexibility when compared to XRP . Ethereum took the opposite approach by enabling smart contracts and decentralized application development. It allowed anyone to build and deploy apps directly on the blockchain, creating a highly programmable but complex system. This turned Ethereum into a general-purpose platform, but one that comes with unpredictable transaction fees and performance bottlenecks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP was designed to operate between those two extremes, being less rigid than Bitcoin, but more focused than Ethereum. It wasn’t trying to build an open app ecosystem. It was built specifically to optimize payments and related financial functions. As a result, many market participants believe Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t compete with XRP in the payment space. Choosing Purpose Over Scope From its launch, XRP prioritized fast transaction finality, low and predictable fees, and enterprise-level integration capabilities. Schwartz emphasized that these were not afterthoughts or side benefits, but were central to the network’s architecture. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously stated that XRP was designed by engineers who recognized Bitcoin’s flaws , and this focus allows the digital asset to meet the needs of financial institutions, payment processors, and developers building financial tools. Its performance characteristics have made it attractive to institutions for cross-border payments, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and many other services, especially in environments where reliability and cost control are non-negotiable. Rather than chasing general-purpose blockchain use cases, XRP maintains a tight focus on financial applications. The digital asset was not designed to do everything, but that’s precisely why it does its job well. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The summer bull run is gearing up, and smart money is quietly accumulating two of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, both still trading under $1. First is Cardano (ADA), a long-standing altcoin with strong fundamentals and a growing ecosystem of smart contracts and DeFi activity. But the real firestarter is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-priced DeFi token at $0.03 flying under the radar that’s quickly becoming a breakout candidate. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,900 investors. More than $10.4 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. For anyone looking to make bold moves this summer, these under‑$1 plays might just be the top crypto buys before the market catches up. Cardano (ADA) Holds Steady as Market Eyes Summer Momentum Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.67, maintaining relative stability amid broader market consolidation. While ADA has yet to reclaim its early-year highs, the network continues to see steady development activity and gradual growth in total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi ecosystem. Some analysts remain cautious, citing competition from faster L1 chains, but ADA still appears on many watchlists for long-term positioning. With speculative interest building around altcoins under $1, Cardano remains a candidate for gradual upside if market sentiment improves through the summer. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction among high-ROI investors seeking breakout potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Skyrockets: $10.4M Raised and 11,900 Investors Can’t Be Wrong Mutuum Finance is rapidly carving its place in the DeFi lending space, having already attracted over $10.4 million and built a thriving community of 11,900+ holders. Right now, MUTM tokens are available at just $0.03, but in the next presale round, prices will jump to $0.035, meaning anyone who buys now locks in an instant 16.67% profit. When Mutuum officially launches at $0.06, early investors could see a massive 100% gain. This is the kind of growth that DeFi investors dream about. The Power of Dual Lending: Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Models Changing the Game Mutuum Finance’s secret weapon is its hybrid lending system that blends: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Lock your USDT into smart-contract-driven liquidity pools and earn passive income, no hassle, all automated. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Cut out the middleman and lend or borrow directly, with full control and privacy over loan terms. This combination gives users unmatched flexibility, privacy, and competitive yields, putting Mutuum ahead of the pack. Built on Trust: Certik-Audited & Backed by a Stable USD-Pegged Coin Security is vital in crypto and Mutuum Finance delivers. Its open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, one of the blockchain industry’s top security firms. On top of that, Mutuum is creating a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, designed to maintain long-term price stability and avoid the collapse risks that have tanked algorithmic stablecoins. This means safer investments and a foundation for institutional adoption. Huge Rewards for Early Backers: $100,000 MUTM Giveaway for 10 Lucky Investors To reward its earliest supporters, the platform is hosting a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each snag $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This is your chance to join a thriving community, earn amazing rewards, and ride the wave of what could be the next big DeFi success story. MUTM is exploding, still just $0.03, with a 100% gain on the table at launch. Next price jump will take price to $0.035. Wait, and you’ll pay more. $100K giveaway is also live, with 10 winners set to win $10K each. Buy now before the next breakout.

This has been obvious with multiple rejections above $110,000 over the last few days, while the bulls have held support above $108,000. This trend plays into an analysis published by crypto analyst TehThomas, who had forecasted the rejection from $110,000. But what’s more interesting is where Thomas sees the price going from here. Bitcoin Could Drop For Shallow Pullback In the analysis, Thomas explained what is happening with the Bitcoin price and why the pullback could happen. This begins with the breakout after falling toward $100,000 and then bouncing back again. The digital asset was able to quickly clear multiple fair value gaps on the 4-hour timeframes to claim its spot above $110,000. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises The crypto analyst explains that this move has triggered a shift in the sentiment toward the positive, and this has been followed by rising volumes, as well as impulsive candles. In all, this is quite bullish for the cryptocurrency. However, there is still a risk of a price decline from here. After filling multiple fair value gaps with strength, the crypto analyst believes this has set a precedent for the Bitcoin price. He expects the same pattern to play out for the cryptocurrency, which includes a rapid rise before a shallow pullback, and then a continuation from there. BTC Pullback Into $104,000 Territory The Bitcoin price recovery above $110,000 seems to have created a fair value gap below $107,000, which the crypto analyst believes will need to be filled. If this is the case, then it is possible that the price rally will not continue until this condition is fulfilled. Nevertheless, a pullback to the level would not be bearish, but rather provide a bounce-off point for the price recovery. Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash – Here Are The Targets Thomas referred to this trend as “a classic breakout-fill-continue sequence”, and the next thing in line is to fill the fair value gap. According to the shared chart, the crypto analyst sees the pullback taking the price back down below $105,000 and into the $104,000 territory before its next bounce. This would mean a 5% pullback, and going by the trends from this year so far, something that would be bad for altcoins. However, the conclusion remains that Bitcoin is still bullish from here. Once the fair value gap is filled, a strong push upward is expected, possibly toward new all-time highs. “I’m expecting a controlled retracement to fill the new 4H imbalance, after which price could continue pushing toward the major resistance area,” the analyst said. “The momentum is clean and structured—until that changes, continuation remains the more likely path.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-12 09:30:14
45856222,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=168273,1749720616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45856222.jpeg,DeFi Development Pulls $1B S-3 Registration After SEC Flags Key Omission,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-development-s3-withdrawal/,"BitcoinWorld DeFi Development Pulls $1B S-3 Registration After SEC Flags Key Omission In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi), companies often seek traditional funding avenues to fuel growth and expansion. This is why news regarding a significant player like DeFi Development (formerly known as Janover) pulling a major regulatory filing caught the attention of many in the crypto news sphere. The company recently withdrew its ambitious $1 billion S-3 registration application, a move that raises questions about regulatory readiness and future plans, especially concerning its stated interest in assets like Solana (SOL). What is an S-3 Registration and Why Did DeFi Development File One? Before diving into the specifics of the withdrawal, it’s helpful to understand what an S-3 registration is. Think of it as a shortcut for established public companies to register securities with the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). Unlike the more extensive S-1 filing required for initial public offerings (IPOs), an S-3 is available to companies that have been reporting to the SEC for a certain period and meet other eligibility criteria, signifying they are already transparent and compliant. Filing an S-3 allows a company to quickly raise capital through various offerings, like selling stock or bonds, without needing a brand-new, lengthy filing each time. It signifies a level of maturity and regulatory compliance that makes accessing public markets more efficient. DeFi Development filing an S-3 indicated its intention to become a more traditional, publicly accessible company, leveraging capital markets for potentially significant funding. A $1 billion registration is a substantial amount, suggesting considerable growth plans. For a company deeply involved in the DeFi and crypto space, this move represented a bridge between the decentralized world and traditional finance, aiming to tap into a broader pool of investors. The SEC’s Stance: Why Was the Application Deemed Ineligible? The core reason for DeFi Development withdrawing its S-3 was a determination by the SEC that the application was ineligible. This isn’t a rejection based on the company’s business model or assets like Solana , but rather a finding that the filing itself was incomplete or non-compliant with specific regulatory requirements for the S-3 form. According to reports, the ineligibility stemmed from the absence of a required internal controls report. The SEC has stringent rules about the financial reporting and internal controls of public companies, designed to protect investors by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements. For an S-3 to be effective, the filing company must meet all reporting requirements, including demonstrating effective internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). The lack of this specific report meant that, in the SEC’s view, DeFi Development did not meet a fundamental prerequisite for using the streamlined S-3 process. It’s a procedural hurdle, but a significant one, highlighting the regulator’s focus on foundational corporate governance and financial reporting standards, even for companies with a digital asset focus. Understanding the Missing Internal Controls Report What exactly is this crucial internal controls report? It’s primarily related to Section 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). SOX was enacted after major accounting scandals (like Enron and WorldCom) to improve corporate governance and accountability. Section 302 requires senior officers (CEO and CFO) to certify the accuracy of financial reports and the effectiveness of internal controls. Section 404 requires management and the external auditor to report on the adequacy of the company’s internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). For a company seeking to use an S-3, demonstrating compliance with these requirements, typically through filed reports and certifications, is essential. The absence of this report suggests that DeFi Development either had not yet established or adequately documented its ICFR to the SEC’s satisfaction, or that the required report was simply not included in the filing package. This isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox; strong internal controls are vital for preventing fraud, ensuring financial data integrity, and providing investors with confidence in the company’s reported performance. The SEC’s insistence on this report underscores its role as a guardian of investor protection within regulated markets. The Solana Connection: How Funds Were Intended for SOL One particularly interesting detail in the original plan was the intention to use some of the raised funds to purchase Solana (SOL). This highlights DeFi Development’s strategic view of incorporating significant digital asset exposure into its operations or investment strategy. Solana , known for its high throughput and growing ecosystem, is a popular asset within the crypto space. At the end of May, the company already held a substantial amount: 621,313 Solana tokens. At current market prices, this represents a considerable holding, indicating their existing commitment to the asset. The plan to use a portion of the $1 billion raise for further SOL purchases suggests they saw opportunities for growth or strategic use of Solana within their business model or investment portfolio. The withdrawal of the S-3 means this specific funding mechanism for acquiring more Solana is now on hold. While the company could potentially use other funds or methods to acquire SOL, the large-scale purchase envisioned through the S-3 raise is delayed until the regulatory hurdles are cleared. What This Means for DeFi Development and Future Plans For DeFi Development , the immediate impact is the delay in accessing the public capital markets via the S-3 mechanism. This doesn’t necessarily mean their funding plans are canceled, but the process will take longer. The company has stated its intention to refile in the future. This means they will need to address the specific issue cited by the SEC – the missing internal controls report. This will likely involve: Establishing or strengthening their internal controls over financial reporting. Documenting these controls thoroughly. Obtaining the necessary certifications and potentially external audits related to ICFR. Ensuring all required reports are included in the subsequent filing. Refiling will require time and resources, potentially pushing back any plans that were contingent on the $1 billion raise, including the significant purchase of Solana . It’s a setback, but one that is potentially fixable if the company can quickly meet the SEC’s requirements. Navigating the Regulatory Waters: Broader Implications for Crypto News This incident offers a valuable case study for the broader crypto news landscape and companies operating within it. It underscores the increasing scrutiny that crypto-adjacent businesses face when interacting with traditional financial regulations. Key takeaways include: Regulatory Readiness is Paramount: Companies looking to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance must ensure they meet all standard regulatory requirements, not just those specific to digital assets. SEC Focus on Fundamentals: The SEC is clearly focused on core financial reporting, governance, and internal controls, regardless of the company’s underlying technology or assets like Solana . Procedural Hurdles Can Cause Delays: Even established companies can face significant delays if filings are incomplete or miss required documentation. Transparency and Compliance are Key: Building robust internal processes and ensuring transparency in reporting are essential for navigating the regulatory environment successfully. For investors following crypto news , this event highlights the importance of looking beyond just the digital assets a company holds or plans to acquire (like Solana ) and considering the company’s operational and regulatory maturity, especially if they plan to access public markets. Conclusion: A Temporary Setback or a Warning Sign? DeFi Development’s withdrawal of its $1 billion S-3 registration is undoubtedly a setback, primarily due to a procedural issue flagged by the SEC regarding internal controls. While the company plans to refile, the incident delays its access to significant capital and its plans to acquire more Solana . This event serves as a clear reminder that companies operating at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance must adhere strictly to established regulatory frameworks. The SEC’s focus on fundamental requirements like internal controls signals that regulatory compliance is not a minor detail but a foundational necessity for accessing U.S. public markets. The crypto industry continues to evolve, and successful navigation will increasingly depend on robust corporate governance and a deep understanding of, and compliance with, existing financial regulations.

Ondo price could reach a high of $0.80 to $2.05. With a potential surge, Ondo crypto price may hit $9.30 by 2030. After an impressive surge that saw the ONDO price reach $1.10 before retreating to $0.91, investors are now closely eyeing its future potential. In Q2 2025 alone, ONDO gained 70% from its lows of $0.66, and despite a recent cooldown, it’s still holding onto gains of over 40%. With such resilience, ONDO price prediction 2025 has become a hot topic among analysts and retail investors alike, especially as the token continues to build credibility and momentum through high-profile developments. With more than $250 million in TVL and growing institutional interest, ONDO has solidified itself as a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) space . But how far can it go from here? Let’s dive into the detailed ONDO price forecast from 2025 to 2030. Table of contents Ondo Price Today Ondo Price Prediction 2025 ONDO Cryptocurrency Price Target 2026 – 2030 Ondo Coin Future Forecast 2026 Ondo Token Price Prediction 2027 ONDO Price Prediction Next Bullrun 2028 Ondo Price Forecast Long-term 2029 ONDO Coin Price Growth Potential 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Ondo Price Targets FAQs Ondo Price Today Cryptocurrency Ondo Token ONDO Price $ 0.84045544 -5.41% Market cap $ 2,655,089,121.8009 Circulating Supply 3,159,107,529.00 Trading Volume $ 169,566,248.3037 All-time high $2.14 on 16th December 2024 All-time low $0.08355 on 18th January 2024 Ondo Price Prediction 2025 Analyzing the daily chart reveals a fascinating price action for ONDO, especially following its recent Q2 surge. Experts were anticipating that this altcoin could gain significant traction and potentially break the crucial $1 mark, which coincides with a strong supply level. As institutional collaborations increase, retail adoption appears to be on the rise as well. Also, external factors, such as Bitcoin’s ascent beyond $100K, have contributed to a positive trend in the crypto sector. However, after mid-May, the optimism turned pessimistic when supply, after briefly touching $1, pushed the ONDO price back below the 200-day EMA band. The uptrend observed in Q2 was comparatively muted, unlike other altcoins. Recently, in June’s second week, it rose briefly in the short term to $0.90 but faced a hurdle at the 50-day EMA band. If the ONDO price continues its short-term uprise and jumps beyond the 50-day EMA band, then a target of $1.20 could be within reach by June, and a daily close above $1.20 would lead towards the potential to retest $2.05 by year-end. Conversely, with a bearish reversal and ongoing market uncertainty, the ONDO price may decline. If the $0.80 support level is breached, it could fall to $0.66.

Recent data reveals a significant resurgence in activity, particularly among Ethereum NFT traders . After a period of correction and lower engagement, the number of active traders on the Ethereum network has climbed back to levels not seen since 2022. This recovery is a hopeful sign for the broader NFT market recovery and indicates renewed interest and confidence in the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Surge in Ethereum NFT Traders ? Several factors appear to be contributing to this positive trend. While the market is complex and influenced by many variables, two key drivers have been highlighted: OpenSea’s New Rewards Program: As a leading NFT marketplace, OpenSea’s initiatives can significantly impact trader behavior. Their introduction of a rewards program seems to have incentivized activity, encouraging both new and returning users to engage with the platform and the wider Ethereum NFT ecosystem. Such programs often reward users for trading volume or participation, directly boosting the number of active traders. Increased Focus on NFT Utility : Early in the NFT boom, many projects focused primarily on digital art and collectibles without much practical use. However, developers have increasingly shifted towards building utility into NFTs. This includes integrating them into gaming ecosystems, using them for access to exclusive communities or events, providing staking opportunities, or linking them to real-world assets and services. NFTs with tangible benefits are proving more attractive and sustainable for users beyond mere speculation. This combination of platform-driven incentives and fundamental value creation through utility appears to be a powerful catalyst for the current rebound in trader numbers. How Many Ethereum NFT Traders Are We Talking About? The data paints a clear picture of the scale of this recovery. The total number of active Ethereum NFT traders has reportedly surged to approximately 40,000. This figure represents a substantial increase from lower points experienced during the market downturns and brings the activity level back in line with figures observed during parts of 2022. While not reaching the peak frenzy of late 2021 or early 2022, returning to the 40,000 mark is a meaningful indicator of market health and participation. Is This a Sign of a Full NFT Market Recovery ? While the increase in trader numbers is undoubtedly positive, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of the NFT market recovery . Trader count is one metric among many. Other factors like total sales volume, floor prices of major collections, and the influx of new capital also contribute to the overall market health assessment. However, a growing number of active participants is a foundational element for a sustainable recovery. It suggests liquidity, interest, and a base of users willing to engage with NFT assets. This trend aligns with broader positive sentiment observed in the crypto market trends , where renewed interest and capital flow into digital assets can often spill over into related sectors like NFTs. Exploring the Impact of OpenSea Rewards and NFT Utility Let’s delve a little deeper into the specific impact of the mentioned drivers: The Role of OpenSea Rewards Marketplace incentives are a classic strategy to boost activity. By rewarding users for trading, OpenSea directly encourages the behavior that drives volume and participation. This can create a positive feedback loop, attracting more users and potentially leading to more listings and sales. It also helps OpenSea maintain its position as a dominant player in the space by fostering loyalty and activity on its platform. The Growing Importance of NFT Utility The shift towards utility marks a maturation of the NFT space. Projects that offer real-world benefits or integrate NFTs into functional ecosystems are building more sustainable models. Examples include: Gaming: NFTs representing in-game assets, characters, or land. Membership: NFTs acting as digital keys for exclusive online or offline communities. DeFi Integration: Using NFTs as collateral or for yield farming. Intellectual Property: NFTs granting specific rights or royalties. This focus on utility moves NFTs beyond speculative art and towards valuable digital assets with tangible use cases, attracting a different kind of buyer and fostering longer-term holding rather than just flipping. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum NFT Traders and the Market? The return of Ethereum NFT traders to 2022 levels is a promising indicator, but the market remains dynamic. Continued growth will likely depend on: Sustained Utility Development: Projects need to continue innovating and delivering real value through NFT utility. Marketplace Innovation: Platforms like OpenSea must keep evolving their offerings and incentives. Broader Crypto Market Health: The NFT market is still heavily correlated with overall crypto market trends . Continued positive momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum typically benefits NFTs. Regulatory Clarity: As the space grows, regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping its future. For existing and potential Ethereum NFT traders , this recovery suggests renewed opportunities but also highlights the importance of doing thorough research and understanding the specific utility and community behind any NFT project. In Conclusion: A Remarkable Step Forward for Ethereum NFTs The recovery of Ethereum NFT traders to 2022 levels is a significant milestone for the digital collectibles space. Fueled by strategic moves like OpenSea rewards and a fundamental shift towards NFT utility , this surge in activity demonstrates resilience and growing maturity in the market. While challenges remain, the return of tens of thousands of traders signals renewed confidence and sets a positive tone for the ongoing NFT market recovery . It’s a clear indication that despite past volatility, the core appeal and potential of NFTs, particularly on the robust Ethereum network, continue to attract a dedicated and growing community of participants.

Gold climbed as much as 0.6% to about $3,373 an ounce. By 12:30 a.m. GMT, Brent crude futures had gained 15 cents, or 0.2%, reaching $69.92 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude added 22 cents, or 0.3%, to trade at $68.37 a barrel. Trump said on Wednesday that US personnel were being moved out of the region because “it could be a dangerous place,” and reiterated that the United States would not permit Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. His remarks followed reports stating that Washington is planning a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad and will allow military dependents to leave various posts across the Middle East due to elevated security risks, according to US and Iraqi officials. It stoked concerns that rising tensions with Iran could interrupt oil supplies. Both benchmarks had jumped more than 4% on Wednesday, marking their highest closes since early April. Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, plays a key role in global supply. Iran’s Defense Minister, Aziz Nasirzadeh, warned that Tehran would target US bases in the region if nuclear negotiations collapse and conflict breaks out with Washington. Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran should it fail to agree to a new nuclear deal. Adding to the market’s upbeat mood was growing optimism over a potential US-China trade agreement, which could lift fuel demand in the world’s two biggest economies. Gold also felt the impact of geopolitical uncertainty On Thursday, gold rose for a second straight day as tensions in the Middle East increased its appeal as a safe haven, and President Trump said he would inform trading partners of forthcoming tariff rates within two weeks. The bullion climbed as much as 0.6% to about $3,373 an ounce, building on a 1% gain from the previous session, which was also driven by a weaker dollar. Trump said he planned to send letters to US trading partners in the next one to two weeks to set unilateral tariff rates, ahead of a July 9 deadline to reinstate higher duties on many economies. He also claimed that a trade framework with China has been finalized, keeping levies between the two powers at current levels. Ongoing worries about global trade tensions and geopolitical risks have unsettled markets this year, increasing gold’s reputation as a store of value in uncertain times. The precious metal has climbed about 28% so far this year and hit an all-time high in April, supported in part by increased purchases from central banks.

The network recently introduced an auto-burn mechanism to streamline token utility and strengthen its DeFi offerings, particularly swapping and staking. Meanwhile, SHIB wallet addresses have surged to an all-time high, pointing to accelerating retail interest. Notably, wallets holding under $1,000 in value are leading this adoption wave, showcasing increased micro-investor trust in the ecosystem. As momentum builds, investors are watching the charts closely to check if SHIB can break out of its current consolidation phase. We explore the possible short-term targets in this Shiba Inu price prediction. SHIB Price Analysis: At the time of writing, SHIB price is at $0.00001275, with a 1.47% intraday drop and a weekly dip of just 0.16%. The price has ranged between a 24-hour low of $0.00001274 and a high of $0.0000136, with overall market sentiment slightly bearish as reflected in the 4.62% 24-hour drop in price. Looking at the daily chart, the 9-day SMA has turned flat near $0.00001274, suggesting that SHIB is currently testing a crucial support zone. A sustained close below this level could take the price down to its psychological support at $0.00001200. Successively, the chart also hints at a potential double-bottom formation near the $0.000012 region. If this pattern holds, and SHIB maintains support above $0.00001270, a short-term reversal could be in play.

According to an official announcement , PayPal is bringing its stablecoin PayPal USD ( PYUSD ) to the Stellar ( XLM ) blockchain network, known for its speed and low-cost transactions. The integration is currently pending regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Once live, users will benefit from more options to access and use PYUSD through digital wallets and connections to local banks and cash systems. In addition to expanding consumer access, the integration with Stellar opens doors for new liquidity channels and faster, more efficient capital flows for small and medium-sized businesses. Using Stellar’s real-time settlement features, businesses can access instant working capital in PYUSD to pay suppliers, manage inventory, or cover other expenses. This approach, known as Payment Financing or “ PayFi ,” could be especially helpful for businesses dealing with delayed payments or upfront costs. Liquidity providers on the Stellar network can also support these financing needs, potentially earning returns by funding real-world economic activity. PYUSD was launched initially on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain in August 2023. It was later made available on Solana ( SOL ) in late 2023, and then expanded to Cardano ( ADA ) earlier this year.

In another significant development, Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, recently waived fees for PYUSD transactions and introduced seamless 1:1 USD redemptions, improving access for merchants and institutional users.

Between March 2022 and June 2023, Rogan deceitfully convinced her clients to invest in what she described as a “high-yield fixed-interest account.” However, in reality, the funds were transferred to her personal and company-controlled bank accounts, converted to cryptocurrency, and funneled into wallets linked to a purported UK-based trading platform already blacklisted by the commission.

After five years on the market, this non-custodial platform has matured from a clever desktop client into a 360° crypto wallet ecosystem: buy, swap, stake, and store 1,000-plus assets in one interface—no KYC for core functions, no middlemen holding your keys. Below is an deep dive into the features that keep Atomic a contender in every “ best crypto wallet ” roundup, plus practical tips on how to withdraw from Atomic Wallet , use the built-in atomic charge wallet to fund purchases, and unleash passive income through atomic wallet staking . 1. True Self-Custody: Your Keys, Your Crypto Atomic’s architecture is simple but powerful. The 12-word backup phrase and every private key are generated locally and encrypted on-device. They never touch company servers. In practice that means: No custodian risk: even if Atomic’s website goes offline, your funds remain on-chain. No forced verification: you can hold, receive, and send without uploading an ID. No data harvest: the wallet doesn’t store personal details; you remain pseudonymous. If you keep that seed phrase offline in two secure spots, you own a bullet-proof gateway to any supported network—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Monero, even NFTs on multiple chains. 2. Buy, Exchange, Stake—All Under One Roof BUY – Through integrated partners (currently MoonPay, Simplex, and Guardarian) you can purchase BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, and dozens more with Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, or local bank rails in over 180 countries. The new “ atomic charge wallet ” flow pre-loads fiat so repeat buys happen in two taps. EXCHANGE – The atomic wallet swap engine links several DEX and instant-swap APIs. Roughly 60 pairs can be exchanged anonymously; each trade may return 0.3–1 % cashback paid in AW utility tokens. Spreads are competitive with major exchanges—minus the sign-up friction. STAKE – Yield hunters will appreciate the in-app staking dashboard: ETH (≈5 % APR), ADA (≈3 %), SOL (≈7 %), ATOM (≈16 %), HBAR, XTZ, and more. Every validator set is pre-audited; rewards land directly in your address with no extra fees—an underrated perk that puts Atomic among the best crypto wallet choices for passive income. 3. Seamless Asset Management on Any Device Whether you prefer desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) or mobile (iOS, Android, Huawei App Gallery), the UX stays consistent: clean portfolio charts, dark/light themes, biometric unlock, and instant balance sync across devices. Sorting by value, name, or gains makes it painless to track a long-tail portfolio. Need to deposit something obscure? Tap “Add Assets” and paste any valid address for ERC-20, BEP-20, TRC-20, or native layer-1 coins; Atomic auto-detects the network and tags it to your list. That flexibility—combined with 10 M+ global installs—cements Atomic’s role as a crypto wallet app for power users and beginners alike. 4. Security Posture & Withdrawal Process Critics will ask, “Great features, but how to withdraw from Atomic Wallet safely?” The answer: as easily as sending a normal blockchain transaction. Open the asset page (e.g., BTC). Paste the destination address. Set a fee or pick “fast”/“standard.” Confirm with your password or biometrics. Because keys stay local—and because Atomic connects directly to full-node servers—your withdrawal is signed client-side, broadcast instantly, and visible on-chain within seconds. No ticket, no approval queue. For extra peace of mind, you can export raw private keys or your 12-word seed into any hardware wallet later on. 5. Transparent Team & Roadmap Unlike many anonymous wallet projects, Atomic lists its leadership publicly: Konstantin Gladych, PhD – CEO and former co-founder of Changelly (the instant-exchange giant processing $0.5 B monthly). Charlie Shrem – Strategic adviser, Bitcoin Foundation co-founder, and early BTC evangelist. The roadmap for 2025 focuses on: Layer-2 support (Arbitrum, Base) for cheaper swaps. In-app DEX charting and limit orders. Multi-sig vaults for teams and small businesses. Such transparency is a hallmark of a best cryptocurrency wallet contender; users see exactly who steers the ship. 6. Independent Feedback On Trustpilot Atomic hovers around 4.5/5 across 25 k reviews; major praise targets the 24/7 live chat that actually responds in under 10 minutes. Forbes, CoinTelegraph, and PCMag have each run an atomic wallet review labeling it “a Swiss-army knife for mainstream crypto usage.” 7. Pros & Cons Snapshot Pros Cons ✓ Full non-custodial control ✕ No native hardware-wallet integration (planned) ✓ 1,000+ assets supported ✕ Buy fees depend on third-party provider ✓ Built-in staking up to 20 % APR ✕ Some swap pairs can have thin liquidity ✓ Anonymous swaps + cashback ✓ Available on every major OS/mobile store 8. Final Verdict: Why Atomic Still Ranks Top-Tier If your priority is a single interface to buy crypto with a debit card , swap cross-chain, stake for passive rewards, and manage exotic tokens—all while keeping custody—Atomic ticks every box. The wallet’s commitment to decentralization, its battle-tested security model, and a relentless roadmap give it a durable edge over many custodial “super apps.” Add a responsive support team and transparent leadership, and it is easy to see why Atomic remains a staple recommendation in any 2025 list of best cryptocurrency wallet solutions. For anyone seeking a future-proof, privacy-first, feature-rich gateway to digital assets, Atomic Wallet deserves a spot on your home screen—and maybe even on your hardware-backup card.",Information,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|ETH|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 09:47:10

According to a June 11 announcement from the Swedish firm, the raise consisted of two directed share issues totaling 69.65 million Swedish krona ($7.3 million) and a 31.35 million krona ($3.29 million) convertible loan tranche. Bitcoin plans draw broad participation The financing drew participation from key Bitcoin advocates and investment firms, including Blockstream CEO Adam Back, UTXO Management, and several Nordic investors such as Race Ventures Scandinavia and Crafoord Capital Partners. The convertible loan component, labeled Tranche 1, was increased from a previously announced 21 million krona. The loans are interest-free and will mature in five years, with shareholders having the option to convert them into equity at a price of 1.75 krona per share. Investors will also be required to convert their holdings if H100’s share price maintains a 33% premium above the conversion rate for 20 consecutive trading days. Net proceeds from the share issues and loan agreements will be used to purchase additional Bitcoin, with estimates suggesting H100 could acquire roughly 67.1 BTC at current market prices. This would bring the company’s total holdings to approximately 81.85 BTC, including the 13.95 BTC it has already acquired. H100’s Bitcoin treasury strategy H100 Group’s commitment to Bitcoin began on May 22 with a $490,000 purchase of 4.39 BTC, its first foray into crypto reserves and a landmark moment that made H100 the first listed Swedish firm to embrace Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Shortly after, on May 25, it raised an additional $2.2 million in a funding round led by Adam Back. The funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, allowed the company to purchase roughly 20.18 more Bitcoins. That tranche featured a conversion price of 1.3 krona per share and represented an estimated 12% dilution upon full conversion. H100 views its Bitcoin strategy as a means to strengthen its reserves without diverting from its core business in health and longevity technologies. According to CEO Sander Andersen, the “values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community align well with, and will appeal to, the customers and communities” that H100 plans to serve through its health and longevity-focused platform. Investor response has been noteworthy. Shares of H100 surged 39% after its initial Bitcoin acquisition and have since climbed 280%, closing at 4.64 krona on June 11. The company is listed on the Nordic Growth Market exchange. H100 joins a growing list of health and med-tech firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Some notable names include Semler Scientific , Basel Medical Group, and KindlyMD .

45857207,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=168301,1749721809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45857207.jpeg,Shaquille O’Neal Reaches Crucial $1.8M Settlement in FTX Lawsuit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/shaquille-oneal-ftx-settlement-2/,"BitcoinWorld Shaquille O’Neal Reaches Crucial $1.8M Settlement in FTX Lawsuit Big news has just dropped in the ongoing saga surrounding the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. Basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal , often referred to as Shaq, has reportedly reached a significant agreement to resolve claims against him related to his promotion of the platform. This development marks a notable moment in the FTX lawsuit landscape, particularly concerning the involvement of high-profile figures. The Details of the Shaquille O’Neal Crypto Settlement According to recent reports, Shaquille O’Neal has agreed to pay $1.8 million to settle the claims brought against him. These claims alleged that he promoted unregistered securities through his association with FTX. While the sum is substantial, it’s important to note the key terms of the agreement, which is still pending court approval: Settlement Amount: $1.8 million paid by Shaquille O’Neal. No Admission of Wrongdoing: A crucial point of the settlement is that O’Neal does not admit to any illegal activities or wrongdoing in connection with his promotion of FTX. No Reimbursement from FTX Estate: The agreement explicitly states that O’Neal will not seek reimbursement for this settlement amount from the bankrupt FTX estate. This means the payment comes directly from him. This crypto settlement brings one piece of the complex FTX legal puzzle closer to resolution, at least regarding one prominent individual associated with the exchange. Why Was Shaquille O’Neal Targeted in the FTX Lawsuit? Shaquille O’Neal was one of several celebrities who endorsed FTX before its dramatic collapse in November 2022. He appeared in commercials and promotional materials for the exchange, famously stating, “I’m all in. You guys know me. I’m a guy of the people. So, I’m always going to make sure you guys are right. And that’s why I’m involved with FTX.” The lawsuit against O’Neal and other celebrity endorsers alleged that they promoted FTX without disclosing the risks involved and, crucially, that they promoted what the plaintiffs deemed to be unregistered securities . The argument is that the services or products offered by FTX, particularly interest-bearing accounts, should have been registered with regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities, and that the celebrities facilitated their sale to the public without proper disclosure or registration. Other notable figures sued in similar class-action lawsuits included Stephen Curry, Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, and Larry David, many of whom have also reached settlements or had cases dismissed. Shaquille O’Neal had notably been difficult to serve with the lawsuit initially, leading to delays in his case compared to others. Crypto Settlement: What This Means for Celebrity Endorsement The FTX debacle and the subsequent lawsuits against its celebrity promoters have sent a clear message through the world of marketing and endorsements: associating with crypto assets carries significant risks, especially if proper due diligence and disclosures are not made. The Shaquille O’Neal settlement underscores this point. Key takeaways for celebrity endorsement in the crypto space: Increased Scrutiny: Regulatory bodies and the public are paying close attention to how crypto products are marketed, especially when celebrities are involved. Disclosure is Crucial: Endorsers must clearly disclose their relationship with the company and, in some jurisdictions, the risks associated with the investment. Failure to disclose can lead to legal action, as seen with other celebrities facing SEC charges for promoting crypto without disclosing compensation. Potential Liability: Celebrities can be held liable if the promoted product or service is found to be illegal or misleading, particularly if it involves unregistered securities. Due Diligence: Simply being paid to promote something is no longer enough. Endorsers are increasingly expected to perform some level of due diligence on the company and the product they are promoting. This settlement serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the potential legal and financial repercussions for those who lend their fame to the often volatile and complex cryptocurrency market without taking necessary precautions. Understanding the ‘Unregistered Securities’ Claims A central theme in many crypto lawsuits, including the one involving Shaquille O’Neal and FTX, is the allegation of promoting unregistered securities . But what does this actually mean? In the U.S., the Securities Act of 1933 requires that offers and sales of securities be registered with the SEC unless an exemption applies. The purpose is to protect investors by ensuring they receive essential information about the investment. The debate in crypto often centers on whether a particular crypto asset or service constitutes a ‘security’ under the law, typically assessed using the Howey Test. If something is deemed a security, promoting its sale to the public without registration (unless exempt) is illegal. In the context of FTX, the focus was often on products like their yield-bearing accounts, which promised returns on deposited crypto. Plaintiffs and regulators have argued that these types of products function like investments in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others – the hallmarks of a security. Promoting such products without them being registered could therefore be seen as promoting unregistered securities. Shaq’s settlement, while not an admission, resolves claims based on this legal theory, reinforcing the regulatory risks associated with promoting crypto services that might be classified as securities. Actionable Insights from the Shaquille O’Neal Case The Shaquille O’Neal crypto settlement offers valuable lessons for anyone involved in the crypto space, whether as an investor, influencer, or project founder. For Investors: Don’t Rely Solely on Celebrity Endorsements: Fame does not equal financial expertise or regulatory approval. Always do your own research (DYOR) before investing based on endorsements. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrency investments are highly volatile and can result in significant losses. Be skeptical of promises of guaranteed high returns, as these can sometimes be associated with products later deemed unregistered securities . For Influencers/Celebrities: Seek Legal Counsel: Before promoting any crypto product or service, consult with legal experts familiar with securities law and advertising regulations. Demand Transparency: Understand exactly what you are promoting and how it works. Ask about the company’s regulatory compliance. Disclose Everything: Clearly and conspicuously disclose your relationship with the company and the fact that you are being compensated for the promotion. For Crypto Projects: Navigate Regulations Carefully: Be mindful of how your products and services might be classified by regulators (e.g., as securities). Educate Endorsers: Ensure that anyone promoting your project understands the risks and their disclosure obligations. The era of simply getting a celebrity to shout out a crypto project without consequences appears to be over. Accountability is increasing. The Wider FTX Lawsuit Landscape Shaquille O’Neal’s settlement is just one piece of the massive legal fallout from the collapse of FTX. The FTX lawsuit landscape is vast and complex, involving: Criminal Charges: Against founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who has been convicted of fraud and money laundering. Bankruptcy Proceedings: The ongoing process of trying to recover and distribute assets to millions of FTX customers and creditors worldwide. Civil Lawsuits: Numerous class-action lawsuits filed by former FTX customers against the exchange, its executives, and third parties like the celebrity endorsers. Regulatory Actions: Investigations and charges brought by bodies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The legal battles are expected to continue for years, highlighting the significant impact the exchange’s failure had on the crypto industry and its participants. Conclusion Shaquille O’Neal’s reported $1.8 million crypto settlement in the FTX lawsuit over claims of promoting unregistered securities is a significant development. While it includes no admission of wrongdoing, it underscores the increasing legal risks faced by high-profile figures involved in celebrity endorsement of crypto platforms. The case serves as a stark reminder for both celebrities and the public about the importance of due diligence, transparency, and understanding regulatory classifications in the volatile world of digital assets. As the broader FTX lawsuit continues, this settlement highlights the potential for accountability when promotions go awry in the complex and rapidly evolving crypto market.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Solana's Soaring Journey: Is SOL the Future of Blockchain? Solana, launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, has become a leading blockchain platform known for its speed and efficiency. Using a unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism, Solana processes over 50,000 transactions per second with minimal fees, solving scalability issues of older blockchains. Since mid-2021, Solana's SOL token has surged impressively. By November 2024, it reached an all-time high of $263.83, showcasing over 600% growth from earlier levels. This meteoric rise has attracted investors seeking substantial returns. Solana's strengths include exceptional speed, scalability, and innovative features like parallel processing. Dubbed the ""Ethereum Killer,"" it offers low fees and high throughput. Despite challenges like network outages and competition, Solana continues to attract developers and users. In the current market cycle, Solana appears attractive. Experts believe increasing adoption and technological improvements will drive growth. Many analysts expect SOL's price to exceed previous highs by November 2025. Looking ahead, predictions vary. Some forecasts see SOL reaching over $500 by 2025, and possibly trading between $500 and $1,300 by 2030. While speculative, these predictions highlight Solana's potential in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP's Journey: Unlocking Ripple's Future Potential Ripple, known as XRP, is a network for fast, low-cost money transfers. It handles quick transactions for regular and digital currencies. With its coin XRP, Ripple aims to speed up global money movement. XRP uses a unique protocol and trusted nodes to secure fast transactions. Handling up to 1,500 transactions per second, it's scalable for high demand. Its technology attracts banks and financial institutions seeking efficient payments. XRP's price has swung widely. It hit $3.84 in January 2018 and faced declines afterward. Despite challenges like legal disputes, including a significant battle with the SEC, it has shown resilience. Recent price movements in 2024 and early 2025 suggest potential for growth. Experts have varied predictions for XRP's future. By 2030, some expect it to reach $6, others forecast up to $45 or even more. These views consider increased adoption, partnerships, and advances in its technology. With strong technology and growing partnerships, XRP seems promising in the current market. Its ability to process fast, low-cost transactions makes it attractive to many. However, market conditions and regulations can impact its performance. Investors should stay informed and consider XRP's potential for future growth. Cardano in 2025: Is ADA Poised for a Bullish Breakthrough? Cardano (ADA) is a decentralized network launched in 2017. It uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. Unlike energy-hungry networks, Cardano aims to enhance security and scalability without harming the environment. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano wants to become the home for decentralized apps. Its native token, ADA, is used as both a store of value and a means of exchange. Users can pay fees or stake ADA to help secure the network. Since its start, ADA has seen significant price moves. In September 2021, it hit an all-time high of $3.10. During the last bull market after the 2024 Bitcoin halving, ADA surged again, reflecting its strong market position. As of 2025, many think ADA is set for growth. Cardano keeps improving its network, attracting developers and users. With the crypto market hinting at another bull run, ADA's strong fundamentals make it an attractive option. Some experts predict ADA could reach prices between $4 and $10 in coming years. These forecasts suggest significant growth potential. Only time will tell how ADA's value evolves. TRON's Journey: From DApps to DeFi – Is TRX the Next Big Thing? TRON (TRX) is a public blockchain supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Compatible with Ethereum, developers can migrate projects easily. TRON offers a fast and efficient network for sharing digital content without intermediaries. Using a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, TRON has 27 super representatives adding blocks every three seconds. TRX holders vote for these representatives. Its architecture includes application, storage, and core layers, ensuring scalability and reliability for users and developers alike. In 2018, TRON gained attention by acquiring BitTorrent. Founder Justin Sun departed in 2021. Despite legal challenges, TRON continues to expand, hosting DApps that let creators bypass big tech companies. This empowers users to control their content and data directly. TRX reached $0.3004 in early 2018. On December 3, 2024, it surged to $0.4407 but settled around $0.241 by January 21, 2025. Investments like Trump's World Liberty Financial purchasing $4.66 million worth of TRX show growing interest and confidence in the platform. Future predictions for TRON are optimistic. By 2025, prices may range from $0.156 to $0.45, reaching up to $1.20 by 2030. With its expanding ecosystem and increasing adoption, TRX could be an attractive option in the current market cycle for investors looking toward long-term growth. Conclusion Established altcoins like SOL, XRP, ADA, and TRX have been influential in the crypto market, but their short-term growth potential may be limited compared to emerging projects. Investors seeking higher returns might find more dynamic opportunities by exploring innovative tokens that leverage advanced technologies. A notable development is the emergence of projects utilizing genuine artificial intelligence to enhance profitability. By offering intelligent market analysis and automated trading based on AI-driven signals, these ventures aim to help investors navigate the complex crypto space and achieve substantial gains. Engaging with such cutting-edge initiatives may present opportunities beyond what traditional altcoins currently offer.

While the market has seen its fair share of ups and downs, Neo Pepe is positioning itself as a game-changer. Using blockchain technology, good governance, and the hype in the crypto market, this token has what it takes to lead the meme coin market. But what is fueling this rise and what makes this token special compared to the original Pepe coin? In this article, we will be breaking it down for you, from the beginning of the Neo Pepe Tokens to why the Neo Pepe presale is attracting traders globally. By the end of the article, you will see why this token could change the meme coin industry while securing your chance to enter its presale. What Makes Neo Pepe Coin Different Governance Revolution Decentralized Through DAO When it comes to governing its community, Neo Pepe Tokens does something that has not been seen in the crypto sector. Unlike Pepe Coin which was successful due to its hype, Neo Pepe Coin presents investors with its Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This DAO offers investors the best of everything, allowing token holders to make decisions concerning developments on the platform through votes. This means the project is putting the power in the hands of its investors. Why does this matter? For investors familiar with the meme coin market, the lack of governance on platforms has often led to instability, which has caused most projects to collapse. Neo Pepe Protocol is changing that, creating a platform that is sustainable and can benefit its community. This enables the platform to increase scalability, and trust, and engage with its community better. Smart contract Enhancements While Pepe Coin is an exciting project (a cultural impact in the meme industry), it lacks the utility that Neo Pepe is bringing to the blockchain industry. The platform uses its smart contract features to enable secure transactions, automatic agreements, and staking opportunities. This is the same thing as mixing the entertainment aspect of meme coins with the technical ability of blockchain technology. Whether you’re choosing to stake your Neo Pepe Tokens for income or participating in the presale, smart contracts ensure you can rely on the platform when it comes to security. While Pepe Coin may have started the process, Neo Pepe Coin’s features will ensure that it wins the market. Why Neo Pepe’s Presale Has Game-Changing Potential In the crypto market, there are often presale opportunities that look to provide investors with the best opportunities to make profits. In the Neo Pepe Presale, which investors are calling one of the biggest in the present market, everybody is excited about it. Here are some reasons to consider the presale: Demand and Scarcity: Experts have predicted that Neo Pepe Coin’s limited supply will create demand during and after the presale. Community-Centered Features: Unlike previous meme coins that relied on influencers to market them, Neo Pepe is expected to grow organically through its community efforts. Early Investor Advantages: By entering this project during its presale, investors can purchase tokens for a fraction of their price in the future after the project launches. Investors are already predicting that this project could be the next big thing in the crypto market, and while we can’t travel to 2026 to confirm it, we have to follow the signs that point to the project being successful. Pepe Coin, Elder Meme King This development doesn’t mean Pepe Coin is ready to be relegated, as it just laid the foundation for meme coins to gain popularity through its branding, viral nature, and ability to attract internet users to support different projects. Pepe Coin has been around for a while, benefitting from the liquidity and awareness in the meme coin market. If you are a trader who follows trends, you would have discovered the wild price rises of the digital asset. The project has also been able to use its meme power to maintain relevance across different crypto spaces. However, OG Pepe Coin relies on its community and its technical development which is limited. It is here that Neo Pepe can gain the advantage of mixing the meme features with tools that improve real-world applications like smart contracts. Speculative Predictions for 2025 This is the perfect opportunity for traders to predict what might happen in the crypto market. And here is why most people are saying 2025 belongs to Neo Pepe: Massive Adoption Rates: With the best presale strategies and governance, adoption is expected to surpass expectations within its first year of launch. Strategic Partnerships: There are chances of partnerships in the future, with NFT and DeFi platforms expected to be interested in the project. Progressive Scalability: Because of its reliance on Polygon, the project has been predicted to do well in terms of scalability even if adoption rises. These predictions show that Neo Pepe Coin is not just another meme coin, it is about providing investors with utility, longevity, and a community they can be a part of. Wrapping It All Up Neo Pepe Coin shows that new meme coins are trying to stay relevant in the competitive crypto market. The platform has the features to achieve this using features such as its DAO governance, smart contracts, and presale. It is also creating its spot among the top projects in the crypto market and at the same time, showing respect to Pepe Coin, giving investors the choice between hype and impactful development.

We’re not heading into the era of digital finance, we’re already knee-deep in it. Up to $5 trillion in assets are expected to go digital this year. That’s not some distant projection. It’s now. Even so, that number is actually a bit shy of earlier predictions. So… what’s slowing things down? You might also like: Tokenization beyond finance: Real-world assets will be crypto’s next engine | Opinion The promise of tokenization is massive. But the reality? It’s complicated. You can’t exactly rip out the pipes while the water’s still flowing. Enterprises are eager to modernize, but not at the expense of compliance, control, or continuity. That’s where hybrid solutions shine. Think of them as innovation with a seatbelt: built for real-world systems, not crypto sandboxes. By blending control with creativity, they offer a risk-managed path to tokenization without demanding a full leap into decentralization from day one. Take SWIFT, the longtime backbone of global financial messaging. Its recent pilot with Chainlink didn’t require tearing up the rails. Instead, it layered in blockchain connectivity, plugging new capabilities into systems that already work. That’s the power of interoperability. It turns tokenization from disruption into evolution. What’s the holdup? Tokenization, or the transformation of physical or financial assets into digital tokens, promises to revolutionize how value is exchanged. Still, plenty of enterprises are tapping the brakes and asking, “Is now really the time to tokenize?” Some see the upside right away. But there’s a quiet tug-of-war behind the scenes. It might look something like this: Innovation says go. Compliance says slow. Risk wants certainty. IT sees another integration headache coming. Everyone loves innovation… until it shows up with a to-do list! For most leaders, the question isn’t whether tokenization makes sense—it’s whether they can pull it off seamlessly. One wrong move can stall progress and invite tough questions from the board or key stakeholders. This is where hybrid solutions come in. They allow institutions to start small, test quickly, and scale deliberately. Hybrid models meet enterprises where they are, integrating with current systems while unlocking the real-world value of tokenization. Real estate offers a clear case. Traditionally opaque and illiquid, it’s now being transformed through fractional ownership and expanded access. A $5 million fund could unlock up to $500 million in new capital by lowering entry barriers and reducing operational friction. Instead of months of paperwork and high price thresholds, tokenization enables faster, broader participation. Think of it like crowdfunding, but for billion-dollar assets. A hybrid approach makes this even more practical, connecting tokenized assets to existing financial infrastructure. It not only reduces friction, it levels the playing field. So the question isn’t just “Should we tokenize?” It’s “How can we do it in a way that’s smart, safe, and scalable?” So…how should we tokenize? For enterprises in highly regulated industries, compliance and privacy are foundational. Jumping straight into full decentralization can feel risky, even if it’s not. It brings speed and innovation, yes, but also complexity in governance and control. Hybrid models shift the mindset from all-or-nothing to progressive and purposeful. By combining the control of private systems with the transparency of public networks, they allow institutions to test new capabilities while safeguarding core operations. The thing is…breakthroughs don’t have to break things. Innovation can thrive at the edge. A private equity platform can issue public-facing tokens while keeping investor data secure. A real estate firm can record ownership on-chain while conducting due diligence off-chain. And it’s already happening. Archax , the UK’s first FCA-regulated digital asset exchange, uses DLT to tokenize securities. It preserves compliance workflows privately while anchoring transaction data to public ledgers for trust and auditability. Diamond Standard applies a similar model to physical diamonds: custody and authentication are managed off-chain, while proof of ownership lives on-chain. This layered approach satisfies regulators, empowers stakeholders, and maintains operational control. That’s why nearly 90% of global enterprises are already exploring blockchain in some capacity, many through hybrid architectures. No one wakes up thinking, “Let’s disrupt compliance today.” But with hybrid models, you don’t have to. They are built to handle KYC, AML, and data privacy from day one, giving enterprises the freedom to push boundaries without crossing the line. Setting the pace for a tokenized world Hybrid models aren’t a compromise. They’re the new blueprint. It’s not just about choosing a platform. It’s about aligning with your goals, risk appetite, and regulatory needs. The real advantage? Start with private systems, scale into public networks as confidence grows. That’s how many enterprises are testing the waters today, and it’s working. Not all hybrid models are created equal. The leaders won’t be the loudest or the fastest. They will be the ones who build with purpose. And let’s be clear: this isn’t a compromise. It’s a competitive advantage. The only question is: will you be left behind?

The timing, just after a shaky U.S.-China trade deal, has raised fresh concerns about a new round of global trade tensions. Markets are already feeling the pressure and crypto is no exception. Global Sell-Off Begins as Tariff Clock Ticks Trump’s tariff plans have sparked a pullback across global markets. European and U.S. equity futures have dropped as investors brace for what could be another hit to international trade. The dollar has weakened, gold prices have surged, and Treasury yields are falling – all signs that investors are moving to safer assets. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes is sounding the alarm. Taking to X, he warned, “Don’t get shook,” as he predicted rising volatility across crypto markets in the days ahead. Don’t get shook. pic.twitter.com/GJbdZb73X4 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 12, 2025 Bitcoin Drops Below $110K, Altcoins Follow Bitcoin started the week strong, riding the wave of global liquidity. But the rally didn’t last. After being rejected at the $110,000 resistance level, BTC is now down 1.66%, trading near $107,750. Altcoins are in the red too. Dogecoin is seeing the steepest drop among the top ten, down 7% in just 24 hours. Even a lower-than-expected U.S. CPI reading wasn’t enough to boost market sentiment. Traders are growing increasingly cautious as macro uncertainty piles up. More Trade Moves Coming At the same time, the Trump administration is also pushing for bilateral trade deals with major economies like India, South Korea, and Japan. The goal is to strengthen America’s economic position but these moves could also raise tensions in global trade even further. Hayes: Volatility Is Just Getting Started Arthur Hayes has repeatedly called for the Fed to switch from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE). But with inflation still a concern and interest rate cuts now unlikely, that shift seems far off. With Trump’s tariff strategy shaking up traditional markets, crypto is entering another phase of heightened volatility. Hayes’ warning comes at a critical time for traders trying to navigate this evolving landscape. The Bottom Line Trump’s new tariff plan is already sending shockwaves across global markets. From equities to the dolla, and now crypto, volatility is back in a big way.

Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.00008879 Market Cap $785.02M Trading Volume $111.68M Circulating Supply 9.62T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.00009823 24-hour Low $0.00008817 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 10.39% 50-Day SMA $0.00009209 14-Day RSI 50.70 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.000103 Floki Inu price analysis: FLOKI falls to the bear, recovery soon? Key Insights: Floki’s price is down 6% today. The MACD is neutral-bullish. Short-term momentum suggests sellers are in control of the market. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: FLOKI is testing support at $0.00008860 The FLOKI/USDT price analysis for June 12 shows a recent bearish movement, with the price breaking below the middle Bollinger Band but remaining well above the lower band. This suggests that while the price has lost some momentum, it isn’t in an oversold condition yet. The price is testing the support level around $0.00008860, which could act as a key level to hold. Immediate resistance also lies at $0.00009161. Floki Inu is testing support at $0.00008860 Looking at the MACD, the histogram shows a slight uptick, which implies that the momentum is neutral to slightly bullish. However, the upside momentum isn’t strong enough to indicate a clear breakout. A break below support could lead to a decline toward the next support at $0.00008564, which may be a key level for bulls to defend. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Floki Inu is bearish in the short-term On the 4-hour chart, the price shows a downtrend, with candles indicating signs of exhaustion as they approach key moving average support levels. The Alligator indicator’s lines are narrowing, signaling that the market could be entering a period of consolidation or even a potential reversal. The price is currently below the green line (fast-moving average), confirming a short-term bearish sentiment. FLOKI is bearish in the short-term The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) value of 0.13 suggests some buying pressure in the market. However, the pressure isn’t strong enough to indicate a clear upward movement. Additionally, the Balance of Power indicator shows a negative value of -0.10, indicating that selling pressure is slightly stronger than buying pressure in the short term. If the price stays above the $0.00008858 resistance level, there could be a potential rebound or consolidation. However, if FLOKI continues to decline, it might test lower support levels at $0.00008564.

A rebound is possible if buying pressure increases, but a further decline toward $0.00008564 is also possible if the support breaks. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows, and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

A recent statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent, as reported by Odaily News, highlights this convergence, forecasting a potentially massive Stablecoin Demand for US Treasury Bonds that could reach $2 trillion or more. This outlook underscores the growing importance of stablecoins within the broader financial ecosystem and their potential impact on the US Dollar Status . Why is There Such High Stablecoin Demand for US Treasury Bonds? To understand this forecast, we first need to look at what stablecoins are and how they operate. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility, typically by being pegged to a ‘stable’ asset or basket of assets. The most common stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, aiming to maintain a value of $1 per coin. How do stablecoin issuers maintain this peg? Primarily through reserves. Issuers hold reserves of traditional assets that match or exceed the value of the stablecoins in circulation. These reserves often include: Cash (USD) Cash equivalents (like money market funds) Commercial paper And crucially, US Treasury Bonds , particularly short-term Treasury bills. Holding safe, liquid assets like Treasury bonds in reserves is a key method for stablecoin issuers to ensure they can meet redemption requests and maintain their dollar peg. As the stablecoin market grows, the demand for these underlying reserve assets, including Treasury bonds, grows with it. Understanding the Scale: What Does $2 Trillion in Demand Mean? The forecast of $2 trillion or more in Stablecoin Demand for US Treasury bonds is a staggering figure. To put this into perspective: The total market capitalization of stablecoins is currently in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Leading stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) already hold significant amounts of Treasuries in their reserves. A $2 trillion demand would represent a substantial portion of the outstanding US Treasury market, particularly in short-term instruments favored by stablecoin reserves. This level of demand would significantly increase stablecoins’ footprint within traditional financial markets, cementing their role beyond just the Crypto Market . This forecast suggests a future where stablecoins are not just a niche part of the digital asset space but become major players in the market for US government debt. How Does This Bolster US Dollar Status? U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent also reaffirmed the Trump administration’s commitment to preserving the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. The projected Stablecoin Demand for US Treasury Bonds directly supports this goal. Here’s why: Increased Demand for USD-Denominated Assets: Stablecoins pegged to the USD create persistent, global demand for assets denominated in US dollars, specifically Treasuries. This reinforces the dollar’s role as the primary unit of account and store of value in the digital economy. Deepening Market Liquidity: Stablecoin reserves holding Treasuries contribute to the liquidity and depth of the US government bond market. Global Reach: Stablecoins are used globally for trading, remittances, and payments. By backing these digital dollars with US debt, the global usage of stablecoins effectively translates into increased international reliance on US financial infrastructure and assets. In essence, stablecoins act as a digital extension of the US dollar, and their reliance on Treasury bonds for stability ties the growing world of Digital Assets directly to the strength and stability of the US financial system and the US Dollar Status . What Are the Benefits of Growing Stablecoin Demand for Treasuries? The convergence of stablecoins and the Treasury market offers several potential benefits: Support for US Debt Financing: Increased demand from a new, large buyer base helps the US Treasury finance government spending and manage its debt. Potential for Lower Borrowing Costs: Higher demand for Treasuries can help keep interest rates (and thus borrowing costs for the government) lower than they might otherwise be. Integration of Crypto and Traditional Finance: This trend represents a significant bridge between the often-separate worlds of the Crypto Market and traditional finance, potentially leading to greater understanding and adoption on both sides. Innovation in Financial Infrastructure: As stablecoins become larger holders of Treasuries, it could spur innovation in how bonds are issued, traded, and settled using blockchain technology, impacting the broader landscape of Digital Assets . Reinforcing Dollar Hegemony: As discussed, it solidifies the dollar’s position in the burgeoning digital economy. Are There Risks to This Growing Stablecoin-Treasury Relationship? While the forecast highlights potential benefits, the significant growth of stablecoin reserves in Treasuries also introduces challenges and considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of comprehensive, clear regulation for stablecoin issuers remains a significant risk. How stablecoins are regulated will directly impact their reserve requirements and their ability to hold Treasuries. Systemic Risk: If a major stablecoin issuer were to face a crisis (e.g., a ‘run’ on the stablecoin), a rapid liquidation of their Treasury holdings could potentially cause disruption or volatility in certain segments of the bond market. Concentration Risk: A large portion of the stablecoin market is concentrated among a few issuers. Their combined holdings of Treasuries could become significant enough that their actions have broader market implications. Transparency and Auditing: Ensuring the transparency and regular auditing of stablecoin reserves is crucial to maintaining confidence in the peg and understanding the true exposure to US Treasury Bonds . Geopolitical Factors: The reliance of global stablecoin users on USD-backed assets also has geopolitical dimensions, potentially raising concerns in countries seeking alternatives to the dollar. Addressing these challenges through thoughtful regulation and robust oversight will be critical as Stablecoin Demand for Treasuries continues to grow. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market and Digital Assets? The Treasury Secretary’s outlook is a strong signal regarding the increasing legitimacy and integration of Digital Assets into the mainstream financial system. It indicates that policymakers and traditional financial institutions are taking stablecoins seriously, not just as a crypto curiosity, but as a significant source of demand in major markets like government debt. This recognition could pave the way for further institutional adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets. It highlights the critical link between regulatory clarity and market growth in the Crypto Market . It underscores the potential for blockchain technology to impact even the most traditional financial markets. For participants in the Crypto Market , understanding this dynamic between stablecoins, Treasuries, and the US Dollar Status is key to navigating the evolving landscape. Actionable Insights for Readers Given the potential for $2 trillion in Stablecoin Demand for US Treasury Bonds , here are some key takeaways: Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on proposed stablecoin legislation in the US and globally. Regulation will shape the future of stablecoin reserves and their impact on traditional markets. Understand the Interconnectedness: Recognize that the Crypto Market is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance. Developments in one can significantly impact the other. Evaluate Stablecoin Reserve Structures: If using or holding stablecoins, understand how their reserves are managed and what assets back them. Transparency is key. Consider the Macro Impact: The role of stablecoins in the Treasury market is a macro-financial trend with implications for interest rates, debt management, and the global US Dollar Status . The forecast is a powerful reminder that Digital Assets are no longer on the fringes but are becoming central to discussions about the future of finance and global currency dynamics. Conclusion The projection by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent of $2 trillion or more in Stablecoin Demand for US Treasury Bonds marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of digital assets and traditional finance. This immense potential demand highlights the growing scale and influence of stablecoins, reinforcing the strategic importance of their reserve holdings. This trend not only presents significant benefits for the US government in financing its debt and potentially lowering borrowing costs but also fundamentally strengthens the global standing and US Dollar Status in the digital age. While challenges related to regulation and systemic risk must be carefully managed, the forecast underscores a future where the Crypto Market and traditional financial systems are more deeply integrated than ever before, driven in part by the humble stablecoin.

Priced at just $0.03 and already boasting more than 11,900 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most-watched digital assets under $0.035. With robust technology, early traction, and multiple revenue-generating systems already in place, this DeFi project is earning strong traction before even hitting major exchange listings. A Lending Model That Changes Everything Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol with a dual lending structure that’s catching serious attention. The platform offers both peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) lending systems, giving it an edge in flexibility and market coverage. In the P2C model, users interact with a liquidity pool, depositing assets to earn interest or borrowing with overcollateralization. It’s simple, efficient, and well-suited for blue-chip cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. However, what truly elevates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its P2P model. Here, users will be able to directly lend or borrow specific tokens — including those not typically supported on pooled platforms — such as memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Dogecoin (DOGE). This opens a niche but high-demand lending market that most platforms completely ignore. To earn trust, especially in the current market, projects must meet strict security standards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a rigorous security audit with CertiK — one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. The audit included both static analysis and manual code reviews and resulted in a solid token scan score of 80. The review process started in February 2025 and was finalized with revisions in May 2025. According to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap, the team will launch the beta version of the platform around the time the token goes live on exchanges. This means that unlike many DeFi projects, users won’t be asked to buy into a vision with nothing built. They will interact with a real, functioning protocol from day one — and that’s expected to accelerate adoption exponentially. MUTM Token Utility Creates Ongoing Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend digital assets and earn interest based on market demand. Users deposit cryptocurrency into liquidity pools, which borrowers can access by providing overcollateralized loans—meaning the collateral is worth more than the loan amount, reducing default risk. Interest rates for lenders adjust automatically depending on pool utilization: when borrowing activity rises, rates increase, attracting more deposits; when borrowing slows, rates decrease, balancing supply and demand naturally. When users deposit assets into a liquidity pool, they receive mtTokens representing their deposit on a 1:1 basis plus accrued interest. For example, depositing DAI returns mtDAI tokens that increase in value as interest accumulates. These mtTokens are liquid and transferable, allowing users to sell them or use them as collateral within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol. The native MUTM token supports the ecosystem by linking protocol performance to token demand. A portion of the protocol’s profits will be allocated to buying MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to users staking their mtTokens in the safety module. This process distributes passive income to stakers and creates buy-side pressure on the token. Additionally, some protocol earnings will be used to expand liquidity pools and support marketing efforts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs straightforward, transparent mechanisms designed to allow users to earn interest and borrow assets in a decentralized environment. The protocol emphasizes on-chain transparency, non-custodial control, and revenue-based rewards for participation. Stablecoin Innovation Adds Long-Term Depth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing to launch a decentralized stablecoin that will be fully overcollateralized and algorithmically managed. Unlike centralized stablecoins that depend on fiat reserves or opaque treasury holdings, this stable asset will be backed by crypto assets already within the protocol itself. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just a lending protocol — it’s being built for scale. Layer-2 integration will enable faster and cheaper transactions, addressing common complaints users have about traditional DeFi platforms like high gas fees and congestion. By improving user experience from day one, the team is setting the stage for real-world usage beyond DeFi natives — a necessary move for long-term dominance. To fuel early interest and reward its growing base, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign. This initiative is designed to onboard thousands of new users, boost community engagement, and increase token exposure in anticipation of the listing and beta launch. It’s a strategic move that brings visibility while ensuring that early supporters are recognized and rewarded. Why Traders Are Jumping In Now With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, a current price of just $0.03, and over $10.3 million already raised in its ongoing presale phase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the DeFi space. Over 11,900 holders have already taken a position, signaling that this token is not being ignored. As the market continues to recover, and as more DeFi users seek projects with real earnings, actual products, and provable security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a token that checks every box. This is the moment that early traders will look back on — the time when the price was low, the fundamentals were strong, and the signs were all pointing in one direction. The smart money is watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now — and those who act first will benefit most.

Unlike traditional reserves dominated by gold and fiat, this new framework integrates select cryptocurrencies, with XRP explicitly named as one of the assets being added. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a crypto enthusiast on X, shared an image highlighting XRP’s role in the reserve and its underlying strengths. He described the asset as “fast, compliant, scalable,” reinforcing why it stood out among the choices available. The decision elevated XRP’s profile from a promising cross-border payments solution to a nationally endorsed digital instrument. Trump’s administration is signaling not only acceptance but full-scale integration of blockchain-based assets into the nation’s financial infrastructure. His inclusion of XRP reflects both its technological maturity and growing institutional credibility . They built gold reserves for a reason. Now they’re talking digital reserves $XRP is being positioned as a candidate and it’s no accident Fast. Compliant. Scalable If #XRP gets tapped for a U.S. reserve, you’ll want to be holding before that headline hits Still waiting? pic.twitter.com/Ra1CoDFu6q — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 11, 2025 XRP’s Inclusion in Trump’s Reserve XRP is well-known for its efficient transaction capabilities, proven enterprise integration via RippleNet, and growing compliance with U.S. regulatory frameworks. The asset’s utility in reducing costs and settlement times in international payments has made it a serious contender for systemic adoption. XRP is also the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency, making it a top pick for Trump, who is known for his America-first stance. Its performance record across both private and institutional environments provided the foundation for its selection. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While the U.S. government has yet to accumulate XRP, a recent filing by VivoPower to the SEC listed the asset as one of five that the government plans to add to its stockpile. Market Reaction and Anticipated Policy Shifts The market has responded swiftly. Investors are no longer reacting to speculation but to an official policy directive. As X Finance Bull noted, “If XRP gets tapped for a U.S. reserve, you’ll want to be holding before that headline hits.” That narrative has shifted from anticipation to strategic positioning, as the government could accumulate these tokens at any time, raising XRP’s profile and potentially causing a major price surge. Adding to this momentum is growing speculation that the Trump administration may move to exempt U.S.-based cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes . While no formal policy has been enacted yet, the potential for such a tax incentive is contributing to heightened interest in XRP and other domestic tokens. The possibility of tax-free crypto transactions could trigger a wave of institutional and retail investment. With its legitimacy now anchored by the U.S. government, XRP is expected to gain wider adoption and further price stability.

Following these developments, the global crypto market cap climbed to $3.59 trillion on June 11, with daily trading volume hitting $135.14 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly pushed past $110,000, Ethereum ( ETH ) reclaimed $2,800, and XRP ( XRP ) held steady around $2.30. Although the top three tokens saw modest pullbacks today, Bitcoin’s momentum has rippled across the broader market, driving renewed interest in altcoins, with memecoins leading the charge over the past week. Here are some of the best-performing memecoins this week worth keeping an eye on. Fartcoin Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a Solana-based memecoin born out of Elon Musk’s love for farts, has surged 47.8% over the last 7 days, bringing its market cap to over $1.3 billion. It’s expected to stay in the spotlight this week with a Coinbase listing set for June 12 at 9 AM PT. Ahead of the spot listing, Coinbase will also launch Fartcoin perpetual futures on its Advanced and International platforms. On the daily chart, Fartcoin has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a formation often associated with bullish reversals. It is currently trading above its 50-day moving average, while the MACD has flashed a bullish crossover, which is often a precursor for an extended rally. FARTCOIN 50-day SMA and MACD chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news If this trend holds, the next target could be a retest of the $1.64 level. You might also like: Ethereum holds $2.7K as ETF inflows surge and ETH options flip sharply bullish SPX6900 SPX6900 ( SPX ), a memecoin with a tongue-in-cheek mission to flip traditional markets, has rallied for five consecutive days, hitting an all-time high of $1.73 on June 11. Its market capitalization has climbed from $275 million in March to nearly $1.6 billion at press time. The token is drawing attention this week for two key reasons. First, it has continued to gain despite its official X account being suspended, a development that would typically hurt sentiment. Instead, the sustained rally has highlighted the strength and engagement of its community, which could attract further interest. Second, whale activity has picked up. Large holders now control over 106 million SPX tokens, up from 105 million in mid-May. At the same time, the amount of SPX on exchanges has dropped noticeably, which is usually a sign that investors are holding, not selling, fueling even more hype and FOMO. From a technical perspective, the SPX6900 is forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart, a setup that often signals further upside. SPX price, CMF and Aroon chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news The price looks poised to touch the upper boundary around $1.742. Once it hits the target, if it pulls back slightly to form the “handle” and holds support, it could set the stage for the next leg up. Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow is positive, indicating buying pressure, while the Aroon Up is at 92.86%, suggesting that a strong uptrend remains in effect. Hence, if bulls stay in control, the SPX could continue to push higher after a brief consolidation. aura aura (AURA) has surged by more than 9,700% in the past week, climbing from around $0.00090 to $0.090, with its market cap jumping from just $1 million to nearly $83 million. The memecoin had seen little to no activity for months, but suddenly spiked on June 10 following a wave of buying pressure. On-chain data suggests that a single whale accumulation , rumoured to be linked to the SPX community, played a key role in triggering the rally. More than $500,000 worth of AURA was reportedly deployed across decentralised exchanges within a few hours, causing a price cascade as retail traders rushed in. Over 215 wallets interacted with the token during the peak surge, driving daily volume up by over 100,000%. On the daily chart, the MACD lines and Relative Strength Index have moved well above overbought levels, indicating a potential pullback could be on the horizon. AURA price, RSI and MACD chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news Despite this, if momentum continues and visibility grows across trading forums and social media, AURA could see further upside in the near term, especially given its low float and speculative appeal. However, the lack of fundamentals, project updates, or clear utility means the rally is driven largely by sentiment and volatility. As with most parabolic runs, profit-taking by early holders could trigger equally steep pullbacks, making AURA a high-risk, high-reward trade at current levels.

This decision highlights a notable shift in how companies are viewing and utilizing cryptocurrencies as part of their core financial planning. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy ? F Street’s announcement to purchase $10 million worth of Bitcoin for its treasury reserves isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a larger, evolving trend where businesses are exploring alternatives to traditional cash reserves and low-yield assets. But what drives this interest? Inflation Hedge: Many companies see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in the current macroeconomic climate where fiat currencies may be losing purchasing power. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s limited supply (capped at 21 million coins) and decentralized nature are often cited as reasons it could serve as a reliable store of value over the long term. Potential Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant growth potential, offering the possibility of increasing the value of treasury assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional assets. Future-Proofing: Aligning with digital asset trends can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative. This strategic shift by firms like F Street signals increasing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond speculative trading into serious financial planning. Exploring F Street’s Specific Bitcoin Investment Plan According to reports, including one from Bitcoin Magazine on X, F Street intends to acquire $10 million in Bitcoin. What’s particularly interesting about their approach is the methodology: Instead of a single large purchase, F Street plans to make daily buys. This dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy aims to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s price volatility. By spreading purchases over time, they can potentially achieve a lower average cost per Bitcoin compared to a lump-sum purchase that might coincide with a price peak. The funds for these purchases will come directly from the firm’s business proceeds, indicating a deliberate allocation of operational capital towards building their digital asset reserves. This isn’t just passive investment; it’s an active decision to integrate Bitcoin into their financial framework. Is This Part of a Broader Institutional Bitcoin Trend? Absolutely. F Street is joining a growing list of publicly traded and private companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have been particularly vocal and aggressive in their Bitcoin investment strategy, accumulating substantial amounts over time. Other notable examples include Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and various investment funds. The increasing participation of investment firms like F Street in the institutional Bitcoin space is significant. It suggests that professional money managers and financial strategists are becoming more comfortable with the asset, developing frameworks for its custody, accounting, and risk management. This trend lends further credibility to Bitcoin and can pave the way for even larger players to consider similar moves in the future. Each new corporate adoption, regardless of size, adds another data point to the viability of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. What Does the F Street Bitcoin Decision Mean for the Market? While a $10 million purchase might seem modest compared to the multi-billion dollar acquisitions by some giants, F Street’s move is still impactful: Validation: It provides further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class suitable for corporate treasuries. Demand: Consistent daily buying, even in smaller amounts, contributes to sustained demand in the market. Sentiment: Positive news of corporate adoption can boost overall market sentiment and encourage other firms to explore the option. Precedent: For other investment firms or businesses of similar size, F Street’s strategy could serve as a template or inspiration. The decision by F Street to allocate a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin reflects a calculated approach to navigating the current economic landscape and positioning the firm for potential future growth in the digital asset space. Their use of daily buys is a practical example of managing the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets when building a long-term position. Considering a Bitcoin Treasury for Your Business? Key Insights F Street’s strategy offers valuable insights for any business contemplating a similar move: Start Small: You don’t need to allocate a massive percentage of your reserves initially. A smaller allocation allows you to get comfortable with the process and volatility. Have a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives (e.g., inflation hedge, long-term growth) and your purchasing methodology (e.g., lump sum, DCA). Address Custody and Security: Securely storing Bitcoin is paramount. Explore reputable custodians or robust self-custody solutions. Understand the Accounting and Tax Implications: Bitcoin holdings have specific accounting treatments and tax obligations that need to be addressed. Be Prepared for Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. Ensure your business can tolerate potential short-term drawdowns. The F Street Bitcoin purchase is more than just a headline; it’s a case study in how businesses are actively adapting to the evolving financial landscape and incorporating digital assets into their long-term financial health. Conclusion F Street’s plan to acquire $10 million in Bitcoin for its treasury reserves through daily buys is a clear signal of increasing confidence in cryptocurrency among institutional players. This move aligns with a broader trend of companies exploring corporate Bitcoin strategy as a means to diversify reserves, hedge against inflation, and potentially capture long-term growth. As more firms make the leap into institutional Bitcoin , it further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a significant asset in the global financial system. The decision by F Street Bitcoin is another step in the ongoing integration of digital assets into traditional finance, demonstrating a practical approach to building a Bitcoin treasury in the modern era.

According to the recent Gemini and Glassnode’s Report , over 30% of Bitcoin ( BTC ) circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities across six categories: centralized exchanges, ETFs and funds, public companies, private companies, DeFi protocols, and governments. This consolidation of Bitcoin into institutional hands coincides with its rapid price appreciation—from under $1,000 in 2015 to over $100,000 today, suggesting that major institutions now view Bitcoin as a strategic, long-term asset. Across nearly all categories, with the exception of private companies, the top three entities hold between 65% to 90% of the total assets, reflecting the outsized role of early movers, especially in the DeFi, public company, and ETF categories, in shaping the early trajectory of institutional Bitcoin adoption.

However, the majority of that BTC has shifted to ETFs and funds, especially U.S. spot ETFs. Since June 2021, the total BTC held by this spot trading sector has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 3.9 million and 4.2 million BTC. This stability indicates that the decrease in exchange balances reflects a structural redistribution of custody rather than a reduction in overall supply. The increasing share held by ETFs signals greater adoption by TradFi , yet the total liquidity available to spot buyers has stayed largely consistent.

The report also highlighted that the creation of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has significantly boosted institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a sovereign-grade asset. Following the SBR announcement, public and private companies have significantly increased their Bitcoin purchases. The report concludes that with over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply held by centralized entities, the market has undergone a structural shift catalyzed by long-term investments and strategic custody. While early adopters continue to dominate holdings, Bitcoin’s acceptance as a sovereign-grade asset—marked by the SBR—has boosted institutional confidence. Even as custody moves from exchanges to ETFs and other custodians, the overall supply available for spot trading has remained stable.

While one of the most important of these, the US giant GameStop, made its second Bitcoin purchase, another company started preparations to buy BTC. Mercurity Fintech (Nasdaq: MFH), a Nasdaq-listed digital fintech group, has announced plans to raise $800 million to create a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. Accordingly, the company stated that it will collect $800 million for the Bitcoin treasury reserve. Aside from purchasing Bitcoin, the funds raised will also be used to integrate blockchain-focused custody services, staking, and tokenized treasury management into the company’s digital reserve framework. The company also said that FTSE Russell is expected to be included in the broad market Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes under its 2025 annual restructuring preliminary list. The company’s CEO, Shi Qiu, said the following about the Bitcoin move: “We are creating this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will be a fundamental component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem. Our company is also set to move from Russell Microcap to Russell 2000, demonstrating that investors recognize the value we create in blockchain finance.

Qubetics, the emerging titan, is being whispered about in nearly every corner of the crypto ecosystem. Analysts argue that the most popular cryptocurrency right now isn’t one with years behind it—it’s the one just stepping onto the stage. While some raced to catch the tail end of older projects, thousands are eyeing Qubetics as the project redefining smart contract usability, wallet technology, and decentralized control. As the most popular cryptocurrency discussions swirl around volatile tokens and short-term gains, Qubetics has entered the frame as the strategic alternative few anticipated. Surging ahead with a non-custodial multi-chain wallet and practical utility across sectors, Qubetics is solving real problems where others have stalled. While many contenders in the race for the most popular cryptocurrency title focused on hype, Qubetics is quietly building infrastructure poised for mass adoption. A multi-sector use case strategy, strong community involvement, and a reinforced tokenomics revamp position $TICS as more than a trend—it’s a long-term contender. Arbitrum: The Overlooked Powerhouse of 2025 For many, Arbitrum served as the benchmark Layer 2 scaling solution that briefly took center stage. It offered transaction efficiency that Ethereum lacked and promised innovation without abandoning foundational decentralization. During its ascent, Arbitrum gained recognition as one of the most popular cryptocurrency contenders, backed by multiple DeFi protocols and ecosystem partners. The buzz around its airdrops and early user incentives made headlines, triggering surges in user numbers. However, for those who didn’t enter early, the opportunity quickly grew distant. As its initial wave subsided and newer projects gained steam, Arbitrum’s narrative began to blend into the larger pool of past market movers. With token volatility and shifting narratives in the Layer 2 arena, the question now shifts to where real value still resides. As such, the focus has increasingly turned toward protocols like Qubetics—those that offer practical use cases without needing speculative frenzies to gain traction. Qubetics ($TICS): The Final Countdown Has Already Begun The Qubetics multi-chain wallet is designed to simplify asset management across multiple blockchains, giving users seamless control over their digital holdings. Supporting a wide range of networks, it eliminates the need for multiple wallets or complicated swaps. Buyers can store, transfer, and monitor various tokens from a single interface, while enjoying top-tier security and decentralised custody. The wallet’s cross-chain compatibility positions Qubetics as a key player in the growing Web3 market, offering both convenience and flexibility as more users diversify their portfolios across multiple ecosystems. Qubetics is in its 37th crypto presale stage. With a fixed token price of $0.3370 and just 10 million $TICS remaining before the price increases to $0.40, urgency is building. Over 515 million tokens have already been acquired by more than 27,800 holders, bringing the total raised to a striking $17.9 million. This phase is the final opportunity to acquire $TICS at below-market value. If $TICS hits $5 in the next bullish cycle — a level some analysts are already eyeing — a $5,000 investment today could turn into $75,000. If it reaches $10, that initial stake could skyrocket to $150,000. Following a strategic tokenomics overhaul, Qubetics has slashed its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens—immediately introducing scarcity. In parallel, the public sale allocation has been increased to 38.55%, making it a rare project prioritizing community distribution. Qubetics isn’t just another DeFi token. It introduces a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that bridges fragmented ecosystems, allowing seamless access across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and more. Here are real-world scenarios where the Qubetics ecosystem transforms user experience: For Businesses : Cross-border companies can manage payroll, vendor payments, and tax settlements across different blockchains without intermediaries or custodial delays. For Freelancers and Creators : Individuals working on global platforms can receive payments in crypto directly to their Qubetics wallet and swap tokens instantly, avoiding exchange fees and delays. For Retail Users : A commuter in New York or a student in Mumbai can store, swap, and stake assets with a single mobile interface while retaining full control over their keys. For Crypto Projects : Developers can plug into Qubetics’ SDK and provide wallet integrations with community governance modules pre-built. With this unique offering and a decentralized governance structure embedded from launch, Qubetics is seen not merely as a product but as a platform. Analysts now project post-mainnet listing valuations ranging from $10 to $15 per token within the first market cycle. From an ROI perspective, Stage 37 participants stand to gain nearly 20% immediately upon listing, with 30x potential once the price hits mid-tier analyst expectations. Given that this is the last chance before the listing event, time remains the only constraint. Final Thoughts Missing out on Arbitrum in its prime taught a painful lesson: innovation doesn’t wait for latecomers. In a digital economy governed by momentum, every cycle leaves behind stories of what could have been. The current momentum surrounding Qubetics offers a second chance—an opportunity that aligns with both technological progress and economic logic. Positioned as the most popular cryptocurrency in real terms—not hype—Qubetics stands as the logical successor to fill the void left by missed opportunities. While others debate past mistakes, Qubetics is making headlines for all the right reasons. For those monitoring the most popular cryptocurrency trends with long-term value in mind, this isn’t just a token—it’s the blueprint for sustainable Web3 engagement.

To deal with the potential losses, the investment bank is planning to put aside hundreds of millions of dollars more than it did in the previous quarter, Bloomberg reports . While speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference this week, Vis Raghavan, Citigroup’s head of banking, reportedly cautioned that the firm’s credit reserve build can change its outlook rapidly. “Given the macro environment, etc., cost of credit compared to last quarter, we expect to be up a few hundred million.” Bloomberg also reports, however, that analysts expect loan losses to go down in the second quarter. Raghavan said 80% of Citigroup’s corporate exposure is to entities with high creditworthiness. “We still have a few more weeks to go in this quarter, but on the credit overall, I’m incredibly reassured of the quality.” The executive reportedly notes, however, that the firm’s investment banking business has been hurt by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. “What investment banking likes is clarity. So either it’s really bad or really good, whatever it is, just give us the news, but it is that middle area of not knowing that really freezes market activity.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

What is Legendary Education Group Planning? Legendary Education Group, known primarily as an investment holding company, revealed its plans to allocate up to HK$30 million, which translates to approximately $3.82 million USD, towards investments in the cryptocurrency market. This strategic decision was formalized with the establishment of a dedicated investment committee, tasked with overseeing the group’s foray into virtual assets. Why is Legendary Education Group Making This Move Now? The board of Legendary Education Group expressed clear optimism regarding the current state and future potential of the cryptocurrency market. They cited the “robust momentum” observed in the space as a key driver behind their decision to diversify into digital assets. This indicates a belief that cryptocurrencies offer compelling growth opportunities that align with the group’s investment objectives. Key aspects of their investment strategy include: Funding Source: The investment will be funded entirely from the group’s existing internal financial resources. This suggests confidence in their current liquidity and a long-term perspective on this new asset class. Execution Method: Investments will be conducted through the open market. Platform Choice: Crucially, the group emphasized that the investments will be made exclusively on a regulated platform , specifically a licensed virtual asset trading platform. This highlights a commitment to compliance and security in their approach to digital asset investment. The Significance of Investing on a Regulated Platform Choosing a regulated platform is a critical point in Legendary Education Group’s announcement. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, regulatory clarity and compliance are becoming increasingly important, especially for publicly listed companies. Investing through a licensed platform in Hong Kong provides several potential benefits: Investor Protection: Licensed platforms typically adhere to strict operational and security standards, offering a higher degree of protection for assets. Legal Compliance: It ensures the investment activities are in line with Hong Kong’s evolving regulations for virtual assets . Market Integrity: Trading on regulated platforms can contribute to greater market transparency and reduce risks associated with unregulated exchanges. This approach sets a precedent for other traditional firms in Hong Kong considering similar moves, emphasizing a cautious yet forward-thinking strategy towards integrating digital assets into their portfolios. What Does This Mean for Corporate Crypto Adoption? Legendary Education Group’s planned investment is another data point in the growing trend of corporate crypto adoption globally and, importantly, within Hong Kong. While $3.82 million might seem modest compared to investments by larger global corporations, it represents a significant step for a Hong Kong-listed investment holding company venturing into this space. It signals that digital assets are increasingly being viewed as legitimate investment opportunities by traditional financial and investment firms in the region. This move could potentially: Encourage other Hong Kong-based companies to explore digital asset investments. Increase liquidity and trading volume on regulated virtual asset platforms in Hong Kong. Further solidify Hong Kong’s position as a hub for regulated cryptocurrency activities in Asia. Looking Ahead: The Future of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong The decision by Legendary Education Group to invest in virtual assets underscores the shifting perception of cryptocurrencies from speculative curiosities to legitimate components of an investment portfolio. As regulatory frameworks in Hong Kong continue to mature, it is likely that more traditional companies will evaluate similar opportunities. The focus on using a regulated platform is particularly telling, indicating a desire for secure, compliant entry into the market. This development is a positive sign for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, demonstrating increasing institutional interest and confidence in the long-term viability and growth potential of digital assets, starting with a notable Hong Kong crypto investment .

Garlinghouse shared this projection at the recent XRPL Apex Conference in Singapore. The CEO said this in response to an interviewer’s question at the event. According to him, SWIFT today is premised on messaging and liquidity. With the liquidity being owned by banks, he believes XRP can supplant that with crypto liquidity. He said: “There are two parts to SWIFT today: messaging and liquidity. The banks own liquidity. I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity. If you’re driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP… so I’ll say five years, 14%.” Garlinghouse’s comments highlight how Ripple is counting on using crypto liquidity to gain market share in the cross-border payments sector. With its approach, the firm expects that its ability to offer faster and cheaper transactions that leverage blockchain technology will be enough to take market share from SWIFT. Currently, SWIFT powers the majority of all international transactions. Interestingly, there have been reports of a potential partnership between Ripple and SWIFT that could integrate XRP with the platform. However, Ripple’s moves suggest it is more likely to position itself as a competitor. XRPL EVM sidechain to launch soon Meanwhile, talks at the XRPL APEX were not restricted to Ripple’s ambitions for cross-border payments, with the company’s CTO David Schwartz also announcing a couple of developments within the XRPL ecosystem. The biggest update was that the XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain will launch in Q2 of 2025. The product Ripple developed in partnership with Peersyst already has its testnet active since March 31, with over 80 projects already deployed on the testnet. Given that June is the last month of Q2, it is expected that Ripple could launch the sidechain sometime this month. That could be a major boost for activity on XRPL by allowing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and decentralized applications on XRPL. According to Ripple, over 6 million active wallets are on the network, with a lifetime transaction volume of around 33 billion. However, it could use a boost in DeFi transactions, with payments currently dominating on-chain network activity. Interestingly, XRPL is already primed to see more activity with Ondo Finance , which is finally launching its OUSG tokenized US treasuries product on the network. This comes after the real-world assets tokenization protocol announced the plan in January. Users can mint and redeem OUSG on XRPL using Ripple stablecoin RLUSD. Other announcements on the first day of APEX include the news that publicly trading Vivo Power will deploy $100 million in XRP to the Flare ecosystem to generate yield and the upgrade that allows XRPL to support Dynamic NFTs. XRP is down 3% despite conference optimism Meanwhile, the developments announced at the XRPL APEX did nothing for the XRP price over the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, the token is down almost 3.5% today, falling to $2.244. This decline is likely due to the general fall in the price of crypto assets after Bitcoin slipped from over $110,000 to $107,000, causing almost all other tokens to also record a slump . XRP could not buck the trend despite the positive sentiments expected from its conference. With its recent decline, the token has been down 3.35% year-to-date. This best describes how 2025 has been for XRP, with the token steadying around above $2 and struggling to see any major gains. Nevertheless, the XRPL APEX is a three-day event set to end by June 12, so many positive updates to the ecosystem could still be announced. XRP holders will be counting on such to boost the token value.

Nearly all top 100 coins have recorded decreases over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 4% to $3.51 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $132 billion. TL;DR: The market turns red today, most top 100 coins are down; BTC dropped to the $107,500 level, ETH is at $2,749; Ethereum’s bounce-back signals more than just price action; Volatility expectations are increasing; US spot ETH ETFs outperform their BTC counterparts: $240.29 million vs $164.57 million; Markets are digesting the news of the US-China trade agreement and the US inflation report; The dip may be a short-term development, but the market is at a crossroads. Crypto Winners & Losers In complete contrast to yesterday’s situation, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.7%, dropping from the $109,500 level to the current price of $107,563. Ethereum (ETH) is close by, decreasing by 1.6% to the price of $2,749. While Dogecoin (DOGE) was the highest gainer yesterday, it saw the highest drop in this category today: 6.2% to $0.1898. Moreover, most of the top 100 coins are down today. Only four are up, with SPX6900 (SPX) recording the highest increase of 8.1% to $1.68. Jupiter (JUP) saw the highest decrease, and the only double-digit one: 10.6% to $0.4538. The markets have seen a variety of significant developments this week, including the tentative trade agreement between the US and China, US inflation report, as well as the US Senate voting to invoke cloture on a substitute amendment to the stablecoin GENIUS Act . Big headline, but the devil’s in the details. Let’s see the terms before calling it a game-changer. Markets might pump short-term, but long-term trust takes more than a tweet. — GameCentric (@gamecentric_io) June 11, 2025 Speaking of stablecoins, Ant Group , the Jack Ma-backed fintech giant, plans to apply for stablecoin licenses in key Asian markets. It is eyeing licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as in Luxembourg. Crypto Market Sensitivity to Price Fluctuations Rises Per Glassnode’s latest report, BTC is holding above the psychologically significant $100,000 level, indicating that investor confidence remains robust. At the same time, volatility expectations are rising. The dense concentration of coin supply near the current spot prices increases market sensitivity to price fluctuations, the analysts argue. That said, mature investors have no losses locked. Almost all loss-taking occurred from top buyers across the ATH formation. This suggests “a capitulation of only the most speculative of investors.” Yet, Options At-the-Money Implied Volatility “across all major tenors remain historically low, suggesting that options traders may be underpricing the likelihood of a volatility regime shift,” Glassnode says. Source: Glassnode However, many eyes are on Ethereum these days. Dom Harz, co-founder of Layer-2 BOB , commented that ETH’s price rise in recent days “marks a significant shift in sentiment toward an asset that had, until relatively recently, fallen out of favour.” Ethereum’s bounce-back signals more than just price action, Harz argues. “The momentum reflects a meaningful shift in sentiment, fuelled by a combination of technical progress, market activity, and regulatory signals.” The Pectra upgrade has gone live and been reinforced by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins’ support for DeFi, as well as the strong performance of Circle’s record-breaking IPO, the co-founder says. “These are exciting times for DeFi and for Ethereum’s role in the industry’s next chapter. Hopefully, we are moving beyond the memecoin noise and back to building scalable, decentralised systems — the foundations for crypto’s future,” Harz concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $107,563, the lowest it’s been today, significantly moving away from the all-time high of $111,814, which it hit on 22 May. Notably, it’s also back to the levels seen at the beginning of this week before it started this latest push upwards. Also notably, this is a pullback from the intraday high of $110,269, indicating the coin’s initiative to move towards and above the ATH. The key support level stands at $97,600, while the resistance is at $115,400. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same time period, Ethereum hit an intraday high of $2,870. It’s also interesting to note that this intraday high moves higher every day. Analysts argue that ETH is poised for further increases. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment slightly decreased within the greed zone. Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell from 65 yesterday to 61 today . This may indicate that the market is overheating and heading for a correction, but there are also movements towards the neutral zone, which would ease these concerns. “Encouragingly, the wave of fear in market sentiment did not translate into a meaningful shift in spending behavior,” Glassnode says. “When assessing losses locked in on-chain, only -$200M of losses were realized, with the magnitude significantly shallower than previous correction events. This suggests that loss-taking remained contained, with investors largely unfazed by the drawdown.” Meanwhile, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $164.57 million on Wednesday. BlackRock leads the list with $131.01 million. The cumulative total net inflow now stands at $45.22 billion. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded 18 consecutive days of inflows. Today, they surpassed the BTC counterparts, with $240.29 million in inflows. BlackRock is the biggest contributor to this amount with $163.64 million on 11 June. The cumulative total net inflow climbed to $3.74 billion. According to Seamus Rocca, Chief Executive Officer of Xapo Bank , “the rise of corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is significant, but it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions. It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Companies like Strategy and Metaplanet represent “high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims.” However, for most others, a more measured approach is better suited – “one grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility. In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” Rocca emphasizes. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly,” Rocca concludes. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and stock markets have increased in the last day, though crypto’s increase is notably higher. The S&P 500 has decreased by 0.27%, the Nasdaq-100 is down 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.0026%. The markets are reacting to and are still digesting the developments related to Wednesday’s US inflation report and the result of the trade talks between the US and China. Is this dip sustainable? The dip may be brief, followed by another rally, given the still prevailing bullish sentiment. However, the market stands at a crossroads, and further dips, even if short-term, are possible.

In most cases, markets have struggled to absorb the new supply, with price and market cap often declining in tandem. This trend underlines a concerning mismatch between token emissions and investor demand, which is placing pressure on valuations across multiple ecosystems.

US spot Ethereum ETFs are making serious waves, demonstrating growing investor appetite for digital assets. On June 11, these investment vehicles saw a significant boost, recording a massive $240.7 million in total net inflows. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the 18th consecutive trading day of net inflows and stands out as the largest single-day inflow observed over the past four months. This surge in US spot Ethereum ETFs activity is a clear indicator of shifting market dynamics and increasing confidence. What Exactly Are US Spot Ethereum ETFs? Before diving deeper into the recent numbers, let’s quickly touch upon what US spot Ethereum ETFs are. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or, in this case, cryptocurrencies. A “spot” ETF means the fund directly holds the underlying asset – Ethereum (ETH) – rather than derivatives or futures contracts. Think of it this way: When you buy shares of a spot Ethereum ETF, you are essentially gaining exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without needing to buy and hold ETH yourself on a crypto exchange. The ETF provider handles the complexities of buying, storing, and securing the actual Ethereum. These ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts. The approval and launch of ETH ETF products in the US have been highly anticipated events, following the successful rollout of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in the year. They offer a regulated and familiar investment pathway for individuals and institutions alike. The Surge in Ethereum ETF Inflows: Breaking Down the Numbers The $240.7 million figure for June 11 is truly noteworthy. It highlights a significant influx of capital into these nascent products. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, this single day represented the peak inflow over the last four months, signaling strong momentum for Ethereum ETF inflows . Let’s look at how the major players stacked up on that particular day: ETF Provider Ticker Net Inflows (June 11) BlackRock ETHA $164.05 million Fidelity FETH $37.28 million Grayscale (Mini) ETH $19.61 million Grayscale ETHE $13.30 million Bitwise ETHW $6.46 million As you can see, BlackRock’s ETHA dominated the inflows, capturing the lion’s share. Fidelity and Grayscale’s products also saw substantial capital injections. The fact that this marks the 18th consecutive day of net inflows suggests a sustained positive trend rather than just a brief blip. Why Do These Ethereum ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto Market? The consistent and significant Ethereum ETF inflows are a bullish signal for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are often preferred by large institutional investors, financial advisors, and traditional fund managers who might face regulatory or logistical hurdles investing directly in crypto. Inflows indicate that this class of investors is starting to allocate capital to Ethereum via these regulated products. Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in Ethereum as easy as buying a stock, opening up the market to a much broader base of retail investors who may be hesitant to use crypto exchanges. Market Validation: The demand for these products validates Ethereum as a significant asset class in traditional finance circles. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one relationship, sustained inflows mean that ETF providers are buying large amounts of actual ETH on the market to back the shares being purchased by investors. This consistent buying pressure can positively influence the Ethereum price . The performance of Crypto ETF products, particularly Bitcoin and now Ethereum, is increasingly seen as a key metric for tracking the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Considering Investing? What Are the Benefits and Challenges of ETH ETFs? For investors looking at gaining exposure to Ethereum, the ETH ETF route offers distinct advantages and disadvantages compared to buying ETH directly: Benefits: Simplicity and Familiarity: Trade through existing brokerage accounts. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection not always present with direct crypto investments. Custody Handled: No need to worry about setting up wallets, managing private keys, or securing your ETH yourself. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major exchanges, typically offering high liquidity. Challenges: Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) which can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the spot price of Ethereum due to fees, trading costs, and operational factors. Indirect Ownership: You own shares of a fund that owns ETH, not the ETH itself. This means you cannot stake your ETH or use it in DeFi applications. Market Hours: ETFs only trade during traditional market hours, unlike the 24/7 crypto market. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial when deciding the best approach for your investment goals and risk tolerance regarding the Ethereum price exposure. What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? The recent positive inflow trend suggests strong initial demand following the initial regulatory hurdles. The approval process itself was a significant catalyst, and the subsequent inflows indicate that investors were ready to jump in once the products became available. Future performance will likely depend on several factors: Overall Crypto Market Sentiment: As with any crypto-related product, performance is heavily tied to the broader market’s health and sentiment. Regulatory Environment: Continued clarity and favorable regulations could encourage more traditional finance players to engage. Product Competition: As more providers launch their ETH ETFs, competition could lead to lower fees, benefiting investors. Ethereum’s Development: Updates and developments within the Ethereum network itself could impact investor confidence and demand for ETH-related products. The success seen in Bitcoin ETFs, which have accumulated tens of billions in assets, sets a potential precedent for the growth trajectory of US spot Ethereum ETFs . Conclusion: A Strong Signal for Ethereum’s Future The news of Ethereum ETF inflows reaching $240.7 million on June 11, marking the largest single-day inflow in four months and the 18th consecutive day of positive flows, is undeniably a powerful signal. It underscores growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum as an asset class and highlights the impact of regulated investment products like the ETH ETF on bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. While the market remains volatile, the sustained demand reflected in these inflows provides a compelling narrative for the increasing acceptance and potential future growth of Ethereum within the global financial landscape. It’s a development that investors and market watchers will continue to monitor closely.

The government has proposed a strategy to redirect up to 2,000 megawatts (MW) of surplus energy to crypto mining and AI data centers, turning financial losses into potential gains. This marks a major shift in how the country looks at energy and digital assets. Pakistan’s troubling financial state resembles its urgency to take Bitcoin seriously and to resolve its decade-long energy issues as well. 5️⃣ Energy Allocation for Mining ➺ Last month, Pakistan announced to allocate 2,000 MW of electricity to power bitcoin mining and AI data centres. ➺ This will help monetize surplus energy, while also boosting SBR and job creation. ➺ An overall win for the country and its… pic.twitter.com/YS2Dul2Ehf — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) June 5, 2025 Unused Power Becomes a Massive Drain The country currently has an installed electricity capacity of 46,600 MW, but nearly 14% of this remains idle for much of the year. During low-demand winter months, consumption can drop to just 12,000 MW. Despite not being used, many of these plants continue receiving capacity payments, which are fixed fees paid whether electricity is generated or not. Moreover, these payments have now reached around $7.4 billion a year, heavily burdening the national budget and increasing electricity costs for citizens. Rapid Solar Growth Creates New Challenges Pakistan has also seen a boom in solar energy. In 2024 alone, net-metered solar capacity surged from 1.3 GW to nearly 4.9 GW, driven by an influx of over 17 GW of low-cost Chinese solar panels. While solar energy is a cleaner alternative, it has brought new issues like grid instability and uneven cost distribution. Non-solar users now pay higher rates, and poorer households struggle to access affordable energy solutions. Bitcoin Mining Offers a Digital Lifeline To address this growing imbalance, the government has floated the idea of using idle power for Bitcoin mining . The proposal suggests that crypto mining could absorb excess electricity during off-peak times, reduce pressure on the grid, and generate digital revenue. This could help offset the huge losses from capacity payments and offer a new income stream for the state. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price?

A Real-World Test for Crypto If Pakistan can pull this off, it could become a rare example of using crypto mining to solve a real economic problem. The success of the plan will depend on how it is managed and whether the benefits are shared fairly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The plan aims to convert idle electricity capacity, which costs Pakistan $7.4 billion annually in payments, into revenue through Bitcoin mining. This could offset losses and utilize surplus power, potentially reducing energy costs and easing grid pressure, especially during off-peak hours. What environmental impacts could arise from using old coal plants for crypto mining? Using old, inefficient power plants, often coal-fired, for crypto mining could significantly increase air pollution and carbon emissions, counteracting global efforts to combat climate change and potentially creating local environmental concerns. Could this energy strategy set a precedent for other countries facing similar crises? Yes, if successful, Pakistan’s strategy could serve as a unique blueprint for other developing nations with surplus energy capacity or seasonal energy imbalances, demonstrating how digital asset generation might address economic and energy challenges.",News|Mining,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 12:00:43

Key Takeaways: Japan will urge G7 nations to coordinate action against North Korean crypto thefts at the June summit. The push follows a $307M hack on DMM Bitcoin, linked to North Korea’s TraderTraitor group. If adopted, it would mark the G7’s first joint response to nation-state threats in the crypto sector. According to Japanese media reports , Ishiba will call for greater collaboration among member states to improve oversight of digital asset markets and restrict illicit financial flows tied to state-sponsored hacking groups. The goal is to address cybercrime that supports North Korea’s weapons programs and undermines international non-proliferation efforts. G7 May Take First Joint Action on North Korea Crypto Threats If adopted, the initiative would mark the first time the G7 formally discusses collective action on crypto-related threats linked to a nation-state. The Group of Seven includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the U.S., and the European Union. Japan’s renewed focus comes in the wake of a $307 million theft from DMM Bitcoin, one of the country’s largest exchanges. Investigators from Japan’s National Police Agency and the FBI have attributed the May 2023 breach to the North Korean hacking group TraderTraitor , also known as Jade Sleet and UNC4899. The hack reportedly began with a social engineering scheme, where a North Korean operative posing as a recruiter gained access to an employee at Ginco, a wallet software provider servicing DMM Bitcoin. The operative deployed a malicious Python script that infiltrated Ginco’s internal systems. This access was later used to manipulate a transaction request, enabling the theft of more than 4,500 BTC. Authorities traced the stolen funds to wallets operated by TraderTraitor, a group already under U.S. sanctions for its role in cyberattacks aimed at funding North Korea’s military ambitions. The DMM incident forced the exchange to suspend operations and drew renewed attention to the vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure. North Korea Linked to Major Crypto Hacks North Korea has also been linked to several other major crypto heists, including those targeting Bybit , the Ronin Bridge , Harmony, and various DeFi platforms. Global law enforcement is responding. The U.S. Department of Justice recently moved to seize over $7.7 million in digital assets tied to North Korean IT workers embedded in blockchain firms. Meanwhile, the U.S. and South Korea signed a bilateral agreement in 2023 to enhance their technical capabilities in detecting and countering DPRK cyber operations. North Korean cyber strategies continue to evolve. In April, Lazarus-linked operatives reportedly set up U.S.-based shell companies to distribute malware to crypto developers. Kraken recently thwarted an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean posing as a job candidate.

45863783,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=770430,1749729818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45863783.jpeg,Bitcoin Sentiment Explodes While Bitcoin Hyper Soars: Best Presale in 2025 About to Take Off?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-sentiment-explodes-while-bitcoin-hyper-soars-best-presale-in-2025/,"There’s much ado about Bitcoin these days. After notching a new all-time of $111.9K on May 22, 2025, $BTC has been trading back and forth below that mark, never falling below $100K. But usually holding sideways between $105K-$110K. But Bitcoin sentiment is beginning to build again. Will it lead to a new push for the market? If so, then the aptly-named Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale could gain the most as Bitcoin’s first Layer-2 implementing the Solana Virtual Machine. Long-Time HODLers Selling at $100K One reason for the recent selling pressure might be long-term Bitcoin hodlers finally choosing to sell. Early investors who bought Bitcoin when the price was a few thousand (Bitcoin was below $10K only a few years ago, on July 1, 2020) might be finally ready to cash out now that $BTC has gone 10x or more from their original investment. Is that a bad sign for Bitcoin investors? Not necessarily. A potential tightening of Bitcoin’s supply will likely offset the increased selling pressure. On-chain data supports that conclusion, as the amount of exchange-held Bitcoins has steadily fallen, even as Bitcoin’s price rises. In fact, only weakening demand may have kept $BTC’s price down so far. And that’s not likely to continue forever. Bitwise CEO: ‘No One Is Going To Sell’ Once Bitcoin Breaks Through Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley thinks that tightening supply will only worsen once Bitcoin breaks through $130K-$150K. At that point, the HODLers will return, diamond hands and everything. If he’s correct, then the issue of tightening supply will kick in harder than ever. And the first and perhaps only immutable law of economics – supply and demand – could supercharge Bitcoin’s price. Institutional investors being more bullish than ever also helps the narrative, even as retail investors go back-and-forth with Bitcoin. Take GameStop, which recently purchased 4.7K Bitcoin and plans to offer $1.75B of convertible notes to potentially fund more purchases. A recent Santiment report shows that Bitcoin positivity is returning in the community , with positive comments outweighing the negative by more than 2-1. Growing Bitcoin hype means at least one thing: $BTC-centric presales like Bitcoin Hyper could grow big – fast. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Unlock Fast, Cheap Bitcoin Transactions with First Bitcoin Layer 2 More than a store of value; with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin can finally be everything it was meant to be – the home of crypto payments, meme coins , dApps, and smart contracts. The technical framework for Bitcoin Hyper is straightforward; with the Bitcoin Relay Program, any $BTC deposited to a specific Bitcoin address can be minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2. That Layer 2 leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for better throughput and increased scalability, and sets $HYPER up to be one of the strongest crypto presales so far in 2025. The end result is a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) equipped Layer 2, trustless but fully synced to the Bitcoin Layer 1 blockchain. $HYPER, the native token for the Bitcoin Layer 2, provides a number of benefits for $HYPER chain users. Those benefits include: Low gas fees, paid in $HYPER Staking rewards, currently 647% APY Participation incentives Developer bounties Bitcoin Hyper’s presale rocketed out of the gate, passing $1M raised in a matter of days. Token currently cost $0.01185, with $1.13M raised so far. That price could reach $0.02595 by the end of 2025 (for a 118% increase), according to our price prediction . Buy into the $HYPER , and join a community of visionaries who want to transform Bitcoin’s position in the dApp industry. Bullish Outlook Means Growing Demand for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper As $BTC supply tightens, demand will only increase. That should fuel a further increase for both $BTC and related projects, like a groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2. And if you consider $HYPER’s utility is all about making Bitcoin more prepared for the adoption ahead, the project’s potential in the market becomes beyond clear.

Open interest refers to the total number of active contracts that haven’t been settled or closed. Therefore, a high open interest suggests that more investors are either speculating on Ethereum’s future price or hedging their spot holdings to manage risk. An all-time high (ATH) in OI often precedes significant price movement, as a build-up of leveraged positions can lead to short squeezes or long squeezes, depending on trader bias. It can also lead to liquidations, which amplify price swings. CoinGlass data reveals $2B in long positions set for liquidation at $2,600 and $1.8B in shorts at $2,900, creating a high-stakes tug-of-war. With liquidity clustered at both ends, market makers face a pivotal decision on which side to target next. Therefore, caution should not be thrown to the wind because Ethereum’s price can go either way. At the time of this writing, ETH was experiencing a pullback to trade at $2,770 per CoinGecko data . Ethereum is Attracting More Institutional Interest Than Bitcoin Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have drawn over $800 million in the past two weeks, which is more than double Bitcoin’s inflows of around $400 million, according to SoSoValue data. This can be linked to the fact that there’s growing speculation that ETH ETFs will soon incorporate staking—allowing investors to earn yield on ETH holdings without handling the technical side themselves. As a result, this staking optionality is drawing fresh capital into Ethereum compared to Bitcoin ETFs, which lack similar yield features. Jeff Mei, the COO at crypto exchange BTSE, opined, “Investors are finally recognizing the compelling investment opportunity that Ethereum presents. It’s still trading well below its all-time highs, while Bitcoin is already near its ATH levels.” He added that there is a high probability that Ethereum will reach or surpass its ATH by year’s end. ETH’s historic high price currently sits at $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Ethereum exchange supply hitting a 7-year low also paints a bullish picture, thanks to the intensified hodling taking place. DeFi’s Resurgence Propels Ethereum to New Heights as TVL Surpasses $65 Billion and Institutional Demand Surges Ethereum’s momentum in mid‑2025 is being turbocharged by a resurgence in DeFi activity, fueled by record demand, infrastructure upgrades, and institutional inflows. Ethereum now commands roughly $65.45 billion of DeFi’s global total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama data. Innovations Lowering Friction Upgrades like Spectra, EIP‑4844 blobs, and the forthcoming Pectra upgrade are reducing fees and boosting scalability, enabling smoother DeFi operations. Additionally, emerging ZK‑rollup solutions are proving capable of processing more than 70 swaps per second—a dramatic improvement over Ethereum’s base rate of ~12 TPS. These developments enhance composability and user experience in borrowing, staking, and trading. Diversified Protocol Strength Ethereum’s DeFi suite has broadened in functionality: Lido leads liquid staking, helping depositors earn staking yields while keeping assets liquid for DeFi use. Aave dominates lending markets with its GHO stablecoin and cross‑chain lending pools. EigenLayer and EtherFi enable restaking, allowing users to earn extra yield while bolstering network security. Sky (MakerDAO’s evolution) now offers high‑yield stablecoins and vaults, growing TVL over 55% in recent months. Institutional Capital & Macro Tailwinds Ethereum’s deep liquidity and strong developer ecosystem are drawing institutional interest. Whales are shifting assets into self‑custody and DeFi vs. exchanges, increasing on‑chain demand . Broader macro trends—potential interest‑rate cuts and stablecoin growth—boost DeFi yield attractiveness compared to traditional fixed income. Network Effects Amidst Competition Ethereum remains the dominant platform, hosting over half of the global DeFi TVL. Although competitive ecosystems are growing (Solana up 800% Y/Y, newer chains like Aptos gaining traction), none match Ethereum’s composability, developer momentum, or market share. Conclusion Ethereum’s DeFi renaissance—rooted in record TVL, cross‑protocol innovation, on‑chain capital flow, and protocol upgrades—has created a positive feedback loop. As TVL rises, more builders are incentivized to innovate, attracting users and assets, reinforcing Ethereum’s network effects. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how Ethereum plays out in the short term because liquidity is clustered in both bullish and bearish sides, with the psychological price of $3,000 expected to be a turning point.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-12 12:04:41

The timing of this congressional inquiry proves particularly significant, as the Senate prepares to vote on upcoming stablecoin regulation legislation . The lawmakers argue that, given Meta’s enormous market influence, it has become imperative for both Congress and the American public to gain complete transparency regarding the company’s cryptocurrency ambitions. Why Warren Calls Meta’s Stablecoin a ‘Monopolistic Threat’ to the US Economy In their June 12 correspondence , the senators articulated their concerns about the broader implications of technology giants entering the digital currency space. “Big Tech companies’ issuing or controlling their own private currencies, like a stablecoin, would threaten competition across the economy, erode financial privacy, and cede control of the U.S. money supply to monopolistic platforms that have a history of abusing their power,” the senators wrote. Source: U.S. States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Zuckerberg has been given a five-day deadline until June 17 to provide detailed responses to eight specific inquiries about Meta’s stablecoin strategy. These questions encompass which external companies Meta has engaged for consultation and whether the corporation is actively considering developing its own stablecoin. The senators are also seeking information about Meta’s lobbying activities regarding cryptocurrency legislation and the company’s stance on potential amendments that would prevent “Big Tech” firms from controlling stablecoin issuers. Zuckerberg questioned by the U.S Senate/ Source: Senate.Gov Warren and Blumenthal referenced Meta’s previous ventures into digital currency through the Libra and Diem projects, which debuted in 2019. These initiatives ultimately failed due to overwhelming regulatory pressure and opposition from both political parties , leading to the sale of all related assets by 2022. Will the GENIUS Act Hand Stablecoin Control to Big Tech? Senate Vote Sparks Fury The letter also highlights concerns about potential regulatory exceptions that could benefit Meta. The senators worry about President Donald Trump potentially granting the company a waiver under the GENIUS Act, which could allow Meta to circumvent regulations other stablecoin issuers must follow. #DontMessWithMedicaid (The Genius Act Page 2 of 2) The bill also includes a giant carve-out to ensure Musk’s social media platform X, formerly Twitter, would not be covered by even modest restrictions, thereby “gifting the President’s closest Big Tech ally a competitive… — Harold Katlin (@HaroldKatl3281) June 9, 2025 The lawmakers warned about privacy implications if Meta were to control its stablecoin infrastructure. “If Meta controlled its own stablecoin, the company could further pry into consumers’ transactions and commercial activity,” the senators wrote. This congressional investigation stems from a May 8 report revealing that Meta has been discussing incorporating stablecoins into its platform ecosystem with various cryptocurrency companies, including Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. At the time of initial reporting, it remained uncertain whether Meta intended to partner with established stablecoin providers like Tether or Circle or planned to develop its own proprietary solution. Meta Says ‘No Stablecoin’ — But Senators Found Evidence of Secret Crypto Talks Meta communications director Andy Stone responded to the May reports by confirming that the Diem project had been permanently discontinued, stating that Diem is “dead” and that there was “no Meta stablecoin.” To be clear: as Mark said (and as the story notes), Diem is “dead.” There is no Meta stablecoin. https://t.co/U1DN2VXM9Q — Andy Stone (@andymstone) May 8, 2025 However, subsequent reporting by Fortune suggested that Meta was actively negotiating with multiple cryptocurrency firms regarding stablecoin payment integration. Drawing from available information, Meta’s primary interest lies in the practical advantages of stablecoins over traditional fiat currencies, particularly regarding cost-effective international transfers and cross-border payments. Circle’s Senior Director of Business Development Matt Cavin, who previously held an executive position at Web3 gaming company Immutable until March, is reportedly spearheading the discussions.

This release comes after he spent six months in custody, following an initial conviction related to bribery allegations. Who is Lee Jung-hoon and What Were the Charges? Lee Jung-hoon is the former chairman of Bithumb Holdings, the holding company behind one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bithumb. His legal troubles stem from allegations that he accepted substantial bribes – reportedly several hundred million won – in exchange for listing two specific cryptocurrencies on the Crypto Exchange platform. The case has been closely watched as it involves a high-profile figure in the South Korea Crypto industry and touches upon critical issues of listing integrity and potential corruption within exchanges. In the first trial, Lee was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison. This conviction led to his detention starting in December 2024. Understanding the Bithumb Bail : Details of the Release The decision to grant Bithumb Bail to Lee Jung-hoon was reported by Digital Asset. His release signifies a shift in his legal status while the case potentially moves forward, likely through appeals. The court imposed several conditions upon his release, designed to ensure he remains available for future legal proceedings and does not interfere with the case. These conditions include: A strict restriction on changing his registered residence. A ban on leaving South Korea without explicit court approval. A substantial bail deposit of 50 million won (approximately $36,500 USD). A prohibition on contacting individuals who are involved in the ongoing case. These conditions are standard in cases where bail is granted after a conviction, reflecting the court’s need to balance the individual’s rights with the requirements of the justice system. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Exchange Landscape in South Korea Crypto ? The release of a figure as prominent as the former Bithumb Chairman on Bithumb Bail naturally raises questions about the broader implications for the South Korea Crypto market and the regulatory environment surrounding Crypto Exchange operations. While the bail itself does not overturn the initial conviction, it allows Lee to potentially participate more actively in his defense during the appeal process. For Bithumb, the ongoing legal saga involving its former chairman continues to be a point of scrutiny, although the company has sought to distance its current operations from the charges against Lee, which relate to past alleged actions. Challenges for the industry include maintaining investor confidence amidst high-profile legal cases. The focus on listing practices in this case highlights the ongoing global regulatory push for greater transparency and integrity on trading platforms. The South Korea Crypto market, being one of the most active globally, is particularly sensitive to such developments. Looking Ahead: What’s Next After the Bithumb Bail ? The release on Bithumb Bail is not the end of the legal process for Lee Jung-hoon . The case is expected to move to higher courts for appeal, where the initial conviction will be reviewed. The outcome of these appeals will be crucial in determining the final legal standing of the former Bithumb Chairman . Observers of the South Korea Crypto scene and the global Crypto Exchange market will be watching closely for developments in this case, as it could set precedents or influence future regulatory approaches to exchange operations and executive accountability. Summary Former Bithumb Chairman , Lee Jung-hoon , has been granted Bithumb Bail after six months in custody following his initial conviction on bribery charges related to listing cryptocurrencies on the Crypto Exchange . His release comes with specific conditions, and the case remains ongoing within the South Korea Crypto legal system. This development underscores the legal challenges facing high-profile figures in the industry and the continued scrutiny on exchange operations.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touched on stablecoins, which have been a subject of debate in recent months, in his statement to the Senate subcommittee. Bessent said dollar-backed stablecoins could reach a market value of $2 trillion or more. Emphasizing that stablecoins have the potential to expand the global use of the US dollar, Bessent noted that Congress is advancing legislation requiring stablecoins to be backed by high-quality assets such as US Treasury Bonds. Bessent stated that there have been many incidents throughout history where the status of the dollar has been questioned, but such fears have been proven unfounded as new dynamics have given the US dollar new momentum. “This administration is committed to preserving Bitcoin’s reserve currency status in America and advancing blockchain technology. Stablecoin legislation backed by U.S. Treasury Bonds or Treasury Notes would create a market through these stablecoins that would expand the use of the U.S. dollar around the world. “I think 2 trillion is a very, very reasonable number for the stablecoin market, and I can see it being much higher.” The US Treasury Secretary recently reiterated that the US government is seeking to solidify the dollar’s reserve currency status by supporting legislation that would further embed stablecoins into the financial system and include strict rules that would ensure they are fully backed by Treasury bonds and other short-term government debt. Meanwhile, great efforts are being made to pass the GENIUS bill, which is seen as cryptocurrency-friendly, in Congress. Related News: New Development in the US's Cryptocurrency-Friendly GENIUS Bill!

In an X post , Teng declared the next decade won’t be about crypto hype but its deep integration into global finance. Forget the old “should we invest?” Institutions are now focused on how to make crypto a cornerstone of their strategies. Here’s why this shift is massive and what it means for the future. Institutions Are All In Teng points to real changes that are underway. Heavyweights like Moody’s and Alphaledger just pulled off a historic trial, tokenizing municipal bonds on the Solana blockchain with embedded credit ratings. This is the first time that tokenized debt on a public chain is being experimented with by a leading ratings agency. In the meantime, Vivek Ramaswamy co-founded Strive Asset Management, funded an incredible $750 million to buy distressed Bitcoin-linked debt, including claims from Mt. Gox. These aren’t small bets; they scream confidence in crypto as a legit, long-term asset class. Crypto Winter? It Might Be Over The long crypto winters we’ve seen in the past might be behind us. Michael Saylor—known for his massive Bitcoin investments – recently said as much, pointing to growing government support and clearer regulation as signs the space is maturing. Teng seems to agree. And the numbers back it up: a new survey from Coinbase found that 83% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto holdings in 2025. This isn’t about guessing what might happen. It’s already happening, whether people notice it or not. The Financial World’s New Playbook The rules are being rewritten by this institutional push. Wall Street is embracing digital assets with tokenized bonds and Bitcoin debt arrangements. Teng’s point is very clear: the discussion of cryptocurrency has moved from skepticism to strategy. A decade of unheard-of development and legitimacy is ahead of us when blockchain and finance clash. The takeaway? Richard Teng’s statement highlights that crypto’s institutional wave is here, and it’s bringing opportunity like never before.

Stablecoin market cap on Tron surged $1.86B in 7 days, now at $79.04B. Justin Sun joined Trump’s pro-crypto dinner circle in May 2025. TRX is showing signs of fading momentum near the $0.286 resistance level. On-chain data shows 60.03% of holders remain in profit, lowering sell pressure. TRX is consolidating near $0.275, and bulls must reclaim $0.286 to regain trend control. Trump-Backed Stablecoin Sparks TRX Momentum TRX price regained investor attention after World Liberty Financial launched the Trump-linked USD₵1 stablecoin, backed by Justin Sun. Minted on Tron, it coincides with th e TRX testing $0.286 resistance. Justin Sun confirmed the launch on X, with on-chain validation via TRONSCAN. Network metrics surged, with Tron’s stablecoin cap rising from $77.18B on June 10 to $79.04B on June 12, a $1.86B increase in just two days, alongside a new user activity peak. Justin Sun the Founder of TRON cryptocurrency was among the top contenders invited to Trump’s crypto dinner in May 2025, signaling deeper alignment with U.S. pro-crypto policy and boosting sentiment around the TRON ecosystem. TRX/USD Loses Steam After Rejection Compared to earlier in June, when Tron Coin was attempting a clean breakout above $0.286 with bullish momentum behind it, the current setup presents a more cautious tone. Previously, TRX was in the midst of a rally, gaining over 7.45% weekly and pushing toward the $0.30 psychological level. As of now, price has retreated back to $0.274, testing key trendline support. The failure to close above $0.286 — now a confirmed multi-test resistance — signals exhaustion rather than continuation. Momentum Divergence: RSI (14) has declined from 61.89 to 57.59, reflecting waning bullish strength. While still above neutral, the negative slope hints at declining momentum. Stochastic RSI is flattening after a recent bullish crossover, with the gap between 65.85 and 43.74 narrowing. This shows indecision among short-term traders. MACD histogram is fading, and the crossover curve has flattened — unlike the sharper positive divergence seen earlier this month. Resistance: $0.286 (multi-test), $0.290 (short-term breakout), $0.30 (psychological). Support: $0.275 (trendline), $0.268–$0.276 (accumulation zone). Momentum indicators suggest a stall. If $0.275 fails, downside may accelerate. On-Chain Metrics: Confidence Builds, But Resistance Holds DeFiLlama shows 2.31M returning users on June 12 — slightly below the June 6 peak of 4.58M, signalling decline in network activity. According to IntoTheBlock, 60.03% of TRX holders are currently in profit, up roughly 3% since the stablecoin news, while 32.18% are at breakeven and 7.80% remain in loss. This suggests reduced sell pressure from profitable holders, though the high concentration of breakeven wallets around $0.281–$0.290 may still act as near-term resistance unless volume and sentiment strengthen. This reduces selling pressure. Still, many breakeven holders near $0.281–$0.290 reinforce resistance. TRON’s stablecoin market cap is now $79.04B, rising $1.86B in 7 days. USDT dominates with 99.01% share, confirming Tron’s relevance in stablecoin flows. TRX Outlook: Can the Rally Sustain or Is a Cool-Off Inevitable? TRX sits at a pivotal zone where technical fragility meets growing on-chain strength. If bulls reclaim $0.286 and trigger a daily close above, momentum could rapidly accelerate toward $0.290 and $0.30 zones that would validate the recent breakout narrative. Should this move coincide with an uptick in whale activity or stablecoin inflows, expect broader market confidence to follow, possibly pushing the price even higher. In that scenario, $0.32 becomes a feasible short-term extension. However, if the price continues to hover below $0.286 without new volume or catalyst support, consolidation could extend. A breakdown below $0.275 would open the path to $0.268, especially if momentum metrics like MACD and RSI continue to weaken. As of now, TRX holds in a neutral-bullish structure, but time is running short for buyers to defend the trend. The next 48–72 hours will likely dictate whether TRX rallies or rolls into deeper correction",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 12:17:17

Big news is brewing in South Korea, a major player in the global cryptocurrency landscape. The nation is taking significant steps to enhance oversight of its bustling crypto market, specifically targeting how exchanges decide which tokens make it onto their platforms and which ones get delisted. This move could fundamentally change the dynamics between regulators and the platforms you use to trade digital assets. Why is South Korea Crypto Regulation Getting Stricter? The push for enhanced South Korea crypto regulation comes amidst a global trend towards greater control and investor protection within the digital asset space. Following market volatility and high-profile incidents, governments worldwide are scrutinizing the largely unregulated aspects of cryptocurrency trading. In South Korea, the focus is turning towards the gatekeepers of the market – the exchanges themselves. Historically, decisions around listing new tokens or removing existing ones have largely been left to the discretion of individual exchanges. While exchanges have their own internal review processes, concerns have been raised about transparency, fairness, and potential conflicts of interest. Stricter oversight aims to: Protect retail investors from fraudulent or unstable projects. Ensure market integrity and prevent manipulation. Standardize listing/delisting criteria across platforms. Build greater trust in the digital asset market as a whole. Understanding the Proposed Digital Asset Act A key development driving this change is the proposed digital asset basic act, submitted by the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) on June 10. This legislative effort signals a serious intent from the government and National Assembly to establish a more robust legal framework for cryptocurrencies. The initial proposal within the bill included provisions that would have granted regulators significant, potentially full, authority over token listing and delisting processes. Imagine a scenario where an exchange couldn’t list a new promising project or delist a problematic one without direct regulatory approval for every single decision. This approach, while maximizing regulatory control, raised concerns within the industry about stifling innovation and creating bureaucratic hurdles. How Will Token Listing Delisting Decisions Change? According to reports, after discussions with industry stakeholders, the bill was revised. The updated approach seeks a balance: exchanges would retain their internal review systems for token listing delisting decisions, but these processes would now fall under the direct supervision of a new market surveillance committee. This committee, likely comprising regulators and perhaps industry experts, would oversee the *framework* and *execution* of exchange listing/delisting policies, rather than approving each individual token. This revised model suggests: Exchanges Keep Internal Systems: Platforms maintain their technical and analytical capabilities to evaluate tokens. Regulatory Oversight: A central committee monitors these internal systems, ensuring they are fair, transparent, and consistently applied. Focus on Process, Not Just Tokens: The oversight would likely focus on the criteria used, the due diligence performed, and the transparency of the decision-making process. Integration with Unfair Trading Reviews: The same surveillance committee would also oversee reviews related to unfair trading practices, creating a centralized point of oversight for market integrity issues. This represents a significant shift from the current system where exchanges largely operate independently on these critical decisions. Impact on Crypto Exchange Oversight The increased crypto exchange oversight implied by this bill is substantial. Exchanges will need to ensure their internal procedures for listing and delisting are robust, well-documented, and can withstand regulatory scrutiny. This could lead to: More stringent due diligence requirements for projects seeking listing. Clearer and more transparent communication with users regarding delisting decisions. Potential standardization of listing fees and practices to avoid perceived unfairness. Increased compliance costs for exchanges as they adapt to the new oversight framework. While some exchanges might view this as an intrusion on their business operations, proponents argue it’s a necessary step to professionalize the industry and build long-term trust, which is crucial for the growth of the digital asset market. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Integrity? Ultimately, the goal of this enhanced regulation is to bolster crypto market integrity. By supervising listing and delisting, regulators aim to reduce the prevalence of ‘shitcoins’ or projects with insufficient fundamentals, high risk of manipulation, or outright fraudulent intent from being easily listed and traded. Furthermore, oversight of delisting processes can help ensure that tokens aren’t removed unfairly or without proper notice, protecting investors from sudden loss of access to their assets. This focus on market integrity is vital for attracting institutional investors and increasing mainstream adoption. A well-regulated market is perceived as safer and more reliable, which can drive further investment and innovation. Challenges and Opportunities While the intentions behind the bill are clear, challenges remain. How will the market surveillance committee be structured? What specific criteria will they use to evaluate exchange processes? Will the oversight inadvertently slow down the listing of legitimate, innovative projects? These are questions that will need to be addressed as the bill progresses. However, opportunities also arise. For exchanges that already have strong internal controls, this could be an opportunity to demonstrate their compliance leadership. For the market as a whole, clearer rules could lead to greater stability and predictability, benefiting all participants. Actionable Insights for Investors and Exchanges For Investors: Stay informed about regulatory developments in jurisdictions where you trade. Understand that stricter rules can lead to a safer trading environment but might also affect the variety of tokens available on certain platforms. Pay attention to how exchanges communicate listing and delisting decisions. For Exchanges: Review and strengthen your internal listing and delisting policies. Ensure they are transparent, objective, and well-documented. Prepare for increased scrutiny and potential reporting requirements from regulatory bodies. Conclusion: A New Era for South Korean Crypto? South Korea’s move towards stricter supervision of token listing and delisting marks a significant moment in its crypto regulatory journey. The proposed digital asset act, with its focus on a market surveillance committee overseeing exchange processes, signals a shift towards a more controlled yet potentially more secure and transparent market. While the exact implementation details are still evolving, the direction is clear: the era of largely independent exchange control over these critical decisions may be coming to an end, ushering in a new phase focused on investor protection and market integrity under enhanced regulatory watch.

Rexas Finance is pioneering real estate tokenization and new token creation technologies to start a decentralized investing revolution. With its last presale stage ending at $0.20 and an exchange debut price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025, every investor wonders: Will Rexas Finance reach $20 by 2026? Revolutionary Platform with Real-World Use Rexas Finance enables the ownership and trading of real-world assets, extending beyond just cryptocurrency. Investors can now access multi-million-dollar asset classes, including real estate, commodities, and even rare collectibles, as blockchain technology enables fractional ownership of previously illiquid assets. Such innovation is no longer limited to sophisticated and institutional investors; it opens the financial system to new, expanding markets and provides entirely new dynamics to asset ownership. Thanks to tools like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot for Telegram and Discord, creating digital tokens without technical skills is now as easy as sending a message. Major Presale Success and Community Momentum Rexas Finance’s presale performance is crucial to investor confidence. From $0.03 at Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12, Rexas Finance achieved a 600% presale gain. Sales of over 466.7 million Rexas Finance tokens raised $49.3 million, indicating market confidence in the project’s long-term value. With over 2.25 million giveaway entries and a community engaged with Rexas Finance across platforms, the project is entering public trade with momentum. The scheduled launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, on at least three of the top 10 crypto exchanges is expected to create substantial buying pressure. Strong Security and Deflationary Tokenomics Deflationary tokenomics is another essential component of Rexas Finance’s long-term pricing prediction. Supply is closely restricted to a maximum of 1 billion tokens, with allocations split between presale, liquidity, staking pools, and ecosystem utility. Scarcity models often raise prices when demand increases, as seen with BNB and ETH during their early bull runs. Security is top-notch. Rexas AI Shield protects smart contracts by proactively reducing vulnerabilities. Rexas has also passed a Certik audit, a blockchain security gold standard, and is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, boosting investor confidence. Analysts Expect Massive Growth Industry analysts expect Rexas Finance’s value to rise 10,000 %+ due to various factors: Real-World Applications: Rexas Finance has intrinsic value, unlike meme coins or speculative tokens, thanks to its underlying assets. Innovation in tech: Its Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas Estate products pioneer blockchain-based asset ownership. Strategic Launch: Entering major exchanges at $0.25 provides Rexas Finance with visibility and liquidity for a rapid price increase. Rexas Finance has gamified engagement by offering a $1 million incentive, which creates excitement and loyalty within strong communities. If market circumstances remain bullish, Rexas Finance might reach $2–$3 by 2025. If the platform’s adoption expands at scale, notably through real estate tokenization, $10–$20 million in 2026 is achievable. What Must Happen to Reach $20 Rexas Finance would need an 80x increase from $0.25 to $20. This may seem ambitious, but successful ventures like Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Chainlink (LINK) have achieved similar or greater multipliers over comparable timeframes. It must happen as follows: 1. RWA Tokenization Mass Adoption Increasing tokenized asset acceptance will drive Rexas Finance’s ascent. Regulatory clarity and additional RWA institutions will also significantly benefit Rexas Finance. 2. Collaborations and Integration Strategic partnerships with real estate firms, commodities dealers, and DeFi protocols might boost adoption and attract billions in cash. 3. User Growth, Platform expansion Adding retail and institutional users with its user-friendly tools is key. As asset tokenization gets easier, Rexas Finance will gain value. 4. Maintain Market Sentiment If the crypto bull market continues into 2026 and Bitcoin (BTC) surpasses $100,000, as many analysts estimate, strong altcoins like RXS might experience exponential profits. Conclusion: Can $20 Rexas Finance Happen in 2026? Rexas Finance has tremendous post-launch upside. One of the most promising 2025 initiatives is Rexas Finance, with its real-world value, robust infrastructure, increasing community, and deflationary supply mechanics. If acceptance grows, a valuation of $5–$10 within 12 months of launch is possible. For a decentralized project addressing real-world problems, a valuation of $20 by late 2026 is possible under the right market conditions, strategic integrations, and user growth. Early investors could make life-changing returns. As with any investments, proper diligence and risk management are necessary. If Rexas Finance adheres to its vision, it may experience exponential growth over the next two years.

The collaboration gives institutions the ability to borrow stablecoins without having to unwind their staked ETH positions. Borrowers can use stETH as collateral for credit lines underwritten by Maple’s in-house credit team, according to a press release. Lido’s stETH is a liquid version of staked ETH that can be put to work in decentralized finance (DeFi), while still earning rewards from staking. Restaking – the idea of using a blockchain to secure other apps – has quickly become a new investment trend in crypto. Lido, an Ethereum staking stalwart, has been busy forging partnerships to bring return Lido’s stETH to center stage. Maple, with over $1.8 billion of assets on its platform, has been on a tear of late, working with Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald to do bitcoin-backed loans. “This partnership formalizes a growing demand from institutions already using stETH in their capital strategies,” said Sid Powell, CEO and Co-Founder of Maple. “By enabling loans backed by stETH, we’re making it easier for institutions to access liquidity while keeping their core assets staked and productive.” The offering serves a range of institutional use cases including treasury runway extension, conservative leverage trading, and short-term working capital, according to a press release.",Finance|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-12 13:37:24
45868438,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-must-wait-for-new-ath-as-rally-stalls,1749735453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/45868438.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bulls Must Wait For New ATH As Rally Stalls,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-must-wait-for-new-ath-as-rally-stalls,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) push toward a new all-time high stalled after reaching $110,253. The decline comes despite encouraging US macroeconomic data. However, analysts are optimistic about a recovery and a rally to $115,000. BTC is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $106,943, with sellers in control. Centralized Treasuries Hold A Third Of The Bitcoin Supply A recent research report by Gemini and Glassnode has revealed that centralized Bitcoin treasuries hold around 31% of the total Bitcoin supply. Centralized treasuries, including those of governments, exchange-traded funds, and public companies, control 30.9% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin , signaling a shift towards institutional-grade infrastructure. The total Bitcoin with institutional and custodial entities stands at 6.1 million BTC , worth $668 billion at current prices. This represents a staggering 924% increase in the Bitcoin supply held by these entities over the past decade. According to Glassnode and Gemini, the jump in BTC holdings by institutional funds, governments, and treasuries shows that they view the asset as a strategic store of value. “During the same period, the spot price of Bitcoin has climbed from under $1,000 to over $100,000, reinforcing the thesis that institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” Centralized exchanges hold around half of that figure and may be holding them for retail investors and individual customers. The report also stated that the top three entities across all institutional categories control between 65% and 90% of the total holdings. “In contrast, private company holdings appear more distributed, reflecting a broader base of engagement.” Bitwise CEO Believes Selling Pressure Will Vanish Once BTC Taps $130,000 Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes Bitcoin sell pressure will evaporate once the asset’s price crosses $130,000. Horsley stated in a post on X, “I think once Bitcoin breaks through $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin. Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some. That said, once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off. And from there on, when people need liquidity, they are going to borrow from an ever-growing set of lenders. All of which will further propel the price. There's simply not going to be enough Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could reach the $130,000-$150,000 price range this year thanks to growing demand and institutional adoption. According to Horsley, the current selling pressure is from early buyers of Bitcoin, who acquired the flagship cryptocurrency at low prices and have decided to sell some of their assets. “Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices are selling some. Once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off.” Horsley believes there will not be enough Bitcoin in the market, and holders must find alternative avenues of accessing liquidity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a bullish note, surging past $110,000 on Monday. Sellers attempted to take control on Tuesday as the price fell to a low of $108,335 but were unsuccessful as BTC rebounded to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. However, selling pressure overwhelmed buyers on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42% to $108,687. The flagship cryptocurrency continues to trade in the red during the ongoing session, trading at around $107,400. BTC’s brief rally past $110,000 came as US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came in cooler-than-expected. The CPI rose 2.4% year-over-year against an expected 2.5%, while Core CPI also beat estimates, rising 2.8% against a forecasted 2.9%. Analysts expect risk assets like BTC to rally if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. However, the chances of a rate cut next week remain low as headline CPI is rising for the first time since January. Overall market sentiment around BTC remains bullish, and softer-than-expected CPI data could see BTC rebound and surge to new highs above $115,000. US Producer Price Index (PPI) data could be a BTC and crypto rally. PPI is expected to rise 0.2% month-over-month, while core PPI is expected to rise 0.3%. Lower-than-expected numbers could reinforce dovish expectations over the second half of the year. Bitfinex analysts believe BTC could reach $111,000 despite heightened volatility and a substantial decline to below $108,000 this week. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, believes soft inflation numbers could increase the likelihood of a rate cut, giving assets like BTC a boost. The Bitfinex analyst believes this could drive the price to $111,000 even though its upside depends on the performance of the S&P 500. “ BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained.” BTC started the previous week with a sharp drop to $103,768. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday and slipped below $105,000 on Wednesday after dropping almost 1% to $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC continued to push higher over the weekend, rising 1.15% on Saturday and registering a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC rallied over 4%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settling at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42%. Slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,687. The current session sees BTC down nearly 2%, trading around $107,054 as it struggles to stay above $107,000. A bearish MACD suggests sellers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

45868388,https://coinpedia.org/?p=469329,1749735476,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee,https://coinpedia.org/news/brazils-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-bill-passes-first-committee/,"The post Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On June 12, Brazil’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill 4501/2023 passed first committee, pushing the country closer to holding $BTC as part of its national reserve. The significant move suggests the creation of a national reserve termed “RESBiT,” which allows up to 5% of the country’s foreign exchange to be allocated to Bitcoin. Key Highlights of Brazil’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Bill Project No. 4,501 of 2024 “Provides for the formation of a Sovereign Strategic Reserve of Bitcoins by the Federal Government and other measures”, stated the proposal of the bill. The Brazil Bitcoin Reserve bill 4501/2023 was introduced by Brazilian Federal Deputy Eros Biondini and received favorable feedback of approval from the Economic Development Committee– two of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies. When the reserve was initially introduced, it aimed to back Brazil’s central bank currency using blockchain and AI for transactions. This legislation aims to create a national Bitcoin reserve that would hold up to 5% of the country’s reserve. The bill highlights that the Central Bank of Brazil and the Ministry of Finance will be the operating bodies managing reserves using stringent security protocols as cold wallets. It will be required to submit audited transparency reports to Congress every six months. The Bitcoin reserve bill also aims to diversify the Treasury’s assets by supporting a country’s central bank digital currency. What is the Brazilian Government Saying About the Bitcoin Bill? Luis Gastao, the rapporteur of the proposal and also a Brazilian Congressman, emphasised that if Brazil adopts this Bitcoin Reserve plan, it can help reduce reliance on fiat currency. He added that it could also assist in diversifying its assets. He added – “We are advocating for a cautious and gradual implementation strategy to balance the potential benefits and risks of adding Bitcoin to Brazil’s official reserves.” Final Note Additionally, this new Bitcoin reserve bill is seeking approval from the committee on technology, constitution, and finance for further consideration. If the bill is ultimately passed, Brazil will second Latin American Country, just behind El Salvador, to legally establish a bitcoin reserve. However, Brazil’s approach is considered more structured. Brazil’s initiative for a Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve can steer other nations’ tech policies. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ether ETFs Continue Hot Streak Data indicates that BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack, attracting $163.6 million in fresh funds. The massive inflow coincides with Ethereum’s jump above the $2,800 mark for the first time in almost four months. The last time the inflows into the nine ETH ETFs surpassed that threshold was on February 2, when investors added $276 million into BlackRock’s ETHA, and Ethereum’s price hovered at around $2,900. Fidelity’s FBTC had an inflow of $37.28 million, Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and Bitwise’s BITW also posted minor inflows. Wednesday was the 18th consecutive session with positive flows for the spot ETH ETFs, underscoring the improving sentiment towards the underlying asset. Notably, the Ether ETFs outpaced flows into their spot Bitcoin counterparts, which gathered $164.5 million inflows on Wednesday. Since they went live last July, the Ethereum products have recorded around $3.74 billion in net inflows. ETH Price Rally Imminent? According to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum was trading at around $2,742, representing a 2.3% decline over the past day. While Bitcoin recently registered a new all-time high above $111,000, the second-biggest crypto by market cap remains over 43% below its 2021 peak of around $4,878. Despite falling out of investors’ favor and vastly underperforming BTC this year, the ETH ETFs are enjoying a resurgence as President Donald Trump’s family has, in recent months, revived interest in altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected the company’s S-3 filing—an important step in its plan to raise $1 billion—due to compliance issues related to internal financial reporting. In a filing submitted on Wednesday, DeFi Development Corp said it would withdraw its S-3 registration after the SEC found it ineligible due to the absence of a required management report on internal controls over financial reporting. The firm acknowledged the withdrawal was “consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.” Solana Plans Still in Motion Despite the SEC’s rejection, DeFi Development Corp emphasized that its plans are far from over. The company said it intends to refile a resale registration statement at a later date to continue pursuing its capital raise. The original filing, made on April 25, outlined a broad use of funds including corporate expansion and additional Solana purchases . This isn’t DeFi Development Corp’s first move in the Solana ecosystem. In a separate announcement on May 28, the firm revealed it had adopted liquid staking strategies using the dfdvSOL token, converting a portion of its SOL holdings into these yield-generating assets. It had also cautioned that price volatility could affect the value of its SOL holdings, with the potential need to convert tokens into cash at a loss. Notably, Bitcoin remains the top digital asset on corporate balance sheets—with over 3 million BTC held across institutions, currently worth more than $342 billion. However, DeFi Development Corp is carving out a unique path as a Solana-focused treasury firm. From Real Estate to Crypto Treasury Originally a real estate financing company leveraging AI to match lenders and property buyers, DeFi Development Corp has fully shifted to the blockchain sector . Its transformation began in earnest with its first Solana purchase of 2,858 tokens on April 8. By May 15, the company had made its 11th Solana acquisition, bringing its total holdings to 609,190 SOL—valued at over $97 million based on current prices. The company’s leadership has also seen a shake-up. A group of former Kraken exchange executives purchased 728,632 shares of DeFi Development Corp on April 7. Joseph Onorati, Kraken’s former chief strategy officer, now serves as chairman and CEO, steering the firm’s bold move into Solana territory.

Recent economic data out of the United States suggests that a key hurdle for further upward movement might be easing. According to a leading crypto strategist, cooling US inflation could be the catalyst the crypto market needs to ignite the next phase of its rally. The Inflation Factor: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, plays a significant role in the broader financial landscape, and increasingly, in the crypto market . When inflation is high, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve often raise interest rates to cool down the economy. Higher interest rates can make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to safer investments like bonds or even cash. Conversely, when US inflation shows signs of cooling, it can signal to the market that the central bank might slow down or even reverse its rate hikes. This potential for ‘policy easing’ can increase liquidity in the system and make investors more willing to take on risk, often benefiting assets like Bitcoin. Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, highlighted this connection in a recent communication. He pointed to the latest U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for May, which registered a 2.4% year-over-year increase. This figure came in slightly below the forecasted 2.5%, a subtle but potentially significant signal that inflationary pressures might be moderating faster than expected. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Targets on the Horizon Based on this improving economic outlook, Mena offered some compelling price targets for Bitcoin. While acknowledging the inherent volatility of the market, he suggested that a sustained break above the resistance zone of $105,000–$110,000 could pave the way for rapid ascent. Initial Target: A move towards $120,000 following a decisive break of the $105k-$110k range. Mid-Term Target: Potentially reaching $138,500 by the end of summer. Long-Term Outlook: A bullish scenario where the Bitcoin price could even touch $200,000 by the end of the year is now considered a possibility, fueled by continued positive macro trends and increasing adoption. These predictions underscore the strategist’s view that the current environment is becoming increasingly favorable for significant upside movement. Beyond Inflation: Other Macro Factors at Play While US inflation is a critical piece of the puzzle, it’s not the only macro factor influencing the outlook for Bitcoin. Mena also cited broader improvements in macroeconomic clarity as contributing to a more positive sentiment. This clarity reduces uncertainty for investors and institutions, making them more comfortable allocating capital to the digital asset space. The potential for central banks globally to shift towards more accommodative monetary policies further supports this trend, suggesting an environment where risk assets could thrive. The Rise of Institutional Adoption A key driver Mena expects to accelerate capital inflows is the continued rise in institutional adoption . We’ve already seen significant steps in this area, particularly with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Mena anticipates this trend will only strengthen, with: Increased participation from traditional financial institutions. Growing interest from corporate treasuries looking to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Continued rollout of state-level Bitcoin reserve programs within the U.S. These developments represent substantial new sources of demand for Bitcoin, which Mena believes will significantly boost ETF inflows in the coming months. Higher ETF inflows directly translate to more BTC being bought and held, reducing supply on exchanges and potentially driving the Bitcoin price higher. Putting It All Together: A Bullish Case for Bitcoin The confluence of cooling US inflation , improving macroeconomic clarity, the potential for policy easing, and accelerating institutional adoption paints a decidedly bullish picture for the crypto market , specifically for Bitcoin. While volatility is always a factor, the foundational elements for a significant rally appear to be falling into place. Investors are keenly watching economic indicators and capital flows, as these macro factors are expected to play a crucial role in determining whether Bitcoin can reach the ambitious targets outlined by strategists like Matt Mena. Summary: Navigating the Path Ahead In summary, the recent dip in US inflation is viewed by strategists at 21Shares as a potential green light for a substantial Bitcoin price rally. Coupled with growing institutional adoption and a clearer macroeconomic picture, the conditions are becoming increasingly ripe for Bitcoin to test new highs. While the path may not be linear, the underlying macro factors appear to be aligning in favor of the digital asset, suggesting exciting times potentially lie ahead for the crypto market .

Speaking at the 2025 XRPL Apex event in Singapore, Garlinghouse suggested that the XRP Ledger could, within the next five years, handle 14% of the transaction volume currently processed by the SWIFT financial network. Ripple CEO’s Projection: XRP Ledger vs SWIFT During the panel, a journalist asked Garlinghouse and Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, how much of SWIFT’s global transaction volume the XRPL could realistically support by 2030. Garlinghouse responded by clarifying that SWIFT operates primarily as a messaging system, and that XRP’s relevance lies in its capacity to provide on-demand liquidity. Garlinghouse projected that the XRPL could eventually facilitate 14% of SWIFT’s liquidity-based transaction volume. While SWIFT is commonly cited as moving $5 trillion daily, this figure refers to message traffic rather than the value of settled transactions. A more conservative figure published by Forbes in 2023 estimates that SWIFT’s actual annual transaction volume is closer to $150 trillion. Applying Garlinghouse’s 14% estimate to that figure, the XRPL would process approximately $21 trillion annually. Impact of $21 Trillion On XRP Price To understand how this level of volume could affect XRP’s price, we asked ChatGPT from OpenAI to analyze the numbers based on current market metrics. At the time of the projection, XRP was priced at $2.24, with a circulating supply of 58.81 billion tokens. This resulted in a market capitalization of roughly $131.9 billion. If the total supply of 100 billion XRP is considered, the fully diluted valuation would be around $224 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP is designed for high-frequency transactions and is not significantly burned during use, which means it is recycled across multiple transactions. Therefore, its market value is shaped more by how often it circulates and how much liquidity is required to support transaction flow rather than by scarcity. If each XRP token were to turnover 30 times per year, roughly once every 12 days, supporting $21 trillion in volume would require a liquidity base of about $700 billion. To meet this requirement with the current token supply, each XRP would need to be valued at approximately $11.90. Additional Market Factors Could Raise Valuation Beyond its utility, other dynamics can influence XRP’s price, including institutional adoption and investor sentiment. Should speculative interest raise the token’s market cap to 1.5 times the required liquidity level, the token’s price could rise to around $17.85. If the market valuation were to double the base liquidity estimate, the price per XRP could reach approximately $23.81. It’s important to note that these projections rest on several conditions. XRP must remain the core asset for transactions on the XRPL, and the estimated turnover rate of 30 times per year must be maintained. If tokens circulate more frequently, the liquidity pool needed would decrease, potentially altering the price outlook. If Ripple’s forecast holds and XRPL becomes a major player in global liquidity, XRP could experience significant appreciation , with its value potentially rising to double digits.

Per the insiders, the Singapore-based entity will initiate its application for a stablecoin issuer’s license in Hong Kong as early as August, once the city’s forthcoming Stablecoins Ordinance comes into effect. “ We plan to apply for the fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS) issuer’s license once the process is open after the Stablecoins Ordinance takes effect on August 1 ,” a spokesperson for Ant International told Reuters. Ant International seeks approval for cross-border financial services Ant International is seemingly applying for the licenses to fortify its blockchain-based financial infrastructure for cross-border payments and treasury management services. In 2023 alone, Ant processed over $1 trillion in global transactions. One-third of that volume was facilitated by the company’s Whale platform, a blockchain-based system that optimizes international fund flows. The Whale platform is part of the company’s financial services backbone. It has features like homomorphic encryption, artificial intelligence, multiparty verification, and supports several tokenized assets issued by banks and institutions globally. The company’s blockchain expansion is a pivot from its previously dominant lending business in China, which came under tighter regulatory control following the abrupt halt of Ant Group’s record-breaking IPO in 2020. The company has already signed collaboration agreements with over 10 global banks, including major players such as HSBC Holdings Plc, BNP Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Standard Chartered Plc. Just this week, it added Deutsche Bank AG to its list of partners to co-develop payment solutions and treasury services. IPO and stablecoin regulation Since the suspension of its IPO, Ant Group has been looking for new market growth initiatives. Regulatory crackdowns in China halted its once-profitable online lending operations under two platforms, Huabei and Jiebei. In January 2022, Chinese regulators imposed stricter rules on online lending, requiring internet platforms and banks to contribute at least 30% of the funding for loans issued jointly. Before the new mandate, Ant Group’s micro-lending arms, Jiebei and Huabei, typically provided just 1% to 2% of the capital for such loans, according to research firm Financial Regulation & Law. According to a Bloomberg report in May, Ant posted nearly $3 billion in revenue for 2024 and has delivered two straight years of adjusted profitability. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence estimate that if the company were to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, it could command a valuation ranging between $8 billion and $24 billion. Companies flock to stablecoin development and issuance Ant International is among several major tech firms trying to enter the stablecoin market . Meta Platforms Inc., once attempted to launch its own stablecoin project in 2019, only to abandon the plan following backlash from US lawmakers and central bank. In parallel, traditional asset managers have begun issuing tokenized investment products that are similar to stablecoins for use in collateralized trading. Firms like BlackRock Inc. and Franklin Templeton have introduced tokenized money market funds. On Tuesday, France’s Societe Generale announced plans to launch a publicly tradable, dollar-backed stablecoin through its digital asset unit, SG-FORGE. The new token, called “USD CoinVertible,” will be issued on Ethereum and Solana blockchains, with trading set to begin in July, according to a company statement . SG-FORGE added that the stablecoin will be classified as an e-money token and regulated under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) framework, which came into effect in 2023.

After peaking at $0.007222 in late September 2024, the token has lost over 85% of its value, reaching a new all-time low of $0.001046 on June 12, 2025. Despite earlier signs of resilience, recent events have triggered an aggressive sell-off, leaving both retail and institutional investors scrambling to reassess their positions. Currently priced at $0.001062, the token is down nearly 20% in the last 24 hours, continuing a brutal decline that has erased nearly 60% of its value in the past month alone. Hamster Kombat price chart |Source: CoinMarketCap To make matters worse, the market cap now hovers around $68.5 million, with a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $160 million — a sign of panic rather than healthy liquidity. The crash began with the HMSTR airdrop The most severe damage came when the HMSTR team unveiled that only 88.75% of the much-anticipated airdropped tokens would be immediately available, while the remaining portion would be vested over a ten-month period. This announcement triggered widespread outrage among users who had been eagerly waiting to cash out their free tokens. As a result, the token crashed by nearly 27% in a single day, as millions rushed to sell before prices dropped further. That one revelation not only fractured user trust but also intensified liquidity stress as sell orders flooded the books faster than buyers could absorb them. In addition, ahead of the airdrop, the Hamster Kombat team had disabled 2.3 million accounts for suspected cheating. Hamster Kombat user engagement has collapsed dramatically Following the airdrop debacle, Hamster Kombat, which once boasted over 300 million players engaging with its gamified mechanics, has seen its active user base fall sharply to just 13.1 million. This mass exodus has hurt both perception and demand, making it harder for the project to sustain upward momentum or generate organic growth. Without a steady inflow of new users or returning participants, any attempts to stabilise HMSTR’s price face immediate headwinds. Top wallets are offloading HMSTR tokens at scale Adding to the woes, several large wallets—believed to belong to insiders or early investors—have been dumping massive amounts of HMSTR into the market. This aggressive unloading has raised questions about the long-term viability of the token, as concentrated supply in just 37 wallets poses systemic risks to price stability. Whales currently control over 87% of the token’s total supply, giving them outsized influence over every price movement and eroding confidence among smaller holders. Scam fears are growing across the community In parallel, a wave of phishing scams — most notably the rise of copycat tokens like “Hamster Cash” — has ignited fears that the entire ecosystem may be compromised. These clones have taken advantage of the chaos to target unsuspecting users, further damaging trust in Hamster Kombat’s brand integrity. Until the team addresses these security concerns, users may remain reluctant to re-engage with the platform or reinvest in HMSTR. Technical indicators signal a continuation of the bearish trend From a technical analysis standpoint, HMSTR’s daily setup offers little optimism for a quick turnaround. The token has broken below its 9-day simple moving average, and its Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) recently flashed a bearish crossover, reinforcing the existing downtrend. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to an extremely oversold level of 14.64, signalling that sentiment is deeply negative. Although such readings typically hint at a possible bounce, the lack of strong buying pressure suggests this time could be different. To reverse the current trajectory, the project would need to roll out a bold marketing campaign, secure additional exchange listings, and possibly reconsider its vesting structure. Unless confidence is rebuilt through meaningful actions and transparent communication, Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) risks slipping deeper into obscurity.

A $100 investment could have morphed into millions by today. That window may be closed, but crypto experts now whisper about a similar generational opportunity: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Currently in presale at just $7, analysts believe its unique fusion of Bitcoin’s security with next-gen scalability could ignite returns reminiscent of Bitcoin’s legendary 10,000% ascent. With its presale rocketing past $4.1 million and over 11,000 users seizing early positions, the momentum is undeniable. Could this be your second chance at crypto history? Beyond Bitcoin: The Foundation for Exponential Growth Bitcoin revolutionized finance, proving digital scarcity and decentralized value. Yet, its limitations – slow transactions, high energy costs, and limited programmability – created room for evolution. Enter Bitcoin Solaris. It doesn’t replace Bitcoin; it builds upon its legacy with a revolutionary dual-layer architecture designed for the modern world. This isn’t just another altcoin; it’s engineered to solve the bottlenecks holding back mass adoption and user wealth creation. The Engine Room: How BTC-S Outpaces the Past Bitcoin Solaris’s power lies under the hood. It’s a groundbreaking hybrid consensus mechanism that merges the ironclad security of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) base layer with the blazing speed and efficiency of a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Solaris Layer. Base Layer (PoW): Utilizes battle-tested SHA-256, compatible with existing Bitcoin mining hardware, ensuring robust security and decentralization. Blocks settle every 5 minutes, anchoring the network. Solaris Layer (DPoS): Where the magic happens. 21 elected validators process transactions with 2-second finality, enabling over 100,000 TPS – dwarfing traditional blockchains. Validators rotate daily, and malicious actors face slashing, maintaining integrity. Cross-Layer Synergy: Critical state updates and validator sets are immutably logged on the secure Base Layer, creating a trustless bridge between security and speed. This architecture delivers enterprise-grade scalability (100,000+ TPS) alongside Bitcoin-grade security, enabling complex applications previously impossible on legacy chains. Your Path to Wealth: Mining, Staking & The Presale Advantage Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just tech; it’s a wealth-generation platform accessible to everyone. Forget expensive mining rigs and soaring electricity bills: Democratized Mobile Mining: The upcoming Solaris Nova app promises to turn any smartphone into a potential mining device, leveraging the Solaris Layer’s efficiency. Earn BTC-S simply by participating. Powerful Staking Rewards: Holders earn substantial yields (20% of all block rewards) by staking BTC-S. Dynamic APY and compound rewards incentivize long-term participation, growing your holdings passively. The $7 Presale Opportunity With a current presale price of $7 and a planned launch at $20, early entry offers a potential 233% gain at launch. Add the 9% bonus and long-term growth potential, and the 10,000% analogy starts to make sense. Phase 7 is ending soon, with the price rising to $8, and only about seven weeks remain before the July 31, 2025, launch. Over $4.1 million has been raised and 11,000+ users have already secured their positions, recognizing this as one of the market’s fastest and most explosive presale opportunities. The Fastest-Growing Crypto of 2025? Explore BTC-S Now Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: Mining Evolution Feature Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin Solaris Mining Accessibility Specialized ASICs Only Smartphone (Solaris Nova) Energy Consumption Extremely High Highly Efficient Barrier to Entry Very High (Cost/Tech) Very Low Primary Reward Block Rewards Block Rewards + Staking Potential ROI Mature, Lower Growth Early Stage, High Growth Why Crypto Insiders Are Buzzing: Performance Meets Potential The hype isn’t baseless. Bitcoin Solaris tackles crypto’s trilemma – security, scalability, decentralization – head-on. Its Solana-inspired smart contracts (built in Rust) unlock a vast ecosystem: DeFi protocols handle lending, borrowing, and high-speed DEXs. Enterprise solutions for supply chains and digital identity. Thriving NFT markets and play-to-earn gaming with negligible fees. Real-world applications in IoT, healthcare, and governance (DAOs). Coupled with its staggering throughput and mobile-first approach, this positions Bitcoin Solaris for mass adoption. Influencers and deep-dive analysts are taking notice. Detailed reviews breaking down its unique value proposition are emerging from voices like 2Bit Crypto and Ben Crypto , further validating the project’s potential to reshape the landscape. Security You Can Trust: Audits and Transparency Building a foundation for massive growth requires unshakeable security. Bitcoin Solaris prioritizes this with: Resistance to 51% attacks via its robust PoW base layer. Byzantine Fault Tolerance on the Solaris Layer. Mitigations against long-range attacks. Optional Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy. Its commitment is proven: comprehensive audits by leading firms Cyberscope and Freshcoins provide independent verification of the protocol’s resilience. Transparency is further ensured through public dashboards and open-source tracking of rewards and network operations. The Final Verdict: A Unique Moment in Crypto Early Bitcoin investors saw life-changing gains by recognizing its potential early. Bitcoin Solaris presents a similar opportunity but with solutions to Bitcoin’s limitations. Its hybrid consensus ensures unmatched speed and efficiency, while mobile mining and staking create new ways for users to build wealth. With a presale price of $7 ahead of its July 31st launch at $20, it offers a structured entry point for early adopters. With over $4.1 million raised and 11,000+ users onboarded, Phase 7 is closing fast, making early access increasingly limited. While history never repeats exactly, the potential for extraordinary growth with Bitcoin Solaris is undeniable.

As one of the nation’s leading platforms, Upbit plays a crucial role in shaping user experience and compliance standards. A significant recent announcement from Upbit is set to impact many traders and investors: the addition of BingX to its list of approved virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Upbit Adds BingX: A Key Development for South Korea Crypto Users In a move welcomed by users seeking greater interoperability and compliance assurance, South Korean crypto exchange giant Upbit officially announced the integration of BingX as a supported platform for deposits and withdrawals. This means users can now transfer digital assets between their Upbit and BingX accounts, provided the transaction meets certain regulatory criteria. The core of this integration lies in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule . This international standard requires VASPs like Upbit and BingX to share certain information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers above a specific threshold. By adding BingX to its approved list, Upbit is facilitating these compliant transfers, specifically for transactions valued at 1 million KRW (approximately $737.13 USD at the time of the original announcement) or more. This development is particularly significant for the South Korea crypto market, known for its strict regulatory environment. It signals a growing trend of exchanges working together to create a more compliant and interconnected ecosystem, while still adhering to necessary anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Understanding the Travel Rule and VASP Compliance The Travel Rule , introduced by the FATF, aims to bring greater transparency to cryptocurrency transactions, similar to how traditional financial institutions handle wire transfers. For crypto exchange platforms operating in regulated markets like South Korea, compliance is mandatory. What is the Travel Rule? It requires VASPs to obtain and transmit specific information about the parties involved in a crypto transaction. This information typically includes the sender’s and receiver’s names and account numbers (or wallet addresses). The rule applies to transactions exceeding a de minimis threshold, which in South Korea is set at 1 million KRW. Becoming a Travel Rule -compliant VASP, as BingX has done in the eyes of Upbit , involves implementing robust systems and procedures to collect, verify, and securely transmit this required information. This often involves integrating with specific Travel Rule compliance solutions. For users in the South Korea crypto space, this compliance is a double-edged sword. While it adds layers of verification, it also enhances the legitimacy and security of transfers between compliant platforms, reducing risks associated with non-compliant or illicit activities. Benefits for Upbit and BingX Users The integration between Upbit and BingX offers several tangible benefits for users of both platforms, particularly those based in or transacting with South Korea: Seamless Large Transfers: The primary benefit is the ability to make compliant deposits and withdrawals exceeding the 1 million KRW threshold between the two exchanges without facing immediate holds or rejections specifically due to Travel Rule non-compliance between these two entities. Enhanced Compliance Assurance: Knowing that both platforms are recognized as compliant VASPs by each other provides users with greater confidence that their transactions adhere to South Korean regulations. Increased Interoperability: As more exchanges become interoperable under Travel Rule frameworks, the overall crypto ecosystem becomes more connected and user-friendly for compliant participants. Access to BingX Offerings: For Upbit users interested in features or assets available on BingX but not on Upbit (or vice versa), this integration simplifies the process of moving funds between the platforms legally and compliantly. This move is a positive step towards creating a more regulated yet functional environment for crypto exchange users in the region. Navigating Transfers: What Crypto Exchange Users Need to Know While the integration simplifies large transfers, users should still be aware of the process and potential requirements when moving assets between Upbit and BingX : Key Considerations: Verification: Ensure your accounts on both Upbit and BingX are fully verified according to their respective Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This is foundational for Travel Rule compliance. Information Sharing: Be aware that for transactions over 1 million KRW, information about you (as the sender or receiver) will be shared between the two exchanges as required by the Travel Rule . Supported Assets: Check which specific cryptocurrencies are supported for direct VASP-to-VASP transfers between Upbit and BingX . Not all assets listed on both platforms may be enabled for compliant transfers immediately. Transaction Details: Always double-check recipient addresses and required memo/tag information before initiating a withdrawal. Errors can lead to lost funds. Platform Procedures: Familiarize yourself with the specific withdrawal and deposit interfaces and procedures on both Upbit and BingX , as they may differ slightly. Understanding these points will help ensure smooth and compliant transfers, allowing users to leverage the benefits of this new integration effectively within the South Korea crypto landscape. The Broader Impact on the South Korea Crypto Market The inclusion of BingX on Upbit ‘s list of compliant VASPs is more than just a technical integration; it reflects the maturing regulatory environment in South Korea crypto . It sets a precedent and encourages other international exchanges that wish to interact with the highly active South Korean market to prioritize Travel Rule compliance. This trend towards increased VASP interoperability under regulatory frameworks suggests a future where compliant cross-exchange transfers become standard, potentially reducing reliance on peer-to-peer (P2P) methods or multiple conversion steps for large transactions between regulated platforms. It reinforces South Korea’s position as a market focused on regulatory adherence and investor protection. While the immediate impact is on users of Upbit and BingX , the long-term effect could be a more interconnected yet securely regulated global network of crypto exchange platforms, starting with key markets like South Korea. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Compliant Crypto Transfers The addition of BingX as a supported Travel Rule -compliant VASP by Upbit is a significant development for the South Korea crypto market. It directly benefits users by enabling seamless and compliant transfers of 1 million KRW or more between these two major platforms. This move underscores the importance of the Travel Rule in today’s regulatory landscape and highlights the ongoing efforts by leading crypto exchange platforms like Upbit and BingX to adapt and thrive within these frameworks. As the industry continues to mature, such integrations are crucial steps towards building a more secure, transparent, and interconnected global digital asset ecosystem.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value traded as high as $2,450 in 2023, and had dropped to as low as $1,472 in April before rebounding to trade as high as $2,873 this week, CoinDesk data show. The hacker made a $9.37 million in profit on their transaction, EmberCN said. Debank data shows that all of the stolen funds are now being dispersed through Tornado Cash. It is unclear whether the hacker was a part of a larger group or working solo.

Binance Alpha , a dedicated space within the expansive Binance Wallet ecosystem designed specifically to shine a light on promising early crypto projects , has officially added Pundi AI (PUNDIAI) to its showcase. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Think of Binance Alpha as a curated gallery for digital assets that are still in their foundational stages. It’s not the main Binance exchange with its massive trading volumes and established tokens. Instead, it’s a platform integrated into the Binance Wallet experience, offering users a glimpse into projects that are generating buzz and showing potential within the crypto community. The primary goal is to provide visibility to these nascent projects and give curious users an opportunity to learn about them before they potentially gain wider recognition. For project teams, being featured on Binance Alpha offers valuable exposure to a vast audience connected through the Binance ecosystem. Key aspects of Binance Alpha : Part of the broader Binance Wallet infrastructure. Focuses exclusively on early crypto projects . Acts as a discovery platform, not a trading exchange. Highlights projects based on specific criteria. Introducing Pundi AI : What Does This Early Crypto Project Offer? The latest addition to the Binance Alpha lineup is Pundi AI , represented by the token PUNDIAI. While the specifics of every project featured on Alpha vary, the inclusion suggests that Pundi AI has met Binance Alpha’s criteria for emerging interest and community engagement. As the name suggests, Pundi AI likely operates at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. This is a rapidly growing area within the crypto space, with projects exploring how AI can enhance decentralized applications, improve trading strategies, automate processes, or even create new forms of digital content and interaction. Being recognized by a platform like Binance Alpha is a notable step for Pundi AI , indicating that it has garnered sufficient attention and appears to have a development path that resonates with current market trends, particularly the surging interest in AI-related crypto initiatives. How Does Binance Wallet Fit In? Understanding the Ecosystem. It’s important to understand that Binance Alpha isn’t a standalone website or app. It’s integrated within the Binance Wallet , which is the official crypto wallet provided by Binance. This integration is strategic. By placing the Alpha platform inside the wallet, Binance makes it convenient for users who are already managing their digital assets to discover new projects. It creates a seamless experience where exploration and potential future interaction (like holding or using the token, should they choose to) are linked within a single interface. This connection to Binance Wallet provides Binance Alpha with a direct pipeline to a large user base, enhancing the visibility offered to the featured early crypto projects like Pundi AI . Beyond the Hype: What Does This Mean for a Potential Crypto Listing ? Now, here’s where clarity is absolutely crucial. As the official announcement explicitly stated and as is standard practice for Binance Alpha , inclusion on the Alpha platform DOES NOT guarantee a future crypto listing on the main Binance exchange . This is a vital distinction for anyone looking at Pundi AI or any other project featured on Alpha. While being showcased certainly provides exposure and validation of sorts (as it met the platform’s selection criteria), it is not a pre-listing announcement or an endorsement of the project’s long-term success or safety. Think of it as being featured in a tech incubator showcase – it’s a sign of potential and progress, but not a guarantee of becoming the next tech giant or securing a major public offering (which a main exchange crypto listing would be akin to). Actionable Insights: Navigating Early Crypto Projects on Binance Alpha. For users interested in exploring projects like Pundi AI on Binance Alpha , here are some actionable insights: Use Binance Wallet: Access Binance Alpha directly through your official Binance Wallet app to view the featured projects. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Inclusion is just the first step. Dive deep into the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, tokenomics, and community before making any decisions. Understand the Risks: Early crypto projects are inherently high-risk. They are often volatile, may fail, or may not achieve their goals. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Look at the Criteria: Remember Binance Alpha selects based on community engagement and market trends. This indicates popularity and relevance, but not necessarily fundamental strength or guaranteed future performance or a crypto listing . Stay Updated: Follow official announcements from both the project (like Pundi AI ) and Binance for the most accurate information. Being featured on Binance Alpha is a positive development for Pundi AI in terms of visibility within the Binance ecosystem. It signals that the project has achieved a level of community interest and aligns with current market narratives like AI, making it noteworthy among early crypto projects . However, it is crucial for users to approach this information with a balanced perspective, recognizing that this is a discovery platform within Binance Wallet for nascent projects and explicitly not a guarantee of a future crypto listing on the main Binance exchange. As always, thorough research and understanding the risks are paramount when exploring the exciting yet volatile world of early-stage cryptocurrencies.

After a successful retest of a keg buy zone, technical indicators suggest that XRP is preparing for a powerful move toward the $3.7 level soon. Falling Wedge Setup Signal XRP Price Breakout XRP is currently entering what Robert Mercer, a TradingView crypto analyst, describes as the perfect breakout setup following a prolonged period of consolidation. This technical structure suggests that XRP could potentially experience a sharp rally from its current price of $2.25 to the $3.70 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Remains Bullish Above $2, This Falling Channel Says $3.8 Is Coming Notably, on the 2-day XRP price chart, Mercer noted that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within a Falling Wedge pattern since late December 2024. Since establishing a local bottom at $2.11 in the same timeframe, the altcoin has repeatedly tested this bottom level without breaking below it in a sustained manner. The $2.11 price zone has also acted as a reliable horizontal support level throughout the six-month Falling Wedge formation. Meanwhile, XRP’s price action has been gradually compressing within the wedge pattern, indicating reduced volatility and increasing pressure near the wedge apex. Looking at the TradingView analyst’s chart, it appears that XRP is now approaching the Falling Wedge resistance at the upper boundary, which coincides with the $2.45 level, where a buy retest has occurred. This convergence is viewed as a potential confirmation zone. If buying momentum continues and XRP closes decisively above $2.45, the breakout would confirm the end of the Falling Wedge and potentially initiate the cryptocurrency’s next upward move. Mercer highlights that XRP’s current bullish structure is a simple yet perfect setup. And based on this setup, price targets above the wedge are projected in several stages, with $2.98, $3.36 and $3.71 serving as resistance levels based on historical price action and technical extensions. If the breakout holds and buying interest persists, the TradingView expert predicts that XRP may reach the $3.5 – $4 region over the next three to five months, aligning with past performances following similar wedge breakouts in the market. $1.40 Breakdown Still In Play If Resistance Fails While XRP’s current structure supports a bullish outlook, Mercer‘s price chart shows that a failed breakout remains a possibility. If XRP is rejected again at the $2.45 resistance level, it could resume its consolidation within the Falling Wedge pattern. This would place downward pressure on the price and may lead to a retest of lower support zones. Related Reading: Why A Sweep At $2 Is Important For XRP Price To Continue Rallying The most critical support level in this bearish scenario is located around $1.4. While this price level has not been tested directly in recent months, it marks the lower boundary of the Falling Wedge pattern. A breakdown below this level could invalidate the XRP’s wedge and bullish setup. It may also indicate a possible shift in market structure from consolidation to bearish continuation, which could result in further downside.

This follows a pivotal phone conversation between President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. The terms of the trade agreement stated that both countries should stick to the agreement. Following the terms, China emphasized that it always honors its commitments . This represents a fragile truce in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The US and China close new ‘groundbreaking deal’ On Wednesday, June 10, Trump expressed his satisfaction with the trade deal. He stated on Truth Social, “Our deal with China is completed, pending final approval from President Xi and me.” The deal is that China will supply the US with full magnets and any needed rare earth materials upfront. In return, the US will provide what they agreed upon, including allowing Chinese students to attend their colleges and universities, which Trump claimed he has always supported. Trump also revealed they are implementing 55% tariffs, while China is getting 10%. Following the trade agreement, during a regular news briefing, Lin Jian, t he deputy director of the information department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, highlighted that the nation has consistently honored its commitments and produced positive outcomes. Therefore, according to him, now that an agreement has been made, both parties should stick to it. The phone call between Trump and Xi ended a standoff that had emerged only weeks after they reached an initial agreement in Geneva. Another round of discussions in London quickly followed, and Washington said the talks had added “meat on the bones” to the Geneva agreement to reduce bilateral retaliatory tariffs. The Geneva agreement stumbled because China reportedly continued to limit its mineral exports. In response, the Trump administration imposed export controls that stopped shipments of semiconductor design software, jet engines for Chinese aircraft, and other products to China. However, the details of this new agreement and how it will be implemented remain unclear. Trade truce raises new risks and leaves core issues unresolved The tentative agreement between the United States and China might suggest a step back from the worst-case scenario of a complete trade breakdown between the two largest economies in the world. However, it seems to create more issues than it resolves. What has been shared by people with knowledge of the agreement indicates that this deal may harm both economies and not address critical problems, such as China’s control over the rare earth supply chain. Regarding the trade agreement, Trump cited rare earths specifically, noting that China will supply these metals, which are essential for many electronics and vehicles, “up front.” However, the agreement does not really tackle the primary issues faced by rare earth and other processed metals, such as lithium and cobalt, which Chinese companies dominate. The US plans to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will respond with a 10% tariff on US goods, a sharp rise from the 25% rate in place when Trump returned to office in January. Such high tariffs could reduce trade, raise inflation in the United States, and slow economic growth in both nations. If Beijing, instead, decided to keep the 10% tariff on US energy imports in place, it would probably block almost all US crude oil, coal, and liquefied natural gas from heading into China. This would remove one of the few items the nation can purchase in significant quantities from the US. It is also unclear whether these taxes will result in more manufacturing in the US or push some production from China to countries with lower import taxes. Therefore, it is worth noting that even at its best, this week’s deal is a temporary fix . It averted an immediate crisis for US manufacturing. Still, it left the door open for Beijing to dangle a threat of supply cutoff at the United States if there were other problems between the countries down the road.

The Singapore-based firm plans to acquire XRP ( XRP ) tokens as long-term reserves, use them in staking strategies to earn yield, and deepen engagement in the Ripple ecosystem. Trident also named Chaince Securities LLC as its strategic advisor for the effort. The initiative would be funded through equity issuance, structured financing, and strategic placements, the company said. Discussions are reportedly underway with crypto foundations and institutional partners to secure favorable acquisition terms for XRP and related infrastructure. While Trident positioned the move as a step toward pioneering blockchain-native corporate finance, so far, the investor response has been negative.

This means people can now use USDC on XRPL directly, without needing to bridge it from another blockchain. So, what does this mean, and why should you care? No More Bridging — Just Fast, Easy Access With USDC now working natively on the XRPL mainnet, users don’t need to go through complicated bridging processes anymore. That means faster access, lower risk, and a much smoother experience for anyone using USDC on the XRP Ledger. Circle, the company behind USDC, confirmed that both Circle Mint and Circle APIs now fully support USDC on XRPL. This makes it much easier for developers and businesses to tap into USDC liquidity and take advantage of XRPL’s fast and secure infrastructure. How This Changes the Game This launch opens the door for all kinds of real-world use cases: Global Payments : Businesses can now use USDC to send money across borders quickly and more efficiently. DeFi Liquidity : Market makers can use USDC to bring liquidity to token pairs and currency exchanges on XRPL. Fintech Apps : Wallets, custodians, and financial platforms can now integrate USDC directly on XRPL, offering faster and more transparent settlements. Bigger Ecosystem for USDC This move also marks an important milestone for USDC’s expansion. With XRPL added to the list, USDC is now available on 22 different blockchains. That’s a big step toward making stable digital dollars more accessible and useful around the world. USDC on XRPL brings together two powerful forces, the stability of a trusted digital dollar and the speed of XRP Ledger. Whether you’re building apps, sending money, or just exploring crypto, this is a step toward a faster, more open financial future.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 14:07:54

However, although the SEC has evaluated the applications made so far, it has not made a final decision by delaying it. At this point, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the summer months could be the altcoin ETF approval season. Balchunas also argued that Solana could be the first altcoin to receive approval. “Get ready for an Altcoin ETF Summer, likely led by Solana (and some basket products),” the Bloomberg analyst wrote. Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Explains: ""Get Ready for the Altcoin ETF Summer! This Altcoin Will Be the First to Get Approval!"" At this point, while the market continues to grow anticipation for SOL, ETF Store President Nate Geraci stated that Grayscale’s multi-asset fund containing XRP and Cardano (ADA) could receive approval before any Solana ETF. Nate Geraci shared on his X account that he believes the Grayscale Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund could receive approval before the Solana ETFs pending at the US SEC. Geraci said that “it’s pretty clear where this is all going,” pointing specifically to XRP and Cardano. Grayscale’s GLDC fund is a basket consisting of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Notably, the fund includes all five cryptocurrencies listed for inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, while the fund is only available to accredited investors. According to Bloomberg Intelligence data, the probability of approval for the Solana ETF is set at 90%, for Litecoin 90% and for XRP 85%. Dogecoin follows with an 80% probability, while other altcoin ETFs such as Cardano, Hedera (HBAR) and Avalanche (AVAX) are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. Sounds like this may be first in line for approval before spot sol ETFs… Includes XRP & Cardano.

Ant Group, the fintech powerhouse linked to Alibaba, is reportedly setting its sights on the rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes of Hong Kong and Singapore. This isn’t just any move; sources familiar with the matter, as reported by Bloomberg, indicate that Ant Group is planning to apply for stablecoin licenses in these key Asian financial hubs. This potential step by Ant Group into the regulated stablecoin space could signal a significant shift in how major tech players view and engage with the crypto asset class, particularly regarding stablecoins. What’s Driving Ant Group’s Stablecoin Push? The decision by Ant Group to explore Ant Group stablecoin initiatives is noteworthy. It suggests a strategic pivot towards areas where regulatory clarity is emerging. Why stablecoins? Stablecoins, pegged to traditional assets like fiat currencies, offer the potential for efficient digital payments and transfers while mitigating the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. For a company like Ant Group, with deep roots in payments and financial services through Alipay, leveraging stablecoin technology under a regulated framework could unlock new opportunities in cross-border transactions, digital asset services, and potentially even decentralized finance (DeFi) within controlled environments. Several factors might be influencing this move: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Both Hong Kong and Singapore are actively working on regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, aiming to provide legal certainty and consumer protection. Global Expansion: While Ant Group faced regulatory challenges domestically, focusing on international markets with clear rules allows them to innovate and grow. Payment Innovation: Stablecoins offer potential improvements for payment systems, including speed, cost, and accessibility, aligning with Ant Group’s core business. Market Demand: There is growing interest in regulated digital assets from both institutional and retail users in Asia and globally. Navigating the Waters: Hong Kong Stablecoin License Landscape Hong Kong has been proactive in establishing itself as a digital asset hub. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have been developing frameworks to regulate virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and stablecoins. The prospect of obtaining a Hong Kong stablecoin license involves meeting stringent requirements designed to ensure stability, investor protection, and anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) compliance. Hong Kong is building a robust framework for digital assets. Risk-Based Regulation: The framework considers the specific risks associated with different types of stablecoins, particularly those pegged to fiat currencies. Licensing Requirements: Entities issuing or facilitating the trading of stablecoins may need specific licenses, adhering to capital requirements, governance standards, and risk management protocols. Alignment with International Standards: Hong Kong aims to align its regulations with global standards set by bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB). For Ant Group, securing a license here would not only legitimize their stablecoin operations but also provide access to Hong Kong’s well-established financial infrastructure and international connectivity. Singapore’s Approach to Stablecoin Regulation Singapore, another major financial center in Asia, is also forging ahead with its digital asset regulations. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has outlined its proposed framework for stablecoins, focusing on single-currency pegged stablecoins (SCS) issued in Singapore that meet specific requirements. The aim is to ensure that stablecoins used as a medium of exchange are reliable and stable. Key features of the proposed Singapore stablecoin regulation include: Regulatory Framework for SCS: Specific rules for stablecoins pegged to the Singapore Dollar or other G10 currencies, issued in Singapore. Reserve Requirements: Issuers must hold reserves that are at least equal to the value of the stablecoins in circulation, held in high-quality, low-risk assets. Prudential Standards: Requirements around capital, governance, and risk management. Disclosure: Mandates for clear disclosure of information to users. Applying for a license in Singapore would position Ant Group within a jurisdiction known for its forward-thinking approach to fintech and its strong regulatory reputation. It would allow them to tap into the Southeast Asian market with a regulated stablecoin offering. The Bigger Picture: Stablecoin Applications and Global Impact The potential approval of Ant Group’s applications could significantly impact the adoption and variety of stablecoin applications globally. Beyond simple payments, regulated stablecoins can serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Think about instant, low-cost cross-border remittances, efficient settlement for securities trading, or even powering innovative financial products and services built on blockchain technology. Potential applications include: Application Area How Stablecoins Can Help Cross-Border Payments Faster, cheaper, and more transparent international money transfers. Digital Asset Trading Easy on/off ramps for trading cryptocurrencies without relying solely on volatile assets. Tokenized Assets Facilitating the buying and selling of tokenized real-world assets like real estate or stocks. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Providing stable value within DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, and yield farming (though regulation here is complex). Supply Chain Finance Streamlining payments and financing within complex supply chains. A major player like Ant Group entering this space with regulated offerings could accelerate mainstream adoption and build confidence among businesses and consumers who have been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty or volatility. China Tech’s Evolving Role in Crypto This move by Ant Group is also significant in the context of China tech crypto engagement. While mainland China has taken a strict stance against cryptocurrencies, its major tech companies are exploring blockchain technology and digital assets in international markets where regulations are more permissive. Ant Group’s focus on regulated stablecoins in Hong Kong and Singapore demonstrates a strategy to participate in the digital asset economy outside of mainland restrictions. This contrasts with the mainland’s focus on the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Ant Group’s stablecoin plans in other jurisdictions suggest they see a distinct, potentially complementary, role for privately issued, regulated stablecoins in the global financial ecosystem. What Does This Mean for the Future? Ant Group’s reported plans are a strong indicator that major global fintech companies see a future in regulated digital assets. If successful, their entry into the stablecoin market in Hong Kong and Singapore could: Increase Competition: Challenge existing stablecoin issuers and potentially lead to more innovation. Boost Adoption: Bring their vast user base and technical expertise to the stablecoin space. Influence Regulation: Their experience navigating these regulatory frameworks could provide valuable insights for future policies globally. Strengthen Asia’s Role: Further solidify Hong Kong and Singapore’s positions as leading hubs for regulated digital assets. Actionable Insight: Market participants, regulators, and businesses should closely watch the progress of Ant Group’s applications. Their approach and the regulators’ responses will set precedents and offer insights into the viability of large tech firms operating regulated stablecoin services in major financial centers. Conclusion Ant Group’s reported intention to apply for stablecoin licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore marks a potentially transformative moment for both the company and the global digital asset landscape. It highlights the growing importance of regulatory clarity for the adoption of stablecoins and underscores the strategic moves major tech players are making to participate in the future of finance. As these applications progress, the industry will be watching closely to see how one of Asia’s largest fintech giants navigates the complex path towards regulated digital currencies in key international markets.

The partnership comes as authorities reveal seven suspected cases totaling more than HK$9 billion (US$1.1 billion) in recent years, according to South China Morning Post reporting . Mario Wong Ho-yin, Assistant Commissioner for Intelligence and Investigation at the Customs and Excise Department, said Thursday that the effort is part of a broader strategy to enhance cooperation with academia, the financial sector, and international law enforcement. Among 39 locally reported money laundering cases between 2021 and May 2025, seven involved virtual assets, according to SCMP. One 2024 case led to the arrest of three suspects tied to more than 1,000 suspicious transactions totaling HK$1.8 billion, with HK$760 million allegedly processed through a cryptocurrency platform. While specific details of the tool remain confidential, Wong noted that it builds on forensic technology already used by Customs to monitor online copyright violations, according to the report.

Nailwal, who launched the project in 2017 when it was still called Matic Network, will consolidate control and reorient the team toward AggLayer — Polygon’s new cross-chain liquidity protocol that promises seamless interoperability across networks.

In addition to employing researchers, builders and community liaisons, the foundation was granted a large trove of ether (ETH) tokens at Ethereum's genesis which it uses to fund its operations and support other projects in the ecosystem. In a blog post, the foundation stated it plans to annually designate 15% of its treasury to operational expenses (""opex""), with a 2.5-year buffer kept at all times in its reserves. ""We intend to reduce annual opex roughly linearly over the next five years, ending at a long-term 5% baseline,"" the foundation wrote.

The proposal for the change, which was confirmed in an update on GitHub , had sparked debate within the Bitcoin community.

Speaking in a 90-second recorded video at Coinbase's (COIN) State of Crypto Summit (no relation to the CoinDesk newsletter with the same name), Trump reiterated comments he's made at other events about ending his predecessor's so-called war on crypto and forming a working group to examine digital assets. Trump also referenced legislation working its way through Congress. ""My administration is working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act supporting the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins, and we also will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin,"" he told a filled room to scattered applause. The Senate's GENIUS Act will go through a procedural vote on Thursday, following a successful effort on Wednesday . Meanwhile, two key House committees advanced a market structure bill on Tuesday. Trump also noted his executive order on establishing a national bitcoin BTC reserve, saying, ""we created the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the United States Digital Asset stockpile,"" though neither has actually been created yet. Coinbase donated a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund, and was a major backer of the Fairshake super PAC in the 2024 election. It's already committed tens of millions of dollars to Fairshake for the 2026 election. Following his remarks, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle (CRCL) CEO Jeremy Allaire reflected on crypto and their respective company's evolutions, arguing that crypto could become a bigger part of the global financial system. Allaire, whose company went public on the New York Stock Exchange last week, said it was difficult for Circle to meet with backers or other entities a decade ago. ""It was amazing to me that, like, I'd literally walk in a room with an insurance company, [and] they were literally, like, we were not sure we're allowed to have this meeting,"" Allaire said.",Policy|Donald Trump|Coinbase|Circle|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-12 15:19:04

The HINU token recently registered its latest price increase, rising from $0.00017889 to $0.00017941. The project’s next price jump will see the token rise to $0.00017993. Husky Inu’s (HINU) Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is set to register its latest price jump, which will see the token’s value rise from $0.00017941 to $0.00017993. The project had only recently registered an increase to $0.00017889. The project has seen a surge of interest as markets rebounded, with Bitcoin (BTC) rallying past $110,000, while Ethereum (ETH) crossed $2,800 before registering a marginal decline. Interest in Husky Inu remains strong despite a decline in the broader crypto market over the past two sessions. The price jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which aims to empower the project’s fledgling yet growing community and ensure they can benefit from favorable pricing. If you remember, the token price at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000 and has steadily increased since. The token price has risen every two days and will continue until the tokens sell out. Closing In On Another Milestone The project is also closing in on another major milestone, the $800,000 mark. The burgeoning interest in Husky Inu has seen the project raise $798,320 so far. The project could reach the $800,000 mark as early as next week and remains on track to achieve its stated goal of $1.2 million. Markets Stall After Burgeoning Rally Meanwhile, the crypto market’s rally stalled, with major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, trading in bearish territory. BTC surged past $110,000 on Monday but lost momentum as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. As a result, it fell 1.42% on Wednesday and extended its losses during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. ETH also started the week on a bullish note, surging past $2,600 on Monday and $2,800 on Tuesday to settle at $2,816. However, it slipped back below $2,800 and currently trades around $2,770. Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also registered notable declines.

According to the company’s latest corporate statement, this latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin reserves to 153.4627 BTC. Japanese Fashion Brand ANAP Holdings Increases Bitcoin Reserves with New Acquisition The move reflects ANAP Holdings’ commitment to integrating digital assets into its treasury strategy and adds to the growing number of publicly traded companies in Japan and around the world turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. While ANAP is known for its trend-driven fashion collections, it has recently increased its focus on Web3 technologies and blockchain-based finance. This latest BTC purchase reflects a deepening belief in the long-term value and role of cryptocurrencies in the modern economy. The company did not disclose the purchase price or the timing of the transactions, but this addition brings ANAP’s total Bitcoin value into the millions of dollars based on current market prices. ANAP Holdings is one of the few public companies in Japan to disclose active Bitcoin investments, signaling a potential shift in corporate finance norms in the region. *This is not investment advice.

Billionaire investor Tim Draper is one such figure, convinced that Bitcoin could benefit positively from the persistent volatility recorded in the traditional finance market. In a recent post shared to X, Draper doubled down on his previous forecast for Bitcoin, with a price target of $250,000. The billionaire investor told his 268,000 followers that Bitcoin could kick off a bullish marathon this year, despite hitting a new all-time high 15 days ago. “Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows.” He wrote. Outlining the main factors responsible for “pushing Bitcoin forward” at this time, Draper pointed to renewed optimism from market participants, as President Trump works out trade deals, the incoming regulatory frameworks essential for the provision of market clarity, and the increase in Web3 applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain. He observed that traditional banks are adding to their offerings, noting that JP Morgan plans to join the race, while businesses pile in— a development he believes could bring about mainstream adoption. He went on to make the following observations; “Bitcoin is extremely low risk compared to some other cryptocurrencies and stocks because people believe in it. It’s earning the title of a store of value. Meanwhile, Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum while keeping a solid foundation. The smart money sees what comes next.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin kicked off June with an opening price of $104,637 and traded at an intraday high of $105,884. On Thursday, Bitcoin sharply declined as selling pressure intensified, resulting in a revisit to the $100,000 price mark. Down 8.12% from its all-time high of $111,970, with a 2.04% decline in market cap value, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $107,598.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Tim Draper,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-12 15:28:20

45873772,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=770303,1749742232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45873772.jpeg,Will Dogecoin Moon Or Crash? This Indicator Holds The Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/will-dogecoin-moon-or-crash-indicator-holds-answer/,"According to market technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) a single metric—the 20-month simple moving average—could be the line that could separate another vertical rally from a gut-wrenching breakdown for Dogecoin. Currently, DOGE sits comfortable above that moving average, now plotted at $0.1751. The black curve on Cat’s chart shows only three clean retests of the 20-month SMA since 2014. All Eyes On Dogecoin’s 20-Month SMA The first came in March 2017, when price tapped the average near $0.00020 and then ripped more than 9,000% into the January 2018 peak. The second occurred in the winter of 2020, with price kissing the average at roughly one-fourth of one cent before the parabolic 34,500% run to $0.73 the following May. The third and current encounter began in August last year when DOGE rallied by more than 480%. As of today, two successive monthly candles dipped into the zone just below twenty-cents, but both were bought aggressively, leaving higher wicks and preserving the upward slope of the average. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as that moving average remains intact, “we’re going higher.” A decisive monthly close beneath $0.175 would, by this read, place the entire structure at risk and could usher in the sort of multi-month down-trend that followed the 2018 and 2021 climaxes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst TOTAL2 Needs To Break Out Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) overlays that micro view on a much broader canvas. His chart tracks the total crypto market capitalization ex-Bitcoin (TradingView ticker “TOTAL2”) in monthly candles back to 2017. Two bold yellow trend-lines define a seven-year rising channel whose upper rail repelled price at the January 2018 and November 2021 alt-season tops. Since the June 2022 low, the market has carved out an ascending triangle: a rising series of higher lows presses against a flat-topped supply zone between roughly $1.43 trillion and $1.7 trillion. The apex of the triangle now looms; aggregate alt-cap is already worth about $1.2 trillion — all that stands between the current print and a confirmed breakout is a monthly close above the upper edge of that yellow rectangle. Kevin’s projection measures the height of the pattern and adds it to the breakout level, dropping a vertical marker that intersects the mid-channel near $5.89 trillion. Kevin’s first Fibonacci extensions target is the 1.618 at $4.06 trillion. Higher extensions at 1.886, 2.0 and 2.618 cluster around $4.57 trillion, 5.89 trillion and $6.9 trillion respectively, the last of which coincides almost exactly with the channel’s ceiling and is circled as the analyst’s ultimate upside objective. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Why does that matter for Dogecoin? The meme-coin’s two explosive cycles began only after TOTAL2 had broken its own prior-cycle high and money poured into non-Bitcoin assets. Kevin states that “altcoins are just scratching the surface of what is possible in the coming months,” provided that macro-liquidity and regulatory factors permit capital rotation out of Bitcoin into the wider market. In that scenario the 20-month SMA on DOGE would likely continue to slope higher, setting the stage for an explosive move higher. Conversely, failure of the alt-cap triangle would make a sustained loss of the SMA far more probable, robbing DOGE of its historical launch-pad. For now, the indicator holds—and with it the prospect that Dogecoin could be primed for yet another bout of furious upside. But as both analysts caution, the monthly close will tell the story: above the 20-month SMA and an alt-cap breakout, or below it and back into hibernation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

In the artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, AI models make noteworthy price forecasts for these assets, citing fundamental developments as key factors influencing a bullish price action. More recently, China’s artificial intelligence model DeepSeek made a bullish price prediction for a handful of alternative cryptocurrencies, including Cardano’s native token ADA. The AI model, regarded as China’s most advanced, predicts that the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap could leap to $7. According to technical indicators, the price could be attained by the end of 2025. At its current price of $0.68, a 10X price rally can be considered a bold price prediction for the altcoin. As such, prolonged bullish momentum is essential for the price prediction to come to fruition. At the time of this report, ADA is up by 0.44%, a mild hourly gain that is setting the pace for a much-needed upward correction following a sharp decline this week. ADA sustained a total of 7% in losses over the last seven days as the broader crypto market tumbled. Emerging as the 3rd highest loser this week, an increase in buying pressure could prepare the bulls for a break above the nearest resistance at $1.10, although ADA is nearing a strong support level. Like ADA, the DeepSeek AI model is making a bullish price call for XRP, with a year-end price target of $5. While doubling its press time price of $2.12 may or may not be a hurdle for XRP bulls in the long term, the altcoin is likely to face a major test around the $3 price level if the bulls can sustain momentum at the $2 support area in the near term.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-12 15:33:58

This piece delves into whether these leading cryptocurrencies signal a time to invest, offload, or maintain current holdings. Discover which of these digital assets may be poised for a breakout or further downturn. Bitcoin Market: Steady Growth with Bullish Focus at Critical Levels Bitcoin saw a steady price climb over the past month with a 5.70% gain, reflecting a calm yet positive performance. Over the last six months, a 9.85% rise demonstrated continued investor interest and an overall upward trend. Weekly price behavior, marked by a 4.08% increase, confirms resilience in the market during this period with gradual recovery evident in the price progression. Bitcoin currently trades within a price range of $94,832 to $113,326.8. Nearest resistance is located at $121,869.42, while the nearest support stands at $84,880.08. The Awesome Oscillator at 1,723.82 indicates positive energy, while the Momentum Indicator at 3,965.46 also suggests upward movement. The Relative Strength Index near 61.98 points to a moderately strong market. Bulls appear dominant, but caution exists as no clear long-term trend emerges. Tactical trades may be effective, with buying near support and selling near resistance for balanced risk and reward. Close monitoring of key signals is essential. Ethereum: Short-Term Rally Amid Mixed Half-Year Trends Past month ETH data shows a clear short-term gain, with a one-week increase of 7.61% and a monthly rise of 10.99%. Over the past six months, Ethereum experienced a decline of 28.12%, reflecting a challenging longer-term trend despite recent upward momentum. This mix of short-term recovery against a longer-term downturn highlights a market that can catch sudden lifts but remains influenced by broader bearish pressures over time. Current price action finds Ethereum trading in a range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. The nearest support is marked at $1318.72 while resistance looms near $3395.40. Bulls appear to be gaining ground in the short term, as reflected by recent gains and positive momentum indicators. However, the relative strength index shows upward pressure could soon face pushback if overbought conditions emerge. Traders might consider positions around the current range with stop-loss orders near the lower support, while monitoring for potential breakouts above $3395.40. XRP Price Snapshot: Week Gains Amid Minor Long-Term Decline XRP experienced a slight weekly increase of 2.08% with a monthly drop of 3.14% and a six-month decline of 1.98%. The coin’s performance has shown limited volatility, as modest gains balanced out larger period declines. Price activity over the past month and half-year has been mixed, featuring small upward moves offset by gradual fading values over time. Indicators reflected a neutral mood, with the market quietly adjusting without dramatic swings. The recent behavior indicates a consolidation phase where neither bulls nor bears have taken full control of the market. XRP currently trades in a price range of $1.95 to $2.53, sitting above clear support at $1.73 and below resistance at $2.88. A second resistance is seen at $3.45 while a lower support is marked at $1.15. The market’s momentum is positive with an indicator reading of 0.1126, though the Awesome Oscillator stands slightly negative. Moving averages suggest moderate buying interest. The overall price lies within well-defined boundaries, indicating a lack of a decisive trend. Traders may consider long entries near support levels, with profit targets around resistance zones while remaining cautious. Conclusion BTC shows potential for growth with current trends. ETH appears stable but needs close watching for market shifts. XRP remains volatile, requiring cautious consideration. Each offers unique opportunities depending on market interest and individual risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The White House wants to cut NASA’s science budget by about half, to $3.9 billion. According to Bloomberg , Trump has left the agency without a permanent leader or a clear plan to work with allies or compete with China. Public interest in space is changing. NASA once stood alone in the spotlight, but companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX now draw headlines with faster, lower-cost launches. NASA’s Perseverance rover has spent four years exploring Mars. Since its February 2021 landing, it has drilled into the ground, sealed rock and soil samples in tubes, and left them on the surface. Perseverance was meant to kick off a multi-step mission. A later spacecraft would collect those tubes and return them to Earth to study whether Mars ever had, or still has life. Under the proposed 2026 budget , that follow-up mission would be scrapped. The sample tubes might sit on Mars for decades, hit by dust storms before they can be retrieved. NASA now risks losing its lead For decades, NASA’s research has helped scientists map the universe, learn how planets form, and search for life beyond Earth. Photos from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have captivated millions. Planned cuts include a spacecraft bound for an asteroid flyby in 2029 and missions to study Venus’s acidic clouds. Analysts warn that canceling them could waste past work and delay new discoveries. “Once you launch and you’re operating, then all those costs are behind you, and it’s relatively inexpensive to just keep the missions going,” said Amanda Hendrix, chief executive officer of the Planetary Science Institute. The budget plan comes as the administration aims to trim government waste and jobs. Critics point to NASA’s slow program management, rising costs, and schedule delays. Still, most of the $18.8 billion proposed for NASA, about $7 billion, would go for returning humans to the moon, with another $1 billion for sending astronauts to Mars. Lawmakers may push back against Trump’s NASA cuts Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to boost NASA funding to nearly $10 billion next year. Meanwhile, NASA remains without a confirmed leader after the White House withdrew the nomination of Jared Isaacman. On the All-In Podcast, Isaacman suggested the pullback was tied to his relationship with Musk , following a public dispute that briefly threatened SpaceX contracts. “Stopping Jared from becoming confirmed is only going to hurt NASA’s ability to push back on budget cuts,” said Jim Muncy, a space consultant and lobbyist with PoliSpace. NASA contracts have long provided steady support for the space industry and guided private companies. But as NASA’s budget shrinks, its influence may wane. “NASA would, in a sense, define access and define the culture of spaceflight and define the ambitions of spaceflight,” said Dreier. “Now, they have competitors for that, and frankly, some of their competitors are laying out more ambitious programs.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Those who leapt at those early stages? They’re now celebrating life-changing returns. With Ponke now priced at $0.148304, early backers saw their investments grow over 4,800%. A mere $1,000 turned into nearly $50,000. This wasn’t just luck—it was timing. But not everyone got in early. Many watched it skyrocket and wished they had a second shot at that kind of breakout. Missed Ponke? Arctic Pablo Coin is Redemption Everyone loves a comeback story.

However, the rally was short-lived, and the involved ones erased much of the gains in the past several hours. The Latest Additions The US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase officially added support for three digital assets: PancakeSwap (CAKE) on the Ethereum network, Subsquid (SQD) on the Arbitrum network, and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) on the Solana network. The news was released yesterday (June 11), while trading services with the aforementioned tokens will become available to users from today. The announcements caused a price uptick for all involved coins. CAKE pumped by 6% to as high as $2.69, FARTCOIN rallied above $1.50, while SQD hit a new all-time high of $0.28. It is important to note that the entire crypto market was booming yesterday following the positive US CPI data and the developments in the USA-China trade relations. In the following hours, the sector headed south, and Coinbase’s newly added tokens lost much of their recent gains. As of this writing, SQD remains in the green zone, whereas FARTCOIN and CAKE have charted losses on a 24-hour scale. SQD Price, Source: CoinGecko The initial pump of the tokens shouldn’t come as a surprise. After all, Coinbase is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, and its support boosts their liquidity, accessibility, and overall reputation. This theory has been backed up numerous times in the past several months. At the start of the year, the meme coin Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) witnessed a 30% price increase after Coinbase introduced it on its platform. Just days later, another meme – Toshi (TOSHI) – exploded by triple digits after the exchange added it to its roadmap. This is a special zone where assets must meet certain criteria before being officially listed. Different Story When Delisting Towards the end of May, the company announced that users will no longer be able to conduct trading services with Helium Mobile (MOBILE), Render (RNDR), Ribbon Finance (RBN), and Synapse (SYN) starting from June 26. “M OBILE, RNDR, RBN, & SYN are being delisted because new versions of these tokens have been released . As a result, the original versions of these tokens no longer meet our listing criteria, ” it said at the time. The delisting effort triggered a substantial pullback for the affected ones , with SYN suffering the most significant loss of around 15%.

The gaming firm also acknowledged that high-resolution background textures are supported. Players must enable the 4K texture option in the PC settings to use the features. In the PC version of the game, Stellar Blade said players can experience all of the action moments vividly with the DualSense controller, which fully supports haptic feedback and adaptive trigger features.

The game also said it’s giving all users the new outfit Crimson Wing as a token of their gratitude as they celebrate the release of the PC version. The game now supports Chinese and Japanese voiceovers in all regions. Stellar Blade will also apply matching facial animations for both languages. The game’s technical director, DonKi Lee, mentioned that the update will benefit players who could not access the game due to platform restrictions. The new PC game will include a new boss fight, where players can battle Mann, the leader of the Sentinels, in the Boss Challenge mode.

Unlike the usual frontrunners, these lesser-known altcoins are catching the eye of investors and analysts alike. Discover which coins have emerged as unexpected contenders and are poised for potential gains. Arbitrum Price Actions and Key Level Zones Last month saw a nearly 10% decline as ARB trended lower, marked by moderate drops and volatile shifts. The past six months witnessed a steep decrease of over 60%, indicating a significant downward correction that has weighed on sentiment. A one-week surge of about 13% brought some optimism, though it was insufficient to erase deeper losses. Historical price swings from roughly $0.2549 to $0.4648 highlight sharp fluctuations, while the prolonged decline shows the coin’s vulnerability amid broader market shifts. At present, ARB trades between roughly $0.2549 and $0.4648 with resistance around $0.5898 and support near $0.1699. A second resistance can be found at about $0.7997, while there’s no lower support below zero. Indicators show mixed signals, with positive momentum yet slight caution indicated by the Awesome Oscillator. Bulls are applying some pressure within these levels, but a clear upward trend is absent. Trading in the current range may provide opportunities for short-term gains, especially if prices retrace to the support level before testing resistance. Chainlink Price Action: Mixed Signals Amid Recovery and Decline Chainlink traded between $12.14 and $16.89, displaying mixed behavior in recent months. A weekly gain of 8.10% contrasted with a monthly decline of 10.73%, with a six-month drop of 47.60% underscoring a longer-term downturn. These price movements indicate recovery periods interrupted by significant sell-offs, leading to divided investor sentiment. Market indicators reflecting momentum and relative strength have produced mixed signals, highlighting ongoing volatility. Recent price action illustrates uncertainty, as short-term rallies have failed to reverse the persistent downward trend, maintaining a cautious atmosphere among traders who remain alert to potential rebounds. Currently, Chainlink has support at $10.30 and key resistance at $19.80, with a secondary support level at $5.55 and upper resistance at $24.55. The price action between these levels reflects a struggle between bulls and bears, with buyers attempting to push prices higher despite underlying weakness. The relative strength index around 55.13 suggests stability but lacks clear dominance. Subdued momentum indicators accompany the Awesome Oscillator, indicating cautious buying interest. A sustained hold above $10.30 could set the stage for a test of $19.80, while any slip below support may prompt further declines. Traders should look to buy near support and employ risk management strategies while observing price activity around these critical levels for clearer trends. CRV Market Analysis: Key Levels and Trading Signals CRV experienced an 8.71% drop over the past month and a steep 40.25% fall in the last six months. A modest weekly gain of 4.27% provided brief relief amid overall declines. Price changes reflect a period of volatility and investor uncertainty across different time frames. CRV currently trades between a narrow range of $0.58 and $0.81, with the nearest support identified at $0.50 and resistance at $0.95. A secondary resistance emerges at $1.17, while further support holds at $0.27. Indicators remain near neutral, with an RSI of 52.87 and a slight negative reading on the Awesome Oscillator at -0.037. Modest positive momentum at 0.033 suggests some bullish pressure. Price action lacks a strong trend, indicating short-term range-bound strategies may be best. Traders could consider initiating long positions around $0.50, targeting $0.95 and potentially $1.17, while bear traders might seek short opportunities in the higher resistance zones. Conclusion ARB , LINK , and CRV are showing impressive performance this week. ARB is gaining attention with its recent developments. LINK is solidifying its position with consistent growth. CRV is surprising many with its resilience. These altcoins are standing out, making them worth watching. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(DFDV), the Nasdaq-listed firm pursuing a solana SOL treasury strategy, is planning to get some more dry powder to boost its SOL stack. According to a Thursday press release , the company has secured a $5 billion equity line of credit with RK Capital Management. The agreement allows DeFi Dev to sell shares at its discretion, so long as it meets conditions like filing a resale registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it plans to file the necessary paperwork soon. ""We now have the flexibility and structure we need to scale,"" said Joseph Onorati, Chief Executive Officer. ""This is a clean, strategic path to continue growing SOL per share and compounding validator yield."" DFDV shares rebounded from early losses and were up 12% during the Thursday session. The company, formerly known as real estate tech platform Janover, is part of a growing trend of publicly-traded firms raising funds by selling shares and debt to add cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet, following Strategy's playbook with bitcoin BTC. The firm focuses on Solana, accumulating the network's native token and operating validators. It held over 609,00 SOL tokens as of May 16, worth $96 million at current prices.

RESOLV ( RESOLV ) dropped sharply on Thursday, falling from a daily high of $0.4108 to $0.29 at the time of writing. The steep correction has caught the attention of traders and analysts, sparking renewed scrutiny of the token’s launch dynamics. The decline comes just two days after RESOLV’s listing on Binance, KuCoin, and Bitget on June 10, positioning the token as a high-profile test case for how aggressive incentive models and multi-platform debuts perform under real market pressure. The pullback raises broader concerns around user retention post-airdrop, sustainable tokenomics, and the limits of early exchange exposure. You might also like: Five altcoins to watch on Thursday and Friday: Memecoins and DeFi lead this week’s rally Why RESOLVE price is down One clear driver of RESOLV’s drop is profit-taking following its launch rally. After surging from $0.091 to $0.41 during a hype-fueled breakout, early buyers, especially airdrop recipients, have started cashing out, creating heavy sell pressure. This pattern mirrors previous airdrop-driven market action. Tokens like Arbitrum ( ARB ) and Starknet ( STRK ) experienced similar volatility, with ARB falling nearly 90% from its IOU highs as smart money wallets dumped large amounts shortly after launch. STRK followed suit, plunging over 50% within its first 24 hours as whales and airdrop farmers rushed to exit. In addition to the profit-taking, the RESOLV team is facing allegations of unfair airdrop allocation. On January 12, a critic on X accused the project of distributing 11.7% of RESOLV’s supply—above the promised 10% allocation. According to the post, 6% of the token’s total supply was distributed to just 230 addresses, including at least one wallet that did not appear in the original airdrop contract. This controversy has likely damaged community trust and may have accelerated panic selling. Of the 11.7%, 6.4% was directly transferred by the foundation on June 10th rather than being claimed from the airdrop contract. While the main airdrop contract distributed 5% of the total supply to 23,000 users, the direct transfer distributed 6% of the total supply to only 230… pic.twitter.com/1ndv8ndCF3 — OddEyeResearch (@OddEyeResearch) June 12, 2025 From a technical perspective, RESOLV’s Relative Strength Index is now falling back after reaching near-overbought territory of 65-70, suggesting a loss of bullish momentum. With trading volume also shrinking, short-term traders appear to be exiting their positions, leaving the token vulnerable to a consolidation phase. If RESOLV holds above $0.35 and the rally resumes, the next upside target is $0.40, then possibly $0.45. Should it break below $0.30, deeper correction toward $0.25 or even retests of $0.19 may follow.

In a market filled with buzzwords and shallow utility, BTC-S is cutting through the noise by delivering what others only promise: speed, scalability, and a new opportunity to build serious wealth. The headlines are catching on. Crypto communities are buzzing. And while many projects are still planning their next move, Bitcoin Solaris has already made its play — and it’s paying off fast.

From passive earners to hands-on builders, the network is designed to support everyone, and it’s doing it with speed. The upcoming Solaris Nova app adds another layer of appeal. While not yet released, this mobile-first innovation will allow users to mine BTC-S from anywhere, transforming smartphones into powerful contributors to the network. With mining made accessible and mobile-friendly, it’s no wonder BTC-S is rising through the ranks. Meanwhile, rewards aren’t just handed out randomly.

Security, Trust, and Transparency: Backed by Audits Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just bold — it’s verified. The project has passed two comprehensive audits: Audit by Cyberscope Audit by Freshcoins This level of transparency has only added to its credibility, solidifying BTC-S as one of the safest plays among presale-phase tokens.

Amid the new wave of massive gains, you might be wondering what to hold. Smart investors know that when the market heats up, the best options are those that show massive potential but have yet to be uncovered by the rest of the market. One of the finest examples of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Let us dive into which projects to consider this summer. Solana (SOL) Could Ride ETF Wave Analysts forecast that if the SEC approves a Solana (SOL) ETF, it could push Solana (SOL) past the $200 mark. The price of Solana (SOL) is currently at $150, after a massive slump of nearly 50% from the all-time high of $294 in January. Amid this falling enthusiasm for Solana (SOL), investors in the project are looking for options elsewhere, and so far, they have settled on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for bombastic returns. Even with an ETF approval, SOL would only rise by 25%, which is meager compared to the real gains that MUTM presale investors are expecting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) -Life-Changing Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the Defi sector that aims to give participants in its ecosystem some of the biggest returns of 2025. To achieve this, it has created a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their assets for the chance to earn interest, while borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral to access those assets. The interest rate in the pools on Mutuum Finance is determined by a pool’s utilization rate. Security On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) completed an audit by the trust CertiK blockchain audit service. In the results, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received a Token Scan Score of 80. These results have inspired confidence in the project, with investors now rushing to secure their presale tokens in phase 5 of the presale. The results of the presale have also helped Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secure a listing on CoinMarketCap, the leading platform for price movements in the crypto sector. The platform receives over 350 million monthly visitors, which will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gets the visibility it deserves. It will also allow crypto investors to view the price movement for MUTM tokens to make smart investment decisions. To further bolster security, the platform will implement an address screening program, which will ensure nefarious actors are kept outside of its reach. The program will use an independent third party, where addresses will be screened before being allowed onto the platform. However, private details like IP addresses and metadata will not be shared with the third-party security service. The project is also sending out an open invitation to security experts, developers, and ethical hackers to examine the code and report vulnerabilities. To do this, the project will launch a bug bounty program, which will be open to anyone with blockchain security expertise. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Its main advantage is that it was the first, and has continued to grow a large community around it. Additionally, it has received a lot of institutional inflows in 2025. Based on these activities, analysts forecast that it could reach 200k by the end of 2025. However, while those gains seem massive, they are not as impressive as those in low-cap coins with massive potential. For instance, a rise to $200K would represent a 100% increase. On the other hand, conservative estimates on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show that it could rise from the current price of $0.03 to $2. That would represent a 6,566.67% increase, eclipsing Bitcoin (BTC) gains on the highest end of the forecast. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $10.4 million from investors so far. Over 11,900 unique buyers are taking part in the presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.03. In the first phase of the presale, the tokens were priced at $0.01. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. Ongoing $100,000 Giveaway To reward presale participants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway. This giveaway is open to all presale participants who purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the presale. They will then stand a chance to be one of the ten lucky winners who will receive $10,000 in MUMT tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that prioritizes security and intends to become the leading Defi project. By investing in the presale, you stand a chance to make huge gains that could propel your portfolio to new heights.

33767162,[object Object],1749744023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin War: Michael Saylor Dares JPMorgan And Warren Buffett To Bring It On,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-battle-lines-drawn-as-saylor-teases-1-million-entry-fee-for-jp-morgan/,"Michael Saylor doesn’t seem bothered about other big companies joining the Bitcoin bandwagon. Speaking on Bloomberg Crypto alongside Matt Meilier and Katie Greifeld, the MicroStrategy (rebranded to Strategy) executive chairman made it clear that he’s not losing sleep over JPMorgan or Warren Buffett. In fact, he sounded ready for them . Saylor’s confidence hasn’t changed. His company, now completely backed by crypto, is still buying—and according to him, that’s what makes all the difference. Strategy’s Bitcoin Bet Remains Unshaken At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $107,918. Saylor believes it’s still early. He told Bloomberg that legacy firms like JPMorgan will probably wait until BTC hits $1 million before they make serious moves. JPMorgan recently announced plans to let select clients borrow money using Bitcoin ETFs as collateral. That news came not long after reports that the banking giant will soon allow direct Bitcoin purchases. These signs point to a growing interest in crypto , even from traditional finance heavyweights. Saylor, though, brushed it off. He said Strategy is ready to compete with anyone, no matter how big. He argued that firms like JPMorgan will end up buying crypto when it’s much more expensive than it is now. Michael Saylor: I welcome the competition from JP Morgan. I hope they enter the space. I’m not really worried. When they (finally do it) they’ll be paying $1 million per Bitcoin. The price will go to the moon.” pic.twitter.com/YaEg4ToLTg — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) June 10, 2025 No More Bear Markets? During the interview, Saylor made another bold claim—he said there would never be a bear market for Bitcoin again. While that’s hard to prove, he backed it with Strategy’s continued buying and the strong demand he believes is still to come. The idea that Bitcoin might never dip again would sound strange to most investors. But for Saylor, Bitcoin isn’t just an asset. It’s the foundation of Strategy’s entire business model. He says that’s what gives the company an edge. He also said that the Bitcoin-backed structure helps Strategy issue preferred stock with more liquidity and better returns. These claims weren’t backed by detailed data, but Saylor was confident during the interview. JPMorgan’s Move Seen As Bullish For Bitcoin Despite downplaying the competition, Saylor did admit that JPMorgan’s involvement could be good for the overall market. He thinks it could boost BTC price even higher, creating gains for everyone already holding BTC or related products. On May 1, he tweeted that Bitcoin will reach $1 million before most wealth managers advise their clients to buy in. He took it a step further and said it might hit $10 million before they realize it’s a good idea. Calls For More Tech Giants To Buy Crypto Saylor hasn’t stopped at just talking about JPMorgan. He’s reportedly encouraged companies like Apple and Microsoft to get Bitcoin exposure. His push isn’t just about Strategy—it’s part of a larger vision he’s been promoting for years. He also took a jab at skeptics like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and US President Donald Trump supporter Warren Buffett. Saylor believes their criticism comes from not understanding Bitcoin. Whether people agree or not, Saylor’s message hasn’t changed. He says Strategy is still buying , and he’s not afraid of the competition.

45875245,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70748,1749744029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Is BlockDAG the Top-Trending Crypto of 2025? Hedera, VeChain, & Pi Coin Join the Race",https://timestabloid.com/is-blockdag-the-top-trending-crypto-of-2025-hedera-vechain/,"With June 2025 heating up, crypto traders are going all-in on coins that show more than just talk. Layer 1s and DeFi plays are all fighting for space, but only a few are showing signs of real traction, mass appeal, and potential for explosive upside. Enter BlockDAG, a rising force that’s pulled in over $298 million in presale funds, sold 22.4 billion coins, and launched one of the fastest-growing mobile mining apps this year. If you’re looking beyond hype and want the next big mover in Web3, picking the top-trending crypto today means watching where money, users, and innovation meet. This article explains why BlockDAG is capturing attention and how it compares with Hedera, VeChain, and Pi Coin in the race for long-term dominance. 1. BlockDAG: The Top-Trending Crypto for 2025 BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight, and it’s not hard to see why. With $298 million raised during presale and 22.4 billion BDAG coins already sold, this project is building momentum before it’s even listed. Now in Batch 29, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, but early buyers can still lock in the $0.0018 rate until June 13. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, that means a massive 2,678% ROI could be on the table for those who get in now. And it’s not just about potential profits. BlockDAG is packed with serious tech, and full EVM compatibility makes it a prime target for Ethereum dApp migration. Its no-code dApp builder and live testnet add even more firepower for developers looking for performance without complexity. The X1 Miner App is going viral, passing 1.5 million users, and the NBA teaser floating across social channels has only amped up the buzz. Whether that deal goes through or not, BlockDAG has become more than a Layer 1; it’s building cultural momentum. For anyone chasing the top-trending crypto, this project checks every box: traction, community, upside, and hype. 2. VeChain (VET): Pushing Real-World Projects, Lacking Breakout Fuel VeChain continues promoting its sustainability mission with campaigns like the “Green Ambassador Challenge.” Its price sits near $0.0259, and daily volume remains steady at $55–$59 million. However, VeChain hasn’t rolled out any big on-chain upgrades lately. Most of its narrative relies on brand strength rather than new development. It’s still considered a solid hold for the long haul, but for traders chasing the top-trending crypto title, it may not be time yet without a big new catalyst. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Bullish Energy With Some Speed Bumps Hedera is flashing some bullish technicals as it heads toward $0.167, with an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern suggesting a breakout to $0.25–$0.65 if volume holds. Traders are also watching the June 13 AMA, where Hedera will discuss cross-chain advances and new Coinbase x402 developments. Still, there are hurdles. Stablecoin activity has dipped, and ETF approval delays in the U.S. remain a drag. For those looking at top-trending crypto plays with regulatory strength, Hedera offers potential, but short-term gains could be limited if those approvals don’t come through soon. 4. Pi Coin (PI): Strong Community, Still Searching for a Clear Path Pi Coin has settled between $0.62 and $0.64 after bouncing from a $0.608 low. This double-bottom setup could spark a short squeeze, especially with trading volume up 22% and 200 million PI pulled from liquidity. The upcoming Pi Day 2 on June 28 is stirring excitement, but the technical setup remains shaky. Bears still point to downside toward $0.57. Pi has the community, no doubt, but buyers tracking the top-trending crypto want to see more utility and exchange support before diving in. Top-Trending Crypto to Buy Right Now Crypto is evolving fast, and the real winners will be the ones combining innovation, scalability, and user adoption. While Hedera builds slowly, VeChain holds its position, and Pi Coin flirts with short-term moves, BlockDAG is surging with momentum. With $298 million in presale funding, a viral mobile miner with 1.5 million users, EVM-ready architecture, and a live testnet already in play, BlockDAG is checking all the right boxes. Throw in the potential 2,678% ROI from its $0.0018 entry price before June 13, and the appeal is clear. BlockDAG is more than a hot project, it’s a full-blown crypto movement in the making. If you’re searching for the top-trending crypto that could define 2025, this might be the moment to jump in. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Another Company Makes a Huge $500 Million XRP Move!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/giant-companies-are-lining-up-for-ripple-xrp-another-company-makes-a-huge-500-million-xrp-move/,"Singapore-based company Trident has announced a financing plan of up to $500 million for its Ripple (XRP) treasury. According to the official announcement, Trident announced that it will raise up to $500 million to establish one of the world's first large-scale institutional XRP Treasuries. The company also appointed Chaince Securities LLC as strategic advisor. This strategic move marks a significant milestone in the evolution of blockchain-based financial infrastructure, placing Trident at the forefront of integrating decentralized financial assets into treasury and capital management applications. It was stated that the fund will be used for long-term purchases of XRP, research into staking mechanisms to generate returns, and deep interaction within the Ripple ecosystem. The initial launch of the XRP Treasury is planned for the second half of 2025, subject to regulatory compliance and prevailing market conditions. Trident founder Soon Huat Lim said: “As a public company, our commitment to transparency, strong governance and strategic foresight guides every decision we make. We see digital assets as key enablers in the evolution of the global financial landscape. The XRP initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer. “Through this initiative, Trident aims to demonstrate how public companies can thoughtfully and responsibly participate in the ongoing development of decentralized finance.” Apart from Trident, many other companies are also trying to get their hands on the XRP treasury, including Chinese companies Webus and VivoPower.

Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ) plunged to $0.0010, down 89% over the past year. The token’s market capitalization has collapsed from over $437 million in September to just $67 million today. HMSTR’s crash came as many holders capitulated and sold their tokens. Nansen data shows exchange balances have increased by 13% over the past 30 days, rising to over 17.86 billion HMSTR. A rise in exchange balances typically indicates that investors are moving tokens from self-custody to centralized platforms to sell. Additional on-chain data shows that the number of HMSTR holders dropped from over 300 million at its peak to just 672,200 today. Most exited as the token collapsed and user activity on its mini app declined sharply following its token generation event.

Futures open interest for HMSTR dropped to $30 million on Thursday, down from this month’s high of $60 million. At the same time, Hamster Kombat’s funding rate sank to a record low of minus 0.06%. A negative funding rate indicates that traders are paying to maintain short positions, signaling expectations of further downside. HMSTR funding rate | Source: CoinGlass Hamster Kombat’s crash reflects a broader trend among “to-earn” tokens. Other tap-to-earn tokens, notably Notcoin ( NOT ), haveplunged after its token-generation event. HMSTR price technical analysis HMSTR price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows HMSTR peaked at $0.0029 in April and formed a double-top pattern, with a neckline at $0.002438, the swing low from May 6. The token has since broken below key support at $0.001460, its lowest level in February. Price has also moved below all major moving averages, while both the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have plunged. Additionally, HMSTR has formed an inverse cup-and-handle pattern. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as buying interest remains weak. If the decline accelerates, the next level to watch will be $0.00095.

The $500 million XRP treasury plan has drawn the attention of institutional investors and market observers alike. A Bold Institutional Move Toward XRP The company, headquartered in Singapore, has unveiled its intention to raise half a billion U.S. dollars through a combination of equity issuance, strategic placements, and structured financing. These funds will be used to acquire XRP tokens as a long-term reserve asset to leverage their utility within decentralized financial systems. According to the company, this treasury will align with regulatory standards and will prioritize governance, transparency, and consistent public disclosures. Chaince Securities LLC has been appointed as the strategic advisor for the effort. Expanding Use Cases Within the Ripple Ecosystem Trident’s approach does not stop at accumulation. The treasury will also integrate staking mechanisms to generate yield, and the firm plans to actively engage with various projects in the Ripple ecosystem. Discussions are underway with crypto foundations and institutional stakeholders to secure advantageous acquisition terms and dependable on-chain infrastructure. Initial deployment of the XRP treasury is expected in the second half of 2025, contingent on market and regulatory conditions. Trident has committed to providing ongoing updates covering governance, operational milestones, and compliance practices in line with public company standards. A Signal to the Market: Institutions Are Paying Attention This initiative stands out not only for its scale but also for what it suggests about institutional sentiment. With $500 million earmarked specifically for XRP, Trident appears to be positioning itself ahead of what it sees as a broader institutional shift toward token-based financial instruments. By establishing this XRP treasury, Trident sends a strong message to the market: digital assets are moving into corporate finance, not just as speculative instruments but as strategic reserve assets. The $500 million XRP-focused treasury is not just a financial maneuver; it is a clear indication that some institutional players are preparing for a future in which blockchain-based assets have a central role. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 About Trident and Its Broader Mission Trident describes itself as a company focused on digital transformation services and Web 3.0 enablement. Its flagship product, Tridentity, is a blockchain-based digital identity solution designed to provide secure authentication across third-party systems. While its reach extends globally, the company emphasizes activity in Southern Africa and other key developing regions. “As a public company, our commitment to transparency, strong governance, and strategic foresight guides every decision we make,” Lim stated. “We see digital assets as key enablers in the evolution of the global financial landscape.” This move by Trident follows a growing trend among forward-looking enterprises positioning XRP as a strategic asset. According to a June 8 report by Times Tabloid , blockchain analytics platform Messari revealed that three other companies— Webus International , VivoPower , and Wellgistics —have collectively proposed to allocate $471 million in XRP to their corporate treasuries. With Trident now preparing a $500 million XRP treasury of its own, the message is becoming clear: institutional confidence in XRP is accelerating, and major players may be acting on signals that the broader market has yet to fully grasp.

He's currently long $ETH with 25x leverage. https://t.co/09Rmkt6BIb pic.twitter.com/8LleWvjVXv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 12, 2025 Tate’s tumultuous journey on Hyperliquid Tate seems to have started his trading journey on Hyperliquid at the end of 2024. However, his activity on the platform did not blow up until early June 2025 when Tate shared a post on X showcasing a 138.5% profit on a 25x leveraged Ethereum (ETH) long position. The trade initially appeared successful, earning him $22,000 in unrealized profits at the time. However, he used high leverage, which made it vulnerable to price fluctuations. It did not take long for blockchain transparency to reveal a less favorable outcome as crypto sleuths were able to trace Tate’s Hyperliquid wallet using his referral code (“TOPGTOPSTRIKER”). They found that his cumulative profit and loss (PnL) showed a net loss of approximately $597,000–$600,000 across all trades on the platform since he began trading there. His 25x leveraged ETH position was liquidated after a slight price dip, costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and forcing him to delete the initial post of him bragging about the 138% gain. Fast forward to June 8, and Tate shared a post about a potential $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position on Hyperliquid, with the caption, “100M BTC long. My turn?” Many thought the statement was made in reference to James Wynn’s billion-dollar BTC bets on the platform, but there is no direct evidence suggesting this. It is also not yet known if he has executed the trade, and some speculate it was a promotional stunt to drive referral sign-ups. He later took down the post as well. Tate insists he plans to make it all back Tate’s trading losses were revealed when he attempted to earn fees from new user sign-ups by sharing his referral code. Unlike centralized exchanges, Hyperliquid’s on-chain nature makes all trades publicly traceable, and crypto traders were quick to identify Tate’s wallet and expose his $600,000 loss, triggering widespread mockery on X. Andrew Tate’s trades on Hyperliquid have run up to $597,000–$600,000 in losses. Source: LookOnChain As usual, Tate was defiant in the face of the critics, stating, “I’ll make it all back with one trade,” but this did little to quell criticism. So far, LookOnChain claims Tate has made 76 trades on Hyperliquid and has only had 27 wins — a 35.53% win rate. He’s currently long $ETH with 25x leverage; however, his overall account is still down by nearly $600,000. Thanks to the volatile markets, it is unclear if his ETH long can end his streak of losses. While Tate’s posts about Hyperliquid have drawn more attention to the platform, his deleted posts and public exposure have made him a cautionary tale about the risks of leveraged trading and the transparency of DEXs like Hyperliquid. Now, many on X are waiting to see which runs out first, his ego or his ETH.

Total market capitalisation has dropped nearly 4% to around $3.51 trillion. Almost every asset in the top 100 list is now showing losses. Bitcoin trades near $107,688, while Ethereum is around $2,736. Altcoins are feeling the squeeze as well, with Dogecoin at $0.1877 , Solana at $158 , and Cardano at $0.6827 . Source: CoinMarketCap Amid these declines, spot Ethereum ETFs in the US continue to attract larger inflows than Bitcoin ETFs—a shift that hints at deeper changes in investor behaviour. Spot Ethereum ETFs attract more flows US-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds continue to outperform their Bitcoin equivalents. On 11 June, BlackRock’s ETH ETF brought in a one-day inflow of $160 million. Ethereum ETFs in total pulled $240 million in net inflows. Overall, Ethereum ETFs have seen cumulative inflows of $3.74 billion over 18 straight days. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs totalled $45.22 billion, but inflows for 11 June were a more modest $133 million. The continuing strength of ETH ETF flows has coincided with Ethereum’s rebound from recent lows. On-chain analysts interpret this as a sign of shifting sentiment, fuelled by the Pectra upgrade, increasing DeFi activity, and more favourable regulatory commentary from figures such as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Bitcoin and altcoins slide as volatility concerns rise The broader downturn in crypto assets has been led by Bitcoin’s decline of around 1.68%, dragging it down from earlier highs near $110,350 to current levels near $107,688. Ethereum lost about 4.29%, dipping from intraday highs of $2,868 to today’s $2,736. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins suffered deeper losses. Dogecoin fell roughly 7.5% to $0.1876, Solana dropped about 5–6% to $158, and Cardano slipped nearly 5.4% to $0.6827. These declines reflect a market-wide pullback following softer US inflation data and renewed uncertainty stemming from US-China trade discussions. On-chain data points to underpriced volatility risk On-chain data highlights several warning signs. Much of the supply of Bitcoin is clustered close to current price levels. When coins accumulate around a spot, even small flips in sentiment can trigger outsized moves. Meanwhile, options markets appear complacent—implied volatility remains low, even as on-chain activity suggests increasing volatility risk. Similarly, Ethereum options show subdued volatility pricing, despite its rebound and growing ETF interest. Analysts suggest both chains may be underestimating potential spikes during events like regulatory developments or protocol changes. Macro triggers and future direction Crypto markets are reacting in step with macroeconomic trends. The increasing tensions in the Middle East and US President Donald Trump saying he would impose unilateral tariffs on trading partners within two weeks have fed into asset-price uncertainty. Equities followed suit, with the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 falling 0.37% and 0.27% respectively, adding to crypto’s downward pressure. However, Institutions continued with activities despite the market volatility. The Ant Group is advancing plans to launch stablecoins in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg. The US Senate also voted to proceed with a substitute amendment to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act. These developments show that regulatory momentum in digital assets continues even amid price volatility. Ethereum’s progress is further underpinned by the recently activated Pectra upgrade and influential endorsements from regulatory figures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maintains key technical levels. On-chain analysts highlight support at $97,600 and resistance near $115,400. Investor sentiment has cooled somewhat, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index easing from 65 into more neutral territory. Yet on-chain data suggests selling remains limited. Only around $200 million of realised losses have been recorded, indicating present declines have been absorbed by long-term holders.

Qubetics Presale Ends Soon—A Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Before a Possible 20% Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-not-buying-cardano-qubetics-presale-ends-soon-a-popular-crypto-coin-to-buy-before-a-possible-20-rise/,"Cardano’s early backers watched it rise from pennies to several dollars. Those who stayed on the sidelines during its initial growth often recall the missed potential when ADA was still accessible to the average buyer. A price surge followed that turned early commitments into substantial returns, while many others entered only after most of the upside had passed. Qubetics ($TICS), a popular crypto coin to buy for 2025, is now being seen as an innovative blockchain project in its early stages, offering strong functionality and ongoing community interest. One of its most talked-about applications is its decentralized VPN (dVPN), which introduces a bandwidth-sharing model powered by blockchain to help users maintain privacy, avoid access restrictions, and earn tokens by sharing unused data. Qubetics is designed to deliver more than price speculation. It offers use cases that apply directly to growing sectors of the blockchain space. This article explores how its utility and structure compare with Cardano’s early growth, and why Qubetics is seen by many as the popular crypto coin to buy before its presale ends. Qubetics ($TICS): Practical Blockchain Use with dVPN at Its Core Qubetics is a Web3-focused blockchain protocol developed to support scalable, secure, and interoperable services across decentralized applications. Among its primary features is a decentralized VPN (dVPN) that allows users to access the internet without routing traffic through centralized servers. This can assist professionals working remotely across restricted regions in real-world use. A freelance developer working from a country with limited access to key coding platforms can use Qubetics dVPN to bypass regional limitations securely. A startup in a high-surveillance region can protect internal data exchanges by routing traffic anonymously through the Qubetics network. Small businesses operating with tight resources can also benefit by monetizing unused internet bandwidth. The Qubetics dVPN enables participants to share this bandwidth and earn $TICS tokens in return, creating a functional network supported by economic incentives. It’s useful not only for individuals but also for businesses that rely on uninterrupted, censorship-resistant connections. The dVPN service also strengthens the larger Qubetics ecosystem by securing Web3 infrastructure. It supports the backends of DeFi, NFT platforms, and decentralized storage, helping maintain encrypted communication for users and applications. This integration highlights Qubetics’ focus on making blockchain services accessible and secure through usable tools instead of abstract ideas. That’s why it’s shining bright as a popular crypto coin to buy for 2025. Qubetics Presale Nearing Close: Scarcity and Demand Drive Momentum Qubetics has reached the 37th and final stage of its crypto presale. More than 27,900 buyers have already acquired over 515 million TICS tokens, generating over $17.9 million in funding. At its current price of $0.3370, only 10 million tokens remain before the public listing, where the price is expected to rise to $0.40. The overall token supply has been significantly reduced from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% allocated to public distribution. This shift has created a supply environment where demand rises while availability tightens. Analysts project that once listed, this popular crypto coin to buy now could reach between $5 and $10 if adoption and network utility continue to grow. A buyer participating today with $8,500 would receive approximately 25,221 $TICS tokens. At $5, this would result in $126,105. If the token moves to $10, the total rises to $252,210. At a projected $15 that purchase would be worth $378,315. Early backers who entered stage one, when $TICS was priced at $0.01, already see a 3270% return. There is still room to participate. At this point, those joining this rising crypto presale lock in a potential 20% gain upon listing. With projections pointing to much higher values, many buyers are entering with long-term utility in mind. ADA’s Early Phase: A Case Study in Timing Cardano (ADA) was introduced as a research-driven blockchain protocol focused on peer-reviewed development and long-term scalability. Initially trading at under $0.05, ADA’s growth over time brought its value above $3 during its market peak, generating significant gains for those who entered early. Its development approach was deliberate. Cardano took years to introduce smart contracts and staking features, but did so with a structured plan. As adoption expanded, it became one of the most traded and widely held cryptocurrencies across major platforms. ADA continues to rank among the top digital assets by market capitalization. Its use cases have grown to include DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and real-world education and digital identity partnerships. However, most price appreciation occurred during its first significant growth cycle. Many gains from under $0.10 to over $1.00 happened early, rewarding those who acted during the foundational stages. This reinforces the importance of timing in the cryptocurrency sector, especially when long-term development is planned. Why Qubetics is Becoming a Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025 Qubetics stands out due to its working infrastructure, straightforward utility, and a defined path to the mainnet. Unlike many presale projects that launch based on marketing cycles, Qubetics builds from a base of usable applications. Its dVPN already aligns with growing demand for privacy tools, and the presale structure supports community-first growth. With a tightened supply and over 27,900 early adopters already on board, attention around Qubetics continues to increase. The project has drawn interest not just for its short-term gains, but for how it integrates privacy and security into blockchain use cases. Cardano built value over time by focusing on strong development and sustainable use. Qubetics is now applying similar long-term principles, starting with tools like dVPN that solve user-facing issues directly. For those evaluating a popular crypto coin to buy during a live presale, Qubetics presents a viable option supported by both adoption and ongoing utility. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What is Qubetics used for? Qubetics is a Web3 blockchain offering a decentralized VPN, tokenized asset marketplace, and scalable smart contract development tools. How much is $TICS priced at in the final presale stage? It is currently priced at $0.3370, with only 10 million tokens left before listing at $0.40. How does Qubetics dVPN work? The dVPN is a peer-to-peer network that allows users to share bandwidth, avoid censorship, and access the internet securely—without central servers. What would a $8500 participation yield at this stage? It would return around 25,221 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10, this equals $252,210 in value. Is there still time to join the Qubetics presale? Yes, the presale is still open in its final stage. The remaining supply is limited, and current participants still access the listing price increase. The post Regret Not Buying Cardano?

After a bumpy first quarter marked by a brief contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions, data now point to stronger growth. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker has jumped to 3.8% QoQ as of early June, a sharp upgrade from earlier in the year. This shift, alongside expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a less aggressive trade policy, has eased recession fears and strengthened investor sentiment. Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin’s BTC appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments. Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing ""mark-to-market"" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it’s also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply. Regulatory clarity Regulatory developments are also expected to reshape the market, the report said. The Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill now heading to the House. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing digital assets. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors. Separately, the SEC is considering more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds and proposals involving staking and altcoins. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October. Overall, bitcoin appears poised to benefit from both macro and structural tailwinds in the second half of the year, while the outlook for altcoins will depend on navigating a more complex and still-evolving regulatory and liquidity environment, according to the report.",Markets|Bitcoin|Macro|Regulation|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-12 17:16:46

Speaking in Madrid, FSB Chair Klaas Knot said that the financial system may be moving towards a “tipping point” due to increasing interconnectedness via crypto ETFs and stablecoins. ETFs Lower Barriers to Retail Investor Entry Knot mentioned that crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are making it easier than ever for retail investors to gain exposure to digital assets. By removing wallets, private keys, or exchanges as a necessity, ETFs introduce TradFi-like convenience with amped-up exposure to the highly volatile crypto universe. Although crypto remains not a systemic risk, Knot warned that this situation may shift in the near future as adoption increases. “We could be at a tipping point,” he said, calling for more regulation. Stablecoins Tie Crypto to US Treasurys Knot brought attention to the runaway growth in the stablecoin market as another area of concern. Digital currencies that are dollar-pegged are ubiquitous within financial systems and are collateralized, in most cases, by US Treasury reserves. This raises the potential for shocks to the crypto world to have impact on sovereign debt markets. FSB Leadership Change with Rising Regulator Focus According to DeFiLlama, today the stablecoins have a combined market capitalization of over $251 billion. Recent studies by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) again illustrate their influence, as they can decrease three-month US Treasury yields by up to 2.5 basis points in 10 days by taking in stablecoin inflows and send them up by as much as 8 basis points when stablecoin outflows increase them. Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are the strongest issuers, having a strong influence on short-term Treasury yield trends, the study found. FSB president Klaas Knot, who is also a president of the Dutch central bank, will leave his FSB role on June 30. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will take over. The Dutch has not yet announced a replacement. The timing is urgent as regulators everywhere move towards creating frameworks for digital assets, including stablecoins, that are increasingly being considered financial instruments of systemic importance. GENIUS Act Advances in US Senate Adding to the regulatory momentum, the US Senate this week voted 68–30 to move forward with the GENIUS Act — a bill that would establish a national standard for stablecoin issuance. If passed, it would bring much-needed certainty to the US stablecoin market and add the country’s competitiveness to the digital asset space. The passage of the bill emphasizes growing concern over the systemic implications that come with the expansion of crypto, an attitude echoed by the FSB in its advocacy for tighter global regulation.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-12 17:20:00

It will involve holding, staking, and deeply engaging in the Ripple ecosystem over the long term to improve its decentralized finance strategy. The rollout of the XRP reserve is set to happen in the second half of 2025 after the regulators’ approval, and it is subject to the market staying stable. Trident plans to fundraise via equity issuance, strategic private placements, and structured financing.

Trident plans to fundraise via equity issuance, strategic… pic.twitter.com/1sLsHtt3xb — Bayberry Capital (@CapitalBayberry) June 12, 2025 The company has promised to give regular updates on how the reserves are being used, how governance is working, and how well they follow public exposure rules. Soon Huat Lim, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Trident, said, “As a public company, we are committed to transparency, strong governance, and innovation. We believe digital assets are central to the future of global finance, and this initiative positions us to lead in that evolution.” Asian institutional buyers line up for XRP reserve Ripple’s XRP supporters are rejoicing as corporate reserve investments in crypto continue to grow. Soon, Huat Lim called the move a strategic transformation. He said, “This is not just a financial move—it’s a strategic transformation.” The Asian user base has continued to enlarge since recently. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Webus International Limited filed a Form 6-K with the SEC to ask for $300 million for an XRP-focused reserve. The company in Hangzhou set up a crypto reserve for payments made with Ripple after forming a joint venture with Samara Alpha Management. Webus plans to use XRP to make quick cross-border payments for its booking system and driver services. In addition, VivoPower, a business that makes renewable energy, wants to build up a $121 million XRP reserve, and BitGo has approved an initial investment of $100 million. Also, the company that lets travelers customize their car and tour services announced that it was renewing its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings, one of China’s biggest online travel agencies, to grow their “Wetour x Tongcheng” charter lines. They said they planned to use the XRP Ledger to settle cross-border rides and driver payouts. Whales are not sitting on the sidelines, either. According to Santiment, wallets holding between one and ten million XRP have scooped up over two billion tokens since late last year. Meanwhile, Trident Digital Tech Holdings saw its stock collapse nearly 40% in early trading Thursday, falling from around $0.45 in the premarket to under $0.20. Financial institutions are still reluctant to use XRP Instead of SWIFT, the XRP Ledger is faster and less expensive. Banks can use the blockchain and XRP as a bridge currency to send money across borders with Ripple Payments. Banks and payment service providers using Ripple’s products will make more people want to buy XRP, making the token more valuable. However, not many banks use XRP as a bridge currency. It is risky to move money with crypto because of volatility. Ripple has made a stablecoin called Ripple USD to solve this problem. But when paying with Ripple USD, the transaction fees should be paid in XRP. These fees are small, and the extra demand for XRP is almost nonexistent. Therefore, financial institutions using Ripple Payments will unlikely be a material catalyst for XRP. Meanwhile, XRP has gone up 13% so far this year. As of June 12, its market value was $132 billion, and it’s worth $2.25 right now. One Wall Street expert believes that the cryptocurrency will be worth a lot more in three years. Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick recently said that XRP would be bigger than Ethereum by 2028.

Speaking at a White House event, Trump stated, “I’m not going to fire him,” while questioning why such a move would be seen as controversial. “The fake news is saying, ‘Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad.’ I don’t know why it would be so bad.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for being slow to lower interest rates, referring to him as “Too Late” and blaming the current rate environment for increasing federal borrowing costs. Powell’s term as Fed chair is set to expire in May 2026. “We’re going out to financing, and I may have to force something,” Trump added, suggesting he might apply pressure on the Fed if rate cuts do not materialize soon. He also noted he isn’t opposed to rate hikes if inflation rises, but believes now is the time to ease.

Trump also hinted that a decision on his nominee for the next Fed chair could come soon, following earlier comments that an announcement was imminent. Despite the sharp critique, he stopped short of saying he would replace Powell, calling him a “numbskull” but reiterating, “I’m not going to fire him.” The president also voiced concern about rising oil prices, underscoring broader economic pressures as he heads into the final months of his re-election campaign.

The company’s average cost per Bitcoin is now $78,582, following this latest purchase, which delivered a 22% yield increase compared to its prior acquisition in late May. This latest move is in line with DDC’s long-term strategy to integrate Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. In a statement about the purchase, Founder, Chairwoman, and CEO Norma Chu reaffirmed the company’s unwavering Bitcoin strategy. “Today’s 38 BTC acquisition proves our focused execution. We continue to aim for higher BTC yield return for our shareholders,” she said. Chu also noted the symbolic value of each acquisition: “With every Bitcoin added, we strengthen shareholder exposure to digital scarcity—now at 0.029679 BTC per 1,000 shares. We remain uncompromising in our pursuit of being a top global corporate holder status.” Positioning Bitcoin as a Core Asset While most companies remain cautious in their approach to digital assets, DDC Enterprise said it has aggressively positioned Bitcoin as a long-term financial hedge and store of value. The company said it has structured its treasury strategy around this conviction, acquiring BTC at what it considers optimal market entry points. Its BTC-per-share metric—now sitting at 0.029679 per 1,000 shares—is touted as a novel value proposition for shareholders interested in digital asset exposure through traditional equity markets. The acquisition is also reflective of a growing trend among listed companies that use Bitcoin not merely as an investment, but as a strategic balance sheet tool. DDC’s move indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upside, despite market volatility and regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. DDC Enterprise said it is using BitGo as its official custodian. The firm said that by using BitGo’s custody solutions, DDC seeks to support its growing digital asset strategy with scalable and secure infrastructure designed to meet the demands of institutional investors.

45879403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70786,1749749035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says Ripple CEO Is Certain About XRP Ledger Claiming 14% Market Share From SWIFT,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-ripple-ceo-is-certain-about-xrp-ledger-claiming-14-market-share-from-swift/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reinforced confidence in the long-discussed potential of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to capture a significant share of global banking liquidity. Speaking at the 2025 XRPL Apex event in Singapore, Garlinghouse stated that XRPL could handle up to 14% of SWIFT’s total transaction volume within the next five years, a projection that has inspired discussions within the XRP community. Garlinghouse Emphasizes Liquidity Over Messaging During a Q&A session that also featured Ripple CTO David Schwartz, Garlinghouse addressed questions about the competition between XRPL and the SWIFT network. He drew a clear distinction between SWIFT’s role in messaging and XRP’s capability in enabling real-time liquidity and settlements. According to Garlinghouse, the true value in cross-border transactions lies not in messaging systems but in the ability to move liquidity efficiently, an area where XRPL is uniquely positioned. He noted that XRP was developed to address the shortcomings of legacy banking infrastructure and that it offers real utility through its speed and efficiency in facilitating international payments. Based on this foundation, he sees a realistic path for XRPL to capture a double-digit share of global bank liquidity currently routed through SWIFT. Analyst’s Opinion On Ripple CEO’s Strategic Outlook The response to Garlinghouse’s remarks has been largely positive among XRP supporters. One notable figure, Nietzbux, stated that the Ripple CEO has a history of making forward-looking statements that align with the company’s long-term strategy. He emphasized that Garlinghouse’s statements should not be viewed as speculation but as indicators of Ripple’s direction and strategic intent. Nietzbux also argued that Ripple’s leadership often communicates long-term objectives well in advance, giving the community early insight into the company’s roadmap. I've studied @bgarlinghouse 's messaging for years. When he speaks, he means it, it eventually comes true. Saying $XRP will capture 14% of all bank's liquidity currently going through Swift is no joke. Reality is setting in. He knows it. The world knows it. — nietzbux (@nietzbux) June 11, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications of a $21 Trillion Volume Target SWIFT processes an estimated $150 trillion in annual transaction volume, based on 2023 data from Forbes . If Ripple achieves its 14% target, XRPL could be responsible for moving approximately $21 trillion annually, equivalent to around $58 billion per day. Such volume would significantly elevate XRP’s role in global finance and could have a material effect on its market value. To evaluate the potential pricing implications, ChatGPT was used to run a theoretical analysis. Since XRP functions as a bridge currency rather than a consumable asset, the focus shifts to how often tokens circulate and the volume of liquidity required. According to the analysis, if each XRP token were reused around 30 times per year, the network would need roughly $700 billion in liquidity to sustain a $21 trillion annual flow. Given XRP’s maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, this would imply a base price of approximately $11.90 per token. Additional factors, such as institutional involvement and speculative demand, could push the price higher. With moderate investor interest, ChatGPT projected a possible price of $17.85. Under conditions of strong adoption and market confidence, the token’s value could rise as high as $23.81. Garlinghouse’s recent statements reflect Ripple’s broader strategy of positioning XRP as a cornerstone of cross-border liquidity infrastructure. By focusing on efficiency and real-time settlement capabilities, Ripple aims to fill gaps left by legacy systems like SWIFT, which were not built for modern, high-speed financial ecosystems. While such projections remain subject to market conditions and regulatory developments, the consistency in Ripple’s messaging and leadership vision continues to resonate with its supporters. As Ripple expands its presence globally, the coming years will test whether XRP can achieve the scale and utility envisioned by its leadership.

Trading at $0.03, MUTM has quickly emerged as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, thanks to its DeFi-focused utility, strong early adoption, and viral momentum across crypto circles. The official presale of Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5, with MUTM priced at just $0.03, rapidly approaching the Phase 6 price of $0.035. That’s after already soaring 200% since launch. With the token set to go live at $0.06, early buyers are locking in a guaranteed 2x ROI. If you’re serious about stacking gains this season, this could be the top summer breakout that leaves PEPE in the dust. Miss it now, and you might be watching from the sidelines when it 50x’s. PEPE’s Realignment in 2025 Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading at $0.000012 after a turbulent but resilient performance in the meme coin market. While it’s still well below its all-time high of around $0.000027 set in 2024, recent accumulation by large holders and renewed community engagement have sparked cautious optimism. Analysts point to a potential breakout if PEPE can consistently hold above key resistance levels near $0.000013, $0.000015, possibly setting the stage for a mid-year run. However, with the broader meme coin sector maturing, many investors are beginning to shift focus toward newer entrants with stronger DeFi utility and early growth momentum, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Mania: $10.4M Already In, Are You Missing Out? Mutuum Finance is exploding in popularity, and it’s not hard to see why. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi powerhouse has already attracted over 11,900 investors and raised $10.4 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price is set to jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 16.67% surge, meaning those who get in now are positioned for major gains. Early adopters are locking in profits. Certik-Approved & DeFi-Ready: Mutuum’s Lending Revolution Is Here Mutuum combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, giving users the best of both worlds: reliable returns from USDT pools and full control of direct crypto transactions. Certik has also officially completed its audit of Mutuum’s open-source smart contracts, giving the platform a stamp of security. That’s a huge green flag for investors, especially those looking for stable, secure plays in crypto. The Next Big Stablecoin? Mutuum’s USD-Backed Token Could Be a Game-Changer Mutuum Finance is riding the DeFi wave it’s building its own. Their upcoming overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability and avoid the pitfalls of algorithmic stablecoins. With the infrastructure already audited and certified, Mutuum is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and those paying attention now could reap the biggest rewards later. $100,000 Up for Grabs Mutuum isn’t just rewarding smart investors, it’s celebrating them. The platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. MUTM is exploding, $10.4M raised, 11,800+ investors in, and the $0.03 presale price won’t last. Launch is set at $0.06, locking in a 2x ROI, with insiders eyeing a 50x run in 2025. This isn’t hype, it’s real DeFi utility, Certik-audited, and backed by a stablecoin. Grab your MUTM now, before Phase 6 hits and you’re priced out.

The tech company’s DRAM technology powers nearly everything, including AI, high-performance computing, the automotive industry, and next-generation wireless devices. Chipmaker Micron Technology was the latest company to pledge large-scale investments in the country since President Trump won the election. According to the tech company’s Thursday statement, the spending will include roughly $150B for expanding domestic manufacturing capacity and another $50B for R&D. The total represented an increase of $30B beyond what it had previously budgeted. Micron restores domestic chipmaking strength Micron Technology joined a growing list of U.S. tech firms and chipmakers investing hundreds of billions to bring more chip manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The announcement is part of the Trump Administration’s push to restore domestic chip manufacturing strength, advance America’s role as a technology leader, and put American workers first. Micron is expected to get about $6 billion in Chips Act money to build domestic production capacity. The new investments will create over 90K direct and indirect jobs. The tech firm will build on its existing investments in Idaho, New York, and Virginia. The U.S.-based chipmaker will construct a second state-of-the-art (SOTA) chip fabrication facility in Boise, Idaho. Micron will also expand and modernize its factory in Manassas, Virginia, to onshore technology from Taiwan. Micron has finalized a $275 million CHIPS Act direct funding award supporting its investment to expand and modernize its Virginia facility, which will begin this year. The investment will onshore its 1-alpha DRAM node. These investments will support the firm’s goal of producing 40% of its DRAM in the U.S. The company had previously pledged to invest about $125 billion to build factories in the US, though it began slow-walking some plans last year. The Micron team disclosed that the additional $30 billion from the pledged funds will be used for various projects, including the advanced packaging necessary to produce high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. “Micron’s investments will likely span over several decades given the company’s focus on cash generation and potential investor concerns over excess capital spending.” – Jake Silverman , Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence However, while the company’s timeframe for the overall $200 billion investment plan was unclear, it allocated between $7 billion and $12.5 billion to annual capital spending in recent years. According to InvestingPro data, Micron maintains a strong financial foundation for this expansion with a healthy current ratio of 3.13 and an overall Financial Health score of “GOOD.” Trump administration prioritizes American chipmaking The Trump administration has prioritized getting Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make public investment pledges in the U.S. to stimulate the economy and boost its manufacturing base. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a hearing last week that the U.S. was reworking agreements it had reached with semiconductor companies under the 2022 Chips Act to secure what he described as better terms. Lutnick said the Trump administration was renegotiating terms to benefit the taxpayer and get more value for the same amount of dollars. Notably, the Commerce Secretary cited the decision by TSMC to add $100 billion to its previous commitment of $65 billion in investment. The Taiwanese chipmaker will receive $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants, but it stepped up its plans without additional government money. The Trump administration also took credit for ongoing projects like the possible $500 billion AI venture by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI that will take many years to complete. The project’s progress slowed earlier this year. Apple plans to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. The investments will include a large factory in Texas for AI servers and an addition of about 20K research and development jobs across the country.

(MFH), a financial services and crypto company, has announced its intention to raise $800 million. The funds will be used to build a large Bitcoin (BTC) treasury and create a blockchain-based financial system. This move is part of the company’s broader strategy to become a major player in the fast-growing world of digital finance. No Mercurity To Build A New Kind of Bitcoin Treasury Unlike traditional companies that hold Bitcoin as a passive asset, Mercurity plans to use it actively. The Bitcoin acquired will be integrated into a yield-generating treasury model. This means the flagship crypto will not just sit in storage; instead, it will be used to earn returns through tokenized tools and staking services. In a recent statement, Mercurity’s CEO, Shi Qiu, said that Bitcoin will be a key financial tool in the future. With this in mind, the company wants to be a leader in the world of digital finance by using cryptocurrency, blockchain, and new financial tools. Mercurity is following a new trend in which companies use Bitcoin as more than just a reserve. Today, many businesses, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, are finding ways to make money with their crypto holdings instead of letting them sit idle. Companies like Blockstream and MARA Digital are already doing this. They use their Bitcoin reserve for services like lending , staking, and other activities that help them earn extra income. Mercurity’s Bitcoin Funding Strategy Remains a Mystery While the company has revealed how it plans to use the $800 million, it has not disclosed how it intends to raise the capital. The New York-based firm is yet to explain whether the money will come from selling company shares, taking on debt, or using other financing methods. Following the news, Mercurity’s stock price rose 1.9% during regular trading but dropped 2.84% after hours. The dip may reflect investor concerns about the unknowns in the company’s funding plan. Mercurity Focus Beyond Crypto This news comes at a key time for Mercurity. The company is expected to be added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes, which are important stock lists that many big investors follow. If the company is included in these indexes, it could help more people notice Mercurity and make it easier to trade its shares.

On June 12, Solana ( SOL )-focused crypto treasury firm DeFi Development Corp. announced it has secured a $5 billion line of credit to accumulate additional SOL tokens and accelerate its SOL Per Share (SPS) metric. According to the statement , DeFi Development entered into a share purchase agreement with RK Capital Management LLC to issue and sell common stock in order to raise the funds. The company expects to access the facility after meeting customary conditions, including filing a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unlike fixed-price equity offerings with large upfront issuances, the agreement uses a “capital-on-demand” model, giving DeFi Development flexibility to raise capital gradually and time deployments with favorable market conditions.

According to the statement, the strategy is designed to give investors direct exposure to SOL while supporting the broader growth of the Solana ecosystem. The $5 billion facility positions DeFi Development as a central liquidity engine within the Solana network, while offering traditional investors access to blockchain-native yields. The company’s validator strategy generates staking rewards and delegation fees, reinforcing Solana’s decentralization and aligning its dual role as both investor and infrastructure operator with long-term ecosystem health. Formerly a real estate software company known as Janover, DeFi Development pivoted to a Solana-native strategy in April after a group of former Kraken executives acquired a majority stake. As of its last reported acquisition on May 15, the company purchased 16,447 SOL for $2.3 million. It now holds a total of 609,190 SOL, worth over $97 million at current prices.

A significant leap is underway as crypto payment gateway Alchemy Pay makes a strategic move into the exciting realm of Real World Assets Crypto (RWA). This expansion is made possible through a key partnership with tokenization expert, Backed Finance . What Does Alchemy Pay’s Entry into Real World Assets Crypto Mean? Alchemy Pay, known for facilitating easy crypto-to-fiat transactions and payments, is now setting its sights on bringing tangible value from the traditional financial world onto the blockchain. By partnering with Backed, they are directly addressing a growing demand within the crypto space for exposure to familiar assets like stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without leaving the digital ecosystem. This initiative represents a significant step in bridging the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional markets, offering crypto users novel investment opportunities. Unlocking Global Access with Tokenized Assets and Crypto ETFs The core of this partnership involves leveraging Backed’s specialized xStocks infrastructure. This technology allows for the creation of Tokenized Assets – digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or value of underlying traditional assets. Alchemy Pay plans to utilize this to launch an impressive selection of 55 tokenized U.S. ETFs and stocks. This is particularly impactful for regions that have historically faced significant barriers to accessing U.S. investment products due to geographical restrictions, complex regulations, or high transaction costs. By tokenizing these assets, Alchemy Pay aims to democratize access, allowing individuals globally to invest in popular U.S. market instruments directly using cryptocurrencies or even fiat through their platform. Think of it this way: instead of going through traditional brokers, international banks, and navigating complex cross-border regulations, users could potentially acquire tokens representing fractional ownership in a major U.S. tech stock or a broad market ETF directly via the Alchemy Pay platform, powered by Backed Finance’s technology. When Can We Expect These Tokenized Assets? According to reports, the platform enabling these transactions is scheduled to go live in August. This timeline suggests that users could soon have direct access to this new class of assets. The focus will be on enabling seamless fiat-to-RWA transactions, meaning users can use their local currency to purchase these Crypto ETFs and tokenized stocks directly, removing the need to first acquire and then convert other cryptocurrencies. Benefits of This Alchemy Pay RWA Expansion Alchemy Pay’s move into the Alchemy Pay RWA sector, facilitated by Backed Finance, offers several potential benefits: Increased Accessibility: Opens up U.S. stock and ETF markets to a global audience previously excluded. Enhanced Efficiency: Blockchain technology can potentially streamline the investment process, reducing intermediaries and settlement times compared to traditional systems. Diversification: Provides crypto investors with an easy way to diversify their portfolios with exposure to traditional, regulated financial instruments. Fiat On-Ramps: The planned fiat-to-RWA capability simplifies the process for newcomers, removing a significant hurdle for mainstream adoption. Liquidity: Tokenization can potentially improve the liquidity of traditionally less accessible assets by making them easily tradable on digital platforms. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of easily accessible Tokenized Assets is exciting, there are challenges to consider: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for RWAs and Crypto ETFs is still evolving globally. Compliance across different jurisdictions will be crucial. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying traditional assets that back the tokens is paramount. Backed Finance’s infrastructure plays a key role here. Market Adoption: Educating users and gaining widespread adoption for this new method of accessing traditional assets will take time and effort. Token Price vs. Underlying Asset: While designed to track the underlying asset’s price, potential discrepancies can arise due to market dynamics on the token platform. Actionable Insights for Investors and Users For those interested in leveraging this development: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Alchemy Pay and Backed regarding the August launch. Understand the Assets: Before investing, research the specific U.S. ETFs and stocks being tokenized, just as you would with traditional investments. Review Platform Details: Familiarize yourself with the Alchemy Pay platform’s interface, fees, and the process for buying and selling these tokenized assets. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: While based on traditional assets, investing via tokenized platforms carries specific risks related to the crypto market and the tokenization process itself. The Future of Finance: A Blend of Crypto and Traditional Alchemy Pay’s partnership with Backed Finance marks a significant milestone in the convergence of crypto and traditional finance. By making Real World Assets Crypto more accessible through tokenization, they are not only expanding their own services but also contributing to the broader acceptance and utility of blockchain technology. The launch of Crypto ETFs and stocks on their platform via Backed’s infrastructure could unlock new investment avenues for millions globally, fostering a more inclusive financial ecosystem.

Fred Rispoli, an attorney and well-respected figure in the XRP community, has addressed these concerns, offering insight into what may happen next. In a reply posted on June 11, he stated, “I’m betting we see Ripple and SEC file the Rule 60 motion to Torres tomorrow or Monday”. This anticipated filing could be critical ahead of the June 16 deadline for a status update in the Second Circuit. I'm betting we see Ripple and SEC file the Rule 60 motion to Torres tomorrow or Monday. Otherwise there is nothing good for the parties to tell the 2nd Cir in their 6/16 status report. If they file with Torres before the status report, then solid chance 2nd Cir gives another 60… — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 11, 2025 Time Pressure Ahead of the Status Report Earlier on June 4, Rispoli had pointed out that despite the deadline fast approaching, there was still “no refile yet by SEC and Ripple in district court.” He emphasized that the June 16 status update looms large and suggested that a refile would likely occur before that deadline. If nothing is pending before her at that time, then the parties may be left with little to report. While both parties initially filed the settlement agreement, Judge Torres rejected the filing as it was made under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, but should have been brought under Rule 60. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rispoli added that the denial of the first request would be all that the Second Circuit has to review if no motion is filed beforehand. Without a refile, the appellate court may push the case out another 60 days, further delaying resolution. However, if the motion is filed, the Second Circuit may consider granting additional time. Rispoli also previously speculated about the next step in the case and revisited the tone set by Judge Torres. According to him, her message was “clear that both parties need to beg for forgiveness.” He remarked that while Ripple might be willing to do so publicly, it remains to be seen how far the SEC will be allowed to go. Countdown to June 16 With only a few days left until that deadline, the focus now shifts to Judge Torres’ docket. If Ripple and the SEC file the Rule 60 motion as predicted, it could buy both sides more time and clarity in the appeal process. XRP is expected to rise following the June 16 deadline , and a prominent analyst recently highlighted a six-month consolidation pattern meant to be completed on that day. Positive developments in the lawsuit could contribute significantly to XRP’s growth, and the community is eagerly anticipating a move from either party before the deadline.

(WLFI) has released updates on its official website, revealing the addition of Bridge and Swap modules centered around its USD1 stablecoin. While the Bridge function appears to be live, the Swap, Lending, and dedicated WLFI App modules remain marked as “coming soon,” showing the project’s staged rollout strategy. The latest update positions WLFI closer to launching a fully integrated DeFi protocol that will eventually include lending, borrowing, and broader cross-chain utility. Although the Swap module and other features are not yet operational, their presence on the platform indicates that development is progressing and that further announcements may follow as backend integration and regulatory alignment continue. Understanding USD1: A Regulated Stablecoin Central to WLFI’s ecosystem is USD1, a fully reserved stablecoin issued by BitGo. Each USD1 token is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and backed by assets such as short-term U.S. Treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents. The USD1 trading competition is heating up Current leaderboard just dropped — over $360M volume already on PancakeSwap V3. Let’s see who ends up with that treasury-backed buy https://t.co/BPxOxWeyZ9 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) June 11, 2025 BitGo Trust Company and BitGo Technologies LLC jointly handle issuance, redemptions, and custody, providing both legal structure and technical infrastructure for USD1’s operations. These reserves are securely held for the benefit of token holders, offering a traditional institutional-grade level of security and transparency. BitGo’s involvement lends institutional credibility to USD1, positioning it as a stablecoin option for users seeking high levels of compliance and reliability. Eligible BitGo customers can redeem their USD1 directly for dollars, while other users may transact or exchange USD1 on supporting platforms, pending availability and compliance requirements. The Road Ahead for WLFI and USD1 While WLFI’s Trump-linked branding has drawn public interest and speculation, the project appears intent on carving out a functional presence within the DeFi space. The plan to integrate USD1 into modules for lending, borrowing, and cross-chain swaps shows a broader vision of merging political branding with emerging financial infrastructure. Though many tools remain in development, the appearance of these modules and the clarity around USD1’s structure suggest that WLFI plans a gradual but credible rollout.

In June, as traders search for the next big altcoin surge, identifying top performers becomes crucial. This guide offers insights and strategies to uncover the altcoins poised for significant growth this month. Discover the potential gems that could shape your June trading success. Uniswap Price Action: Monthly Gains Amid 6-Month Decline and Bullish Signals UNI experienced a 20.48% monthly increase and a notable 25.76% weekly surge, following a significant 52.86% drop over the last six months. This pattern indicates a coin capable of short-term rallies while facing ongoing long-term declines. The volatility suggests renewed interest but highlights the lack of a stable upward trend over more extended periods. Current price action ranges between $4.62 and $7.59, with resistance at $9.12 and support around $3.20. A secondary resistance level is set at $12.08, while broader support is close to $0.239. Momentum is at 2.043, and the RSI stands near 68.53, indicating bullish tendencies in the short term. Traders might consider entering near $3.20 and targeting exits around $9.12, with continuous monitoring of market dynamics to navigate the prevailing bearish pressure. SPX6900 Sees Remarkable Gains and Approaches Key Resistance Levels SPX6900 recorded a nearly 100% increase over the past month and over 120% in the last six months. The coin experienced rapid gains from its lower price of $0.58 to $1.31, demonstrating strong upward movement and increasing trader interest. Robust percentage increases indicate heightened market activity and investor enthusiasm. Price behavior during these periods shows clear signs of bullish momentum and growing appeal within the market. Traders are reacting positively to the coin’s performance, driving notable gains in both short-term and long-term phases. The current price is between $0.58 and $1.31, with resistance at $1.63 and a secondary level at $2.37. Primary support is at $0.15. The Relative Strength Index at 75.80 signals an overbought condition, suggesting caution, while a momentum indicator of 0.52 and an Awesome Oscillator of 0.39 indicate ongoing bullish action. Bulls dominate the market, pushing prices up, but pressure builds near resistance levels where profit-taking may occur. Trading ideas involve watching for pullbacks near key support and securing profits as prices approach resistance, employing tight stop losses to manage risks effectively. Internet Computer Price Dynamics and Key Market Levels Internet Computer saw a modest gain over the past month, but it faced a significant drop over the last six months. A notable increase indicates some short-term recovery amid longer-term struggles. Recent price rallies contrast with the earlier decline, showing uneven market sentiment. Although the coin experienced fluctuations across different timeframes, the optimism from recent performance highlights the potential for further recovery if the short-term trend continues. The current market places Internet Computer within a trading range from $4.19 to $5.88, with buyers and sellers competing near these levels. Immediate resistance appears at $6.85, with stronger resistance at $8.54. Support is at $3.47, with a deeper level near $1.78. Technical indicators show mixed signals; modest bullish pressure is evident, though caution is advised due to a slightly negative Oscillators Recommendation. Bulls have short-term control, but the lack of a clear long-term trend necessitates careful trading. A strategy may involve buying near support and selling at resistance while monitoring momentum shifts. Arbitrum Price Actions and Key Level Zones Last month saw a nearly 10% decline as ARB trended lower, marked by moderate drops and volatile shifts. The past six months witnessed a steep decrease of over 60%, indicating a significant downward correction that has weighed on sentiment. A one-week surge of about 13% brought some optimism, though it was insufficient to erase deeper losses. Historical price swings from roughly $0.2549 to $0.4648 highlight sharp fluctuations, while the prolonged decline shows the coin’s vulnerability amid broader market shifts. At present, ARB trades between roughly $0.2549 and $0.4648 with resistance around $0.5898 and support near $0.1699. A second resistance can be found at about $0.7997, while there’s no lower support below zero. Indicators show mixed signals, with positive momentum yet slight caution indicated by the Awesome Oscillator. Bulls are applying some pressure within these levels, but a clear upward trend is absent. Trading in the current range may provide opportunities for short-term gains, especially if prices retrace to the support level before testing resistance. Conclusion UNI , SPX , ICP , and ARB present promising opportunities for investors this June. Monitoring their performance and key indicators is essential. Adapting to market shifts and staying informed can help identify the best moments to enter or exit positions. Following these tips can maximize potential gains in a dynamic market.

While most altcoins staged recoveries through June, PI continued to slide, signaling a disconnect from broader market tailwinds. That prolonged sell-off has left PI down 43% over the past month, making it the worst performer among the top 100. But recent bullish momentum may have finally caught up to the token. Shaky Fundamentals Cloud Bullish Technical Outlook Despite the bullish technical outlook, Pi Coin’s future may hinge on ecosystem fundamentals as it stands at a crossroads, according to an X post by well-known PI commentator Pi Barter Mall. In their pessimistic outlook, Pi Barter Mall noted slow ecosystem development as the central obstacle to long-term growth. The fact of the matter is that the Pi ecosystem continues to struggle with adoption. Its price action remains largely speculative, lacking a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth. This has also opened the door to liquidity issues, with short-term speculative trading amplifying deflationary pressure as unlocks continue at an average rate of $7 million PI tokens per day. PI token unlock schedule. Source: Piscan . The market struggles to absorb the excess supply without a rise in demand to stabilise Pi Coin price moves. Still, there is an optimistic case. Pi Barter Mall notes that mainstream exchange listings, such as a potential debut on Binance, could serve as major catalysts. If large-scale applications can be achieved, Pi Barter Mall suggests Pi could reclaim its $1–$3 range with real utility to encourage HODLing over flipping. Pi Price Analysis: Could a Golden Cross Push a Reversal? Given the underlying fundamental challenges, a $10 valuation for Pi Coin remains unrealistic—at least until Pi Barter Mall’s optimistic scenario materialises. That said, Pi coin could make a start on technical momentum alone as the recent breakout of a May-born falling wedge pattern pushes a potential golden cross on the daily. PI / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge. Source: TradingView, OKX. The MACD line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line, poised to flash green for the first time since Consensus 2025 unfolded as a sell-the-news event. Selling pressure appears exhausted, with the RSI rebounding from deep bearish territory at 40—an early signal that buy pressure is returning, opening the door for the next leg up. If momentum continues, the pattern suggests a potential 40% Pi Coin price rally to $0.8725, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level. Should bulls push further toward $1, Pi Coin would face a key accumulation zone at the 0.5 Fibonnaci level—a potential catalyst to fuel growth. However, if the golden cross is delayed or falters, strong support at $0.60 remains the critical downside level to watch for signs of a reversal. The Bull Market Could Be Back – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as altcoins continue to lag behind the leading cryptocurrency. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $7 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 57% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

The New York-based digital fintech firm aims to use the funds to acquire and hold BTC as part of a broader strategy to reshape its treasury operations through tokenized finance. Mercurity Fintech Bets Big on Bitcoin According to the official press release , MFH plans to store the assets using institutional-grade blockchain custody infrastructure while integrating staking services and tokenized treasury tools to unlock yield and capital efficiency. The initiative represents a transition from traditional treasury models to a blockchain-aligned reserve structure designed to boost long-term asset exposure and bolster financial resilience. In parallel, MFH is set to move from the Russell Microcap Index to the Russell 2000 and 3000, a development that could enhance visibility among institutional investors and signal market validation for its blockchain-centric approach. In an official statement, Shi Qiu, CEO of the company, said, “We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.” Bitcoin on the Books A growing number of public companies are integrating digital assets into their treasuries, with 117 firms now holding over 800,000 BTC, as per Binance Research’s latest stats . Recent adopters include GameStop, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., and Nakamoto, all following a model first implemented by Strategy and Michael Saylor. Trump Media & Technology Group joined the wave with a $2.5 billion Bitcoin initiative backed by 50 institutions. Ethereum is also gaining traction, as evidenced by SharpLink recently launching a $425 million ETH strategy advised by Consensys’ Joseph Lubin. Japan-based Metaplanet also continued its aggressive BTC acquisition. More recently, the Oslo-based cryptocurrency brokerage company, K33, also started holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after raising $6.22 million via interest-free loans and new share and warrant issues.

U.S. stock indices erased early morning losses on hopes that a lower consumer price index reading might contribute to monetary easing. On Tuesday, June 12, the Dow Jones was up 0.17%, or 70 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both gained 0.35%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks Low inflation data is still influencing trader sentiment, with many anticipating potential rate cuts following last month’s soft CPI figures. Still, the Federal Reserve has remained hesitant to lower rates, citing the potential inflationary effects of U.S. tariffs on major trading partners. This hesitation has been met with continued pressure from the White House. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated that the Federal Reserve should cut rates by one point. While he clarified that he would not seek to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he noted he might have to “force something” on rates.

Shares of the aircraft manufacturer were down 4.5%, as the latest crash compounded recent scandals involving the company. In 2024, the company faced a series of scandals , all starting with one plane that had its door ripped in mid-air. This led to whistleblowers exposing corner-cutting when it comes to safety, as well as attempted coverups.

The firm revised its expected revenue for 2026 to $67 billion, up from the previous estimate of $66 billion. The reason for the revised forecast is the expected growing demand for its AI-powered cloud services. The revenue from its cloud service rose 14% quarterly, largely due to the built-in and integrated AI services the company provides. Read more: Inflation is up but below expectations.

Try PEPETO Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lost-on-how-to-claim-solaxy-try-pepeto-instead/,"The world of memecoins moves quickly, and it can be easy to become overwhelmed, although it does not help that many projects promise the world and deliver very little. With the maturation of the market, investors are looking past shiny logos and meme hype and into utility. Amid this shift, one project is making serious waves: Pepeto. Dubbed the “God of frogs,” Pepeto is more than just another memecoin; it’s positioning itself as a long-term player in a space often defined by short-term thinking. With a presale nearing its final stretch, a robust ecosystem in development, and investor rewards that rival established DeFi projects, Pepeto is attracting serious attention. As uncertainty surrounds how to claim projects like Solaxy, Pepeto offers a refreshing alternative that’s easier to engage with and backed by real infrastructure. Pepeto’s Ecosystem: Fun, Rewards, and Real Utility Pepeto is more than just a symbol of meme culture; it’s a platform designed with a purpose. Built around the acronym PEPETO (Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Transparency, Optimization), the project offers strong fundamentals. The token price is currently at $0.000000134, and the current figure is $5,390,850.38 out of its $5,637,184 presale hard cap. REMINDER : LISTING APPLICATIONS IN PEPETO EXCHANGE ARE BEING VIEWED BY A DEDICATED TEAM, STARTING FROM TODAY. CHECK OFFIClAL WEBSITE TO FILL THE FORM IN. COMMENT $PEPETO ⬇️ 🔗 : https://t.co/uo5vOks5PH pic.twitter.com/Cjxbz0SFfw — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) April 24, 2025 Besides staking rewards of up to 286% APY, the project is preparing to launch PepetoSwap, a decentralized exchange that will host only vetted, utility-driven tokens. This reduces the chances of a scam and develops confidence in the investors. What is more, the integration with wallets is smooth through MetaMask and Best Wallet, where one can purchase and stake with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Pepeto’s simplicity and accessibility, combined with real features, are why it’s being called the best crypto to buy right now. Strong Community, Clear Vision: Why Pepeto May Lead the Pack The movement is gaining momentum. Pepeto’s developers are actively releasing updates ahead of what they call the “day of judgement.” These are sophisticated features, such as cross-chain bridge compatibility and staking mechanisms that compete with leading DeFi protocols. Furthermore, the community growth is escalating throughout social media, which means that an increased interest is developing among retail and experienced investors. Many early backers now believe Pepeto could be the next token to deliver returns. While that’s a bold prediction, Pepeto’s infrastructure gives it a solid shot. For those feeling left behind or confused by other presale projects, now is the time to join Pepeto before the window closes. Still Stuck on Solaxy? Pepeto Might Be the Smarter Bet Solaxy has made headlines as a Layer-2 solution tackling Solana’s congestion. Its ecosystem includes the Igniter Protocol for creating tokens and a DEX for trading them instantly. The technology is promising, but a token-claiming process has frustrated some investors. Despite the fact that more than 13.3 billion tokens have been staked and $47 million have been raised, everyday users still face obstacles. The presale closes on June 16, and many people are yet to know how to participate effectively. If the complexity of Solaxy feels overwhelming, Pepeto offers a simpler and more transparent entry point, complete with rewards and a clear path forward. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful, utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

This blockchain-AI hybrid project has garnered momentum after announcing an audit by Cyberscope and releasing impressive ROI forecasts. With its innovative approach and strong early performance, Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the blockchain sector. Cardano (ADA): The Champion of Sustainability Since its launch in 2017, Cardano has distinguished itself through a focus on sustainability, scalability, and research-backed development. The platform’s adoption of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism established it as an energy-efficient alternative in the blockchain world. Cardano thrives on its academic rigor, with each development phase underpinned by peer-reviewed research. Its capabilities span decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise use cases, and beyond. Despite these achievements, Cardano is seeing competition heat up as emerging projects like Ruvi AI bring new use cases and high-growth potential to the forefront. Record-Breaking Presale Fuels Ruvi AI’s Growth Ruvi AI’s presale has been a resounding success, underscoring investor confidence. Phase 1 of the presale closed in just two weeks, pricing tokens at $0.010. Early adopters gained 50% when Phase 2 launched at $0.015 per token. Today, over 1,500 holders have joined Ruvi AI, and the project has already raised $1.6 million. The project has also achieved key milestones, including securing its first exchange listing and forming a partnership with a well-regarded trading platform. These moves bolster Ruvi AI’s accessibility and liquidity, fueling anticipation for its upcoming developments. Audit by Cyberscope Solidifies Trust Ruvi AI’s announcement of an ongoing audit by Cyberscope is a critical moment for the project. Cyberscope, a trusted blockchain security firm, will rigorously assess Ruvi AI’s code and security measures. This audit builds transparency, a vital element in achieving investor trust and establishing credibility. The audit positions Ruvi AI as a reliable project with a commitment to security and long-term viability. Combined with its real-world utility and innovative vision, the project has the potential to rival even the most established platforms, such as Cardano. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Where Blockchain Meets AI Ruvi AI combines blockchain’s decentralized security with artificial intelligence (AI) to reimagine the possibilities of technology. The platform operates as a superapp, offering users the ability to generate AI-driven content, including text, audio, video, and images. This innovative application makes Ruvi AI a powerful tool for industries focused on marketing, automation, and content creation. The $RUVI token is the lifeblood of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem. It enables transactions, rewards stakeholders through staking, and grants governance rights, ensuring users have a voice in the platform’s development. By addressing real-world challenges, Ruvi AI sets itself apart in a market where utility is paramount. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI’s presale offers high-growth potential through its VIP tiers, rewarding early investors with substantial bonuses. Here are three scenarios based on the $0.015 presale price, $0.07 listing price, and a post-launch valuation of $1: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015 per token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015 per token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015 per token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). The potential returns demonstrate how Ruvi AI appeals to investors seeking substantial growth in the crypto market. The Final Word Ruvi AI’s innovative blend of blockchain and AI, combined with its strong presale results and audit-driven transparency, establishes it as a project with immense promise. While Cardano remains a respected pioneer in the blockchain space, Ruvi AI’s real-world utility and rapid investor-driven momentum make it a compelling alternative. For those eager to invest in the next big breakthrough, Ruvi AI offers a rare opportunity to secure high returns. The time to act is now, as the project’s early achievements pave the way for a bright and groundbreaking future.

The move, signed into law as Public Act No. 25-66 on June 10, 2025, is done at a time when the majority of states — and the federal government — actively examine the place of Bitcoin and other digital assets in public fiscal policy. The new bill, endorsed by the Senate and House unanimously, expressly forbids state treasury, pension funds, and other state-operated institutions from investing any funds in Bitcoin or any other digital currencies. It also forbids state and local governments to receive payments in crypto for taxes, fees, or any other use, and prevents establishing a state-backed crypto reserve. Notably, the ban only holds for state services and public funds — Connecticut businesspeople and residents are otherwise free to buy, sell, and use crypto as governed by existing laws. Connecticut's action is also the reverse of a growing trend among other states. Arizona and New Hampshire already have legislation enacted to create state Bitcoin reserves, and Texas and North Carolina are presently deliberating the same. This is all the more surprising in the context of President Donald Trump issuing an executive order in March 2025 to request that federal agencies develop a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve from seized digital assets, demonstrating pro-crypto attitudes at the federal level. Lawmakers Cite Risks, Critics Warn of Missed Opportunity The supporters of Connecticut's prohibition claim that it is an informed choice to protect public money from the extreme volatility, security risks, and accounting intricacies of virtual assets. Lawmakers utilized the volatility of virtual currencies, the susceptibility to cyberattacks, and the intricacy of valuing such assets as key reasons for the prohibition. The bill also creates new standards for crypto businesses operating in the state, such as stricter licensing, compliance, and notification of customers, and stronger protections for minors who use digital wallets or crypto kiosks. Others warn that the ban will cut Connecticut taxpayers off from possible Bitcoin profits and stifle innovation. ”Connecticut has chosen to miss this opportunity—at least for now.”. But whereas other states are luckier in enjoying the fruits of Bitcoin reserves, we expect Connecticut to reconsider,” said Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter. Certain lawyers term the action symbolic rather than real, a political move and not one in reaction to truly existing threats, and cite the Democratic Party's firm grip on the state as being a key force in the bill's passage. Will Other States Follow Connecticut’s Lead — or Rebel? The state's move also hints at the piecemeal nature of U.S. cryptocurrency policy. While 27 states have introduced bills allowing public funds to invest in Bitcoin or other high-market-cap tokens, an ever-growing list — Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona included — have spurned or stymied such legislation in 2025 alone. This patchwork approach has created confusion for crypto business and investors, who must navigate a maze of incompatible state regimes and solutions to digital assets. While the controversy smolders, though, the issue is whether Connecticut's strong stance will prompt other states to emulate it with bans of their own, or whether it will provoke a backlash and fresh attempts at bringing digital assets into state coffers elsewhere. With the federal government's own plan for a Bitcoin reserve still in its infancy, the fate of state crypto policy far from determined.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-12 18:01:26

As Q3 approaches, two digital assets stand out with great potential. This article will explore the strategic blend of Chainlink (LINK) and POL (ex-MATIC) in creating a resilient and promising crypto portfolio. Discover the hidden gems poised for significant growth in the upcoming quarter. Chainlink Price Action: Mixed Signals Amid Recovery and Decline Chainlink traded between $12.14 and $16.89, displaying mixed behavior in recent months. A weekly gain of 8.10% contrasted with a monthly decline of 10.73%, with a six-month drop of 47.60% underscoring a longer-term downturn. These price movements indicate recovery periods interrupted by significant sell-offs, leading to divided investor sentiment. Market indicators reflecting momentum and relative strength have produced mixed signals, highlighting ongoing volatility. Recent price action illustrates uncertainty, as short-term rallies have failed to reverse the persistent downward trend, maintaining a cautious atmosphere among traders who remain alert to potential rebounds. Currently, Chainlink has support at $10.30 and key resistance at $19.80, with a secondary support level at $5.55 and upper resistance at $24.55. The price action between these levels reflects a struggle between bulls and bears, with buyers attempting to push prices higher despite underlying weakness. The relative strength index around 55.13 suggests stability but lacks clear dominance. Subdued momentum indicators accompany the Awesome Oscillator, indicating cautious buying interest. A sustained hold above $10.30 could set the stage for a test of $19.80, while any slip below support may prompt further declines. Traders should look to buy near support and employ risk management strategies while observing price activity around these critical levels for clearer trends. POL (ex-MATIC) Trading Outlook and Price Zones POL dropped roughly 11.44% over the last month and about 63.77% over the past six months, with a small one-week gain of 5.02% showing some short-term recovery. Price action over these periods has been volatile, reflecting shifts in sentiment and uncertainty among holders. The movement illustrates the challenges faced by this token, marked by significant downward pressure over half a year combined with brief spurts of strength. Currently trading between $0.1839 and $0.2603, the coin faces key resistance levels at $0.3068 and $0.3832 while finding support near $0.1540 and a secondary floor at $0.0776. The technical indicators present a mixed picture; a slightly positive momentum indicator of 0.0109 and an RSI around 52 hint at balance, yet the Awesome Oscillator at -0.0143 suggests a touch of bearish pressure. Bulls and bears appear evenly matched, resulting in a market lacking a clear directional trend. Traders might explore long entries near the immediate support level, while setting tight stop-loss orders below the secondary support. Conversely, short positions could be considered if prices near the resistance levels fail to break higher. Conclusion Combining LINK and POL can create an effective investment strategy. LINK offers strong potential due to its established utility in blockchain technology. POL adds value with its innovative approach. Together, they can diversify risk and increase the chance of positive returns. This diversified approach could cater to different market conditions and investor goals. This mix of established and emerging options makes for a balanced and promising portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 704,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely enter an uptrend and hit $116,000 by early next week after a pullback from the $110,000 level. “Bitcoin: new all-time highs [Thursday].” Source: Kaleo/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin may no longer adhere to its four-year cycle, an idea that the flagship crypto asset has a predictable pattern connected to its halving events, when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. “I believe this is where we finally break out of the traditional four-year cycle revolving around the Bitcoin halving. Higher for longer. Supercycle.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,354 at time of writing, down 2.2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may repeat a similar 2020 pattern and soon enter an explosive uptrend. “A lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now versus where we were in 2020. Spring of 2020 there was a major selloff from the COVID crash that sent ETH beneath HTF (high timeframe) support. Once that line was reclaimed, ETH was up only for the next 20 months. The recent selloff that led to the break beneath HTF support was caused by the Trump Tariff scare in the market. ETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line. Will history repeat itself with this leading to another great ETH bull run and accompanying alt season?” Source: Kaleo/X ETH is trading for $2,754 at time of writing, down 3.6% on the day.

Whether it’s a new AI tool, a fresh way to earn passive income, or just a course that makes us see the space differently, we are proud to build a culture where we can continuously grow and learn as a team. Not because we have to, but because we want to grow. Together. We also care about our readers. You’ve been with us through the market swings, the memes, and the milestones. So it is part of our duty to share good stuff when we find it, not only the juiciest news pieces but something that gives even more value to our readers. Here’s a peek at some of the courses we’re exploring this quarter. Some helped us think smarter. Some helped us earn more. Some just helped us feel less overwhelmed. We hope they do the same for you. Let’s keep growing together. The Defi Passive Income Plan The Defi Passive Income Plan “DeFi isn’t complicated if you start with the right system.” Built by someone managing millions, this course shows you how to earn passive income the smart way. Where: Cryptopolitan Academy Why it matters in 2025: In a year where inflation keeps eating savings, banks are still paying 2%, and everyone is chasing speculative altcoins, the smartest players are doing something simple, but wildly effective: parking stablecoins in DeFi to earn 10–30% yields. This course shows you exactly how to do that: safely, strategically, and without spending hours in DeFi complexities. What’s in it: This isn’t another “DeFi 101” video lecture series. It’s a 3-step, battle-tested, beginner-proof system built by someone who’s already managing millions in crypto: not some influencer chasing affiliate clicks. Created by Karnika E. Yashwant , the founder behind KEY Difference and advisor to global crypto funds, this course distills over $1M of personal investing experience into a 2-hour roadmap that even your TradFi cousin could follow. Here’s what it delivers: Step 1: Smart Setup The course starts with the most basic of instructions in a step wise manner. Learning the exact wallets, platforms, and security protocols top DeFi investors use and how to avoid scams, minimize fees, and start from a position of strength and not confusion. The course shows every step live and provides materials that can be referred to at any time. Step 2: Start Earning (Without Trading) The click-by-click walkthrough of how to earn real yield (12–30%) from your stablecoins. Karnika walks through where to deposit, how to avoid common rookie traps, and how to actually make money on-chain without trading or degen-ing into rug pulls. Step 3: Scale & Reinvest Investing is one thing, but scaling and managing is the key to a long term sustainable portfolio. Karnika teaches how one can reinvest the yield, track performance with simple tools, and compound earnings monthly, that too all in under 20 minutes of maintenance per month. Yes, really. More perks that are included: Risk-optimized strategies backed by personal investment results Clear guides on when to withdraw, rebalance, or exit profitably Access to a private Telegram group with direct mentorship from Karnika and his team Detailed guides and workbooks Why you should care: Because your savings account isn’t saving anything. In 2025, stablecoin yields are one of the most underutilized tools for building real, sustainable wealth and most people either don’t know they exist or assume they’re too complicated. This course changes that. It doesn’t just show you where to put your money. It teaches you how to protect it, grow it, and outpace inflation without gambling on memecoins or staring at charts. Whether you have $500 or $50K, this course helps you put idle capital to work. Also: there’s a money-back + earnings guarantee. If you don’t earn at least double the Fed’s benchmark rate in the first 30 days, Karnika will refund the course and pay you the difference. Try getting that from your bank. Worth it if you: Are tired of watching your cash earn 3-5% a year in a savings account Want passive income without being a full-time trader Have money sitting on the sidelines but no clear system for deploying it Value guidance from someone with skin in the game and real receipts Want to get your first crypto earnings started tonight , not next quarter If you’re serious about building wealth in 2025, you need more than hot tips and hype coins: you need a system. The DeFi Passive Income Plan gives you one. It’s fast, safe, and designed to grow your money while you sleep. You don’t need to be technical. You don’t need to be rich. You just need to stop settling for 1% and start doing what the pros are doing. And with Karnika’s zero-risk guarantee, the only way you lose is by waiting. Secure your spot. Set it up tonight. Wake up earning tomorrow. This is how you win in the new financial system. Join the plan now.

On the other hand, the CEO of Bank of America also announced that the bank is working on stablecoin projects both on its own and with the sector. These developments show that the US financial system's interest in the digital dollar is increasing. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in his statements to Congress that stablecoins could reinforce the dollar's status as a global reserve currency.

The reclaim of the value area low followed by a clean move through the point of control suggests strong demand and trend conviction. The current pullback is now retracing into a powerful support cluster. This includes: The point of control A bullish order block A BOS/SR flip And the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement This makes it a high-confluence demand zone and a logical place for price to form a higher low — which would keep the bullish structure fully intact. As long as this zone holds, SUI is structurally poised for a move toward the $3.49 resistance, the next key level in the local trend. A break of this region could trigger a new wave of buying and set up the asset for higher highs. What to expect in the coming price action SUI remains in a bullish structure following its recent breakout. If the current support confluence zone holds, the next leg higher could target the $3.49 level and potentially beyond. However, failure to defend this zone would invalidate the higher low and introduce deeper correction targets. Until then, the bias remains bullish.

The project has raised $18.3 million in its presale, with its tokens priced at $0.007. It has also been attracting attention among investors due to its AI-powered blockchain integration. Unlike many tokens, Lightchain AI offers investors a transparent and scalable platform, adding decentralized governance to make it better than most tokens with hype. With its roadmap showing progress toward mainnet launch and platform expansion in 2025, investors have started asking if Lightchain AI could perform better than some new projects. However, based on early attention, the project has what it takes to be successful. 2025 Crypto Forecast- Which Altcoins Are Set to Dominate? In 2025, new digital assets are expected to enter the crypto market, and as more enter the market, the fight for control gets bigger. Despite the volatility in the market, it is possible to see which tokens perform better than the others when it comes to some metrics. One important aspect is the utility of the project’s token and its application in different areas. In this context, one thing that sets Lightchain AI apart is its focus on AI-based technologies, combining blockchain and decentralized governance to give traders a platform that works. Thanks to this system, AI-friendly projects are given an edge. Moreover, the team behind Lightchain AI deserves a special mention. The future of the project is promising since its experienced team is mixing blockchain and AI to create the platform. The project is also expected to lead the market in the future because the team is building it on a better base, using it to drive development in the crypto market. Lightchain AI’s Growth Potential Compared to Market Rivals Lightchain AI stands out in the crypto market due to its roadmap and investor attention.

This shows that there is strong demand from investors, with the project using its focus on integrating AI with blockchain technology to provide scalability and boost long-term adoption. Its mainnet is set for March 2025 and plans to move into an open-source platform by August are in the works. These moves will position the platform for the relevance it needs to stay in the crypto market. The project is also expected to deliver profits to investors starting from now, providing an early entry stage better than some of its rivals in the market. Why Lightchain AI Could Outperform Competition in 2025 While many altcoins boast better technologies and teams, Lightchain AI stands out in the market due to its focus on building a transparent, scalable, and decentralized platform. The platform also removes blockchain issues like high transaction fees and slow processing times, positioning itself to win over individuals and businesses in the crypto industry. But that’s not all–Lightchain AI takes it a step further by mixing AI technology, enabling smart data analysis and automated operations. This makes the platform the best for industries that depend on data processing, providing the opportunity for partnerships and real-world applications.

While the lucrative potential of Bitcoin cannot be denied, investors are increasingly seeking safer and more innovative alternatives in the market. Enter Ruvi AI, a project combining transparency, scalability, and cutting-edge technology to offer an enticing opportunity for those looking to minimize risk while maximizing returns.

The platform’s partnership with WEEX Exchange is a major milestone, facilitating global accessibility and adding considerable liquidity to its ecosystem. This collaboration enhances investor confidence by establishing Ruvi AI as a credible player in a crowded market. Another key highlight is its upcoming CyberScope audit, which aims to independently validate the platform’s security infrastructure and code integrity. This third-party evaluation ensures safety and transparency, two critical elements that many projects often lack. By proactively welcoming scrutiny, Ruvi AI demonstrates its commitment to building long-term trust with its investor base, creating a solid foundation for future growth. Driving impact across marketing, entertainment, and finance Ruvi AI’s real-world applications are another factor that sets it apart. By blending blockchain and artificial intelligence, the project delivers practical solutions across three key industries.

Currently in Phase 2, tokens are available at an accessible $0.015 each, making this the perfect entry point for investors seeking a promising asset at an early stage. What makes Ruvi AI particularly attractive is its structured valuation strategy, which sets the token price at $0.07 post-presale. Unlike speculative projects, this growth is pre-planned, transparent, and designed to inspire confidence. Furthermore, analysts forecast a $1 valuation post-listing, underscoring its long-term potential for exponential returns.

It’s a place where innovation meets tradition; this fusion is evident in every aspect of life, including entertainment. While gambling is generally frowned upon in the UAE due to religious reasons, the advent of online crypto casinos has opened a new avenue for residents and tourists alike. These platforms offer a discreet, secure, and highly engaging gambling experience, all from the comfort of your home or luxurious Dubai hotel room. Enthusiasts of online casino gaming in the UAE are experiencing a golden era. The market is flooded with top-notch digital platforms that are secure and eager to accommodate your gaming needs. What’s more, several of these platforms even allow you to place bets in dirham and offer Arabic language support, making the gaming experience incredibly user-friendly for residents of the Emirates. In this article, we aim to equip you with all the essential information you’ll need to engage with real-money online casinos in the UAE fully. We’ll discuss the inception of crypto casinos in Dubai, their legality, and the best casinos to explore online in Dubai. From highlighting the premier platforms where you can wager real money to detailing the variety of games available and the most enticing promotional offers, we’ve got you covered. Crypto gambling in Dubai: Legality The history of gambling in the UAE is fascinating. It is rooted in longstanding Arab gaming traditions that predate the advent of contemporary casinos. Camel racing, for instance, evolved from a modest pastime to a major spectator sport over the years. Sheikh Zayed was instrumental in this evolution, initially funding car racing in the 1970s and establishing horse racing tracks in the 1990s. High-end hotels once hosted gaming parlors until legislative changes in 1998 curtailed them. It’s crucial to understand that the UAE’s legal framework is heavily influenced by Islam, its official religion, which prohibits conventional gambling as well as crypto-based casinos. Both federal and local laws reflect this prohibition, and promoting gambling is equally forbidden. The 2012 amendments to gambling laws further tightened restrictions on online gambling, leading to the blocking of multiple casino websites in 2017. Despite these constraints, a clandestine gambling culture persists, with a limited number of offshore crypto casinos catering to UAE players. The UAE Penal Code stipulates that public gambling or gambling in a designated house can result in detention or a two-year prison sentence. For those interested in online gambling, the safest route is through verified and trusted offshore online casinos, and we can guide you to the most secure options. Interestingly, the UAE is quite receptive to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, since March 2022, Dubai has emerged as a new focal point in the crypto world following the UAE’s introduction of the world’s inaugural standalone crypto regulatory body, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority. Industry giants like Binance co-founders Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and He Yi have relocated to Dubai, while Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong has engaged with its regulatory officials. Additionally, Wazirx, one of India’s leading exchanges, is shifting its headquarters to the city. This aligns with Dubai’s ambitious strategy to ascend into the ranks of global financial powerhouses like New York, London, and Hong Kong. Over the years, Dubai has cultivated its reputation as a hub for business and financial services in the Middle East, largely due to its proactive embrace of innovation. This is especially apparent in its calculated and intentional approach to crypto, which has propelled it to become the third-highest country in global crypto adoption, surpassing Hong Kong and the USA. The current landscape The UAE is not one to lag in technological advancements or global trends. Known for its booming tourism industry, the country has caught the eye of international casino operators. A notable development occurred earlier this year when Ras al-Khaimah, one of the seven emirates, announced plans to consider legalizing gaming in certain resorts. This announcement coincided with Wynn Resorts expressing interest in constructing a gambling-approved resort. This isn’t the first instance of a major international casino brand showing interest in the UAE. MGM has previously announced multiple collaborations with UAE-based companies. What sets the Wynn Resorts proposal apart is its explicit intention to include a designated gaming area, essentially a casino, in its plans. In a move to potentially boost tourism, the UAE has established a new regulatory body, the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), to oversee commercial gaming. Comprising U.S. casino and gambling experts, the GCGRA aims to develop a national lottery and commercial gaming framework. This is a significant step, given that gambling is currently illegal in the UAE. Getting started with crypto gambling Before entering crypto casinos in the UAE, it’s essential to have a strong grasp of cryptocurrency fundamentals. Numerous online resources can explain how crypto functions, equipping you with the knowledge needed to buy and sell digital assets effectively. Next, it’s crucial to identify a reputable crypto exchange that supports the specific cryptocurrencies you’re interested in trading. A reliable exchange will facilitate smooth transactions for buying and selling crypto. Given the many options available, thorough research is imperative before settling on an exchange. Additionally, it’s advisable to read customer reviews and compare pricing structures before creating an account on any crypto casino platform. Factors to consider when selecting a crypto casino in the UAE When it comes to picking a crypto casino, there are several key aspects you should weigh to make an informed decision. Here’s a rundown of what to keep in mind: Security and licensing Security is paramount in any online casino, but it has added significance in crypto casinos. When it comes to gambling in the UAE, your safety, privacy, and anonymity should be top priorities, especially given that online gambling is illegal in the country. Therefore, engaging in crypto gambling only through trustworthy platforms is crucial. In evaluating crypto casinos, we scrutinize their licensing credentials to ensure reputable international authorities accredit them. The UK Gambling Commission, Malta Gaming Authority, and the Curacao eGaming Control Board are among the most credible international licensing agencies. We thoroughly vet all crypto casinos that accept UAE players to confirm they hold valid licenses. Additionally, we look for robust security features, such as SSL encryption and stringent data protection policies, to ensure your safety. Payment options The available payment options should be a key consideration when searching for the top crypto casino in the UAE. Your funds should be securely managed, free from the risks of hacking or loss. We endorse only those Dubai-based casinos that provide secure payment methods backed by stringent security protocols. Additionally, given that crypto casinos are not legal in the UAE, it’s crucial to avoid linking your bank account directly to the gambling platform. We recommend crypto casinos that enable efficient deposits and withdrawals through your cryptocurrency wallets. This approach allows you to legally transfer your winnings from your crypto wallet to your bank account. Slots and games at Crypto Casinos When selecting crypto casinos in the UAE, a crucial aspect to weigh is the range and quality of games and slots. This encompasses several elements, such as the total number of games, the variety within those games, and the integrity of the software, ensuring fair play. We endorse only those casino platforms that feature an appealing array of games, live dealer options, and slots. Regarding slot machines, our recommendations are limited to crypto casinos that boast an extensive collection of slots and table games. Additionally, these casinos should employ provably fair technology to guarantee that each slot machine spin is fair and random. This gives you a genuine opportunity to win, free from manipulative practices. Promotional offers Many crypto casinos in the UAE entice players with appealing bonuses and promotions. Examine these incentives carefully, as they could be a valuable way to augment your funds. Customer support Customer service is a vital component of any crypto casino. Whether you need assistance for basic tasks like navigating the platform or urgent matters like resolving withdrawal issues, timely customer support is crucial. In our evaluation of crypto casinos, we strongly emphasize the responsiveness of their customer support teams. They should be accessible through various channels, including live chat, ticketing systems, and email, and should ideally respond within a 24-hour timeframe. Moreover, we prefer Dubai-based crypto casinos that offer customer support in both Arabic and English. Terms of service Always read the terms and conditions meticulously before signing up. Crypto casinos often have complex rules and limitations, and being well-informed helps you navigate potential risks. For instance, some platforms may require you to wager your earnings multiple times before withdrawal, while others may restrict certain payment methods. By considering these factors, you’ll be better equipped to find a crypto casino that best suits your needs.

USDC issuer Circle announced on June 12 that the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market cap has been deployed on the XRP Ledger, allowing developers, institutions, and users to access it directly on the network—without the need for bridging. The company said its institutional stablecoin creation platform, Circle Mint, and Circle APIs now fully support USDC on the XRPL mainnet, bolstering the stablecoin’s liquidity while enabling users to benefit from the XRPL’s fast and secure infrastructure.

XRPL is known for low transaction costs and rapid global settlements. Ripple has noted that its payments platform has processed over $70 billion in transactions to date. Developers can integrate USDC into decentralized finance products, trading applications, and on/off-ramping services. With support from Circle Mint and its APIs, institutions gain a streamlined gateway to issue, redeem, and manage USDC at scale, while taking advantage of XRPL’s decade-long track record of high throughput, low fees, and regulatory-friendly design. “Regulated stablecoins like USDC coming to the XRPL will enable new institutional and retail use cases by leveraging the ledger’s built-in capabilities for compliance, tokenization, low-cost settlement, and seamless on/off-ramps,” said Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President, RippleX. The integration marks a strategic step for Circle, coming just one week after its public listing. The move expands USDC’s footprint across major blockchain ecosystems and reinforces the firm’s commitment to embedding its stablecoin within both advanced crypto networks and legacy financial systems. For XRPL, the addition of USDC enhances its appeal to wallets and global financial service providers seeking enterprise-grade stablecoin liquidity without sacrificing security or efficiency.

45883608,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107301,1749755908,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Lead Developer Accuses Ethereum Foundation of Phasing out Geth Project,https://zycrypto.com/lead-developer-accuses-ethereum-foundation-of-phasing-out-geth-project/,"Peter Szilagyi , lead developer of Ethereum’s Go implementation Geth, voiced concerns that the Ethereum Foundation pressured developers to discontinue the Geth project. Szilagyi voiced his concerns on X, suggesting that the Ethereum Foundation (EF) had offered $5 million to detach the Geth project from Ethereum. Szilagyi also suggested that EF was funding a secret fork of Geth to replace the development team. Tomasz Stanczak, co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, denied the accusations and reiterated the importance of Geth for the Ethereum ecosystem. Szilagyi, however, maintains that the EF put pressure on developers to discontinue the Geth project. Szilagyi said he made an internal complaint but was fired within 24 hours of voicing his concerns. Szilagyi maintains that the $5 million offer was made multiple times and was a form of pressure to remove the Geth developers. The exchange of X posts online has created a tense situation that has strained relations between the EF and Geth developers. Geth is a Go Ethereum implementation of the Ethereum Client, and is the most popular one online, allowing nodes to verify blockchain transactions. The EF was created to support the Ethereum ecosystem. Szilagyi, who has much experience leading the Geth project, alleged that the EF was offloading core projects while changing its stance towards ongoing research and development. Szilagyi is convinced that the EF has funded a parallel Geth project within the Nethermind project to transition slowly away from his team. Szilagyi claims that the EF recently dismissed four development teams and plans to discontinue Geth within one year. Ethereum investors may be concerned about this news because Geth is a core technology used within the Ethereum ecosystem. Stanczak, EF co-executive director, has rejected the claims that the EF is phasing out Geth. Aya Miyaguchi, newly appointed EF President, held the position of Executive Director, which Tomasz Stanczak and Hsiao-Wei Wang took over. Stanczak has been embroiled in an online controversy involving Geth lead developer Szilagyi. Miyaguchi, moreover, was blamed for the underperformance of Ethereum during her time before receiving a promotion. Some members of the Ethereum community even blame the team members who worked under her for the sluggish performance of Ethereum. The online feud between Szilagyi and Stanczak further extends the controversies surrounding the firing of R&D staff, which started at the beginning of June. Some staff members, such as Szilagyi, may feel threatened by the firings. The EF began reorganising its staff and funding, as part of a broader strategy to make Ethereum leaner. Vitalik Buterin has made public comments praising the lean nature of Bitcoin and wishes to imitate its structure. Stanczak has defended the EF and stated that the foundation plans to keep Geth and wants to extend its capabilities as client software. The EF, however, has not responded to the claims of $5 million in funds. Due to the public exposure of the X debate, the EF may be forced to release a statement explaining key issues, such as the $5 million offers. Ethereum traders may be interested in how these events unfold because the conflict may indicate further troubles for the foundation. The debate may include issues regarding delineating development teams and foundation activities. There may also be a possibility that a third-party individual may come forward to corroborate Szilagyi’s story. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade occurred in early May, marking a critical milestone for the blockchain project. The upgrade addressed scalability issues to increase Ethereum’s competitiveness amongst other cryptocurrencies. The upgrade was a success in terms of public responsiveness. The derivatives markets saw an uptick in terms of Ethereum trading. Investors saw the upgrade as a clear indicator of the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum project. The current demand is for Ethereum ETFs with staking abilities so that traders can benefit from the financial innovations of blockchain technology.

The flagship coin has been forming a bullish continuation pattern after being rejected at its all-time high of around $111,900, which was set around May 22, 2025. Since June 9, 2025, BTC price has experienced a significant resistance level of around $110,500, thus resulting in a 2-3 percent drop to date. The drop below $108k in the past 24 hours has created a palpable fear of further short-term correction. Here are Major Factors to kickstart FOMO and Bullish Sentiment for Bitcoin Soon Technical Aspect BTC price has traded above a crucial weekly support level around $104,354 in the past five weeks. In the past three weeks, BTC price has been retesting the bullish breakout, signaling a parabolic rally soon. In the 1-hour timeframe, BTC price has been retesting a bullish breakout from a falling logarithmic trend. Although a solid base for the ongoing market correction has not been established, a major rebound is on the horizon. Weakening U.S.Dollar Amid Crypto Regulatory Clarity Despite the historical attempts by the Donald Trump administration to strengthen the U.S. dollar, the DXY, which measures the value of the U.S dollar against other major currencies, has been declining. The Chinese Yuan and other currencies have been strengthening against the U.S. dollar. With Bitcoin mostly traded against the U.S. dollar, the underlying value will skyrocket in the near future. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators have been making strategic moves to help the U.S. dollar remain dominant globally. For instance, the country intends to use stablecoins by enacting clear regulations. Consequently, crypto liquidity will increase significantly in tandem with the global money supply (M2). Heightened Demand from Institutional Investors According to aggregate data from BitcoinTreasuries , the entities holding Bitcoin in their treasuries has surged by 21 firms in the past 30 days, thus increasing the BTC holdings by 3.28 percent to 3.41 million. More institutional investors, led by GameStop , have been following in the footsteps of Strategy to leverage the global equity markets to strengthen their Bitcoin holdings. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, have continued to relentlessly accumulate more BTCs in the past year. As a result, the balance of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has exponentially declined to a multi-year low of about 2.09 million coins, thus confirming a major supply vs demand shock.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-12 19:19:07

Particularly, XRP holders are keen to know how such a deal might impact the price of Ripple’s native token. Ripple’s Acquisition Strategy Ripple has taken a turn in 2025, emerging as one of the most aggressive players in crypto M&A. Earlier this year, the company acquired Hidden Road , a crypto brokerage platform, for $1.25 billion. Now, it appears Ripple has set its sights on a much bigger target : Circle. Circle currently manages over $61 billion in USDC and has been preparing a public offering under the ticker symbol “CRCL” on the NYSE, targeting a valuation of around $5 billion. Though Circle rejected Ripple’s $4-$5 billion acquisition offer in April, circumstances have since evolved. The company is reportedly in preliminary discussions with Ripple and Coinbase, with new bids ranging between $6 and $11 billion. https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1924512776233308419 Should Ripple succeed, it would have control over its own stablecoin (RLUSD) and USDC, giving it a large influence in the stablecoin market. This would strengthen Ripple’s position within the crypto payments infrastructure, particularly via Ripple Payments. What does this mean for XRP? Several market analysts have weighed in on potential price scenarios. In a moderate scenario, if Ripple acquires Circle for $6-$8 billion and successfully integrates USDC, analysts project that XRP could rise to between $3.50 and $4.50. This projection assumes that increased stablecoin activity will boost liquidity across Ripple’s network, indirectly increasing demand for XRP as a bridge asset. Others offer a similar outlook for this baseline scenario, also placing XRP in the $3.50-$4.50 range. While stablecoins don’t directly determine XRP’s price, their integration into Ripple Payments could elevate XRP’s utility for cross-border settlements. In a bullish scenario, where Ripple absorbs Circle and effectively scales Ripple Payments across global markets, analysts see XRP climbing to $6-$10. This would assume a strong bull market backdrop and flawless technical integration between RLUSD and USDC.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-12 19:24:55

The new CEO of Polygon Foundation, Sandeep Naiwal, shared this in a roadmap on X. According to Nailwal , the roadmap is already in motion, with the first release on the Amoy testnet set to launch on the mainnet by the first week of July. This is expected to increase Polygon PoS’s speed to over 1000 TPS. More upgrades are expected to follow. He said: “By October, the chain will become one of the most performant and better UX chains in the ecosystem by achieving 5000 TPS with no reorgs.” Based on the roadmap, the Polygon PoS chain will be integrated with Agglayer by the end of 2025 to build an ecosystem where money, assets, and verified data can move globally seamlessly. This will ensure that money moves quickly, providing end users with the comfort and privacy they need and eliminating the need for middlemen and waiting periods. All these are part of the long-term plan to push Polygon TPS to 100,000 by 2026, a mission that the project believes is achievable. Thus, it plans to scale effectively while attracting more validators to boost decentralization. The roadmap also indicates that the organization prioritizes institutional support by partnering with corporations such as Stripe, Reliance Jio, Hamilton Lane, Apollo, and BlackRock. POL is now available on Solana This latest announcement comes just days after Naiwal became the CEO of the Polygon Foundation amid many wholesale changes. He had announced on X that he was moving upstairs to steer the foundation in the right direction and stimulate focused execution. He believes the time has come to put the foundation in the right direction, with millions of liquidity to build sustainably, with no distractions or pressure to raise more funds. The switch-up follows years of Polygon’s struggles to stay relevant as other Ethereum Layer-2 networks gained more market share. Meanwhile, Polygon token POL is now available on the Solana network through Wormhole’s Native Token Transfers (NTT) framework. Wormhole announced the development, noting that POL can now be used within the thriving Solana ecosystem without losing its core functionalities. The availability of POL on the Solana shows its Polygon Foundation’s readiness to operate cross-chain and could boost POL value through increased use. The token has also enjoyed some regulatory clarity since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit, alleging it is a security. Will these changes yield the necessary results for the Polygon Foundation? Since this raft of changes was announced on the Polygon platforms, the POL token has increased by 6% in the past seven days. However, it is trading at $0.22, according to CoinMarketCap, with a 6% decline in the last 24 hours due to a broader market slump. Still, one exciting update that could significantly boost the rating of the POL and the foundation’s general interest is the launch of Agglayer, which has the potential to link and collaborate with various chains in the industry. In the long run, Polygon intends to lead global payment systems and Real-World Assets, and all its present moves are directed toward that goal. It intends to connect all global retail payment networks, stock exchanges transacting on the chain, or several AI agents or IoT devices working on micropayments across its Agglayer-connected chain. This aligns with Polygon’s long-term vision to work towards a situation where there will be no difference between Polygon and other chains. Agglayer works behind the scenes to ensure transactions flow fully and freely across aggregated networks, which will change how global payment networks work. If the Polygon Foundation can achieve its roadmap, the POL token could see a major boost in value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In such a scenario, where both economic superpowers ban entirely each other’s goods and services, the global economy would be plunged. But how might crypto be affected? A Flight to Alternative Assets In times of geopolitical instability and economic upheaval, investors historically flee to “safe haven” assets. Gold has long held that role. However, over the past decade, Bitcoin has slowly but surely solidified its position as a digital alternative to gold. If US-China trade were to collapse completely, confidence in traditional financial systems and fiat currencies would likely take a hit. In such a scenario, Bitcoin could benefit as investors seek non-state, borderless alternatives to protect their wealth. A sudden increase in demand from institutional and retail investors could drive upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, at least after initial market turbulence. Falling Dollar Dominance The US dollar currently dominates as the world’s reserve currency, largely due to America’s central role in global trade and finance. But if the US is no longer seen as a stable trading partner, trust in the dollar may erode, especially among countries that rely heavily on both Chinese and American markets. In that case, Bitcoin could increasingly be seen as a neutral alternative for settling cross-border payments or hedging against currency volatility. XRP could be a candidate here, too. This would be especially true in regions like Southeast Asia, Latin America, or Africa, where financial systems are strained and digital alternatives are gaining traction. Crypto Adoption in Emerging Markets A trade freeze would severely disrupt global supply chains and likely trigger inflation, currency depreciation, and capital restrictions, especially in emerging markets. In countries facing such pressures, crypto adoption could accelerate as individuals and businesses want to preserve value and conduct international transactions outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin, stablecoins, and even DeFi platforms could be crucial in filling the gap, offering financial access and liquidity where local systems fail. Potential Government Crackdowns While crypto might benefit from instability in the private sector, governments may respond with increased scrutiny and regulation. The US and China are willing to crack down on crypto when it threatens monetary control or national interests. In a full-scale trade war, crypto could be viewed as a threat to economic sovereignty, causing tighter controls, bans, or surveillance. This risk is particularly high if Bitcoin becomes a major vehicle for capital flight or sanctions evasion. Expect Short-Term Volatility Despite its long-term promise, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. An abrupt and total freeze in US-China trade would likely spark global panic in financial markets, and crypto would most likely not be immune. Initial reactions could include sharp sell-offs as investors rush for liquidity. However, this could be followed by a speculative surge, as opportunistic buyers could bet on crypto’s role in a reshaped financial order.",Cryptocurrency|News|China|Cryptocurrency News|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-12 19:34:31

This latest acquisition signals a clear and accelerating commitment to digital assets as part of their broader financial strategy. What exactly did they buy, and what does this tell us about their ambitious plans? ANAP’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase Detailed ANAP Holdings recently announced via a press release on June 11th that they had acquired an additional 23.0595 Bitcoin (BTC). This purchase came at a cost of 367.26 million yen, which translates to approximately $2.55 million at the time of the transaction. This isn’t their first rodeo in the crypto market, and it significantly adds to their growing digital treasury. Following this latest ANAP Bitcoin purchase , the company’s total holdings have increased to a substantial 125.9596 BTC. Their cumulative investment in Bitcoin now stands at 1.84 billion yen, roughly equivalent to $12.8 million. This puts their average purchase price for their entire Bitcoin stash at around $93,600 per BTC. It’s clear they’ve been accumulating over time, navigating the market’s fluctuations. Why is a Japanese Company Investing in Bitcoin? It might seem counterintuitive for a fashion company to dive deep into cryptocurrency, but the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is growing globally. Companies are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as an alternative asset class for various reasons, including: Treasury Reserve Asset: Holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Potential for Appreciation: Believing in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their balance sheet. Innovation & Future Readiness: Signaling forward-thinking and adaptability in a digital economy. ANAP’s move places it among a growing list of publicly traded companies, albeit one of the more unique ones given its industry, that are allocating capital to digital assets. This demonstrates a strategic decision that goes beyond traditional corporate finance. ANAP’s Ambitious Crypto Investment Strategy What makes ANAP’s recent activity particularly noteworthy is not just the purchase itself, but the scale of their stated ambition. Earlier announcements revealed that ANAP plans to acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin – specifically, north of 1,000 BTC – by August. This latest purchase of 23 BTC, while notable, is just one step towards that much larger goal. Reaching the 1,000+ BTC target would represent a massive increase from their current 125+ BTC holdings. This aggressive accumulation target suggests a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition over the coming months and years. It positions their ANAP crypto investment as a major component of their future financial health, rather than just a speculative side venture. What Does This Japanese Company’s Bitcoin Plan Signify? The fact that a Japanese company Bitcoin investment of this scale is being pursued is significant for several reasons: Firstly, it highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within traditional corporate structures, even in markets like Japan, which has a well-regulated but sometimes cautious approach to crypto. Secondly, ANAP’s public declaration of a specific, high-volume target provides transparency into their Bitcoin investment strategy and timeline. This isn’t a quiet, minor allocation; it’s a stated objective that they are actively working towards, as evidenced by this latest purchase. Finally, as more diverse companies like ANAP enter the space, it could encourage others in non-traditional crypto industries to explore similar strategies, potentially driving further institutional adoption and market maturation. Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings For ANAP, the potential benefits of holding a significant amount of Bitcoin include: Asset Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s price rises, their treasury value increases significantly. Inflation Hedge: Protection against the potential devaluation of fiat currency. Market Attention: Gaining visibility and potentially attracting investors interested in crypto-forward companies. However, there are also inherent challenges and risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially leading to significant paper losses on their balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Japan. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require companies to mark down the value of crypto holdings if the market price drops below their cost basis, even if the price later recovers. Security Risks: The responsibility of securely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin. ANAP’s decision suggests they have weighed these factors and believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks, particularly in the context of their long-term vision. Concluding Thoughts on ANAP’s Bitcoin Journey ANAP Holdings’ continued ANAP Bitcoin purchase and their ambitious target of acquiring over 1,000 BTC by August make them a fascinating case study in corporate Bitcoin adoption . This move by a Japanese company Bitcoin enthusiast demonstrates that the trend of integrating digital assets into traditional business models is far from limited to tech or finance sectors. Their explicit Bitcoin investment strategy provides a clear roadmap for their future financial positioning. As they work towards their goal, the market will be watching to see how this bold move impacts their balance sheet and sets a precedent for other companies in Japan and beyond.

Big news is shaking up the tech and gaming worlds, and it has a fascinating angle for cryptocurrency enthusiasts! Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings is reportedly casting a strategic eye on a potential Tencent Nexon acquisition . This isn’t just any gaming company; Nexon Co., originally from South Korea and now based in Japan, holds a significant place in the global gaming market, and notably, holds a considerable amount of Bitcoin. What’s Behind the Potential Tencent Nexon Acquisition? According to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, Tencent has reportedly initiated discussions with the family of Nexon’s late founder, Kim Jung-ju. The Kim family, through their investment vehicle NXC Corp. and its affiliate NXMH BV, holds a substantial 44.4% controlling stake in Nexon as of June 30 data. This stake is the core target of the potential deal exploration. For Tencent , a company already deeply embedded in the global gaming industry through investments and ownerships (like Riot Games, Epic Games, and significant stakes in others), acquiring Nexon would be a massive strategic move. Nexon boasts a strong portfolio of popular online games, particularly in Asia, including titles like MapleStory, Dungeon Fighter Online, and KartRider. A successful Gaming acquisition of this scale would further solidify Tencent’s dominance in the international gaming landscape. Nexon’s Bitcoin Holdings: A Key Crypto Angle Here’s where the story gets particularly interesting for our crypto-savvy readers. While the primary focus of a Tencent Nexon acquisition would be on gaming assets and market share, Nexon is one of the notable public companies that holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries confirms that Nexon holds 1,717 Bitcoin . This Bitcoin was acquired at an average price of approximately $58,226 per coin. At the time of acquisition, this represented a significant corporate investment in the leading cryptocurrency. For a potential buyer like Tencent, a company known for its vast financial resources and diverse portfolio, Nexon’s Nexon Bitcoin holdings add an intriguing layer to the valuation and potential deal structure. How a tech giant like Tencent would approach these crypto assets during an acquisition process is a topic of much speculation within the crypto community. Exploring the Nexon NXC Stake and Family’s Options The reported discussions are centered around the significant Nexon NXC stake controlled by the Kim family. The family is currently working with financial advisers to carefully evaluate their options regarding this substantial holding. Selling a controlling stake in a company as large and successful as Nexon is a complex process with many potential paths, including selling to a single strategic buyer like Tencent, exploring other investors, or potentially pursuing other restructuring options. A Tencent investment of this magnitude would require significant capital and likely face regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions, given both companies’ global reach and market influence. The Kim family’s decision will hinge on various factors, including valuation, deal terms, and the future vision for Nexon. What Could This Gaming Acquisition Mean? A potential Gaming acquisition of Nexon by Tencent could have wide-ranging implications: For Tencent: Significant expansion of its gaming IP library and market presence, particularly in PC and mobile gaming in key Asian markets. For Nexon: Access to Tencent’s vast resources, distribution channels, and expertise, potentially accelerating global growth and game development. For the Gaming Industry: Further consolidation and increased dominance by Tencent, potentially impacting competition and developer relationships. For Nexon’s Bitcoin Holdings: This is perhaps the most fascinating question for crypto investors. Would Tencent retain the Bitcoin? Would it be sold as part of the deal? Or could Tencent, already exploring blockchain applications, see strategic value in these holdings? The fate of Nexon’s Nexon Bitcoin holdings under new ownership remains uncertain but is a key point of interest. Challenges and Considerations Any potential Tencent Nexon acquisition faces hurdles. Regulatory approval will be a major factor, especially considering antitrust concerns in markets where both companies operate extensively. Valuation discussions can be complex, particularly for a company with diverse assets, including non-traditional ones like significant Nexon Bitcoin holdings . The Kim family’s goals and the interests of minority shareholders also play crucial roles. Ultimately, the outcome of these reported explorations is yet to be determined. However, the prospect of a tech and gaming giant like Tencent potentially acquiring a company that is also a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin is a development worth watching closely, bridging the worlds of traditional tech M&A and the burgeoning digital asset space.

She pointed out that key people are now handling too many roles and said the new organizational chart is confusing. Is The EF Leadership Being Overambitious? In a July 11 X post , Kim noted that Tim Beiko, Barnabé Monnot, and Alex Stokes are in charge of several things at once. She explained how the three are leading all research and development teams, managing their own, and working on L1 and L2 scaling and user experience improvements for the next 12 months. Sharing the Ethereum Foundation’s organizational chart, the researcher questioned the purpose of the highlighted sections on it and wondered if Beiko was responsible for both protocol coordination and supervising multiple projects. “What are the highlights for?” wrote Kim. “Does Tim lead protocol coordination and oversee pas, pandaops, geth, and steel?” Additional concerns raised included the reasoning behind the color coding, which grouped related functions and teams under different hues, including purple, light blue, light green, and orange. The former CoinDesk reporter was curious about the exact rationale for the groupings, which she felt was unclear. For example, she asked why consensus was in the same category as account abstraction but not with stateless consensus or peer-to-peer networking, and why testing was next to PandaOps instead of security. In response, Ethereum researcher Barnabé Monnot explained that the bolded names on the org chart were team leads, with color groupings referring to “whom each team is reporting to.” Nonetheless, he admitted that the chart might contain too much information, suggesting that the current version was somewhat hard to interpret and could benefit from simplification or removal. Community Reactions The restructuring comes at a time when the EF has been facing ongoing criticism about its management and overall strategy. Community members had warned that if the organization failed to solve major technical problems, Ethereum could lose its strong position in the market. The non-profit responded by making changes, starting in early March, when it appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak as co-Executive Directors. This was followed by the most recent reorganization, which included staff layoffs and renaming the Protocol Research and Development department to just “Protocol.” Reaction to the revamp has been mixed. Some people responded positively, with Wang saying she hopes the new setup will help teams stay focused and move key projects forward. On the other hand, Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, pointed out a possible conflict between growing the network and improving user experience while dismissing staff. The job cuts follow Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade, which has also raised concerns about potential security vulnerabilities. Specifically, EIP-7702 was exploited in phishing attacks that affected over 10,000 addresses. There have also been reports of malicious contracts targeting vulnerable MetaMask users.

A Bitcoin (BTC) donation is shaking the Czech political landscape. On Thursday, June 12, the Czech opposition called for a no-confidence vote on the government over alleged corruption. The scandal involves the donation of 468 bitcoins, worth $45 million, to the state by an ex-convict. The benefactor was Tomáš Jiříkovský, a controversial entrepreneur and drug trafficker who operated a dark web marketplace for illegal drugs. He was convicted in 2017 for drug trafficking, fraud, and illegal weapons possession, and served his sentence until 2021. The payment, which was made to the Justice Ministry, was accepted by then-Minister Pavel Blazek. The funds were later liquidated into fiat and transferred to the state treasury. However, the donation prompted pressure from the opposition, and Blazek was forced to resign on May 31. You might also like: Czech Republic passes crypto-friendly law, exempts Bitcoin from capital gains While the funds were given to the state rather than to the minister personally, the opposition questioned the origins of the funds. The opposition accused the government of accepting the bitcoins without any AML or KYC checks. Without verifying their origin, it’s impossible to know whether they were connected to illegal activity. Czech story mirrors ‘Silk Road’ scandal Jiříkovský’s operations closely resemble those of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road. The platform was one of the first places where Bitcoin could be readily used, but it was also a hub for illegal drug trafficking. Ulbricht was pardoned in January 2025 by President Donald Trump after serving 11 years in jail. Interestingly, in June, he received a 300 Bitcoin donation from a “questionable source.” The scandal is rocking the crypto-friendly Czech government, which had hoped to attract crypto businesses with its flexible stance on MiCA regulations.

Lately, two major players, the US Dollar and the British Pound , have been under pressure. For those navigating the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro trends is crucial, as they influence capital flows and investor risk appetite. Let’s delve into the factors causing the US Dollar weakens trend and the concurrent struggles of the British Pound. Why is the US Dollar Weakening? Exploring Key Factors The US Dollar holds significant sway in global trade and finance, often seen as a safe haven. However, recent times have seen it lose some ground against other major currencies. This isn’t happening in a vacuum; several interconnected factors are at play: Trade Uncertainty: A primary driver is persistent trade uncertainty . Ongoing trade disputes, tariff threats, and shifting international trade agreements create instability. This environment makes investors wary of assets tied directly to trade flows, including the US Dollar, which is central to global commerce. Businesses facing unpredictable trade costs may reduce investments, impacting economic outlook and currency strength. Shifting Interest Rate Expectations: Central bank policies, particularly the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates, heavily influence the US Dollar. Expectations of potential rate cuts or a pause in rate hikes can make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, compared to currencies where interest rates might be perceived as more favorable or stable. Global Economic Outlook: While the US economy might show pockets of strength, concerns about a potential global slowdown can weigh on the dollar. In times of synchronized global growth, the dollar often benefits from increased trade and investment. Conversely, fears of recession elsewhere can dampen demand for dollar-denominated assets. Fiscal and Political Developments: Domestic policy debates, government spending, and political stability (or lack thereof) can all contribute to currency fluctuations. Large fiscal deficits, for instance, can sometimes put downward pressure on a currency over the long term. Understanding these elements helps paint a clearer picture of why the US Dollar weakens in the current environment. The British Pound’s Plight: A Look at Economic Weakness Across the Atlantic, the British Pound has also faced significant headwinds. Its struggles are often linked to unique domestic challenges, exacerbated by global conditions. The core issue for the British Pound has often been perceived economic weakness within the UK. Post-Brexit Adjustments: The long-term economic impacts of Brexit continue to unfold. Adjustments to new trade relationships with the EU, changes in regulatory alignment, and impacts on labor mobility have created ongoing challenges for various sectors of the UK economy. This structural shift contributes to economic uncertainty and can depress the pound’s value. Inflation and Cost of Living Crisis: Like many countries, the UK has grappled with high inflation. While the Bank of England has raised interest rates to combat this, the resulting cost of living crisis has squeezed consumer spending and potentially dampened economic growth prospects. High inflation erodes purchasing power and can be a sign of underlying economic stress. Productivity Concerns: Economists have pointed to persistent low productivity growth in the UK as a fundamental challenge. Higher productivity is key to sustainable wage growth and overall economic expansion. Struggles in this area contribute to the narrative of economic weakness . Global Headwinds: The UK economy is highly interconnected globally. Slowdowns in major trading partners, supply chain disruptions, and elevated energy prices have all added to the economic pressures faced by the UK, further impacting the British Pound . These factors combine to create a challenging backdrop for the British Pound , leaving it vulnerable to negative news and global risk aversion. Navigating the Forex Market: What Does This Mean? The combined weakness of two major global currencies significantly impacts the broader Forex market . Currency pairs involving USD and GBP (like GBP/USD) become particularly volatile. When the US Dollar weakens against a basket of currencies, it implies other currencies are strengthening relative to it. Similarly, a struggling British Pound means it’s losing value against others. Here’s how this plays out in the Forex market : Increased Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook and trade policies fuels volatility. Traders and investors react quickly to news headlines, economic data releases, and central bank commentary, leading to sharper price swings. Shifting Pair Dynamics: The relative weakness of USD and GBP means that pairs like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/EUR experience distinct movements. For example, if the Eurozone economy holds up better, EUR/USD might rise as the US Dollar weakens. If the UK’s economic weakness is more pronounced than the Eurozone’s, GBP/EUR might fall. Impact on Other Assets: Currency movements have ripple effects. A weaker US Dollar can sometimes make dollar-denominated commodities (like oil and gold) cheaper for buyers using other currencies, potentially increasing demand. It can also influence international investment flows and corporate earnings for multinational companies. Staying informed about these dynamics is essential for anyone participating in global markets, including the crypto market, which is increasingly influenced by traditional finance trends. Is Trade Uncertainty the Main Culprit? While many factors contribute to currency movements, the pervasive theme of trade uncertainty stands out as a significant influence on both the US Dollar and the British Pound . Global trade tensions create a difficult environment for planning and investment. Consider these points regarding trade uncertainty : Supply Chain Disruptions: Threats of tariffs or changes in trade relationships can force companies to rethink their supply chains, potentially leading to higher costs or reduced efficiency. This impacts profitability and overall economic health. Reduced Investment: Businesses may postpone or cancel investment decisions when the future of international trade is unclear. This hesitancy slows economic activity. Impact on Exports/Imports: Currency values directly affect the cost of imports and the competitiveness of exports. However, if trade relationships are unstable due to policy uncertainty, the benefits of a weaker currency for exporters might be limited, and the costs of imports might rise regardless of currency moves if tariffs are imposed. Investor Sentiment: Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes often sour investor sentiment, leading to a preference for safer assets, although what constitutes a ‘safe’ asset can also shift depending on the nature of the uncertainty. Sometimes, even traditional safe havens like the dollar can be negatively impacted if the uncertainty directly involves US trade policy. The persistent cloud of trade uncertainty acts as a drag on global growth prospects and contributes significantly to the volatility and weakness observed in currencies like the US Dollar and the British Pound. How Does Economic Weakness Manifest in Currency Values? Perceived or actual economic weakness is directly reflected in a country’s currency value. A weaker economy typically means less attractive investment opportunities, lower potential for interest rate increases (which attract foreign capital), and potentially higher risks. Here’s how economic weakness impacts currencies: Economic Indicator Impact on Currency (Weak Economy) GDP Growth Slow or negative growth reduces investment appeal, weakening currency. Inflation High inflation (if uncontrolled) erodes purchasing power, weakening currency. Low inflation (if deflationary) can signal weak demand, also potentially negative. Unemployment Rate Rising unemployment indicates economic stress, negative for currency. Consumer Spending Falling spending signals weak demand, negative for currency. Trade Balance Persistent large deficits can indicate structural weakness, negative for currency. Government Debt High or rising debt can raise concerns about fiscal stability, negative for currency. When indicators like these point towards economic weakness in the US or the UK, it diminishes confidence in the respective currencies, leading investors to look elsewhere for stronger returns or safer havens. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors? Given the current environment where the US Dollar weakens and the British Pound struggles amidst trade uncertainty and economic weakness , what should investors, including those in the crypto space, consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data releases from the US and UK, central bank announcements, and developments in international trade negotiations. These are key drivers for the Forex market . Understand Correlations: Recognize that traditional market movements, like currency fluctuations, can impact the crypto market, often influencing overall market sentiment and liquidity. Diversification: Consider the role of currency risk in your portfolio, even if primarily focused on crypto. While crypto is a separate asset class, its value is typically quoted in fiat currencies like USD, meaning its perceived value can be affected by currency strength or weakness. Long-Term Perspective: Currency markets are subject to short-term volatility. For long-term investors, focusing on the fundamental economic health and policy direction of a country is more important than reacting to daily fluctuations. Assess Risk Appetite: Periods of high trade uncertainty and economic weakness can increase overall market risk. Adjust your investment strategy according to your personal risk tolerance. While you might invest directly in crypto, understanding the forces shaping the Forex market provides valuable context for the broader financial ecosystem. In Conclusion: Navigating Choppy Currency Waters The current landscape, marked by a weakening US Dollar and a struggling British Pound , is a clear reflection of the pressures from trade uncertainty and underlying economic weakness . These factors create significant volatility in the Forex market , influencing global capital flows and investor sentiment. For investors, particularly those in the interconnected world of digital assets, recognizing these macroeconomic signals is vital. Currency strength and weakness are not isolated events; they are symptoms of broader economic health and geopolitical stability. By staying informed about the forces impacting major currencies, you gain a deeper understanding of the global financial environment that indirectly shapes the crypto market. The path forward for the US Dollar and the British Pound will depend heavily on how governments and central banks navigate trade relations and address structural economic weakness . Until clearer signals emerge, expect continued volatility in the Forex market .

What’s driving the surge in these cryptocurrencies? This article delves into the factors fueling their rise, keeping traders and investors keen on discovering which coins are primed for potential growth. The market never sleeps, and neither should its followers. Uniswap Shows Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Challenges Uniswap displayed robust weekly and monthly gains, with the price surging by 27.50% over the past week and 16.69% over the last month, yet showing a notable 54.03% decline over the six-month period. The coin’s recent upturn reflects short-term bullish strength, while the longer-term trend continues to be challenged by persistent downward pressure. The price movements reveal an asset that, while enjoying temporary recoveries, has not escaped the underlying headwinds that impacted its half-year performance. Such contrasting behaviors indicate that recent gains might be more a result of short-lived market optimism rather than a reversal of long-term trends. Currently trading in a range between $4.62 and $7.59, Uniswap faces clear resistance at $9.12 and firm support at $3.20. Bulls have made significant inroads, as shown by the short-term rally and uplifting momentum indicators, while bears persist, leaving the overall trend uncertain. Traders may consider buying near the support level and setting short-term targets close to the resistance barrier, while remaining cautious if prices slide below these key supports. The medium-term outlook depends on stable consolidation and a potential break of resistance. Technical readings suggest some bullish leanings but also indicate a need for caution. Hyperliquid Market Analysis: Rapid Gains and Key Price Levels Last month showed strong upward momentum with a 69.38% gain, while the past six months delivered a robust increase of 116.18%. A one-week change of 18.16% adds to the picture of a coin in a rising trajectory. Price movements have consistently pushed within a range spanning from about $21 to $42, reflecting strong performance and growing investor interest. These gains highlight a clear appetite for risk among traders. Currently, HYPE trades between $21.20 and $42.08, with a resistance level at $51.47 and immediate support around $9.73. The second resistance level at $72.35 presents an upper barrier for the bulls. The Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator point to upward drive, while an RSI hints at some overbought conditions. The trading range offers opportunities for buyers aiming to break resistance or catch support dips, but traders should remain cautious of potential pullbacks. Conclusion UNI s rise this week can be attributed to improved trading activities on its platform. New features and partnerships drew more users, boosting its token value. HYPE saw a surge following significant community interest and strategic announcements. Increased attention from traders and positive market sentiment fueled its growth. Both tokens displayed strong performance driven by user engagement and market dynamics. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The native integration of crypto into e-commerce is another step in mass adoption. The announcement arrives just days after Circle, the issuer of USDC, started trading as a public company on the NYSE. USDC remains one of the most widely used stablecoins, offering a higher level of security. Unlike other permissionless stablecoins, USDC has shown instances where Circle was able to freeze and re-mint tokens, thus compensating users in cases of fraud and losses. This made USDC more suitable for mainstream fintech usage. Stablecoins have been making crossovers into payment and fintech apps, especially after receiving regulatory clarity. USDC also returned to services like Stripe at the end of 2024. Before the native Shopify integration, Stripe was also offering merchants a tool to accept USDC payments . PayPal’s PYUSD also expanded its supply, while minting more stablecoins on the Stellar network . Tether’s USDT has also spread to multiple fintech apps, though targeting more niche markets. Base to offer cheap USDC payments The new USDC rollout aims to tap the on-chain economy of Base. The chain’s team announced that the new payment gateways may become a convenient checkout and payment button for all Base users. “Pay with crypto” Millions of @Shopify stores are about to accept USDC on Base.

In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,800 followers on the social media platform X that BTC whales exiting long positions in favor of building short positions against retail could cause the crypto asset by market cap to slide down to $106,300. “BTC isn’t the most exciting market at the moment, but that $106,000 imbalance looks appealing if this holds. Technically still range-bound for now. It’s very early and therefore speculative, but whales were exiting long positions and building shorts against retail on Wednesday. This could change, but it could also be an early warning sign of a pullback into $106,300.” Source: Justine Bennett/X The trader’s chart indicates that if BTC were to slide, it would happen sometime during the next 48 hours. Bennett goes on to note that crypto traders should keep an eye on the health of stocks, particularly the S&P 500, as a dip below a specific level could cause it to crash back down to its lows in April and May. “The SPX is holding support now, but if this fails, especially at 5,960, those April and May gaps will be fair game. Not interested in it yet. Just watching.” Source: Justine Bennett/X The flagship digital asset is trading for $107,698 at time of writing, a 2% decrease during the last 24 hours.

With its focus on real-world utility, an ongoing audit to enhance transparency, and analysts drawing comparisons to the early days of Solana (SOL), Ruvi AI is rapidly gaining attention in the crypto community. Solana (SOL): A Pioneer in Scalability and Efficiency Solana has long been celebrated for its impressive transaction speeds and scalability. Capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), Solana has become a preferred platform for developers creating decentralized applications (dApps). Its low transaction fees and reliability have cultivated a strong ecosystem across industries such as gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and NFTs. With its unique consensus mechanism and rapid growth, Solana has cemented itself as a blockchain leader. Yet, as the market evolves, emerging technologies like Ruvi AI are beginning to capture the spotlight, offering innovative use cases and unprecedented potential. Cyberscope Audit Enhances Trust and Transparency The ongoing audit of Ruvi AI by Cyberscope is a significant step toward solidifying investor trust. Known for its rigorous blockchain and smart contract audits, Cyberscope is assessing the project’s platform security and reliability. This transparency is vital in distinguishing Ruvi AI from other emerging tokens. Ruvi AI’s commitment to trust, combined with its innovative technology, draws comparisons to Solana’s early days. Experts believe this level of verification and confidence positions Ruvi AI as a serious competitor in the blockchain sector. Presale Success and Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has showcased its strong investor appeal. Phase 1 was a resounding success, selling out in just two weeks with a token price of $0.010. When Phase 2 launched at $0.015, early supporters saw their investments grow by 50%. This remarkable start drew over 1,500 investors, raising over $1.7 million to date. Momentum continued as Ruvi AI announced its first exchange listing and partnerships with major trading platforms. These moves improve liquidity and boost its visibility in the market. With further updates anticipated, Ruvi AI is poised for exponential growth as it builds on its early achievements. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Merging Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Ruvi AI is redefining the possibilities of blockchain by incorporating artificial intelligence into its decentralized ecosystem. Designed as a superapp, Ruvi AI allows users to generate AI-powered content in formats such as text, audio, video, and images. Its wide applicability makes it an essential tool for industries like marketing, creative production, and workflow automation. At the core of Ruvi AI’s platform is the $RUVI token. This serves as the ecosystem’s currency, enabling transactions, staking rewards, governance participation, and premium feature access. Ruvi AI’s focus on real-world utility has positioned it as an innovative solution for challenges facing businesses and individuals alike. Lucrative Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI For those eager to invest early, Ruvi AI offers three VIP presale tiers that deliver substantial ROI potential. Here are the projected returns based on a presale price of $0.015, a $0.07 listing price, and a predicted $1 post-launch valuation: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). These investment scenarios reveal the tremendous return potential Ruvi AI offers to early adopters. The Final Word Ruvi AI’s rapid trajectory, groundbreaking technology, and commitment to transparency have made it the standout crypto choice this month. While Solana continues to lead in performance and scalability, Ruvi AI brings a fresh perspective by uniting blockchain and AI, creating real-world solutions with unparalleled potential.

Summer 2025 is being touted as the season of altcoin, with massive returns expected. Seasoned investors know that the best altcoins to pick are those at the bottom for maximum gains, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Meanwhile, newbies tend to go for the big coins like Bitcoin (BTC), which are trading at the top. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at just about $100k; if it were to miraculously climb to $200k, that would represent less than a 100% increase. Meanwhile, an altcoin like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at $0.03. If its value climbs to $2, as analysts are forecasting, that would be a 6,566.67% gain. Let us take a look at some of the most promising altcoins of this summer. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) aims to create a system of interconnected blockchains known as parachains, and is aiming to create Web3 on the blockchain. On these parachains, users will be able to create applications that run just like on the internet but without a centralized authority controlling them. Its major draw is the interoperability of different blockchain ecosystems that communicate and exchange value. In terms of price, DOT has performed dismally, falling nearly 20% in the past month. While its vision could potentially lead to a massive ecosystem that triggers growth, its complexity has made that a hindrance. For fast gains that are sustainable due to mass adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a better option. Solana (SOL) Since it went live in 2020, Solana has been touted for helping to usher in meme coins. However, since meme coins do not have much real-world utility, the SOL coin has seen its value drop dramatically as many meme coins have sunk to zero. Currently at around $152, Solana has dropped dramatically from its high of over $294 in early 2025. While there is still hope for a recovery, it is unlikely to deliver the massive growth expected for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Built For Massive Gains The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project built from the ground up for massive growth. It is designed as a decentralized, non-custodial protocol where users can deposit their assets to earn interest. The interest that they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers can participate in the protocol by depositing overcollateralized collateral to receive loans. They can then pay interest on those assets based on the utilization rate in the pool. When the utilization rate rises, borrowers are encouraged to pay back their loans, while lenders are incentivized to deposit more assets into the pool. Part of the interest payments by borrowers goes to the reserve factor. Depending on what asset a borrower used as collateral, the reserve factor could be as low as 10% or as high as 35%. The reserve factor is used to ensure the stability of the ecosystem in case of rapid market movements. Stable assets like stablecoins and ETH get the lowest reserve factor, while more volatile assets like meme coins get a higher reserve factor. The Loan-to-Value Ratio And Liquidation Trigger Another parameter that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses to protect the ecosystem is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Assets that are more stable get a better LTV ratio. For instance, if a borrower uses ETH as collateral, they can get an LTV of 80%, which means for each 1 ETH, they can get a loan equivalent to the value of 0.80 ETH. More unstable assets like the SHIB meme coin will receive an LTV of around 40%. The liquidation trigger comes into effect when the value of collateral falls below a certain level. High-value assets like the USDC stablecoin will feature a higher liquidation threshold of around 80%, while lower liquidity assets will feature a liquidation threshold of around 65%. The MUTM Token Presale Update The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised over $10.4 million from over 11,900 unique buyers. Currently in phase 5, over 30% of the tokens set aside for the phase have been sold, less than two weeks after it began. The MUTM token presale price in the current phase is $0.03, and is expected to increase by 16.67% in the next phase to $0.035. As of the current price, presale participants have a chance to make a 100% ROI based on the planned listing price of $0.06. The upcoming phase will see the ROI cut back to 71.43%. From the above, it is quite clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver the biggest gains this summer. With an active developer team and strict controls to protect the protocol’s health, this is expected to be the biggest winner of summer 2025. Best of all, anyone can join the presale now at the low price of $0.03.

The recent surge brought optimism to the market, yet ETH has now pulled back slightly, struggling to extend gains as global uncertainty weighs on sentiment. With macro pressures mounting and negotiations between the US and China over a potential trade deal in focus, the broader market appears to be awaiting clarity before making its next decisive move. Related Reading: Solana Forms Higher Low: Charging Toward Range Highs? Top analyst Rekt Capital offered historical context to Ethereum’s current setup, pointing to two previous cycles where ETH successfully retested the $2,500 level before launching toward $4,000. In August 2021 and again in early 2024, ETH held $2,500 as strong support (green circles), acting as the foundation for a major breakout rally. This repeating pattern has investors now eyeing the same level with growing interest. As Ethereum trades near $2,750–$2,800, the coming days could determine whether this current setup mirrors past bullish cycles—or if momentum fades again. With strong support beneath and a clear historical roadmap above, ETH’s ability to reclaim strength could trigger the next leg in what many believe may be the start of altseason. Ethereum Echoes Past Patterns Ahead Of Potential Breakout Ethereum has rallied over 100% since its April lows, showcasing powerful momentum and heightened activity at current levels. After briefly tapping a local high near $2,830, ETH has retraced slightly but remains firmly above the $2,750 mark—a key area that now acts as short-term support. The strength of this rebound is fueling growing speculation that Ethereum may not only be preparing for another leg up but also setting the tone for a broader altseason. Analysts across the board are closely watching ETH’s current consolidation, with many citing historical patterns as a reason for optimism. Notably, Rekt Capital highlighted a recurring pattern that has previously led to significant rallies. In August 2021, Ethereum successfully retested the $2,500 level as support before surging to approximately $4,000. The same thing occurred in early 2024, when ETH once again bounced from $2,500 and rallied to the same zone. Now, for the past five weeks, Ethereum has repeatedly confirmed the $2,500 level as solid support, forming what appears to be a textbook foundation for another major move. This accumulation phase—mirroring past cycles—has many traders confident that ETH could soon reclaim $3,000 and begin leading altcoins higher. With macro conditions still uncertain and market participants looking for signals of strength, Ethereum’s behavior at these levels carries added significance. If ETH can maintain its position above $2,750 and build momentum through $2,830, the market could see an explosive shift in sentiment, potentially triggering the next phase of the bull cycle. For now, all eyes remain on Ethereum as it tests the top of its multi-week range with bullish conviction. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance – Breakout Or Breakdown? ETH Holds Above Breakout Zone After $2,830 Rejection Ethereum is currently trading at $2,749 on the 4-hour chart, holding above a key breakout zone between $2,700 and $2,740 following a brief rejection at $2,830. After breaking above this multi-week resistance last week, ETH surged into higher territory before pulling back in the last few sessions. Despite this retrace, the price has so far maintained support above the previous resistance area, now acting as a strong demand zone. This range—highlighted by the yellow box on the chart—served as a ceiling for nearly a month before being flipped into support during the breakout. Ethereum is now consolidating right above this area, and as long as it remains above the 50 and 100 simple moving averages (SMAs), the bullish structure is intact. Volume has started to cool off slightly, suggesting that traders are waiting for a decisive move—either a bounce toward $2,800–$2,900 or a breakdown back below $2,700. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Rangebound Below $2,735 Level – No Clear Breakout Yet A successful hold of this support zone could confirm the retest and build momentum for another breakout attempt. However, failure to hold $2,700 could see ETH revisit the 200 SMA around $2,570. For now, Ethereum remains technically strong, but traders are watching closely for confirmation.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to break resistance near $0.00001311 and Hyperliquid (HYPE) prepares for another possible leg up, a new contender is changing the script. BlockDAG is no longer just a presale name, it’s now offering a bold Double Up deal ahead of its highly anticipated GO LIVE reveal. The opportunity is open to those who’ve already spent $200 or more in BlockDAG . With SHIB in decline and HYPE nearing its ceiling, all eyes are turning to BlockDAG’s unique approach and massive $298 million presale momentum. BlockDAG’s Double Up Power Play Heats Up Before June 13 Launch BlockDAG is pushing forward with a unique pre-launch offer that rewards committed participants. Anyone who has already spent $200 or more on BDAG now qualifies for the “Double Up” offer. By topping up with just 50% more, buyers can double their total BDAG coin balance, an aggressive move before the launch price hits $0.05 on June 13. This offer arrives as BlockDAG passes $298 million raised, with more than 22.4 billion coins sold. The price is currently frozen at $0.0018, delivering a potential 2,678% return for those who act before the presale ends. Once Batch 29 rolls in at $0.0276, the 2,660% rise since Batch 1 becomes a locked-in stat, not a live opportunity. But it’s not only about numbers. BlockDAG’s reach now includes over 1.5 million users on its X1 app. It has teased a partnership with the NBA and confirmed its GO LIVE reveal on June 13. It also completed audits with CertiK and Halborn. With volume rising and visibility expanding, this isn’t just a strong presale, it’s shaping up as one of the most promising crypto launches of the year. SHIB Struggles at $0.00001311 as Bears Retest Support Zones Shiba Inu (SHIB) is under pressure again as it hovers near $0.00001257. Despite a minor 0.19% increase, it remains stuck below the strong resistance at $0.00001311. The price continues to sit beneath the 9-period DEMA and around the lower edge of the Bollinger Band, suggesting bearish sentiment is still in play. For now, support zones from $0.00001209 to $0.00001109 are holding up. On the 4-hour chart, SHIB is showing a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows. Every bounce off the support levels seems to lose steam, which could signal a lack of strong buying interest. If buyers fail to reclaim $0.00001311 soon, the coin might retest the $0.00001109 level. However, a Bollinger Band squeeze indicates that a sharp move is near, traders are simply waiting to see which direction the breakout will go. HYPE Holds Strong With $1B Open Interest and Eyes on $50 Hyperliquid (HYPE) is showing bullish signs even as a small pullback seems likely. The coin trades close to its all-time high of $35, but analysts expect a possible dip toward the $30 to $25 range. This would allow a healthy reset before any upward move toward $37 or the $50 mark. A liquidity heatmap suggests strong trading activity near $30, hinting at a rebound point. Fundamentals remain strong. HyperEVM is active, revenues have grown by 500%, and HYPE now ranks in the top five projects by total value locked, overtaking Cardano. Open interest has surged toward $1 billion, although this also brings risk of sudden liquidations. Still, the general outlook remains positive, and traders view HYPE as a strong contender among top rated crypto names in the market today. One Final Window Before GO LIVE Reveal SHIB’s price action looks weak for now, staying below $0.00001311 while bulls try to hold the lower support zone. HYPE could fall slightly to $30 before aiming for higher levels, supported by solid metrics and growing user demand. But it’s BlockDAG grabbing the spotlight. With more than $298 million raised, a frozen $0.0018 price until June 13, and a launch price set at $0.05, the 2,678% profit window may close soon. Add to that the Double Up offer for $200+ holders and confirmed GO LIVE reveal with 20+ platforms, BDAG is looking like the top-rated crypto of the moment. Those who act now might lock in one of the highest potential setups of 2025.

Van de Poppe tells his 791,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is in the first phase of consolidation after breaking out from the $106,500 price level. According to the widely followed analyst, the first consolidation phase is likely to last a couple of days. “Then, we’re going to have the next breakout above the all-time high. Ideal zone to buy? I would estimate around $107,000 – $108,000. Buy the dip season.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading at $109,325 at time of writing. Next up is Ethereum ( ETH ). According to Van de Poppe, Ethereum is building up for a “big breakout” after a consolidation phase that has lasted for over a month. The widely followed analyst says Ethereum could rise by up to around 26% from the current level. “I assume we’ll start to see a leg to $3,400 – $3,500 if it breaks the resistance at $2,800. The area to hold: around $2,575.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Ethereum is trading at $2,770 at time of writing. Next up is the decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform Bittensor ( TAO ). According to Van de Poppe, TAO could go up by around 92% from the current price level as “confidence comes back in” to the market. “I assume we will break above $475 and we’re getting to $700 – $800 in the next run.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bittensor is trading at around $416 at time of writing.

In a 90-second video message to Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, Trump said it was an honor to be called “Crypto President.” Trump reiterated his goal of ending the previous administration’s “war on crypto” policy in his speech and said they would establish a working group to evaluate digital assets. He also referred to new regulations on the agenda of Congress. “Our administration is working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act, which supports the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins. We will also create clear and simple market frameworks that will enable America to be a leader in the future of crypto and Bitcoin,” he said. The room erupted in applause at this statement, albeit sporadically. Related News: Millionaire CEO Announces He Will Purchase a Large Amount of a Surprise Altcoin—But Only Under One Condition The GENIUS Act, currently under consideration in the Senate, is set to be voted on today. The move follows a compromise reached on Wednesday, while two key House committees also advanced a market structure bill on Tuesday. Trump also claimed to have created a “U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile” via an executive order, although these have not yet been officially established. Following Trump’s statements at the event, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who recently completed their IPO, also took the stage. The two names stated that cryptocurrencies could play a bigger role in the global financial system. *This is not investment advice.
