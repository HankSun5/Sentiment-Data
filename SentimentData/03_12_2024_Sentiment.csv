Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a crypto asset honoring the baby hippo who became an international sensation, soared 108% as the top US crypto exchange made the announcement . The Solana-based memecoin is now up 59% at time of publishing, at $0.5609, with a market cap of $555.8 million. The announcement from Coinbase means the firm has determined the asset will be available for trading in the near future, although the coin is not yet live on the platform.

Proof of Shiba Inu's increasing power as its Shibarium recently blasted a new ATH in Total Value Locked (TVL). Pepe is also giving off breakthrough signals you would not want to miss. But here’s the twist: utility coins like Lunex Network are quietly gaining momentum. Lunex, a decentralized, non-custodial exchange, lets you trade directly while keeping full control of your assets. Plus, with exciting crypto presales heating up, now’s the perfect time to explore your next big move! Lunex shines in crypto presale with advanced utility and massive investor interest Have you noticed utility coins like Lunex taking the spotlight lately? It’s no surprise that Lunex is packed with features that make it stand out in the crypto world. Right now, the Lunex crypto presale is in full swing with tokens priced at just $0.0033. Over 1.78 billion tokens have already been sold, raising an impressive $3.7 million. It’s clear that investors are flocking to Lunex for good reasons. First, it’s all about the perks. Lunex offers advanced performance analytics, giving you real-time insights and predictive market tools to stay ahead of the curve. Plus, $LNEX token holders enjoy revenue redistribution through buybacks and staking rewards—a win-win for building your portfolio.

Shibarium strikes ATH: Shiba Inu's layer-2 increases independent of market upheaval Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 protocol has reached an interesting benchmark, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) achieving an ATH of $8.57 million. Despite SHIB’s current dip in TVL to $4.58 million, data shows Shiba-related activities dominate with $3.06 million, followed by WoofSwap and ChewySwap contributing $875,270 and $497,016, respectively. Shibarium's wallet activity is also on the rise, nearing 1.9 million addresses. This growth indicates strong engagement, with new wallets likely contributing to staking during the recent SHIB ATH. Even so, the community's unwavering participation continues to underscore Shibarium’s potential for long-term growth and innovation. Pepe’s bull flag signals a breakout on the horizon PEPE is showing exciting potential, with a bull flag pattern forming on its 4-hour chart, a classic signal of a possible breakout. This setup indicates that the meme coin could surpass $0.000025 and potentially reach as high as $0.000041. If this happens, all current holders could return to profitability, highlighting PEPE’s strong recovery prospects. Adding to the optimism is the Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) indicator, which reveals weak resistance at $0.000023 and solid support from PEPE holders. This means PEPE has room to grow, supported by a robust base of committed investors. However, as with any investment, it’s crucial to keep an eye on market conditions and make informed decisions. Why settle for less when Lunex could be your next big win? While Shiba and PEPE are making waves, Lunex stands out as the smarter choice. With itscrypto presale in full swing, Lunex offers advanced trading features, real-time analytics, and rewarding staking opportunities.

While experts believe it will boost privacy-focused projects, many are unsure of its benefits to new cryptos like Lunex and established tokens like UNI and XLM. Regardless of its impact on DeFi, Lunex’s focus on security and enhanced privacy features already account for some of its massive attraction to investors and the explosion in its presale phase. Read more about why Lunex trump's XLM and UNI’s performance. Lunex Network attracts investors with privacy guarantee, sells 2 billion tokens With the rise of DeFi, users face growing security and privacy risks to their funds and data. Lunex Network (LNEX) addresses these challenges by offering innovative solutions, including a non-custodial wallet with access to over 50,000 assets across multiple blockchains. Users retain full control over their private keys, reducing risks of hacks or fund loss. Lunex further employs advanced encryption methods and regular smart contract audits, including by Solidproof, to add further protection layers, safeguard sensitive data, and prevent breaches. Lunex also prioritizes user privacy by minimizing data collection and eliminating reliance on centralized servers, reducing the risk of hacks or leaks. Its no-KYC policy allows users to trade, store, and manage assets anonymously. Making waves in its presale, this new crypto is closing in on 2 billion $LNEX tokens sold and almost $3.7 million in collected funds. It is currently available at an extremely low price of $0.0033, making now an excellent time to acquire LNEX tokens. Stellar (XLM) partners with Blockaid to upgrade security amid hacks Blockaid, a Web3 security platform, has partnered with XLM to enhance the protection of decentralized applications (dApps) by integrating its advanced Onchain Detection and Response (ODR) technology. The integration begins with XLM’s Freighter and Lobstr wallets, which will now benefit from Blockaid’s real-time threat monitoring and swift response capabilities. These security features aim to fortify the Stellar (XLM) blockchain against potential vulnerabilities. Ido Ben Natan, CEO of Blockaid, announced that the company’s latest round of security enhancements is designed to alert users about potentially risky transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), or tokens. Using Blockaid, XLM adds to its most recent security upgrade, which it partnered with Hypernative Labs. This partnership enabled Stellar to integrate advanced security features to prevent phishing attacks, fraud, and market manipulation. These improvements will likely drive greater adoption of the Stellar network, benefiting its native token, XLM. With increasing engagement from users and projects, XLM could see a surge in demand, potentially influencing its market price. Uniswap (UNI) upgrades security with a $15.5 million bounty Uniswap Labs (UNI) has offered $15.5 million to identify vulnerabilities in the core smart contracts of its v4 decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This initiative bolsters UNI’ssecurity and protects users' funds from potential risks. UNI’s announcement coincided with a significant price surge for its native token. Over the past week, UNI saw a 15% increase, with experts crediting the price rally to renewed optimism in the DeFi, coupled with Uniswap's proactive security measures. Despite UNI’s projection for a 30% increase and XLM’s for a massive surge, Lunex’ssecurity measures and additional features ensure it’s gaining faster. Investors have locked on to the enormous potential of the project, and they’re now positioning themselves to take advantage of the huge gains fast-approaching on the horizon.

33767162,[object Object],1733178636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin And Ether ETFs Set Record $7.6 Billion Inflows Amid Trump’s Crypto Push,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-ether-etfs-set-record-7-6-billion-inflows-amid-trumps-crypto-push/,"Analysts said that two of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world are riding on the waves of positive sentiments as the exchange-traded funds of Bitcoin and Ethereum reached record highs. The pro-cryptocurrency stance of US President-elect Donald Trump continues to fuel the positive outlook, propelling BTC and ETH to attain unprecedented levels. Bitcoin Hits $6.5 Billion In Net Inflows Analysts showed that as of November, the firstborn cryptocurrency’s exchange-traded funds (EFT) recorded an all-time high of $6.5 billion in net inflows , a significant milestone attributed to the incoming Trump administration. Many market commentators are predicting that Bitcoin could soon hit a record high of over $100,000 per coin; even American author Robert Kiyosaki posted on his X account that BTC would settle at around $250,000 in 2025. Analysts mentioned that since the start of 2024, BTC’s price has already doubled, and they observed that the crypto went up by 45% after the US presidential election, noting that investors’ optimism on cryptocurrencies can be attributed to Trump’s promise to make regulations more friendly to digital assets. As of press time, Bitcoin has been traded at $95,721, down by 1.8% in the last 24 hours and with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. BTC is moving even closer to the $100,000 mark but continues to struggle to pass this resistance level. ETH Outperforms BTC Crypto analysts commented that since Trump’s election, Ethereum has outmatched Bitcoin as the leading altcoin has reached new heights, riding on the overall optimism in the cryptocurrency sector. Reports illustrated that the Ethereum ETFs hit an all-time high of $1.1 billion in net inflows, saying that ETH is keeping up with the Bitcoin surge. Analysts noted that a net inflow of $333 million was recorded from nine Ether EFTs on November 29, adding that BlackRock led the charge wherein its ETHA had a total inflow of $2.1 billion. In the last week of November, SosoValue revealed that Ether ETFs garnered more than $466 million while having an outflow of $71.60 million in the prior week. Moreover, its price also increased by 48% in the last seven days. According to CoinGecko, the largest altcoin is being traded at $3,619 with a total market capitalization of more than $435 billion. Declining Inventory In a post, digital asset analyst Markus Thielen suggested that Bitcoin’s supply might be drying up, noting that there is a dwindling Bitcoin balance on cryptocurrency exchanges. “Unlike late summer, when a sudden large inflow temporarily replenished exchange balances, this time, no additional inventory is appearing,” Thielen said on LinkedIn. The analyst said that Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase are the only crypto exchanges with sufficient Bitcoin in their inventories. Some reports suggested that the latest inflows into BTC are significant, and a bearish outlook might be premature. However, he noted that the crypto’s market capitalization is growing but its dominance waning down by 60% to 56%. Could this indicate that the altcoin season has arrived?

A picture of the first bull to be traded on Solana AgriDex , a Solana-based real-world assets (RWA) marketplace and winner of the Stand With Crypto UK’s ‘Best Use Case’ Awards , made history this week by facilitating the world’s first trade of a live bull on the blockchain from Aurox Meats . The transaction was seamlessly executed through the AgriDex platform and recorded on the Solana blockchain. The bull comes from Gatcombe Park, the Princess Royal's herd. The White Park bull, Dinefwr Wyn, carries a lineage steeped in royal heritage, traced back to some of the most renowned bloodlines in the breed's history. “This historic transaction isn’t just bullish for Solana, it’s bullish for the entire global livestock market. AgriDex demonstrates how blockchain can bring greater accountability to the livestock trade, empowering farmers and suppliers while ensuring animal welfare standards are maintained,” said Henry Duckworth , Co-Founder and CEO of AgriDex. The Future of Solana Depends on Utility Memecoins may be fun, but Solana needs substance. While the blockchain’s speed, low fees, and scalability have fueled an explosion of memecoins, capturing retail traders and driving community engagement, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on more than fleeting hype. Real-World Assets (RWA) present a transformative alternative and offer sustainable growth and real-world value. In early 2024, RWA emerged as the second most profitable crypto narrative , delivering an impressive 285.6% return. For a brief moment in February, it even surpassed memecoins. RWA has been gaining further popularity and is emerging as one of the main narratives of the upcoming bull run. AgriDex leverages the power of Solana’s blockchain to revolutionise livestock trading with transparency, efficiency, and fairness. By ensuring every transaction is fully trackable, the platform reduces fraud and price manipulation across global supply chains. Its near-instant settlements come with significantly lower fees—just 0.15% per trade side—compared to traditional methods that often charge several percentage points and take 4-6 days to settle transactions. The successful facilitation of the trade on the blockchain showcases AgriDex’s commitment to innovation and highlights its role as a platform driving the adoption of blockchain for agricultural and livestock trades globally. As illustrated in the graph below, the project is expected to generate 133 million in profit by the end of 2028. Source: AgriDex Revolutionalise the agricultural industry with blockchain Set to launch on December 4th , Agridex is revolutionising the $2.3 trillion global agricultural trade industry by tokenising the supply chain. AgriDex offers farmers instant settlements, drastically reduced transaction costs, and fraud-proof traceability using blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enshrine legal contracts. The AgriDex Token ($AGRI) is launching at a valuation of $65 million and anticipates generating $53.28 million in trading fees by the end of 2026, supported by an expected net buy pressure of $39.2 million within two years. Blockchain technology is undeniably redefining the tech paradigm, but many have jumped on the trend solely for profit, often not solving a real-world problem. AgriDex, however, stands apart by delivering genuine utility, leveraging blockchain to drive meaningful impact and innovation in the agricultural sector. For instance, food fraud cost the UK £1.96 billion in 2021 and globally accounts for $30-40 Billion dollars in lost revenue. Food fraud is notoriously hard to detect with only 20% of suspected cases being reported. In the UK, of the 610 that were reported in 2021 there were only 16 successful prosecutions, or under 4%. Poor traceability and certificate verification The fraud highlighted above is enabled by the opacity of crossing multiple jurisdictions using wet contracts and poor visibility of origin for consumers. Dozens of different standards and certifications make it challenging to assure quality, origin and sustainability credentials. Source: AgriDex AgriDex solves the problem by providing an inclusive marketplace for all participants in the supply chain. It is driven by the immutable ledger of blockchain - that delivers trust, transparency, and accountability. The RWA platform built on Solana lowers the cost of food traded through it, increases choice, and delivers transparency, reducing fraud and verifying quality and origin and sustainability credentials. It is focused on solving critical issues with trading agricultural products and services including inefficiency, fraud, access to finance and insurance. AgriDex will create a fair and transparent financial system. The graph below illustrates the significant cost and time savings that AgriDex offers • Cost Savings: While traditional systems incur a cost of $1,125 per tonne of cocoa, AgriDex slashes this to just $660, highlighting a stark reduction in trade expenses.• Time Efficiency: Traditionally, such a transaction takes 65 days to complete, but with AgriDex, it's cut down to 40 days. This accelerated timeline demonstrates AgriDex’sefficiency. Source: AgriDex AgriDex is redefining the global agricultural trade industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and fraud-resistant marketplace. By reducing costs, cutting transaction times, and providing traceable records of quality, origin, and sustainability, the RWA platform on Solana addresses critical inefficiencies in the $2.3 trillion agricultural sector. As the first platform to successfully trade a live bull on Solana, AgriDex showcases the transformative potential of RWAs and sets a new standard for using blockchain to solve real-world problems, driving meaningful innovation and sustainable growth in agriculture.

This decision follows months of recovery efforts that ultimately failed to restore the platform’s viability. DMM Bitcoin to Transfer All Assets to SBI VC Trade According to a report from Nikkei Asia, the exchange also plans to sell all its assets to SBI VC Trade, a trading company owned by the SBI Group. SBI VC Trade confirmed in a December 2 statement that an agreement had been reached to acquire all assets of DMM Bitcoin as part of its liquidation process. The transfer, expected to conclude by the end of Q1 2025, will include customer accounts and assets held by the exchange. Details on the specific transfer methods and dates will be disclosed in future announcements. As part of the transition, the company plans to expand its services by offering 14 crypto spot trading options currently available on DMM Bitcoin’s platform. The two firms will continue discussing the asset and account transfer process. DMM Bitcoin was hacked on May 31, 2024, resulting in the theft of 4,502.9 BTC, worth approximately $305 million at the time. The exchange confirmed the breach , announcing that it had taken steps to prevent further unauthorized withdrawals by suspending all spot purchase transactions. Further, it assured customers it would reimburse lost funds by acquiring an equivalent amount of Bitcoin with backing from its associated companies. To that end, DMM Bitcoin secured a 5 billion yen loan in June and outlined plans to raise an additional 50 billion yen to meet its obligations. Failed Recovery Efforts Despite the recovery efforts, ongoing service restrictions and increased challenges forced the exchange to abandon its plans and ultimately decide to shut down its operations. In July, the attackers, believed to be the infamous Lazarus Group, were tracked laundering more than $35 million in stolen funds through Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace that has reportedly become a hub for illicit activities. PeckShieldAlert also reported that an additional 500 BTC had been transferred across multiple wallets in August. However, all attempts to recover the stolen funds have been unsuccessful. The DMM Bitcoin hack ranks as Japan’s second-largest digital asset breach, following the $534 million Coincheck attack in 2018. Coincheck’s incident was mainly attributed to the exchange’s inadequate security practices. Most of the stolen tokens were stored in a single online hot wallet secured by just one private key rather than in offline cold storage or secure multi-signature wallets, as recommended by their issuer.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 22:42:00

The meme-based cryptocurrency has seen bullish momentum lately, grabbing the attention of investors and analysts alike. But is this rally sustainable, and could SHIB really soar to the heights some experts are predicting? Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks so. He just recently published insights suggesting SHIB may be targeting $0.000081, a massive 179% jump from where it is today. The market has been very unpredictable, but Marks said that this breakout is a sign of strength. Is this enough to keep SHIB in the spotlight? Bullish Signals Shine Bright Recent success by Shiba Inu in closing above important resistance levels has revived expectations for more gains. Technical successes along these lines are suggestive of good buy order accumulation. When SHIB continues on this trend, then reaching the $0.000081 target is not very far-fetched. $SHIB (Shiba Inu), after recently confirming another bull pattern, looks to be further joining the bull show as prices are now showing signs of MAJOR STRENGTH! With holding breakouts implying that $0.000081 target to still be in play, these prices can be subject to another… https://t.co/CKpxZb7CMh pic.twitter.com/lu2QT5FzEg — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00003061, which is an increase of 13% in the last 24 hours. That is no small achievement in a volatile market. According to analysts, for SHIB to keep on moving upward, maintaining support levels will be of prime importance. It is not about breaking resistance; it is also about staying above it. Recent Setbacks And Market Volatility However, not all has been smooth sailing. SHIB saw a slight pullback recently, dropping to $0.000029 after losing 6% in a single day. This decline mirrors a broader market slump, with the total crypto market cap shrinking by 6%. Even against Bitcoin, SHIB stumbled, recording a 4% loss. With these fluctuations, one can see the risks that crypto trading poses. Investors should wait for clear breakout confirmations and keep an eye on broader market trends. Short-term price movements are always misleading, so patience is key. The Road Ahead For Shiba Inu Beyond price movements, there are strategic moves made on the part of Shiba Inu to evolve its ecosystem. Developers are working on advanced integration of blockchain technologies to boost utility. Smarter contract platforms can transition it from a mere meme coin to a valuable tool for decentralized applications (dApps). The whole shift might attract long-term investors to look for more than speculative gain. Meanwhile, as the memecoin’s journey to $0.000081 is ambitious, the short-term to medium-term performance of Shiba Inu is quite robust, showing a 109% increase in the last three months. If the bullish trend is sustained and it takes advantage of the technology involved, even the critics will be surprised. For now, it is all about watching the key price levels and navigating through the volatile crypto waters. As always, investing in SHIB – or any crypto for that matter – carries risks, but the potential rewards continue to captivate many.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment products saw a surge in net inflows that brought yearly flows to $37.3 billion last week, a new record. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$270m last week, while the flows displayed an unusual dichotomy between assets within the asset class. Since the launch of options on US ETFs, despite their high initial volumes, we have not seen a commensurate rise in ETP volumes at US$22bn last week, compared to US$34bn the week prior. Total inflows this year so far are at a new record of US$37.3bn.” Source: CoinShares The US region led the world with $266 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong and Germany at $39 million and $12.3 million. “Minor outflows were seen in Switzerland and Canada of US$26m and US$10m respectively.” Following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) unsuccessful push for the key psychological price level of $100,000 last week, BTC saw outflows of $457 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) set a new record for yearly inflows. “In stark contrast, Ethereum saw inflows of US$634m, and has experienced a dramatic turnaround in sentiment which has seen year-to-date inflows hit US$2.2bn, finally beating its 2021 inflows record of US$2bn.” XRP products brought in $95 million, possibly due to possibility of an upcoming XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF).

After weeks of bitter standoffs, the National Assembly has finally agreed to vote in favor of a government-proposed bill that will see crypto tax launch in 2027 , rather than January 2025. Crypto-related Stocks: Buoyed by National Assembly News Gangwondomin Ilbo reported that crypto-related stock prices “rose in tandem” on the morning of December 2, reacting to developments over the weekend. Hanwha Investment & Securities share prices over the past five days on the Korea Exchange. (Source: Yahoo Finance) However, most of these price gains proved ephemeral, rising in the early morning and falling back slightly later in the day. Hanwha Investment & Securities, which owns shares in Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit crypto exchange , saw prices spike upwards as soon as the Korean Exchange opened on December 2. Both Hanwha Investment & Securities and Hanwha Investment & Securities Preferred Stock prices rose by 8% and 11% respectively.

Is it the innovation it brings to blockchain, its potential to solve real-world problems, or the jaw-dropping returns it could offer? With the crypto space brimming with opportunities, finding the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 can feel like striking gold. While Arbitrum has been gaining traction with its Layer-2 scalability and EOS continues to innovate with its smart contract capabilities, Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining what’s possible in crypto payments and asset management. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve your consideration. Qubetics ($TICS) Redefines Crypto Payments And Asset Management Qubetics is making cryptocurrency more accessible with its multi-chain wallet, an advanced application designed for users to manage digital assets with ease. The wallet is not just a storage space; it’s an all-in-one platform for debit and virtual card integration, and compatibility with payment giants like Apple Pay and Google Pay. With a decentralised VPN service and a tokenised asset marketplace, the Qubetics wallet is turning heads for its practical applications. The multi-chain wallet’s real-world utility is unmatched. A small business owner, for example, could use Qubetics to manage payments without worrying about high transaction fees. Imagine a local café offering its customers a way to pay with $TICS using the wallet’s integration with Visa or Mastercard. The business owner can instantly convert the tokens into stablecoins like USDT or USDC, providing reliable fiat currency payouts while bypassing crypto volatility. For developers, Qubetics simplifies blockchain interaction with its innovative design. Whether creating decentralised marketplaces or managing NFT royalties, the wallet streamlines every process. Even for artists, the ability to tokenise artwork and earn royalties every time their piece is resold is groundbreaking. The marketplace within the wallet also allows users to explore tokenised real-world assets like real estate and commodities, providing diversification opportunities that were once limited to institutional investors. The wallet’s accessibility across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms ensures users can manage their $TICS tokens and other digital assets anywhere. For a closer look at its features, watch this informatve video . The Qubetics Presale Opportunity The Qubetics presale continues to attract attention with its 11th stage already underway. Over 259 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 5,700 holders, raising an impressive $4.1 million. At the current price of $0.0282 per token, investors have a chance to lock in before the price increases by 10% in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a return of 783%. Investing in $TICS now could lead to life-changing returns. A $4,000 investment today would be worth $35,460 if the token reaches $0.25. Analysts forecast $TICS climbing to $1 post-presale, turning that investment into $137,450. Long-term projections indicate the token could hit $5, translating to $702,835, and at $15 after the mainnet launch, an astounding $2.1 million. These potential returns showcase why Qubetics is being recognised as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Arbitrum Strengthens Its Lead In Layer-2 Solutions Arbitrum is setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability. Designed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, it handles transactions off-chain to reduce congestion and costs. This makes it ideal for decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and developers looking for a reliable ecosystem. Recent updates reveal that Arbitrum has processed over 1 billion transactions, highlighting its growing adoption among developers and businesses. The introduction of streamlined deployment tools for smart contracts has further solidified its reputation as a preferred platform for blockchain applications. Arbitrum’s real-world relevance lies in its ability to cut costs and speed up transactions.

During the dip, Dogecoin whales have transferred over $100 million worth of DOGE, signaling significant market interest in the asset. As the meme coin continues to show signs of recovery, analysts predict that DOGE could potentially experience a 400% price surge in the upcoming bull cycle. Whale Transactions Indicate Increased Market Activity Recent reports reveal that two large transactions have taken place involving Dogecoin , involving over 249 million DOGE worth around $102 million. The first transaction saw 131 million DOGE transferred from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, while the second involved 117 million DOGE moved from Binance to an undisclosed wallet. These large transfers could suggest that whales are positioning themselves for a possible price move, while also indicating heightened market interest. The increased activity by major holders often signals potential price shifts. As DOGE trades above $0.40, many market participants are closely watching these large transfers, which may precede a breakout or retracement in price. In particular, the recent surge in trading volume by 77% suggests a rise in demand for Dogecoin, potentially setting the stage for the next big move. Analyst Predicts 400% Dogecoin Price Surge Market analyst Javon Marks has speculated that Dogecoin’s price could rise by 400% based on historical trends and Fibonacci extension levels. According to Marks, the meme coin is in its third bull cycle, following similar patterns from previous cycles in 2017 and 2021. The analyst believes that DOGE price could target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which currently sits at $2.28, up from its current price of around $0.42. In his analysis, Marks points out that during the previous bull cycles, Dogecoin surged from its market bottom to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. In 2017, DOGE rose from $0.00009 to a peak of $0.8750, while in 2021, the asset moved from $0.00168 to its current all-time high of $0.73995. Marks anticipates that a similar trend could unfold this time, with DOGE rising from its current cycle bottom at $0.06004 to $2.28. This represents a potential upside of 457% from the current price. DOGE Bullish Pennant Formation Signal Breakout Technical indicators are also signaling a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. The chart pattern currently forming suggests a Bullish Pennant, a continuation formation that typically precedes an upward breakout. After a strong price increase, DOGE has entered a consolidation phase, where it is currently trading near the $0.42 level. This consolidation may indicate a cooling-off period before the price makes another significant move. The breakout from this pattern could propel Dogecoin to higher levels. If the price clears key resistance at $0.45 and $0.50, it could test the projected target level of $0.65. This would align with the bullish structure observed in previous cycles, where DOGE experienced substantial upward movements following similar consolidations. doge/usd price chart (source: TradingView) As Dogecoin continues to consolidate, traders and analysts are keeping an eye on key support and resistance levels. The immediate support for DOGE lies at $0.40, where the price has recently stabilized. If this level holds, DOGE may be able to push through the next resistance at $0.45. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further gains, potentially bringing DOGE closer to the $0.50 mark amid Dogecoin ETF anticipation. On the other hand, if the price fails to hold above $0.40, there could be a pullback to lower support levels at $0.35.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 23:53:20

These big investments across various sectors signal continued institutional interest in Bitcoin, even as market volatility persists. From software intelligence firms to educational platforms, the influx of capital into the Bitcoin market suggests a bullish sentiment despite the recent price dip. Bitcoin Price Fluctuations Attract Institutional Investors On December 2, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm known for its Bitcoin investments, disclosed another substantial purchase. According to a Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company acquired 15,400 BTC for roughly $1.5 billion in cash, paying an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. This acquisition adds to MicroStrategy’s already considerable Bitcoin holdings, underscoring the company’s continued confidence in the cryptocurrency. For the quarter, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin return reached 38.7%, while its year-to-date return sits at 63.3%. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,400 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$95,976 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 38.7% QTD and 63.3% YTD. As of 12/2/2024, we hodl 402,100 $BTC acquired for ~$23.4 billion at ~$58,263 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/K3TK4msGp0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 2, 2024 Simultaneously, MARA Holdings, a company operating in the digital asset and blockchain computing industry, revealed its plan to secure $805 million by issuing convertible senior notes due in 2031. This capital raise seeks to bolster the company’s Bitcoin reserves and address existing debt. MARA intends to allocate up to $199 million to buy back a portion of its convertible notes maturing in 2026, utilizing the remaining funds to increase its Bitcoin holdings and support general corporate activities. $100k Bitcoin Price: A December Dream? Further fueling the Bitcoin market, Genius Group Limited, an AI-driven education company embracing a “Bitcoin-first” approach, announced on Monday that it had added $1.8 million to its Bitcoin treasury. The latest purchase raises the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 172 BTC, valued at $15.8 million, with an average net price of $92,006 per Bitcoin. This investment follows Genius Group’s recent commitment to hold at least 90% of its current and future reserves in Bitcoin, aiming to accumulate $120 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Adding to the wave of Bitcoin acquisitions, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled a shareholder reward program on Monday, offering Bitcoin prizes through a lottery system. Shareholders owning a minimum of 100 shares by December 31 are eligible for the program, which boasts a total prize pool of 30 million yen (approximately $199,500) in Bitcoin. Metaplanet has seen its stock soar by 1,000% in 2024, becoming Tokyo's top stock through its partnership with Sora Ventures and adopting Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy, showcasing the potential advantages of integrating Bitcoin into corporate finance. #Metaplanet … — Vanquish Adept (@VanquishAdept) December 2, 2024 The rewards, distributed via lottery, will be allocated to 2,350 shareholders in varying amounts. In addition, new accounts opened with SBI VC Trade between November 18th and March 31st, 2025, can participate by registering through a dedicated website before the deadline. Bitcoin Price Predictions: Institutional Influence on the Horizon Bitcoin’s price has experienced substantial fluctuations recently, with a considerable increase of approximately 40% following Trump’s U.S. presidential victory in November. The question now is whether the investments by companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, MARA Holdings, and Genius Group, amid a Bitcoin price dip, can provide the necessary momentum to propel the Bitcoin price towards this ambitious target in December. The current market dynamics, driven by massive investments from established and emerging players, suggest a potential upward trajectory for the Bitcoin price. With the $100k target in sight, the influence of institutional buying on the future of Bitcoin remains a topic of keen observation. The combined efforts of these major players create a new wave of investment, potentially signaling a bullish trend for Bitcoin despite the recent price fluctuation.

RCO Finance Positioned to Deliver 10,000x Gains from Its Lowest Point",https://timestabloid.com/missed-cardano-at-0-30-rco-finance-positioned-to-deliver-10000x/,"Missed the boat on Cardano’s meteoric rise from $0.30? Don’t fret; there may be another chance to realize outsized gains. The emerging RCO Finance is poised to follow a similar trajectory, offering investors the potential for 10,000x returns from its lowest point. With its presale selling off fast, RCOF could be the next big thing in crypto. But what are the factors contributing to this bullish outlook? Find the details below! RCO Finance: AI-Powered Investing for the Next Cardano-like Surge As we look to the future, RCO Finance has the potential to mirror the impressive rally of Cardano, which began when it was trading at just $0.30. RCO Finance stands out for its profit potential and innovative offerings as a DeFi trading platform with unique features tailored for crypto traders. A key aspect of RCO Finance’s appeal is its emphasis on artificial intelligence, particularly in its robo-advisor service. Just think about having a financial advisor who recommends which digital assets to buy or not to buy, depending on your taste and level of risk tolerance. Unlike typical robo-advisors who make generic suggestions, RCO Finance’s AI tool analyzes current market trends and investor-specific data, making it relevant for seasoned traders and newcomers eager to enter the market. This personalized guidance can significantly enhance your trading experience. Additionally, RCO Finance is set to launch an exciting new debit card product, allowing users to access their digital assets practically.

Investors who missed Cardano’s price rally, which began at a modest price of $0.30 are being offered another chance as ADA aims to regain the $1.50 mark. Currently priced at $1, ADA has remained stable, not dropping below this threshold despite recent market fluctuations. Bitcoin, which significantly influences Cardano’s token price, is also experiencing volatility and has yet to reach the anticipated $100,000. Nevertheless, Cardano investors are optimistic, with some analysts predicting ADA could reach $2.45 based on the Fibonacci sequence. Investors are hopeful for ADA’s continued upward movement, especially with recent advancements like the launch of the first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on Cardano. This development is expected to increase interest and demand for ADA, potentially leading to a price surge. RCOF Presale Stage 4: Buy Now at $0.077 Before It’s Too Late With RCO Finance having successfully raised over $7 million in its ongoing presale, this is your chance to seize a lucrative opportunity reminiscent of investing in Cardano at just $0.30. RCOF presale tokens are priced at only $0.0777 each in stage 4. This pricing strategy positions investors for an exciting future, with an anticipated launch price of $0.60, offering the potential for gains exceeding 600%. You can also enjoy a generous 50% discount on the current token price using the code RCOF50. Adding to the excitement, many experts are drawing parallels between RCOF and the historic Bitcoin price rally in 2021, owing to its deflationary model. This sentiment suggests that the token value could surge by an impressive 10000x. Don’t let this incredible opportunity pass you by—consider joining the RCOF presale today!

However, despite the closure, the brand’s Ethereum tokens will remain accessible to the public. RFTKT will launch an updated website to maintain its legacy On Monday, Nike’s digital fashion brand, RTFKT, disclosed that it will cease operations by the end of January 2025. In an X post, the platform commented: Today, we’re announcing the plan to wind down RTFKT operations. Looking back, we’re incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved together. ~ RTFKT The platform reflected on its past achievements, including the Clone X project with Takashi Murakami, the development of the first digital sneakers, and the number of artists and creators it has inspired. Additionally, it hopes to maintain this legacy by releasing an updated website that showcases its many works and designs. The brand also believes its innovative ethos will “live on through” the many creators and artists it motivated, adding that it has not come to an end but materialized into what it was always meant to be —an artifact of cultural evolution. Moreover, RTFKT still plans to launch one more ingenuity before its closure- the MNLTH X featuring the BLADE DROP. While the launch may break new technical ground, some analysts believe it could be perceived as a desperate revenue grab before closure. However, Nike is yet to confirm RTFKT‘s operation wind down. RTFKT and Nike have collaborated on shoe designs since 2021 Nike’s acquisition of RTFKT in 2021, under former CEO John Donahoe, came at a time when multiple companies wanted to pursue NFTs and the metaverse. Since then, the two have released incredible designer shoes, becoming a cult favorite for sports players. Even towards the end of 2023, streetwear designer Jeff Staple imagined a future where customers’ feet are scanned in-store for on-the-spot, zero-waste shoe production using recycled materials. During the Paris Olympics, Nike even unveiled a robot-powered, spray-on sneaker built using LightSpray technology that takes just three minutes to produce. No one would have imagined the closure of RTFKT barely four months after its last big launch. Before then, Nike had even revealed 13 AI-generated sneakers co-created alongside athletes, including Kylian Mbappé, LeBron James, and Sha’Carri Richardson.

Key Indicator Hints at Major Price Movement,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-enter-final-bull-phase-key-indicator-hints-at-major-price-movement/,"Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, appears to be on the brink of a potential sharp rise. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Crypto Dan, the market could experience a significant upward trend within the next two months. This insight , shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, is based on a critical market indicator that has historically signaled major price rallies. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Sharp Rise Incoming In the post titled “Strong Rise in Bitcoin is Expected Within 1-2 Months”, Crypto Dan highlights the emergence of a “golden cross” in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator. This occurrence, he notes, is a rare event that typically happens only once or twice during an entire bull market cycle. As part of the current bullish cycle that began in January 2023, its reappearance is being seen as a strong precursor to a substantial market move . For further context, the SOPR Ratio indicator measures realized profits and losses in the Bitcoin market, offering insight into investor sentiment. The “golden cross” identified by Crypto Dan signifies a pivotal moment in the bull cycle . Historically, this signal has been followed by strong price increases within two months of its appearance. Crypto Dan explained that the market is likely entering the final phase of the current upward cycle, a stage characterized by steeper price gains and shorter periods of consolidation . This means that while Bitcoin’s ascent might accelerate, the opportunities for investors to accumulate at lower prices could diminish rapidly. Furthermore, he projected that if the anticipated rise materializes by the end of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, it could draw significant new capital into the market. The inflow of additional funds is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum, potentially driving the market to its peak during this cycle. Dan wrote: As the market moves towards the later stages of the cycle, the magnitude of the rise tends to be larger, and the periods of decline/adjustment are shorter. If a steep rise occurs as implied by this indicator within the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, it can be expected that new inflows and additional funds will enter the market, bringing it to its peak. BTC Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to maintain stability above the $95,000 price mark. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $96,296, down by 1% in the past day but still up by nearly 40% in the past month. According to a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X, while some in the community expect a major retracement in Bitcoin’s price, BTC could do the opposite. The analyst projected BTC could surge to as high as $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction . Given the fact that #Bitcoin tends to do the opposite of what the crowd believes, there is potential for $BTC to go higher. If the current cycle behaves like the last two, #BTC could go to $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction. https://t.co/xTHJMITqJa — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 00:30:14

The decision, issued by Judge Kathaleen McCormick, strikes down the compensation agreement despite shareholders’ attempt to “re-ratify” the deal. McCormick’s ruling follows a previous judgment in January, where the pay package was invalidated. The judge’s decision adds another layer to the ongoing legal battle, with Tesla expected to pursue an appeal. Elon Musk’s $56B Tesla Compensation Deal Invalidated: Court Ruling Details According to a Monday court filing , Judge Kathaleen McCormick has denied the tech company’s request to revise her earlier decision regarding Elon Musk’s pay package. The legal team for Tesla had argued that the recent shareholder vote to “re-ratify” the deal addressed the court’s concerns from the first ruling. However, McCormick rejected this argument, citing that despite the vote, the pay package remained problematic. The judge maintained that the CEO’s compensation deal was influenced by his power over the board of directors, leading to terms that were not “entirely fair.” In her opinion, Tesla had failed to ensure that investors were fully informed before agreeing to the pay package. McCormick reiterated that while the board could have chosen an appropriate amount of compensation, it capitulated to Elon Musk’s terms, which the court found to be excessive. The judge added, “There were undoubtedly a range of healthy amounts that the Board could have decided to pay Musk. Instead, the Board capitulated to Musk’s terms and then failed to prove that those terms were entirely fair.” Moreover, the legal setback also carries a financial penalty for Tesla. In addition to the ruling on the compensation package, the court awarded the plaintiff’s attorneys a $345 million fee, which the tech company must pay in cash or shares. In response, the Tech giant said, “This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners – the shareholders.” Tesla To Appeal Ruling At Delaware Supreme Court Following McCormick’s decision, the tech company will appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. The company had hoped that the re-ratification by shareholders would allow the deal to proceed, but McCormick’s decision has created additional legal hurdles. A Delaware judge just overruled a supermajority of shareholders who own Tesla and who voted twice to pay @elonmusk what he’s worth. The court’s decision is wrong, and we’re going to appeal. This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware… — Tesla (@Tesla) December 2, 2024 The decision also raises broader questions about corporate governance and executive compensation in the tech industry. The outcome of the appeal could set an important precedent for future cases involving large executive pay packages. In other legal developments, the tech giant CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing the companies of engaging in anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model undermines competition in the AI sector. Elon Musk’s legal team argues that OpenAI, backed by a $13 billion investment from Microsoft, has been using its influence to suppress competitors, including xAI. Despite the ongoing legal challenges surrounding his pay package, Musk experienced a positive outcome in a separate legal battle. A U.S. District Court judge recently ruled in Musk’s favor in a case involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had sought to sanction Elon Musk over his handling of the X acquisition, but the court denied the request. The court noted that Elon Musk had already reimbursed the SEC for costs related to a missed meeting.

According to the Federal Government of Brazil’s document on Dec. 02, the central bank has opened the public consultation about the proposed idea of banning stablecoin withdraws to self-custody wallets. The central bank aims to amend several digital asset laws, including BCB Resolution No. 277 of 2022, which regulates the virtual asset service provider in the foreign exchange market. The growing trading volume and connections between digital assets and conventional financial instruments have led the government to regulate these withdrawals. “The topic has been widely discussed in international forums, which recommend the adoption of regulations and supervision compatible with the functionalities provided and the risks associated with such assets,” the proposal state. Another concern raised by the regulators is interconnected with traditional models, consumer and investor protections, prevention of illicit data purposes, and financial-macroeconomic stability. This proposal, with a due date of Feb. 02, 2025, would determine the regulatory body in which the activities of stablecoin would be included under the foreign exchange market or subject to Brazilian capital abroad and foreign capital in the country.

Table of Contents DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead Why now is the time to invest in DTX Exchange The future is hybrid As we are entering 2025 the altcoin market is starting to heat up. Drawing the attention of many investors is DTX Exchange (DTX), making headlines for its $9 million presale. As early backers have gained 400% already, many analysts are placing DTX Exchange ahead of Shina Inu (SHIB) as the most underrated altcoin ahead of 2025. DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale As traders set the trend away from speculative assets to coins with real-world applications, this creates opportunities for DTX Exchange to shine. While Shiba Inu continues to depend on community hype to run, DTX is building itself as a trustworthy and forward-looking platform. DTX Exchange is leading the first hybrid approach at addressing these critical challenges of trading including financial exclusion, inaccessibility to diverse markets, and lack of a holistic set of tools. DTX has a combined ecosystem of traditional and decentralized trading instruments that will appeal to both seasoned traders and crypto newcomers. Due to their growing reputation, DTX Exchange has had one of the most successful presales this year. DTX is a hot item amongst investors, with over $9,000,000 raised during early funding rounds.

DTX Exchange is making headlines for a limited-time offer, where investors who use the promo code SELLSTAGE get their deposit doubled. Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead The recent rise of Shiba Inu as a top 15 cryptocurrency came through the support of the viral community and speculative trading. Although hype plays a role in the crypto world, a maturing market is evaluating assets such as SHIB on their input. Even after the expansion of SHIB’s ecosystem into projects such as Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and Shib.io, more was needed for Shiba Inu to reach its previous peaks. As one of the weakest performers this cycle, SHIB’s price only increased by 40%. When compared to similar altcoins who experienced 100% growth, Shiba Inu has a lot of ground to reclaim.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 517,800 followers on the social media platform X that a bullish Ethereum ( ETH ) would be very favorable for the altcoin market. “An ETH breakout would lead the next wave of altcoin rallies.” Looking at Ethereum, the trader says ETH is very close to sparking a high timeframe breakout. “Ethereum is now pressing past the ~$3,700 resistance of its main pattern (light blue). A weekly close above the pattern top would kickstart a breakout and end the 2024 ETH downtrend.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum has closed the latest weekly candle above $3,700. At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,731. Late last month, Rekt said that Ethereum moving above $3,100 would trigger capital rotation from Bitcoin to ETH. He also shared a chart suggesting that capital would eventually move from ETH to mid-cap and subsequently lower-cap coins. “A weekly close above the blue diagonal resistance ($3,100) would likely set up another wave in the money flow cycle as ETH would take control of large-cap money flow.” Source: Rekt Capital/X As for Bitcoin, Rekt says the crypto king needs to rally above its immediate resistance to spark an upside burst toward the six-figure level. “Bitcoin is now trying to press beyond the bull flag top. A daily close above the bull flag resistance of ~$97,450 could kickstart additional trend continuation to get closer to challenging $100,000 once again.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,891.
