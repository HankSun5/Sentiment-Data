Proof of Shiba Inu's increasing power as its Shibarium recently blasted a new ATH in Total Value Locked (TVL). Pepe is also giving off breakthrough signals you would not want to miss. But here’s the twist: utility coins like Lunex Network are quietly gaining momentum. Lunex, a decentralized, non-custodial exchange, lets you trade directly while keeping full control of your assets. Plus, with exciting crypto presales heating up, now’s the perfect time to explore your next big move! Lunex shines in crypto presale with advanced utility and massive investor interest Have you noticed utility coins like Lunex taking the spotlight lately? It’s no surprise that Lunex is packed with features that make it stand out in the crypto world. Right now, the Lunex crypto presale is in full swing with tokens priced at just $0.0033. Over 1.78 billion tokens have already been sold, raising an impressive $3.7 million. It’s clear that investors are flocking to Lunex for good reasons. First, it’s all about the perks. Lunex offers advanced performance analytics, giving you real-time insights and predictive market tools to stay ahead of the curve. Plus, $LNEX token holders enjoy revenue redistribution through buybacks and staking rewards—a win-win for building your portfolio. This kind of utility is what’s drawing attention to Lunex during its crypto presale. But wait, there’s more! Lunex supports trading across 50,000 currency pairs on over 40 blockchains. That’s the flexibility you can’t ignore. If you’re looking for a strong utility coin to back, Lunex’s crypto presale might be your golden ticket! Shibarium strikes ATH: Shiba Inu's layer-2 increases independent of market upheaval Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 protocol has reached an interesting benchmark, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) achieving an ATH of $8.57 million. Despite SHIB’s current dip in TVL to $4.58 million, data shows Shiba-related activities dominate with $3.06 million, followed by WoofSwap and ChewySwap contributing $875,270 and $497,016, respectively. Shibarium's wallet activity is also on the rise, nearing 1.9 million addresses. This growth indicates strong engagement, with new wallets likely contributing to staking during the recent SHIB ATH. Even so, the community's unwavering participation continues to underscore Shibarium’s potential for long-term growth and innovation. Pepe’s bull flag signals a breakout on the horizon PEPE is showing exciting potential, with a bull flag pattern forming on its 4-hour chart, a classic signal of a possible breakout. This setup indicates that the meme coin could surpass $0.000025 and potentially reach as high as $0.000041. If this happens, all current holders could return to profitability, highlighting PEPE’s strong recovery prospects. Adding to the optimism is the Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) indicator, which reveals weak resistance at $0.000023 and solid support from PEPE holders. This means PEPE has room to grow, supported by a robust base of committed investors. However, as with any investment, it’s crucial to keep an eye on market conditions and make informed decisions. Why settle for less when Lunex could be your next big win? While Shiba and PEPE are making waves, Lunex stands out as the smarter choice. With itscrypto presale in full swing, Lunex offers advanced trading features, real-time analytics, and rewarding staking opportunities. Don't miss the chance to get in early—Lunex could be your best move toward achieving ATH gains!

While experts believe it will boost privacy-focused projects, many are unsure of its benefits to new cryptos like Lunex and established tokens like UNI and XLM. Regardless of its impact on DeFi, Lunex’s focus on security and enhanced privacy features already account for some of its massive attraction to investors and the explosion in its presale phase. Read more about why Lunex trump's XLM and UNI’s performance. Lunex Network attracts investors with privacy guarantee, sells 2 billion tokens With the rise of DeFi, users face growing security and privacy risks to their funds and data. Lunex Network (LNEX) addresses these challenges by offering innovative solutions, including a non-custodial wallet with access to over 50,000 assets across multiple blockchains. Users retain full control over their private keys, reducing risks of hacks or fund loss. Lunex further employs advanced encryption methods and regular smart contract audits, including by Solidproof, to add further protection layers, safeguard sensitive data, and prevent breaches. Lunex also prioritizes user privacy by minimizing data collection and eliminating reliance on centralized servers, reducing the risk of hacks or leaks. Its no-KYC policy allows users to trade, store, and manage assets anonymously. Making waves in its presale, this new crypto is closing in on 2 billion $LNEX tokens sold and almost $3.7 million in collected funds. It is currently available at an extremely low price of $0.0033, making now an excellent time to acquire LNEX tokens. Stellar (XLM) partners with Blockaid to upgrade security amid hacks Blockaid, a Web3 security platform, has partnered with XLM to enhance the protection of decentralized applications (dApps) by integrating its advanced Onchain Detection and Response (ODR) technology. The integration begins with XLM’s Freighter and Lobstr wallets, which will now benefit from Blockaid’s real-time threat monitoring and swift response capabilities. These security features aim to fortify the Stellar (XLM) blockchain against potential vulnerabilities. Ido Ben Natan, CEO of Blockaid, announced that the company’s latest round of security enhancements is designed to alert users about potentially risky transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), or tokens. Using Blockaid, XLM adds to its most recent security upgrade, which it partnered with Hypernative Labs. This partnership enabled Stellar to integrate advanced security features to prevent phishing attacks, fraud, and market manipulation. These improvements will likely drive greater adoption of the Stellar network, benefiting its native token, XLM. With increasing engagement from users and projects, XLM could see a surge in demand, potentially influencing its market price. Uniswap (UNI) upgrades security with a $15.5 million bounty Uniswap Labs (UNI) has offered $15.5 million to identify vulnerabilities in the core smart contracts of its v4 decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This initiative bolsters UNI’ssecurity and protects users' funds from potential risks. UNI’s announcement coincided with a significant price surge for its native token. Over the past week, UNI saw a 15% increase, with experts crediting the price rally to renewed optimism in the DeFi, coupled with Uniswap's proactive security measures. Despite UNI’s projection for a 30% increase and XLM’s for a massive surge, Lunex’ssecurity measures and additional features ensure it’s gaining faster. Investors have locked on to the enormous potential of the project, and they’re now positioning themselves to take advantage of the huge gains fast-approaching on the horizon.

A picture of the first bull to be traded on Solana AgriDex , a Solana-based real-world assets (RWA) marketplace and winner of the Stand With Crypto UK’s ‘Best Use Case’ Awards , made history this week by facilitating the world’s first trade of a live bull on the blockchain from Aurox Meats . The transaction was seamlessly executed through the AgriDex platform and recorded on the Solana blockchain. The bull comes from Gatcombe Park, the Princess Royal's herd. The White Park bull, Dinefwr Wyn, carries a lineage steeped in royal heritage, traced back to some of the most renowned bloodlines in the breed's history. “This historic transaction isn’t just bullish for Solana, it’s bullish for the entire global livestock market. AgriDex demonstrates how blockchain can bring greater accountability to the livestock trade, empowering farmers and suppliers while ensuring animal welfare standards are maintained,” said Henry Duckworth , Co-Founder and CEO of AgriDex. The Future of Solana Depends on Utility Memecoins may be fun, but Solana needs substance. While the blockchain’s speed, low fees, and scalability have fueled an explosion of memecoins, capturing retail traders and driving community engagement, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on more than fleeting hype. Real-World Assets (RWA) present a transformative alternative and offer sustainable growth and real-world value. In early 2024, RWA emerged as the second most profitable crypto narrative , delivering an impressive 285.6% return. For a brief moment in February, it even surpassed memecoins. RWA has been gaining further popularity and is emerging as one of the main narratives of the upcoming bull run. AgriDex leverages the power of Solana’s blockchain to revolutionise livestock trading with transparency, efficiency, and fairness. By ensuring every transaction is fully trackable, the platform reduces fraud and price manipulation across global supply chains. Its near-instant settlements come with significantly lower fees—just 0.15% per trade side—compared to traditional methods that often charge several percentage points and take 4-6 days to settle transactions. The successful facilitation of the trade on the blockchain showcases AgriDex’s commitment to innovation and highlights its role as a platform driving the adoption of blockchain for agricultural and livestock trades globally. As illustrated in the graph below, the project is expected to generate 133 million in profit by the end of 2028. Source: AgriDex Revolutionalise the agricultural industry with blockchain Set to launch on December 4th , Agridex is revolutionising the $2.3 trillion global agricultural trade industry by tokenising the supply chain. AgriDex offers farmers instant settlements, drastically reduced transaction costs, and fraud-proof traceability using blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enshrine legal contracts. The AgriDex Token ($AGRI) is launching at a valuation of $65 million and anticipates generating $53.28 million in trading fees by the end of 2026, supported by an expected net buy pressure of $39.2 million within two years. Blockchain technology is undeniably redefining the tech paradigm, but many have jumped on the trend solely for profit, often not solving a real-world problem. AgriDex, however, stands apart by delivering genuine utility, leveraging blockchain to drive meaningful impact and innovation in the agricultural sector. For instance, food fraud cost the UK £1.96 billion in 2021 and globally accounts for $30-40 Billion dollars in lost revenue. Food fraud is notoriously hard to detect with only 20% of suspected cases being reported. In the UK, of the 610 that were reported in 2021 there were only 16 successful prosecutions, or under 4%. Poor traceability and certificate verification The fraud highlighted above is enabled by the opacity of crossing multiple jurisdictions using wet contracts and poor visibility of origin for consumers. Dozens of different standards and certifications make it challenging to assure quality, origin and sustainability credentials. Source: AgriDex AgriDex solves the problem by providing an inclusive marketplace for all participants in the supply chain. It is driven by the immutable ledger of blockchain - that delivers trust, transparency, and accountability. The RWA platform built on Solana lowers the cost of food traded through it, increases choice, and delivers transparency, reducing fraud and verifying quality and origin and sustainability credentials. It is focused on solving critical issues with trading agricultural products and services including inefficiency, fraud, access to finance and insurance. AgriDex will create a fair and transparent financial system. The graph below illustrates the significant cost and time savings that AgriDex offers • Cost Savings: While traditional systems incur a cost of $1,125 per tonne of cocoa, AgriDex slashes this to just $660, highlighting a stark reduction in trade expenses.• Time Efficiency: Traditionally, such a transaction takes 65 days to complete, but with AgriDex, it's cut down to 40 days. This accelerated timeline demonstrates AgriDex’sefficiency. Source: AgriDex AgriDex is redefining the global agricultural trade industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and fraud-resistant marketplace. By reducing costs, cutting transaction times, and providing traceable records of quality, origin, and sustainability, the RWA platform on Solana addresses critical inefficiencies in the $2.3 trillion agricultural sector. As the first platform to successfully trade a live bull on Solana, AgriDex showcases the transformative potential of RWAs and sets a new standard for using blockchain to solve real-world problems, driving meaningful innovation and sustainable growth in agriculture.

This decision follows months of recovery efforts that ultimately failed to restore the platform’s viability. DMM Bitcoin to Transfer All Assets to SBI VC Trade According to a report from Nikkei Asia, the exchange also plans to sell all its assets to SBI VC Trade, a trading company owned by the SBI Group. SBI VC Trade confirmed in a December 2 statement that an agreement had been reached to acquire all assets of DMM Bitcoin as part of its liquidation process. The transfer, expected to conclude by the end of Q1 2025, will include customer accounts and assets held by the exchange. Details on the specific transfer methods and dates will be disclosed in future announcements. As part of the transition, the company plans to expand its services by offering 14 crypto spot trading options currently available on DMM Bitcoin’s platform. The two firms will continue discussing the asset and account transfer process. DMM Bitcoin was hacked on May 31, 2024, resulting in the theft of 4,502.9 BTC, worth approximately $305 million at the time. The exchange confirmed the breach , announcing that it had taken steps to prevent further unauthorized withdrawals by suspending all spot purchase transactions. Further, it assured customers it would reimburse lost funds by acquiring an equivalent amount of Bitcoin with backing from its associated companies. To that end, DMM Bitcoin secured a 5 billion yen loan in June and outlined plans to raise an additional 50 billion yen to meet its obligations. Failed Recovery Efforts Despite the recovery efforts, ongoing service restrictions and increased challenges forced the exchange to abandon its plans and ultimately decide to shut down its operations. In July, the attackers, believed to be the infamous Lazarus Group, were tracked laundering more than $35 million in stolen funds through Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace that has reportedly become a hub for illicit activities. PeckShieldAlert also reported that an additional 500 BTC had been transferred across multiple wallets in August. However, all attempts to recover the stolen funds have been unsuccessful. The DMM Bitcoin hack ranks as Japan’s second-largest digital asset breach, following the $534 million Coincheck attack in 2018. Coincheck’s incident was mainly attributed to the exchange’s inadequate security practices. Most of the stolen tokens were stored in a single online hot wallet secured by just one private key rather than in offline cold storage or secure multi-signature wallets, as recommended by their issuer.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 22:42:00

The meme-based cryptocurrency has seen bullish momentum lately, grabbing the attention of investors and analysts alike. But is this rally sustainable, and could SHIB really soar to the heights some experts are predicting? Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks so. He just recently published insights suggesting SHIB may be targeting $0.000081, a massive 179% jump from where it is today. The market has been very unpredictable, but Marks said that this breakout is a sign of strength. Is this enough to keep SHIB in the spotlight? Bullish Signals Shine Bright Recent success by Shiba Inu in closing above important resistance levels has revived expectations for more gains. Technical successes along these lines are suggestive of good buy order accumulation. When SHIB continues on this trend, then reaching the $0.000081 target is not very far-fetched. $SHIB (Shiba Inu), after recently confirming another bull pattern, looks to be further joining the bull show as prices are now showing signs of MAJOR STRENGTH! With holding breakouts implying that $0.000081 target to still be in play, these prices can be subject to another… https://t.co/CKpxZb7CMh pic.twitter.com/lu2QT5FzEg — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00003061, which is an increase of 13% in the last 24 hours. That is no small achievement in a volatile market. According to analysts, for SHIB to keep on moving upward, maintaining support levels will be of prime importance. It is not about breaking resistance; it is also about staying above it. Recent Setbacks And Market Volatility However, not all has been smooth sailing. SHIB saw a slight pullback recently, dropping to $0.000029 after losing 6% in a single day. This decline mirrors a broader market slump, with the total crypto market cap shrinking by 6%. Even against Bitcoin, SHIB stumbled, recording a 4% loss. With these fluctuations, one can see the risks that crypto trading poses. Investors should wait for clear breakout confirmations and keep an eye on broader market trends. Short-term price movements are always misleading, so patience is key. The Road Ahead For Shiba Inu Beyond price movements, there are strategic moves made on the part of Shiba Inu to evolve its ecosystem. Developers are working on advanced integration of blockchain technologies to boost utility. Smarter contract platforms can transition it from a mere meme coin to a valuable tool for decentralized applications (dApps). The whole shift might attract long-term investors to look for more than speculative gain. Meanwhile, as the memecoin’s journey to $0.000081 is ambitious, the short-term to medium-term performance of Shiba Inu is quite robust, showing a 109% increase in the last three months. If the bullish trend is sustained and it takes advantage of the technology involved, even the critics will be surprised. For now, it is all about watching the key price levels and navigating through the volatile crypto waters. As always, investing in SHIB – or any crypto for that matter – carries risks, but the potential rewards continue to captivate many.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment products saw a surge in net inflows that brought yearly flows to $37.3 billion last week, a new record. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$270m last week, while the flows displayed an unusual dichotomy between assets within the asset class. Since the launch of options on US ETFs, despite their high initial volumes, we have not seen a commensurate rise in ETP volumes at US$22bn last week, compared to US$34bn the week prior. Total inflows this year so far are at a new record of US$37.3bn.” Source: CoinShares The US region led the world with $266 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong and Germany at $39 million and $12.3 million. “Minor outflows were seen in Switzerland and Canada of US$26m and US$10m respectively.” Following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) unsuccessful push for the key psychological price level of $100,000 last week, BTC saw outflows of $457 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) set a new record for yearly inflows. “In stark contrast, Ethereum saw inflows of US$634m, and has experienced a dramatic turnaround in sentiment which has seen year-to-date inflows hit US$2.2bn, finally beating its 2021 inflows record of US$2bn.” XRP products brought in $95 million, possibly due to possibility of an upcoming XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Ethereum has gained market attention with funding of about $2.2 billion. This is a new record that exceeds the number of funds in 2021 by $2 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) inflow reached $34 billion, while the coin kept testing the target price of $100,000 in the past two weeks. “Bitcoin saw outflows of US$457m, the first significant outflows since early September this year in what we believe is profit taking following bitcoin testing the very psychological level of US$100k,” says CoinShares on the report. Multi-asset crypto and Solana ( SOL ) led the next inflow, which amounted to $441 million and $110 million, respectively. Although both cryptos have seen an outflow this week of $20 million, the month-to-date (MTD) flows have seen different results, with multi-crypto seeing an outflow of $25.3 million. In comparison, Solana records $40 million of inflow. Ripple’s XRP also records massive inflows, with $95 million this week and $141 million year-to-date (YTD).

After weeks of bitter standoffs, the National Assembly has finally agreed to vote in favor of a government-proposed bill that will see crypto tax launch in 2027 , rather than January 2025. Crypto-related Stocks: Buoyed by National Assembly News Gangwondomin Ilbo reported that crypto-related stock prices “rose in tandem” on the morning of December 2, reacting to developments over the weekend. Hanwha Investment & Securities share prices over the past five days on the Korea Exchange. (Source: Yahoo Finance) However, most of these price gains proved ephemeral, rising in the early morning and falling back slightly later in the day. Hanwha Investment & Securities, which owns shares in Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit crypto exchange , saw prices spike upwards as soon as the Korean Exchange opened on December 2. Both Hanwha Investment & Securities and Hanwha Investment & Securities Preferred Stock prices rose by 8% and 11% respectively.

Is it the innovation it brings to blockchain, its potential to solve real-world problems, or the jaw-dropping returns it could offer? With the crypto space brimming with opportunities, finding the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 can feel like striking gold. While Arbitrum has been gaining traction with its Layer-2 scalability and EOS continues to innovate with its smart contract capabilities, Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining what’s possible in crypto payments and asset management. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve your consideration. Qubetics ($TICS) Redefines Crypto Payments And Asset Management Qubetics is making cryptocurrency more accessible with its multi-chain wallet, an advanced application designed for users to manage digital assets with ease. The wallet is not just a storage space; it’s an all-in-one platform for debit and virtual card integration, and compatibility with payment giants like Apple Pay and Google Pay. With a decentralised VPN service and a tokenised asset marketplace, the Qubetics wallet is turning heads for its practical applications. The multi-chain wallet’s real-world utility is unmatched. A small business owner, for example, could use Qubetics to manage payments without worrying about high transaction fees. Imagine a local café offering its customers a way to pay with $TICS using the wallet’s integration with Visa or Mastercard. The business owner can instantly convert the tokens into stablecoins like USDT or USDC, providing reliable fiat currency payouts while bypassing crypto volatility. For developers, Qubetics simplifies blockchain interaction with its innovative design. Whether creating decentralised marketplaces or managing NFT royalties, the wallet streamlines every process. Even for artists, the ability to tokenise artwork and earn royalties every time their piece is resold is groundbreaking. The marketplace within the wallet also allows users to explore tokenised real-world assets like real estate and commodities, providing diversification opportunities that were once limited to institutional investors. The wallet’s accessibility across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms ensures users can manage their $TICS tokens and other digital assets anywhere. For a closer look at its features, watch this informatve video . The Qubetics Presale Opportunity The Qubetics presale continues to attract attention with its 11th stage already underway. Over 259 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 5,700 holders, raising an impressive $4.1 million. At the current price of $0.0282 per token, investors have a chance to lock in before the price increases by 10% in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a return of 783%. Investing in $TICS now could lead to life-changing returns. A $4,000 investment today would be worth $35,460 if the token reaches $0.25. Analysts forecast $TICS climbing to $1 post-presale, turning that investment into $137,450. Long-term projections indicate the token could hit $5, translating to $702,835, and at $15 after the mainnet launch, an astounding $2.1 million. These potential returns showcase why Qubetics is being recognised as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Arbitrum Strengthens Its Lead In Layer-2 Solutions Arbitrum is setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability. Designed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, it handles transactions off-chain to reduce congestion and costs. This makes it ideal for decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and developers looking for a reliable ecosystem. Recent updates reveal that Arbitrum has processed over 1 billion transactions, highlighting its growing adoption among developers and businesses. The introduction of streamlined deployment tools for smart contracts has further solidified its reputation as a preferred platform for blockchain applications. Arbitrum’s real-world relevance lies in its ability to cut costs and speed up transactions. DeFi platforms using Arbitrum can now process trades at a fraction of the cost, which is a game-changer for investors looking for efficiency. NFT marketplaces have also benefited from the platform’s ability to handle large volumes of transactions without slowing down. Analysts believe that as more projects migrate to Layer-2 solutions, the value of Arbitrum’s token, ARB, is likely to grow. With its innovative technology and growing user base, Arbitrum is clearly one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024 , particularly for those eyeing long-term scalability. EOS Continues To Innovate With Smart Contracts EOS has long been a key player in blockchain development, and recent upgrades have brought it back into the spotlight. Known for its focus on high performance and user-friendly interfaces, EOS remains a go-to platform for developers building decentralised applications (dApps). The latest Antelope protocol upgrade has boosted EOS’s scalability and security, making it even more appealing to developers. Reports indicate that the daily user count on EOS has grown by 18% over the past month, thanks to partnerships with gaming and DeFi platforms. EOS’s low transaction fees and fast processing speeds make it a practical choice for both developers and users. Imagine a gaming company creating a decentralised in-game economy on EOS without worrying about lag or high network costs. Similarly, financial institutions using EOS for DeFi applications can process loans and trades with near-instantaneous speeds. With its ongoing focus on innovation, EOS is well-positioned to attract more developers and investors. Its continued evolution makes it one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, especially for those looking for a platform that combines performance with reliability. Conclusion Whether you’re looking for scalability, smart contract innovation, or real-world usability, Qubetics ($TICS), Arbitrum, and EOS each bring something unique to the table. Arbitrum leads the charge in Layer-2 solutions, while EOS continues to refine its developer-friendly ecosystem. However, Qubetics stands out for its multi-chain wallet, blending innovation and practicality with a user-focused design. Its presale offers unmatched potential, with the opportunity to turn modest investments into life-changing returns. If you’re searching for the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics should be at the top of your list.

During the dip, Dogecoin whales have transferred over $100 million worth of DOGE, signaling significant market interest in the asset. As the meme coin continues to show signs of recovery, analysts predict that DOGE could potentially experience a 400% price surge in the upcoming bull cycle. Whale Transactions Indicate Increased Market Activity Recent reports reveal that two large transactions have taken place involving Dogecoin , involving over 249 million DOGE worth around $102 million. The first transaction saw 131 million DOGE transferred from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, while the second involved 117 million DOGE moved from Binance to an undisclosed wallet. These large transfers could suggest that whales are positioning themselves for a possible price move, while also indicating heightened market interest. The increased activity by major holders often signals potential price shifts. As DOGE trades above $0.40, many market participants are closely watching these large transfers, which may precede a breakout or retracement in price. In particular, the recent surge in trading volume by 77% suggests a rise in demand for Dogecoin, potentially setting the stage for the next big move. Analyst Predicts 400% Dogecoin Price Surge Market analyst Javon Marks has speculated that Dogecoin’s price could rise by 400% based on historical trends and Fibonacci extension levels. According to Marks, the meme coin is in its third bull cycle, following similar patterns from previous cycles in 2017 and 2021. The analyst believes that DOGE price could target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which currently sits at $2.28, up from its current price of around $0.42. In his analysis, Marks points out that during the previous bull cycles, Dogecoin surged from its market bottom to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. In 2017, DOGE rose from $0.00009 to a peak of $0.8750, while in 2021, the asset moved from $0.00168 to its current all-time high of $0.73995. Marks anticipates that a similar trend could unfold this time, with DOGE rising from its current cycle bottom at $0.06004 to $2.28. This represents a potential upside of 457% from the current price. DOGE Bullish Pennant Formation Signal Breakout Technical indicators are also signaling a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. The chart pattern currently forming suggests a Bullish Pennant, a continuation formation that typically precedes an upward breakout. After a strong price increase, DOGE has entered a consolidation phase, where it is currently trading near the $0.42 level. This consolidation may indicate a cooling-off period before the price makes another significant move. The breakout from this pattern could propel Dogecoin to higher levels. If the price clears key resistance at $0.45 and $0.50, it could test the projected target level of $0.65. This would align with the bullish structure observed in previous cycles, where DOGE experienced substantial upward movements following similar consolidations. doge/usd price chart (source: TradingView) As Dogecoin continues to consolidate, traders and analysts are keeping an eye on key support and resistance levels. The immediate support for DOGE lies at $0.40, where the price has recently stabilized. If this level holds, DOGE may be able to push through the next resistance at $0.45. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further gains, potentially bringing DOGE closer to the $0.50 mark amid Dogecoin ETF anticipation. On the other hand, if the price fails to hold above $0.40, there could be a pullback to lower support levels at $0.35.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 23:53:20

These big investments across various sectors signal continued institutional interest in Bitcoin, even as market volatility persists. From software intelligence firms to educational platforms, the influx of capital into the Bitcoin market suggests a bullish sentiment despite the recent price dip. Bitcoin Price Fluctuations Attract Institutional Investors On December 2, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm known for its Bitcoin investments, disclosed another substantial purchase. According to a Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company acquired 15,400 BTC for roughly $1.5 billion in cash, paying an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. This acquisition adds to MicroStrategy’s already considerable Bitcoin holdings, underscoring the company’s continued confidence in the cryptocurrency. For the quarter, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin return reached 38.7%, while its year-to-date return sits at 63.3%. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,400 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$95,976 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 38.7% QTD and 63.3% YTD. As of 12/2/2024, we hodl 402,100 $BTC acquired for ~$23.4 billion at ~$58,263 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/K3TK4msGp0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 2, 2024 Simultaneously, MARA Holdings, a company operating in the digital asset and blockchain computing industry, revealed its plan to secure $805 million by issuing convertible senior notes due in 2031. This capital raise seeks to bolster the company’s Bitcoin reserves and address existing debt. MARA intends to allocate up to $199 million to buy back a portion of its convertible notes maturing in 2026, utilizing the remaining funds to increase its Bitcoin holdings and support general corporate activities. $100k Bitcoin Price: A December Dream? Further fueling the Bitcoin market, Genius Group Limited, an AI-driven education company embracing a “Bitcoin-first” approach, announced on Monday that it had added $1.8 million to its Bitcoin treasury. The latest purchase raises the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 172 BTC, valued at $15.8 million, with an average net price of $92,006 per Bitcoin. This investment follows Genius Group’s recent commitment to hold at least 90% of its current and future reserves in Bitcoin, aiming to accumulate $120 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Adding to the wave of Bitcoin acquisitions, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled a shareholder reward program on Monday, offering Bitcoin prizes through a lottery system. Shareholders owning a minimum of 100 shares by December 31 are eligible for the program, which boasts a total prize pool of 30 million yen (approximately $199,500) in Bitcoin. Metaplanet has seen its stock soar by 1,000% in 2024, becoming Tokyo's top stock through its partnership with Sora Ventures and adopting Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy, showcasing the potential advantages of integrating Bitcoin into corporate finance. #Metaplanet … — Vanquish Adept (@VanquishAdept) December 2, 2024 The rewards, distributed via lottery, will be allocated to 2,350 shareholders in varying amounts. In addition, new accounts opened with SBI VC Trade between November 18th and March 31st, 2025, can participate by registering through a dedicated website before the deadline. Bitcoin Price Predictions: Institutional Influence on the Horizon Bitcoin’s price has experienced substantial fluctuations recently, with a considerable increase of approximately 40% following Trump’s U.S. presidential victory in November. The question now is whether the investments by companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, MARA Holdings, and Genius Group, amid a Bitcoin price dip, can provide the necessary momentum to propel the Bitcoin price towards this ambitious target in December. The current market dynamics, driven by massive investments from established and emerging players, suggest a potential upward trajectory for the Bitcoin price. With the $100k target in sight, the influence of institutional buying on the future of Bitcoin remains a topic of keen observation. The combined efforts of these major players create a new wave of investment, potentially signaling a bullish trend for Bitcoin despite the recent price fluctuation.

RCO Finance Positioned to Deliver 10,000x Gains from Its Lowest Point",https://timestabloid.com/missed-cardano-at-0-30-rco-finance-positioned-to-deliver-10000x/,"Missed the boat on Cardano’s meteoric rise from $0.30? Don’t fret; there may be another chance to realize outsized gains. The emerging RCO Finance is poised to follow a similar trajectory, offering investors the potential for 10,000x returns from its lowest point. With its presale selling off fast, RCOF could be the next big thing in crypto. But what are the factors contributing to this bullish outlook? Find the details below! RCO Finance: AI-Powered Investing for the Next Cardano-like Surge As we look to the future, RCO Finance has the potential to mirror the impressive rally of Cardano, which began when it was trading at just $0.30. RCO Finance stands out for its profit potential and innovative offerings as a DeFi trading platform with unique features tailored for crypto traders. A key aspect of RCO Finance’s appeal is its emphasis on artificial intelligence, particularly in its robo-advisor service. Just think about having a financial advisor who recommends which digital assets to buy or not to buy, depending on your taste and level of risk tolerance. Unlike typical robo-advisors who make generic suggestions, RCO Finance’s AI tool analyzes current market trends and investor-specific data, making it relevant for seasoned traders and newcomers eager to enter the market. This personalized guidance can significantly enhance your trading experience. Additionally, RCO Finance is set to launch an exciting new debit card product, allowing users to access their digital assets practically.

Investors who missed Cardano’s price rally, which began at a modest price of $0.30 are being offered another chance as ADA aims to regain the $1.50 mark. Currently priced at $1, ADA has remained stable, not dropping below this threshold despite recent market fluctuations. Bitcoin, which significantly influences Cardano’s token price, is also experiencing volatility and has yet to reach the anticipated $100,000. Nevertheless, Cardano investors are optimistic, with some analysts predicting ADA could reach $2.45 based on the Fibonacci sequence. Investors are hopeful for ADA’s continued upward movement, especially with recent advancements like the launch of the first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on Cardano. This development is expected to increase interest and demand for ADA, potentially leading to a price surge. RCOF Presale Stage 4: Buy Now at $0.077 Before It’s Too Late With RCO Finance having successfully raised over $7 million in its ongoing presale, this is your chance to seize a lucrative opportunity reminiscent of investing in Cardano at just $0.30. RCOF presale tokens are priced at only $0.0777 each in stage 4. This pricing strategy positions investors for an exciting future, with an anticipated launch price of $0.60, offering the potential for gains exceeding 600%. You can also enjoy a generous 50% discount on the current token price using the code RCOF50. Adding to the excitement, many experts are drawing parallels between RCOF and the historic Bitcoin price rally in 2021, owing to its deflationary model. This sentiment suggests that the token value could surge by an impressive 10000x. Don’t let this incredible opportunity pass you by—consider joining the RCOF presale today!

However, despite the closure, the brand’s Ethereum tokens will remain accessible to the public. RFTKT will launch an updated website to maintain its legacy On Monday, Nike’s digital fashion brand, RTFKT, disclosed that it will cease operations by the end of January 2025. In an X post, the platform commented: Today, we’re announcing the plan to wind down RTFKT operations. Looking back, we’re incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved together. ~ RTFKT The platform reflected on its past achievements, including the Clone X project with Takashi Murakami, the development of the first digital sneakers, and the number of artists and creators it has inspired. Additionally, it hopes to maintain this legacy by releasing an updated website that showcases its many works and designs. The brand also believes its innovative ethos will “live on through” the many creators and artists it motivated, adding that it has not come to an end but materialized into what it was always meant to be —an artifact of cultural evolution. Moreover, RTFKT still plans to launch one more ingenuity before its closure- the MNLTH X featuring the BLADE DROP. While the launch may break new technical ground, some analysts believe it could be perceived as a desperate revenue grab before closure. However, Nike is yet to confirm RTFKT‘s operation wind down. RTFKT and Nike have collaborated on shoe designs since 2021 Nike’s acquisition of RTFKT in 2021, under former CEO John Donahoe, came at a time when multiple companies wanted to pursue NFTs and the metaverse. Since then, the two have released incredible designer shoes, becoming a cult favorite for sports players. Even towards the end of 2023, streetwear designer Jeff Staple imagined a future where customers’ feet are scanned in-store for on-the-spot, zero-waste shoe production using recycled materials. During the Paris Olympics, Nike even unveiled a robot-powered, spray-on sneaker built using LightSpray technology that takes just three minutes to produce. No one would have imagined the closure of RTFKT barely four months after its last big launch. Before then, Nike had even revealed 13 AI-generated sneakers co-created alongside athletes, including Kylian Mbappé, LeBron James, and Sha’Carri Richardson.

Key Indicator Hints at Major Price Movement,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-enter-final-bull-phase-key-indicator-hints-at-major-price-movement/,"Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, appears to be on the brink of a potential sharp rise. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Crypto Dan, the market could experience a significant upward trend within the next two months. This insight , shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, is based on a critical market indicator that has historically signaled major price rallies. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Sharp Rise Incoming In the post titled “Strong Rise in Bitcoin is Expected Within 1-2 Months”, Crypto Dan highlights the emergence of a “golden cross” in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator. This occurrence, he notes, is a rare event that typically happens only once or twice during an entire bull market cycle. As part of the current bullish cycle that began in January 2023, its reappearance is being seen as a strong precursor to a substantial market move . For further context, the SOPR Ratio indicator measures realized profits and losses in the Bitcoin market, offering insight into investor sentiment. The “golden cross” identified by Crypto Dan signifies a pivotal moment in the bull cycle . Historically, this signal has been followed by strong price increases within two months of its appearance. Crypto Dan explained that the market is likely entering the final phase of the current upward cycle, a stage characterized by steeper price gains and shorter periods of consolidation . This means that while Bitcoin’s ascent might accelerate, the opportunities for investors to accumulate at lower prices could diminish rapidly. Furthermore, he projected that if the anticipated rise materializes by the end of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, it could draw significant new capital into the market. The inflow of additional funds is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum, potentially driving the market to its peak during this cycle. Dan wrote: As the market moves towards the later stages of the cycle, the magnitude of the rise tends to be larger, and the periods of decline/adjustment are shorter. If a steep rise occurs as implied by this indicator within the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, it can be expected that new inflows and additional funds will enter the market, bringing it to its peak. BTC Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to maintain stability above the $95,000 price mark. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $96,296, down by 1% in the past day but still up by nearly 40% in the past month. According to a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X, while some in the community expect a major retracement in Bitcoin’s price, BTC could do the opposite. The analyst projected BTC could surge to as high as $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction . Given the fact that #Bitcoin tends to do the opposite of what the crowd believes, there is potential for $BTC to go higher. If the current cycle behaves like the last two, #BTC could go to $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction. https://t.co/xTHJMITqJa — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 00:30:14

The decision, issued by Judge Kathaleen McCormick, strikes down the compensation agreement despite shareholders’ attempt to “re-ratify” the deal. McCormick’s ruling follows a previous judgment in January, where the pay package was invalidated. The judge’s decision adds another layer to the ongoing legal battle, with Tesla expected to pursue an appeal. Elon Musk’s $56B Tesla Compensation Deal Invalidated: Court Ruling Details According to a Monday court filing , Judge Kathaleen McCormick has denied the tech company’s request to revise her earlier decision regarding Elon Musk’s pay package. The legal team for Tesla had argued that the recent shareholder vote to “re-ratify” the deal addressed the court’s concerns from the first ruling. However, McCormick rejected this argument, citing that despite the vote, the pay package remained problematic. The judge maintained that the CEO’s compensation deal was influenced by his power over the board of directors, leading to terms that were not “entirely fair.” In her opinion, Tesla had failed to ensure that investors were fully informed before agreeing to the pay package. McCormick reiterated that while the board could have chosen an appropriate amount of compensation, it capitulated to Elon Musk’s terms, which the court found to be excessive. The judge added, “There were undoubtedly a range of healthy amounts that the Board could have decided to pay Musk. Instead, the Board capitulated to Musk’s terms and then failed to prove that those terms were entirely fair.” Moreover, the legal setback also carries a financial penalty for Tesla. In addition to the ruling on the compensation package, the court awarded the plaintiff’s attorneys a $345 million fee, which the tech company must pay in cash or shares. In response, the Tech giant said, “This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners – the shareholders.” Tesla To Appeal Ruling At Delaware Supreme Court Following McCormick’s decision, the tech company will appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. The company had hoped that the re-ratification by shareholders would allow the deal to proceed, but McCormick’s decision has created additional legal hurdles. A Delaware judge just overruled a supermajority of shareholders who own Tesla and who voted twice to pay @elonmusk what he’s worth. The court’s decision is wrong, and we’re going to appeal. This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware… — Tesla (@Tesla) December 2, 2024 The decision also raises broader questions about corporate governance and executive compensation in the tech industry. The outcome of the appeal could set an important precedent for future cases involving large executive pay packages. In other legal developments, the tech giant CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing the companies of engaging in anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model undermines competition in the AI sector. Elon Musk’s legal team argues that OpenAI, backed by a $13 billion investment from Microsoft, has been using its influence to suppress competitors, including xAI. Despite the ongoing legal challenges surrounding his pay package, Musk experienced a positive outcome in a separate legal battle. A U.S. District Court judge recently ruled in Musk’s favor in a case involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had sought to sanction Elon Musk over his handling of the X acquisition, but the court denied the request. The court noted that Elon Musk had already reimbursed the SEC for costs related to a missed meeting.

According to the Federal Government of Brazil’s document on Dec. 02, the central bank has opened the public consultation about the proposed idea of banning stablecoin withdraws to self-custody wallets. The central bank aims to amend several digital asset laws, including BCB Resolution No. 277 of 2022, which regulates the virtual asset service provider in the foreign exchange market. The growing trading volume and connections between digital assets and conventional financial instruments have led the government to regulate these withdrawals. “The topic has been widely discussed in international forums, which recommend the adoption of regulations and supervision compatible with the functionalities provided and the risks associated with such assets,” the proposal state. Another concern raised by the regulators is interconnected with traditional models, consumer and investor protections, prevention of illicit data purposes, and financial-macroeconomic stability. This proposal, with a due date of Feb. 02, 2025, would determine the regulatory body in which the activities of stablecoin would be included under the foreign exchange market or subject to Brazilian capital abroad and foreign capital in the country.

Drawing the attention of many investors is DTX Exchange (DTX), making headlines for its $9 million presale. As early backers have gained 400% already, many analysts are placing DTX Exchange ahead of Shina Inu (SHIB) as the most underrated altcoin ahead of 2025. DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale As traders set the trend away from speculative assets to coins with real-world applications, this creates opportunities for DTX Exchange to shine.

DTX Exchange is making headlines for a limited-time offer, where investors who use the promo code SELLSTAGE get their deposit doubled. Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead The recent rise of Shiba Inu as a top 15 cryptocurrency came through the support of the viral community and speculative trading. Although hype plays a role in the crypto world, a maturing market is evaluating assets such as SHIB on their input. Even after the expansion of SHIB’s ecosystem into projects such as Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and Shib.io, more was needed for Shiba Inu to reach its previous peaks. As one of the weakest performers this cycle, SHIB’s price only increased by 40%. When compared to similar altcoins who experienced 100% growth, Shiba Inu has a lot of ground to reclaim.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 517,800 followers on the social media platform X that a bullish Ethereum ( ETH ) would be very favorable for the altcoin market. “An ETH breakout would lead the next wave of altcoin rallies.” Looking at Ethereum, the trader says ETH is very close to sparking a high timeframe breakout. “Ethereum is now pressing past the ~$3,700 resistance of its main pattern (light blue). A weekly close above the pattern top would kickstart a breakout and end the 2024 ETH downtrend.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum has closed the latest weekly candle above $3,700. At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,731. Late last month, Rekt said that Ethereum moving above $3,100 would trigger capital rotation from Bitcoin to ETH. He also shared a chart suggesting that capital would eventually move from ETH to mid-cap and subsequently lower-cap coins. “A weekly close above the blue diagonal resistance ($3,100) would likely set up another wave in the money flow cycle as ETH would take control of large-cap money flow.” Source: Rekt Capital/X As for Bitcoin, Rekt says the crypto king needs to rally above its immediate resistance to spark an upside burst toward the six-figure level. “Bitcoin is now trying to press beyond the bull flag top. A daily close above the bull flag resistance of ~$97,450 could kickstart additional trend continuation to get closer to challenging $100,000 once again.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,891.

Whether it’s Elon Musk’s tweets or the rise of meme culture, coins like Gigachad, Ponke, and BTFD Coin are adding flair to investing. They’ve gone from being jokes to genuine opportunities for some serious gains. Among these, BTFD Coin is rewriting the meme coin rulebook. From its viral presale to its jaw-dropping numbers, this token is rallying the community like no other. Wondering if it’s one of the best meme coins to join this week? Let’s dive in and break it down! BTFD Coin: The Underdog That’s Leading the Pack If you’re looking for meme coin royalty in the making, BTFD Coin is your ticket. Since its presale launched on November 26, 2024, it has smashed expectations, raising over $500,000 in just one week. With a current price of $0.000058 in Stage 6, early investors are already dreaming of moonshots. The kicker? The 16-stage presale is designed to reward early adopters, giving them an edge before its price skyrockets post-launch. Analysts are bullish, predicting a potential listing price of $0.0006, which could multiply your returns. Imagine this: Investing $4,000 in Stage 6 at $0.000058. That’s a whopping 68.9 million BTFD Coins in your wallet. When it hits $0.0006, your investment could balloon to over $41,000. Now that’s meme coin magic. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers. It’s community-driven with perks like staking rewards and a play-to-earn (P2E) game. The devs are focused on sustainability, so it’s not just another pump-and-dump. In the wild world of crypto, this coin’s roadmap stands out. Gigachad: Flexing Its Meme Muscles What’s more alpha than a Chad? A Gigachad. This coin has all the swagger of its internet namesake, but can it keep the hype alive? Launched with a meme-heavy marketing campaign, Gigachad gained traction quickly, especially among Gen Z investors. Its tagline? “Be the Chad, own the coin.” The beauty of Gigachad lies in its simplicity. The project focuses on community and decentralisation. With minimal utility but maximum meme appeal, it’s a crowd favourite for short-term gains. However, experts warn about its volatility. You’ve got to be ready to “buy the dip” (pun intended) to ride the waves. For investors who love fast-paced action, Gigachad is like riding a rollercoaster. Just don’t forget: It’s risky business. This meme coin thrives on trends, so if the hype fizzles, so might the profits. Ponke: The Wholesome Meme Coin Who knew a frog could be so relatable? Enter Ponke, a coin inspired by its charmingly innocent frog mascot. While its cuteness might seem like a gimmick, Ponke is carving out a niche in eco-friendly initiatives. Yep, this meme coin has a green side. Ponke’s creators have partnered with environmental groups, turning their coin into a movement. Every transaction contributes to reforestation projects, giving it a feel-good factor that’s rare in the meme coin space. Add in low transaction fees and an enthusiastic community, and you’ve got a contender with real staying power. But don’t mistake Ponke for a purely feel-good coin. Its market cap has been climbing steadily, and its user base is growing across the globe. The eco-friendly angle could make it a favourite among investors who value purpose over just profits. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is buzzing with opportunities. From Gigachad’s unapologetic boldness to Ponke’s eco-conscious heart, there’s no shortage of excitement. But one coin is leading the charge: BTFD Coin . Don’t miss your chance to join the presale while it’s still in Stage 6. With its impressive performance and strong community backing, BTFD Coin is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Join the presale today and ride the wave to crypto glory.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 01:18:00

Qubetics flips the script with decentralised, secure, and scalable solutions. But it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, providing access to decentralised applications (dApps) across multiple chains. Analysts are hyped. With a presale price of $0.0282, projections estimate $TICS hitting $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a mind-blowing 52,912% ROI. Think about it. An investment of $1,000 today could become $530,000. Still waiting? Every second counts as the presale journey takes the top flight. 2. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Blockchain Pioneer Cardano has long been hailed as the “Ethereum killer.” Why? Because it focuses on scalability, sustainability, and energy efficiency. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano is constantly upgrading its ecosystem. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is not only eco-friendly but also incredibly secure. Cardano’s upcoming Hydra upgrade aims to process over a million transactions per second. That’s a massive leap forward in blockchain scalability. While its price movements have been steady, analysts predict substantial growth as adoption increases. If you’re into long-term stability with room for explosive growth, $ADA is a solid bet. 3. Solana ($SOL): The Speed Demon Solana is the Ferrari of blockchains—fast, flashy, and always stealing the spotlight. With transaction speeds reaching 65,000 per second, Solana leaves competitors in the dust. It’s already a favourite for NFT platforms and decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. But speed isn’t Solana’s only strength. Its low fees and growing ecosystem are attracting developers and investors alike. While some argue its centralisation is a drawback, others see it as a feature for scalability. With $SOL’s price currently undervalued, now might be the perfect time to grab some before the next bull run. 4. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Multiverse of Blockchains Avalanche is redefining how blockchains interact. Its subnet architecture allows for custom, scalable chains that still connect to the main Avalanche network. Think of it as a multiverse where every blockchain has its own rules but can still communicate seamlessly. This flexibility makes Avalanche a favourite for institutions and enterprises. Its ecosystem is booming, with projects ranging from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Analysts predict strong upward momentum for $AVAX, especially as its partnerships grow. Avalanche might not promise the astronomical gains of Qubetics, but it’s a solid pick for those who want a balance of innovation and reliability. 5. Polygon ($MATIC): Ethereum’s Best Friend Ethereum may be the king, but even kings need allies. Polygon acts as a scaling solution for Ethereum, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees. Its Layer-2 network has become the go-to choice for developers who want Ethereum’s security without the high gas fees. With high-profile collaborations, including partnerships with Disney and Reddit, Polygon is proving its value in the real world. Its upcoming zkEVM upgrade promises even faster transactions and greater scalability. Analysts believe $MATIC could see a significant price increase as Ethereum’s dominance continues. The Final Word Every crypto investor has a “what if” story. What if I’d bought Bitcoin at $100? What if I’d gotten in on Ethereum’s ICO? Here’s your chance to avoid another regret. Qubetics is the real deal, and its presale is your golden ticket. The best cryptos to buy now don’t wait for anyone. Get in on Qubetics before the next stage hits, and secure your slice of the future. The clock’s ticking.

Both projects are making headlines, each vying for dominance in a fiercely competitive market. But while these giants race forward, another name is quietly reshaping the narrative with its own groundbreaking innovations—Qubetics. Qubetics is shaking things up as it enters the 11th stage of its presale. With over $4.1 million raised and analysts forecasting $10–$15 for $TICS post-mainnet, it’s hard not to feel the FOMO. Beyond the numbers, Qubetics isn’t just another presale hype train; it’s offering a real solution to blockchain’s long-standing usability and scalability issues with its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE. In a sea of coins, Qubetics might just be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. Qubetics: A Presale Turning Heads Qubetics is officially in the 11th stage of its presale, and things are getting spicy. With over 259 million $TICS tokens sold, raising a jaw-dropping $4.1 million, investors are buzzing with excitement. And why wouldn’t they be? Analysts are throwing around predictions of $10 to $15 for $TICS after its mainnet launch, which could mean life-changing returns for early adopters. Just imagine turning an $85,000 investment into millions—are you in yet? Beyond the numbers, Qubetics isn’t just another coin on the block. It’s bringing something truly game-changing to the table: QubeQode IDE . This revolutionary toolkit aims to smooth over blockchain’s rough edges, finally making decentralised applications user-friendly and scalable. Ever struggled with clunky, unintuitive blockchain apps? QubeQode IDE is the answer, promising streamlined user experiences and robust transaction processing. With scalability and usability finally sorted, this could be a turning point for blockchain tech. Solana: Still the Speed King Solana’s making moves, and not just in its lightning-fast transaction speeds. The blockchain has been buzzing with ecosystem developments, keeping its community pumped. Did you catch the latest news about Solana’s dominance in NFT trading? It’s no wonder the coin remains a favourite for developers who value performance above all else. But here’s the catch: Solana isn’t immune to blockchain’s big dilemmas. Outages and centralisation concerns keep popping up in conversations. Still, its unmatched throughput continues to solidify its position as a leader in the space. If you’re a fan of efficiency, Solana’s showing no signs of slowing down. Cardano: Slow and Steady Wins the Race? Cardano’s price has been a rollercoaster, with recent rallies turning heads. Yet, even amid cooling markets, this blockchain giant is proving its staying power. Analysts are divided on whether ADA can sustain its growth, but let’s not ignore its solid fundamentals. With a strong focus on research and development, Cardano is often seen as the “academic blockchain” that plays the long game. Despite its reputation for taking things slow, Cardano’s scalability solutions and environmentally conscious approach give it an edge in this crowded market. Investors are watching closely, waiting to see if ADA’s cautious climb can outpace its flashier competitors like Solana and Qubetics. Conclusion Qubetics , Solana, and Cardano are rewriting the rules of crypto investing. Whether you’re in it for speed, sustainability, or revolutionary tools like QubeQode IDE, one thing’s for sure—there’s never been a better time to dive in. So, which one’s grabbing your cash?

Bitcoin SOPR Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Crossover As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out , the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has shown a golden crossover recently. The “ SOPR ” here refers to an indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold/transferred to see what price it was moved at last time. If this price is less than the current spot price for any token, its sale contributes to profit realization. Similarly, transactions involving coins of the opposite type imply loss realization is occurring. The SOPR sums up these profits and losses for the entire sell supply, and determines their ratio. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the average holder could be assumed to be selling their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, being under the mark implies that the overall market is realizing more losses than profits. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin SOPR over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin SOPR fell under the 365-day earlier in the year, but recently, it has reversed its direction and has broken past the level. This increase naturally corresponds to the return of notable profit-taking in the sector following the latest rally of the cryptocurrency. In the chart, the quant highlighted the previous instances of this crossover. It would appear that each of these led into bullish price action for the asset. “After the golden cross appears, the market usually starts a strong rise within 2 months at the latest,” notes the analyst. Thus, it’s possible that Bitcoin could be gearing up for another run shortly. This latest bullish crossover in the Bitcoin SOPR is the second time this cycle that the pattern has appeared, so it’s possible that the run now would lead the asset to its final peak of the cycle. It remains to be seen, though, whether the crossover between the monthly and yearly averages of the indicator would prove to be bullish for BTC or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $95,000, down almost 3% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin rally|Bitcoin Rise|Bitcoin SOPR|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 02:00:14

The S&P 500 has regained momentum after a November rally, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY ) is holding its ground near 106, and altcoins are stealing the spotlight with the Altcoin Season Index spiking to 84—a yearly high. Bitcoin ($BTC ), meanwhile, appears to be taking a breather, hovering near $95K after its breakout run from the $73K range. Source: coinmarketcap.com Historically, December following U.S. presidential elections is known for bullish tendencies, but this year brings mixed signals. While the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% ( link ), the dollar's strength poses a headwind for risk assets. At the same time, a full-force altcoin rally suggests traders are rotating capital, betting on high-risk assets during a speculative frenzy. As traders, whether short- or long-term, our mission is clear: stay prepared, plan our entries, and avoid chasing the first dip without a solid strategy (because let’s face it, the first dip can be a trick). In this analysis, we'll explore three likely correction scenarios for Bitcoin, identify actionable buy-the-dip levels, and highlight the technical reasoning and risks for each. Scenario 1: The Sideways Range Between $91K-$100K Key Technicals: Bitcoin's recent price action suggests the potential formation of a new range between $91K and $100K. The weekly candle’s inside-bar structure between $91000 & $98000 signals indecision, aligning with typical range-bound behavior (inside bars occur when the high and low of a candle are ""inside"" the range of the previous candle, often preceding continuation or reversal moves). On the daily timeframe, $91K is a temporary horizontal support level, while $100K serves as psychological resistance. Strategy: Wait for Confirmation: Monitor Bitcoin’s behavior near the $91K-$92K zone for strong support confirmation via bounce volume or bullish engulfing candles. Buy-the-Dip Level: Between $91K-$92K, aiming for $98K-$100K on the rebound. Stop Loss: Below $89.5K to avoid deeper downside risks. Monitor: Volume spikes and RSI divergence on the 4H/1D charts to confirm ranging activity. Why This Matters: Ranging price action is a hallmark of consolidation phases, often preparing for the next big move. By waiting for confirmation of $91K as a reliable floor, traders can exploit price oscillations between $91K and $100K for swing opportunities. Scenario 2: The Deeper Correction to $81K-$83K Key Technicals: The liquidation heatmap highlights a significant cluster of long liquidations between $83K-$85K, which could act as a liquidity magnet if Bitcoin loses $91K support. There’s a fair value gap (FVG) between $81.3K and $89.5K visible on higher timeframes. FVGs represent imbalances in price action, often revisited before a trend resumes. The Fibonacci retracement tool aligns the Golden Ratio (0.618) with this zone, adding a layer of confluence. Strategy: Set Alerts for Breakdown: If Bitcoin closes a daily candle below $91K with rising sell volume, prepare for entries near $81K-$83K. Buy-the-Dip Level: Between $81K-$83K, targeting $91K on the bounce. Stop Loss: Below $80K to account for false breakdowns. Monitor: Price action around the Golden Ratio (0.618) and the lower bound of the FVG for bullish reversals. Why This Matters: This scenario assumes a market maker-driven move to flush out over-leveraged longs, creating a prime re-entry point. A 15%-18% correction from the current price would still be modest compared to past cycles, presenting a realistic and lucrative buy zone. Scenario 3: A Full Breakdown to $70K-$73K Key Technicals: The 200-day SMA ($67.3K) and the top of the February-November accumulation range ($73K) act as key dynamic and horizontal supports, respectively. Below $80K, the next liquidity cluster lies between $70K-$73K, marking the ultimate ""stink order"" zone for longer-term entries. Historical cycles suggest that Bitcoin rarely retraces this deeply during December, but if it does, the opportunity could be significant. Strategy: Stagger Stink Orders: Place staggered bids between $70K-$73K to catch potential wicks during panic-driven sell-offs. Target: $85K-$90K for partial exits, holding moonbags for potential continuation to $98K+. Stop Loss: Below $67K, the 200-day SMA, as a hard floor. Monitor: Broad market conditions, including DXY strength and altcoin liquidity flow, to gauge overall risk appetite. Why This Matters: Though less likely, this scenario prepares traders for worst-case corrections while capitalizing on extreme fear-driven moves. Long-term buyers could use this zone to accumulate Bitcoin at significant discounts. Wider Context and December Outlook Bitcoin’s current setup reflects a tug-of-war between bullish seasonality (December is traditionally a strong month for risk assets) and macroeconomic headwinds like the dollar's strength. With the Altcoin Season Index at 84, suggesting speculative enthusiasm, Bitcoin could stay range-bound while altcoins dominate short-term performance. The Federal Reserve's likely decision to hold interest rates steady in two weeks adds to this mix, reducing near-term monetary uncertainty. Yet, until Bitcoin firmly establishes a new range or confirms $100K as a breakout point, traders must remain cautious. Summary: Navigating December with a Plan In conclusion: Scenario 1 ($91K-$100K): Likely range action, tradeable for swing traders. Scenario 2 ($81K-$83K): Deeper correction, ideal for mid-term positions. Scenario 3 ($70K-$73K): The ultimate crash zone, best for long-term accumulation. With a strategic approach, December can be both profitable and exciting. Remember, it’s Santa season—a time for optimism—but also for discipline. Invest wisely, stick to your plan, and let the market come to you. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Liquidity Gamechanger on the Horizon?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galachain-x-ton-bridge-liquidity-gamechanger-on-the-horizon/,"The GalaChain ecosystem has become notorious for innovative teams taking Web3 to new levels from what’s commonly known. Recent discussions show the people-powered AI solution is a major player in a planned move that could drive significant liquidity to and fro GalaChain and other significant players in Web3. If achieved, the bridge will further strengthen its standing as the most innovative in the ecosystem. In a recent tweet, the disclosure was made about a bridge between GalaChain and the TON ecosystem. According to the tweet, the decided bridge is part of a broader strategy to develop core technologies to support $TON. Interestingly, this is not just about TON and GalaChain. This move could see liquidity flow between high-potential ecosystems in Web3—something you don’t see often in the blockchain ecosystem. No surprises, as this has been the kind of innovative moves GalaChain has become synonymous with. A Bridge of Opportunity Blockchain bridges are not new. They are becoming increasingly critical as interoperability becomes the holy grail of decentralized finance. A possible GalaChain-TON bridge holds the potential to unlock vast amounts of liquidity. GalaChain has become popular for innovation within the Web3 ecosystem. It is a Layer 1 Blockchain developed by Gala, that serves as a core for its web3 entertainment ecosystem that includes games, music and film. With a strong community of thinker’s and builders driving the vision of blockchain technology, it has seen major dynamic Layer 1 solutions built in rapid fashion. Boasting a flexibility not seen on other chains, the actual design of GalaChain is to bring the next billion users on-chain. On the other hand TON has built a reputation as a powerhouse blockchain with a focus on speed and efficiency. The blockchain is also known for its scalability and growing adoption. Together, these two chains could create a liquidity superhighway, offering seamless asset transfer, reduced barriers to entry, and a more integrated user experience. The bridge’s impact on liquidity and trading volume will reflect the strength of both ecosystems. Liquidity providers and marketing participants could see significant benefits, with increased cross-chain activity and the possibility of new trading pairs enhancing market dynamics. Additionally, as decentralized finance continues to expand, the bridge could introduce new opportunities for yield farming, staking, and other financial instruments. This will further drive liquidity and utility for both chains. Stronger Implications for Other Stakeholders The tweet emphasized an effect that doesn’t just involve $GALA and $TON, but a significant innovation that will have a ripple effect on multiple blockchain protocols. According to the tweet, TON has already built a bridge that allows users to transfer assets between TON Blockchain and the Ethereum Blockchain, as well as between TON and the BNB Smart Chain. A GalaChain-TON bridge will enable massive liquidity flow to TON that would trickle down to other ecosystems linked to TON. Notably, GalaChain also has an ETH bridge , signalling how big players in the ecosystem are quick to collaborate with the chain. The GalaChain Ethereum bridge is a crucial component of the Gala Games ecosystem, enabling seamless transfer of GALA tokens between the Ethereum network and GalaChain. The bridge facilitates the transfer of GALA tokens in both directions: from Ethereum to GalaChain and vice versa. For users in the United States, the Galachain X Ton bridge could be a lifeline. $TON is difficult to acquire due to regional restrictions, but the bridge with GalaChain would provide an alternative. US-based users could potentially access TON’s ecosystem without the usual hurdles, enhancing both usability and adoption. A GalaChain-TON bridge could set new standards for how blockchains collaborate. Of course, all bridges come with obvious challenges. Security, scalability, and user adoption are all critical factors that will determine the success of any cross-chain initiatives. Despite the aforementioned concerns, the individual strength of both chains can navigate these hurdles and present immense rewards. The latest communication however, sends a wave of optimism for both ecosystems, especially those interested in seeing this collaboration drive more cutting edge innovations. There is a clear anticipation that underlines the need for more accessible, efficient, and interconnected systems.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain|TON,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|TON|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-03 02:31:07

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 02:36:00

Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently announced plans to delist stablecoins that do not comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) by December 30, 2024. This move is part of Coinbase’s commitment to adhere to evolving regulatory standards within the European Economic Area (EEA). The Impact of MiCA Regulations on Stablecoins MiCA, which came into effect on June 30, introduces stringent oversight of cryptocurrency companies operating within the EU. One of its key requirements is that all stablecoins available in the EEA must have an e-money license in at least one EU member state. This regulation directly impacts stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, which may face delisting from platforms like Coinbase unless they secure the necessary authorization. Tether has acknowledged the challenges posed by MiCA and is reportedly working on a technology-based solution tailored for the European market. However, until such solutions are implemented, investors may find limited options for trading and investing with USDT on certain platforms. Nordic Arbex: A Reliable Haven for USDT Investors Amid these regulatory shifts, Nordic Arbex remains a steadfast platform for investors looking to capitalize on USDT investments. Unlike some exchanges moving away from USDT, Nordic Arbex continues to support the stablecoin, offering investors up to 4% weekly returns on their USDT holdings. Why Choose Nordic Arbex? High Returns: With the potential to earn up to 4% weekly, investors can significantly grow their portfolios in a short period. Regulatory Compliance: Nordic Arbex operates with a keen understanding of global regulations, ensuring that all activities are compliant and in the best interest of its users. User-Friendly Platform: Designed for both novice and experienced investors, the platform offers intuitive navigation and robust customer support. Security: Employing cutting-edge security measures, Nordic Arbex protects user assets and data, providing peace of mind in a volatile market. The Future of Stablecoins in Europe The introduction of MiCA signifies a maturation of the crypto ecosystem in Europe. By enforcing stricter disclosure requirements, regular audits of crypto firms, and more robust capital reserve mandates, the EU aims to build trust and transparency across the marketplace. While some platforms may face challenges during this transition, others like Nordic Arbex are poised to thrive by aligning with regulatory requirements while still delivering value to their users. Conclusion The impending delisting of USDT by major exchanges such as Coinbase underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the critical importance of regulatory compliance. For investors seeking stability and high returns on their USDT investments, Nordic Arbex offers a compelling solution. By continuing to support USDT and providing attractive returns, Nordic Arbex stands out as a platform committed to its users’ success amidst industry changes. Invest in your future with Nordic Arbex.

While altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) are garnering attention with analysts indicating that prices may rise, there’s another coin entering the fray. 1FUEL’s one-click cross-chain transactions and blistering presale price projections could see it eclipse its rivals in commanding fashion. Simple, secure and user-friendly, 1FUEL’s revolutionary privacy-focused cryptocurrency could well go scorched earth on DOGE and BONK and leave both firmly in the shadows. Will DOGE fade in the face of uncertainty? While DOGE prices have risen in 2024 and did spike 150% in the aftermath of the U.S. election (helped along the way by public support from the self-titled ‘Dogefather’ Elon Musk) the memecoin has struggled to sustain its upward trajectory at times. It’s fair to say that DOGE ’ s ability to rally is still up for debate. Newer altcoins are striving to truly innovate and bring value to the space, while DOGE is heavily reliant on the influence of the controversial Tesla / X boss and now political advisor. Bonk prices remain highly unstable Like DOGE , BONK has struggled to remain consistent, with price rallies followed by dips. Achieving mass adoption and creating sustained, widespread market demand remains elusive, meaning BONK’s gains are likely to be very slow. Despite hype that it could hit $1, DigitalCoinPrice, Wallet Investor, Coincodex and Changeally are all in agreement that it won’t happen anytime soon and a huge leap in value remains very unlikely. 1FUEL has the potential to overshadow both DOGE and BONK 1FUEL is the new privacy-focused cryptocurrency on the block and is already garnering significant attention. Unlike DOGE and BONK which have thus far relied on meme hype and celebrity endorsement to create a buzz, 1FUEL has much more solid underpinnings which set it up for longer term success. Instead of relying on the cult of hype like BONK and DOGE, 1FUEL brings some credentials and innovations to the table. It couples unparalleled automation, with ease of use and robust security measures. It effortlessly handles cross-chain and peer-to-peer transactions with a game changing hassle-free trading style. 1FUEL also works in the background to identify the best exchange rate and minimize fees for users. No other wallet gives users the same degree of freedom and simplicity – but it hasn’t overlooked the importance of privacy and security either. Its privacy mixer, independently verified smart contracts, multi-layered security architecture, disposable wallets and data minimization policy keep assets secure while also safeguarding user privacy. Presale predictions confirm 1FUEL as the next breakout altcoin 1FUEL is focused heavily on making a strong case for user adoption with notably higher levels of utility than both DOGE and BONK. As a result, its presale predictions are staggering, with experts seeing massive growth potential and returns of at least 500%. Those expectations only grow after the presale period with analysts additionally forecasting that 1FUEL will surge by as much as 100x after its public launch. This, coupled with its commitment to removing the technical barriers to trading, mean that it is in line for wider levels of adoption, demand and support than its rivals, setting the stage for it to eclipse DOGE and BONK as the new altcoin on the market. Join the presale The 1FUEL presale is happening right now with early investors set to benefit from crypto staking rewards of 30% APR. Don’t miss your chance to secure 1FUEL tokens at the lowest price before the public launch. Join the presale right now to experience firsthand those projected returns of 500%!

However, the standout among the best crypto to buy now has been the new GambleFi brilliance of Rollblock. Rollblock is making waves in the GambleFi sector, integrating gaming and DeFi with a unique revenue-sharing model. So, sit tight as we explore the best crypto to buy now as another bull run nears. Why Rollblock’s GambleFi revolution makes RBLK the best crypto to buy now The global online gambling industry is worth over $500 billion annually, while DeFi boasts over $118 billion in total value locked. Rollblock sits at the powerful intersection of these two booming sectors. This iGaming ingenuity introduces a revolutionary GambleFi token that combines blockchain innovation with the appeal of online gaming. Unlike many blockchain projects that rely on promises, Rollblock has already delivered. Its Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino is live, offering more than 7,000 gaming titles. At the core of Rollblock’s success is its deflationary tokenomics. With a fixed supply of one billion tokens, RBLK is safeguarded against inflation, making it inherently more valuable over time. Beyond scarcity, RBLK holders can capitalize on lucrative opportunities like staking and a passive income stream that analysts predict is the best crypto to buy now. Over $6.7M raised during its presale and a price surge of 350% demonstrate the market’s confidence in this project. Stellar Lumens gains institutional interest. XLM price eyes further uptick Stellar Lumens has also been making waves as an excellent pick for the best crypto to buy now. The XLM price hasn’t failed to impress. After a 170% surge to a yearly high of $0.55, analysts are already eyeing a retest of its May 2021 ATH of $0.79. Stellar’s ecosystem expansion has also been impressive. Record-breaking DeFi TVL and real-world asset tokenization underpin the XLM price rally. Regulatory clarity in the U.S. and speculation about a spot XLM ETF in 2025 add further momentum. While overbought conditions on the RSI hint at potential corrections, a weekly close above $0.50 could validate a bullish engulfing pattern that could pave the way for more XLM price gains. Polkadot 2.0 and rising stablecoin adoption. Why DOT is another best crypto to buy now Polkadot is also stealing the spotlight as it delivers a double punch of rising stablecoin adoption and the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. Right now, the DOT price is breaking new highs, and it’s now experiencing a massive 132% MoM surge above $9. USDC and USDT adoption has surged, with their combined value exceeding $120 million—a testament to Polkadot’s scalability and low transaction costs. The real buzz surrounding the Polkadot 2.0 upgrade has been deafening, too. Key upgrades like Async Backing, Agile Coretime, and Elastic Scaling have promised to pave the way for a better DeFi on Polkadot. Conclusion The crypto market is heating up. Stellar, Polkadot, and Rollblock are proving themselves to be standout opportunities for savvy investors. However, Rollblock shines brightest among the trio, seamlessly merging the $500 billion online gambling industry with DeFi’s immense potential. So, don’t just watch the market evolve—be part of it. Rollblock is currently in presale and selling for just $0.037. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Analysts are predicting some major price moves after the latest developments in blockchain technology. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to jump into the altcoin market, this is it. Leading the pack is Qubetics ($TICS), a groundbreaking project with real-world utility that’s set to skyrocket after its mainnet launch. Joining it on this list are two crypto heavyweights—Ethereum and Solana. Let’s explore why these three altcoins are must-haves for your portfolio right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Real-World Asset Ownership Qubetics isn’t your average altcoin—it’s a revolution in blockchain. At the heart of Qubetics lies Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT), a game-changing application that allows individuals and businesses to tokenise assets like real estate, art, and even machinery. Picture this: A family inherits a house but needs cash. Instead of selling outright, they tokenise it on Qubetics, letting multiple investors buy fractions. Everyone wins—the family keeps part of the property, and investors get a piece of prime real estate. It’s modern finance, simplified. Right now, Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.0282. Over $4.1 million has already been raised, and excitement is growing as analysts predict a potential surge to $15 after the mainnet launch. To put that into perspective, investing $1,000 today could skyrocket to an incredible $530,000. Opportunities like this don’t come around often—don’t miss your chance! 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Unstoppable Smart Contract Giant Ethereum has been the backbone of blockchain innovation for years, and it’s not slowing down. With its smart contract functionality, Ethereum powers decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and thousands of decentralised apps (dApps). Ethereum’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 has made it faster, cheaper, and more scalable. That’s a win-win for developers and users. Whether you’re minting NFTs or trading on DeFi platforms, Ethereum is the go-to network. As we head into 2025, analysts predict Ethereum’s price could soar past $4,500, making it a solid long-term investment. The upcoming Danksharding upgrade promises even more scalability, ensuring Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto world. 3. Solana (SOL): The Speed Demon of Blockchain Solana is the Usain Bolt of cryptocurrencies. With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, it’s become a favourite for developers and traders alike. Solana’s blockchain can handle 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the game. This speed is why Solana is dominating sectors like gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Imagine a world where gaming rewards are instant, NFT trades are cheap, and DeFi doesn’t feel like pulling teeth. That’s Solana for you. Analysts predict Solana’s price could hit $300 in the next bull run. With its ever-expanding ecosystem, Solana is a must-watch for investors looking for high growth potential. If speed, efficiency, and innovation are your thing, Solana is your coin. Its tech is unmatched, and its ecosystem is booming. Don’t sleep on it. Conclusion: Who is the Star of the Show? While Ethereum and Solana bring innovation and speed, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate game-changer. Its ability to revolutionise real-world asset ownership puts it miles ahead of the competition. With its presale price increasing every weekend, the time to act is now. Secure your stake in the future of blockchain. Opportunities like this don’t come twice—don’t be the one left behind.

Sui (SUI) Sui is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed to support global adoption by offering a secure and scalable development environment. It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in existing blockchain architectures. Sui focuses on improving user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions, making applications more accessible and user-friendly. The platform introduces innovations like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks to enhance Web3 usability. These features contribute to its potential in the blockchain space. Whether Sui’s coin is attractive in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions and individual perspectives. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially deployed as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, TRX tokens moved to their own network in 2018. The platform was created to give full ownership rights to digital content creators, enabling them to receive direct rewards from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. By providing a platform for developers to create dApps and share content openly without significant transaction fees, TRON aims to build a decentralized internet. As an alternative to Ethereum, TRON offers opportunities for content creators and developers. In the current market cycle, TRON’s focus on decentralization and support for dApps may appeal to users seeking alternative blockchain platforms. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance integrates traditional finance with blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This method makes high-grade financial products more accessible, utilizing blockchain to enhance financial infrastructure. Ondo’s structure includes an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products and a technology arm that develops decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, improving the functionality and scalability of its offerings. To address trust and security challenges in the cryptocurrency market, Ondo partners with reputable firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for crypto asset custody. It emphasizes transparency and regulatory compliance. A notable product, USDY, offers stablecoin accessibility with yield, secured by US Treasuries and bank demand deposits. The potential of Ondo’s coin and technology lies in providing non-US investors with regulated and transparent financial products. The attractiveness of the coin in the current market cycle depends on market conditions and individual investment objectives. cat in a dogs world (MEW) MEW is a cryptocurrency that presents itself as a “cat in a dogs world,” setting it apart from the numerous dog-themed coins in the market. It seeks to offer an alternative by introducing unique features and a distinct branding approach. MEW aims to attract users who are looking for variety beyond the typical themes found in other coins. In terms of potential, MEW’s unique positioning might appeal to a niche audience interested in new and different concepts within the cryptocurrency space. Evaluating its attractiveness in the current market cycle involves considering market trends, the coin’s technology, and how it differentiates itself from others. MEW’s success may depend on its ability to offer value and innovation compared to existing options. Conclusion SUI, TRX, ONDO, and MEW are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth with a unique, community-driven blend of memes and sports.

The cryptocurrency is now heading toward its next major price targets. However, in the short term, XRP is experiencing resistance. XRP Breaks Above $2 and Faces Resistance Over the past day, XRP has experienced a significant price increase, surpassing $2. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, once XRP breaks above this level, it tends to make a swift move upwards. The next key level of resistance is $2.50, which XRP has already approached. If XRP can successfully push past $2.50, the next target will likely be $2.75, based on previous price action from January 2018, when XRP experienced key weekly closes in that range. However, at the time of writing, XRP is up by more than 11 percent and is trading at $2.73 levels. $3 Target: Psychological and Fibonacci Resistance Looking further ahead, the next significant price target for XRP is $3. This level represents both a psychological resistance and a key Fibonacci extension point, specifically the 1.618 level. The $3 mark is often viewed as a milestone for many traders, and it is highly likely that XRP will face resistance at this level. However, before reaching $3, XRP needs to break through the resistance zones at $2.50 and $2.75. These are critical levels that could determine whether the cryptocurrency will continue its upward trend or face a potential pullback. Support Levels in Case of Pullback In the event of a pullback, there are two major support levels that traders will be watching closely. The first is at $2, which has already shown some strength as a support level. If XRP were to experience a deeper correction, the next support level would be around $1.60, a level where previous resistance is likely to turn into support.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 03:24:43

ETH is showing bullish signs and might soon aim for a move above the $3,680 resistance zone. Ethereum started a downside correction and retested the $3,550 zone. The price is trading above $3,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could restart its increase if it clears the $3,650 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Upward Move Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,800 resistance zone and corrected some gains like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $3,650 and $3,600 support levels. It even retested the $3,550 support level. A low was formed at $3,557 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $3,600 and $3,620 levels. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,762 swing high to the $3,557 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,650 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,685 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,762 swing high to the $3,557 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,750. A clear move above the $3,750 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $3,920. Another Slide In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,600 level. The first major support sits near the $3,580 zone. A clear move below the $3,580 support might push the price toward the $3,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,440 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,350.

37159666,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656374,1733196607,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-continues-bitcoin-buying-streak-15400-btc-added-this-monday/,"As November concludes and December begins, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has significantly accelerated its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions , slightly surpassing the milestone of 400,000 BTC in its portfolio. This purchase surge comes just over a month after the company announced ambitious plans to raise $21 billion through stock sales to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. $1.5 Billion From Stock Sale Into Bitcoin In the past week alone, MicroStrategy sold 3.7 million MSTR shares , generating approximately $1.5 billion in proceeds, which were promptly reinvested into Bitcoin. This marks the fourth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases by the company. According to Bloomberg data , MicroStrategy has approximately $11.3 billion remaining in stock issuance under its at-the-market share program. This initiative is part of a broader goal to reach $21 billion in funding through fixed-income securities by 2027. The most recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shows that the company acquired 15,400 Bitcoin from November 25 to December 1, at an average price of about $95,976 per token. Since November 11, the company has invested over $13.5 billion in BTC in three batches, bringing its total holdings to approximately $38 billion, or 402,100 BTC as of today, at an average purchase price of $56,658 per coin. Crypto Mining Firms Shift Strategies MicroStrategy’s aggressive purchasing strategy has attracted attention from other companies looking to replicate its success. For instance, MARA Holdings , a cryptocurrency mining company, announced on Monday that it had acquired $618 million worth of Bitcoin over the past two months. The company is also pursuing a $700 million convertible senior note offering, with plans to allocate some of the net proceeds towards further Bitcoin purchases. This trend is notable, particularly as crypto mining stocks have struggled this year, especially after the Halving of Bitcoin rewards in April. This event has prompted miners like MARA to adopt a treasury strategy focused on accumulating Bitcoin rather than selling it. Despite experiencing a 44% drop earlier this year, MARA’s shares have rebounded and are currently up 8% year-to-date. Similarly, Riot Platforms, another mining company , has announced plans to temporarily halt the sale of mined BTC in order to increase its holdings after seeing its share value drop 20% this year, following a significant 59% drop in September. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $95,180, down 1.6% in the 24-hour time frame. This has been a continuous pattern over the past 10 days, as the BTC price has been consolidating between $91,000 and $98,000, failing to retest its record high of $99,540 and the evasive $100,000 milestone.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 04:02:00
37160457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621705,1733198566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37160457.jpeg,OpenAI may be open to using advertising to raise revenue from its ChatGPT,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-open-to-advertising-revenue/,"OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT, is reportedly playing around with the potential of introducing advertising as a new revenue stream for its AI tool. If it went forward with this plan, it would be a complete reversal from its initial premise for one of the world’s most valuable AI companies. OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, confirmed that the company is open to exploring advertisement as a way to increase revenue in a recent interview with the Financial Times. According to her, OpenAI does not have any immediate plans to implement ads. She also added that the company is still committed to being “considerate” about when and where ads might appear. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October as the Microsoft-backed AI firm’s value went above $150 billion. The company has also found success with its popular ChatGPT. The AI chatbot reportedly has over 250 million active weekly users. Still, the company faces questions about profitability, which has brought on significant financial pressures for many other AI firms. Operating and scaling advanced AI models is expensive, with projected costs for 2024 expected to exceed $5 billion. This year, OpenAI has hired advertising specialists from major tech players like Meta and Google. Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s Chief Product Officer, has extensive experience in ad-supported platforms, having helped develop Instagram’s advertising model. Similarly, Shivakumar Venkataraman, a former leader of Google’s search advertising team, joined the firm earlier this year. OpenAI is exploring its options with advertisement plan For a long time, tech giants like Google and Meta have made money through advertising. However, OpenAI executives are still unsure how to add ads without hurting the user experience. CEO Sam Altman is said to be warming up to the idea, but Friar has pointed out that ad models can bring problems like economic sensitivity and a possible shift in focus from users to advertisers. OpenAI currently makes most of its money from enterprise licensing, paid ChatGPT tiers, and its API, which developers use to create apps based on OpenAI’s models. These revenue sources have been good for substantial amounts, but they may still not be sufficient to offset the company’s huge operational expenditures in the long term. If it eventually decides to move forward with its plan, the company risks upsetting a user base that appreciates ChatGPT’s no ad experience and simple design. It could offer insights into why the company is adding advertising stalwarts to its roster as it carefully balances profitability with innovation. What the future holds for AI With its success, OpenAI is certainly one of the trendsetters in the AI space. While Friar assured users that the company does not have any imminent plans to introduce ads, the suggestion was enough to let speculation linger. The move toward ads could put the company in competition with smaller AI companies like Perplexity , which is already testing ads in its products. If OpenAI eventually goes the ads route, it could radically change the revenue generation template for AI firms. If implemented, the ads may take innovative forms, such as AI-powered personalized suggestions, rather than traditional banner ads seen on legacy platforms. Still, the move won’t be straightforward. Targeted ads often rely on user data, which is a touchy subject for AI users and data privacy regulators, especially in Europe. OpenAI would have to address these worries if it moves forward with this model. If Friar is to be taken by her words, advertising for now remains an idea, not a commitment. However, hiring ad experts like Shivakumar Venkataraman and Kevin Weil may hint at the company giving it a considerable level of thought.

Data from Santiment reveals Ripple’s ( XRP ) active wallet addresses shot up over 116,000, helping XRP’s price rally by over 15% in 24 hours. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency’s market cap hit $155.69 billion, a record high on December 3. The trading volume of the token is up by 93.29% in 24 hours.

The daily profit-to-loss ratio recently hovered around 0.374, meaning more investors are selling than buying the token. A low number for daily profit-to-loss during a rally indicates hesitation for traders to enter into long positions.

Yet, that’s exactly what happened in Turkey. Coinbase, which had big plans for the country just three months ago, suddenly called it quits. So, what went wrong? The answer lies in Turkey’s increasingly tough stance on crypto regulation, and Coinbase isn’t the only one feeling the heat. Turkey’s New Crypto Rules Are Shaking Things Up Turkey’s regulators recently tightened the rules for cryptocurrency firms, making life a lot harder for companies like Coinbase. The country’s Capital Markets Board listed Coinbase as one of 14 companies liquidating their operations. At the same time, some big names like Binance and KuCoin are still pushing through the process, though they’ve had to scale back. To comply, Binance and KuCoin removed Turkish language support and cut marketing to local users. That’s a pretty big deal when you think about it. Imagine running a global business but having to pull back in one of your key regions. It seems like the exchange decided it just wasn’t worth the hassle. Coinbase Has Other Problems to Tackle This isn’t the only challenge the exchange is dealing with right now. Over in Europe, they stopped offering USDC yield programs, blaming new EU regulations. On top of that, Coinbase plans to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) by December 19, 2024. That decision surprised a lot of people, considering their other token, cbBTC, is doing great in the DeFi world with a $1.44 billion market cap. Back in the U.S., Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is focusing on policy. He’s reportedly been chatting with politicians about appointing crypto-friendly leaders, including suggesting Hester Peirce as a replacement for SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Whether that will change anything is anyone’s guess, but it shows the exchange is playing the long game. What’s Next for Coinbase? Here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s rally is bringing retail investors back in droves. In November, Coinbase’s app ranking jumped to ninth place globally. That’s a big win for the exchange, even as they face regulatory challenges. For Coinbase, leaving Turkey might be more about focusing on easier markets. But will this strategy help them stay on top? Or will these constant hurdles take a toll?

Despite underperforming compared to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for most of 2024, Ethereum’s strong fundamentals may set the stage for a potential rally. Why Is Ethereum Struggling? Bernstein Analysts Explain Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap exceeding $430 billion, may be on the verge of significant positive price action. Bernstein analysts suggest that ETH’s fundamentals remain strong despite its underperformance , making it an appealing investment opportunity. To put Ethereum’s performance into perspective, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin and Solana have surged 125% and 122%, respectively, while ETH has only managed a 57% increase. In a client note shared today, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani highlighted several factors contributing to Ethereum’s struggles. One issue is that ETH has not established itself as a store of value to the same extent as BTC. Additionally, the leading smart contract platform faces increasing competition from low-latency Layer 1 blockchains such as Solana, Sui, and Aptos. The note also pointed out that Ethereum’s reliance on Layer 2 blockchains, including Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, often redirects users away from Ethereum’s main chain. This hampers user retention and limits transaction fee growth, creating a headwind for ETH’s price momentum. Is Now The Right Time To Buy ETH? Bernstein analysts argue that Ethereum’s outlook could improve substantially, particularly in light of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Following Trump’s win, the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged over 45%, surpassing $3.5 trillion. Ethereum has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this rally, gaining 46% since the election compared to Bitcoin’s 41% and Solana’s 36%. The analysts also noted key developments that could support Ethereum’s growth moving forward. They highlighted the increasing likelihood of staking yield approval in Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under a Trump-led, crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The analysts explained: We believe, under a new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly SEC, ETH staking yield will likely be approved. The analysts added that Ethereum’s current yield rate of 3% could increase to as high as 4% to 5%, which could be an attractive yield rate for investors in a declining interest rate environment. Further, the recently observed growth in Ethereum ETFs in the form of higher inflows could benefit ETH. Although ETH ETFs had a lukewarm launch, they have recently outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. For instance, on November 29, spot ETH ETFs in the US attracted $332.9 million in inflows, compared to $320 million for Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm in September 2023 and the protocol’s burn mechanism have stabilized ETH’s total supply around 120 million.

He has also taken a firm stand on law firms that hire individuals from the outgoing administration of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who were responsible for maintaining an unclear stand on crypto regulations. Coinbase CEO Lashes Out At Law Firms Hiring Ex-SEC Officials Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has released a public statement on the X platform while taking a firm stand against law firms hiring anti-crypto individuals. Brian Armstrong stated that the crypto exchange has informed that they would immediately terminate any professional relations with legal partners hiring such individuals. In the latest development, Milbank LLP has recently hired the SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal who had previously undertaken huge enforcement actions against the crypto industry. Armstrong criticized the firm for hiring former SEC official Gurbir Grewal, leading Coinbase to cease its association with the firm. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules,” he said. He further stressed that senior officials who were involved in shaping unclear regulatory policies should not claim they were merely “following orders”. Instead, Armstrong pointed out that several SEC members chose to leave during this period, reflecting their disagreement with the agency’s direction. However, he added that he doesn’t believe in permanently canceling people from employment. At the same time, he urged the crypto industry to avoid financially supporting firms that hire them. “Let your law firms know that hiring these folks means losing you as a client,” he wrote. Brian Armstrong Looking Ahead to Pro-Crypto Legislation On the other hand, Armstrong and his team have been looking forward to pro-crypto legislation in the US under President-elect Donald Trump. He and his team are confident that the regulatory landscape will improve ahead building a conducive environment for driving crypto innovation. Two key crypto bills are set to reach US Congress soon. The Republican-backed FIT 21 Crypto Bill , passed by the House earlier this year, aims to establish a legal framework for digital assets. The second, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, seeks to regulate and license stablecoin issuers, and is awaiting approval in a House vote. Moreover, crypto exchange Coinbase has continued to support new digital assets, the latest being the Solana-based MOODENG , leading to a massive 94% surge in its price. This rally has pushed the meme coin’s market cap above $600 million while the daily trading volume has surged by 700% to more than $1.1 billion.

This regulatory progression has intensified market speculation about the stablecoin’s potential mechanisms and strategic positioning within the cryptocurrency landscape. Market analysts and community commentators have proposed intriguing scenarios regarding the potential backing and deployment of RLUSD. Some prominent voices in the XRP community have suggested a novel approach involving Ripple’s substantial XRP escrow holdings as a financial instrument for the stablecoin’s initial reserve strategy. According to market commentator Del Crypto, one speculative scenario involves Ripple using its XRP escrow to establish initial reserves. 911 Alert: $XRP Rumors are swirling thru the cryptosphere that @Ripple might custody its entire $XRP escrow and use it to establish the initial reserve for $RLUSD . If true, this move would enable @Ripple to mint $RLUSD , sell it to ODL partners, and unlock substantial working… — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) December 2, 2024 Vincent Van Code, another prominent community figure, weighed in on this hypothetical strategy, noting that it could enable Ripple to mint RLUSD and distribute it to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners while generating substantial working capital for the company. Potential Ecosystem Implications The proposed strategy could potentially generate significant advantages for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Theoretically, the approach might introduce enhanced liquidity, manage XRP’s circulating supply, and create additional economic dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. The speculation has coincided with a notable price surge for XRP, which recently hit a peak of $2.8487, and is trading at $2.71, with a 40.05% increase over the past 24 hours. This price movement has pushed XRP to heights not seen since 2018, and positioned it as the third-largest cryptocurrency, surpassing competitors like Solana, BNB, and USDT. Van Code believes this strategy could help XRP climb, potentially reaching $1,000. Other experts have recently expressed confidence in this target, but there are some crucial considerations to this rumored strategy. Regulatory Considerations for this Approach Ripple initially promised a different approach to how RLUSD would be backed. Regulators may not like this approach proposed by Del Crypto. The company’s announcement explicitly stated that RLUSD would be backed exclusively by USD deposits, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and cash equivalents. This official stance contrasts with the more speculative community discussions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent XRP community member WrathofKahneman urged caution regarding unverified rumors, emphasizing the potential regulatory challenges of using XRP or any cryptocurrency as collateral for RLUSD. One community member noted that regulatory bodies traditionally prefer established, low-volatility assets for stablecoin reserves. This could potentially complicate the rumored backing strategies. Instead, he proposed a unique approach, suggesting potential frameworks, where traditional cash-backed tokenization could coexist with cryptocurrency-adjacent reserve mechanisms. Considering that regulatory approval is the only roadblock left for RLUSD’s launch, Ripple must navigate these complex backing issues to get the stablecoin through regulators.

However, analysts are still bullish on the token, seeing it as a buying opportunity. At the same time, Stellar and a new altcoin, Cutoshi , have seen huge growth. Solana Dip Provides Great Entry Point Solana (SOL) has been one of the top performers this cycle. However, a recent correction shook up the token, leading to a drop in its rankings. Solana is down 10% in the last seven days, from $253 to $227. The big news this week was that Ripple (XRP) surpassed Solana in market cap. After XRP reached $2, it overtook both Solana and Tether (USDT), reaching the third spot among all crypto assets. This came as a shock to Solana traders, as SOL struggled to overtake Tether. Source: Barchart Despite this setback, analysts are bullish on Solana. For instance, Rekt Capital suggests that Solana could reach $300 by 2025 if it confirms support at $250. With a relative strength index (RSI) at a comfortable 51, Solana is in a strong position to grow. However, other indicators are mixed, with an overall neutral outlook . Stellar Sees Huge Gains Stellar (XRM) has seen huge growth in recent weeks, being one of the best performers in that period. The token saw a 478.36% increase in the last 30 days, on news that institutions are looking into Stellar. The catalyst for the growth was, besides the crypto market rally, a recent filing by Grayscale Investments. The filing revealed that the company’s XLM trust recorded a 10% increase in net assets during the financial year. This indicates strong institutional interest in Stellar. Source: CMC The reaction to the news was strong, with traders bidding up the token to new highs. Jed McCaleb, a founder of Stellar, shared why he thinks the growth came. He pointed out that Stellar does 10x daily transactions compared to Ethereum and called it one of the most underrated projects so far. A lot of new people looking at Stellar so I thought I'd write down some quick thoughts about why Stellar is worth your time. IMHO Stellar is the most underrated and least understood crypto project. A lot of recent attention but people are still sleeping on this network. Stellar… — Jed McCaleb (@JedMcCaleb) November 23, 2024 Still, this huge growth can’t last forever and analysts now believe that Stellar will go into a retracement period . However, if it breaks the resistance at $0.60, the token could test $0.70 soon. On the other hand, if it falls below $0.40 support, it will likely decline to $0.28 or $0.22. Cutoshi Showcases Interest In DeFi Stellar’s huge growth indicates that investors are looking into projects with strong DeFi utility. The recent interest in the memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) boosts this case. In under a month since its launch, the token raised more than a million in investments. By December 2nd, Cutoshi’s presale investments reached $1.221 million, showcasing the interest in DeFi projects. Notably, while Cutoshi has a cat mascot, it focuses on building a DeFi ecosystem run by its users. The project is building a multichain DEX, with the goal of breaking down barriers to trading. The blend of memes and DeFi aims to make DeFi accessible to more investors than ever. As the crypto market is in a bullish phase, this is an ideal time for traders to start using decentralized platforms like Cutoshi and keep custody over their coins. Stage 4 of the CUTO presale is now live with tokens available for $0.031. The Cyber Monday 20% Bonus is also live for 48 hours.

But what if there is an even bigger opportunity for profits? Now fast attracting interest in the presale stage is Lunex Network (LNEX) , a game-changing decentralized exchange (DEX). Lunex Network is positioned to provide investors not only a chance at strong returns but also a much better DeFi experience as it enhances asset management by smoothly merging cryptocurrencies, equities, bonds, and more. For investors trying to optimize their gains in the coming months, these three players Polygon (POL), VeChain (VET), and Lunex Network could be the next 100x opportunity. Lunex Network (LNEX): The Future of Asset Management Presenting itself as a complete platform simplifying asset administration and transactions, Lunex Network is revolutionizing the DEX sector. Lunex Network aggregates several assets—cryptocurrencies, equities, bonds, ETFs, and more—into one seamless interface, unlike traditional DEXs. By letting investors monitor and manage their whole portfolio from one point of contact, this creative solution simplifies asset management. Focusing on security, efficiency, and simplicity, Lunex Network gives investors the tools they need to focus on optimizing their earnings. With the LNEX token priced at just $0.0033 during its ongoing presale, Lunex Network offers investors an amazing prospect right now. Early adopters who bought LNEX at the initial $0.0012 price have already witnessed an amazing 210% return on investment, therefore demonstrating the platform’s capacity for notable expansion. Now is the ideal time to join the Lunex Network presale and seize this chance for significant rewards given the expected launch price of $0.0216. Moreover, investors are quickly grabbing their slots as more than 2.0 billion tokens have been sold in weeks and over $3.8 million has been raised in presale revenue. Polygon (POL) on the Rise: Can It Reclaim Its All-Time High? Recently, the Polygon price has seen a notable increase— more than 28% in only the past week. The Polygon price suffered negative pressure once it hit the $0.61 mark, which caused a retreat toward the $0.50 support level. But now that the bullish trend is starting to pick up, the Polygon price chart shows that the altcoin is heading into the $0.61 resistance zone. Polygon (POL) has shown a remarkable positive trend during the past month, increasing its price by 70%. This comeback has inspired traders and investors with hope for a possible near-term continuation of increasing momentum. Though trading almost 50% below its ATH of $1.29, attained in March of this year, analysts still see Polygon’s (POL) bright future. They propose that the altcoin might go back to its ATH by the end of 2024 with continuous optimistic momentum. Under this perspective, technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages show positive signals on the Polygon price chart, therefore signifying a robust upward trend. VeChain’s (VET) Bullish Surge: Is a Return to ATH in Sight? With the VeChain price rising by around 30% in the previous week alone, the altcoin has been showing an amazing upward trend that excites investors expecting further gains. The altcoin has seen notable opposition, nevertheless, as the VeChain price moves toward the $0.045 threshold, therefore testing its capacity to keep momentum . VeChain (VET) has seen a notable surge over the past month, exceeding 83%, despite this resistance at $0.045. Though the VeChain price chart shows that the altcoin is still more than 80% below its all-time high (ATH) of $0.278, attained in 2021, this consistent gain has spurred hope in the prospects of VeChain (VET). With the community demonstrating great support for the future of the altcoin, investor sentiment toward VeChain (VET) remains generally positive. Positive momentum shown by technical indicators such as the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages on the VeChain price chart also supports ongoing optimism.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 05:25:00

Hedera Hashgraph, its chain, is considered an alternative to the traditional blockchains that aim to excel in speed, efficiency, and security. With this, the HBAR gains centre stage and remains the top altcoin according to Lunar Crush with the top market and social activity. Now that the HBAR price has erased 1000+ days of downtrend in just four weeks, where will the price find its peak in the ongoing bull run? The sluggish and weak performance of HBAR has irked the market participants, who often complained of poor participation on the governing council. Now that the price has undergone a 7x rally, a new ATH appears to be imminent. But the question arises whether the price rally will remain restricted at $1 or will continue beyond the range, finding new highs in 2025. The long-term price action of HBAR suggests the rally has gained huge momentum and is about to enter the bullish range. The price is about to enter the final resistance zone below the ATH at $0.5701 and also the 0.618 FIB. A rise from these levels does not only help the price form a new ATH but surpass the trend line and enter the bullish range. Besides, the OBV just rose from a prolonged, multi-year stagnant trend with a massive rise in volume. This suggests the price has just begun with the bull run, activating the higher price targets. The next levels to look out above the ATH could be around 1.2 FIB at $0.715 and later at 1.6 FIB at $0.910. These are the important levels to achieve, which may further push the price beyond $1. Meanwhile, the monthly RSI has entered the overbought range and marked the 2021 highs, suggesting a small pullback could sweep out the selling pressure if any. In such cases, 0.5 FIB, the current resistance level between $0.38 and $0.455, may act as a strong support zone, which may further trigger a healthy rebound. Therefore, the Hedera (HBAR) price rally appears to be primed to mark $1, probably in the early few weeks of 2025 and if the market sentiments remain bullish, an extended rally may assist the price to peak at $1.2 to $1.5.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 05:25:49

Projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started as jokes but quickly became serious contenders, proving the meme coin revolution is no laughing matter. Recently, Fartcoin and Turbo have joined the hype, and analysts are predicting big things for these quirky coins. But that’s not all. A new player has entered the game: BTFD Coin , a meme coin ready to set the market on fire with its innovative perks and lightning-fast growth. Let’s break it all down and see why BTFD Coin is the hottest thing in crypto right now. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is stealing the show in the meme coin universe. Since its presale launch on November 26, 2024, it’s made massive waves. With a presale starting at $0.000004 per coin and a listing price of $0.0006, BTFD Coin promises juicy returns. Currently, in Stage 6, the presale price is $0.000058, with over $500,000 raised in the first week and 15 billion coins sold. Why’s everyone jumping in? Three words: Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and an unrivalled community vibe. These features make BTFD Coin more than just a meme coin; it’s a serious investment opportunity. Analysts predict that as the presale journey progresses through its 16 stages, the price will surge further. If you’re still not convinced, here’s a quick math teaser. Suppose you invest $4,000 at Stage 6 at the price of $0.000058 per coin. You’ll snag 69,048,060 BTFD Coins. Once listed at $0.0006, those coins would be worth $41,428.83. That’s a return you don’t want to miss. Fartcoin: From Farts to Fortune? With a name like Fartcoin, you’d think it’s all a joke, but it’s far from that. Fartcoin has quietly been building a dedicated fanbase, thanks to its focus on transparency and community engagement. Trading at $0.000000001471, it’s got a long way to go to compete with the big boys, but its low entry price makes it tempting for those who love high-risk, high-reward plays. While Fartcoin isn’t breaking records like BTFD Coin, it’s carving out a niche with its quirky marketing and active social media buzz. That said, without features like staking or gaming incentives, it feels more like a hit-or-miss bet. Could it blow up? Maybe. But if you’re looking for a safer meme coin with strong ROI potential, BTFD Coin’s presale might be a better shot. Turbo: Speeding Through the Crypto Scene Turbo is the rebel of the meme coin gang. Unlike traditional meme coins, Turbo positions itself as a utility token with actual use cases in decentralised finance. This hybrid identity has made Turbo popular among investors who love memes but also want something tangible. According to a recent article on TechPoint Africa, Turbo’s ecosystem is designed for long-term growth. With solid backing and an active dev team, Turbo is more than just hype. However, it doesn’t have the instant thrill of a low-price entry like BTFD Coin, nor does it offer the same explosive presale momentum. Turbo is a great choice for those who like to play it cool, but if you’re here for the adrenaline, BTFD Coin takes the crown. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out The crypto market is crowded with meme coins, but BTFD Coin is doing things differently. With its unique blend of gaming, staking, and a powerful community, it’s redefining what a meme coin can be. In just over a week, it’s raised more than $500,000 and hit Stage 6 of its presale, selling over 15 billion coins. The buzz around BTFD Coin isn’t just hype. It’s backed by solid growth metrics, an innovative roadmap, and a community that’s in it to win it. If you’re looking for Top Trending Meme Coins This Month, BTFD Coin is the one you can’t afford to miss. Conclusion BTFD Coin is the standout winner among these meme coins. It’s got the growth, the features, and the FOMO factor to make it a top pick. Don’t let this presale slip through your fingers—join the BTFD Coin presale now and ride the wave to potential profits.

Shiba Inu’s price rallied last week but is now entering a short-term consolidation phase with an 8.74% intraday decline. Meanwhile, analysts are shifting their attention towards low-cap altcoins like Lunex Network (LNEX) amidst the ongoing altseason hype. Since Lunex Network is already poised for 1,800% gains within the next few months, traders are currently rushing to purchase LNEX tokens before the price rallies any further. Dogecoin (DOGE) Prepares to Retest $1 Resistance by Early 2025 Dogecoin’s long accounts have reached the 92 nd percentile over the last 3 months. Dogecoin’s price has also experienced its highest monthly close which is making analysts optimistic about Dogecoin surpassing the $1 milestone. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.4197 after an intraday crash worth 1.36%. Dogecoin’s RSI and Stochastic RSI are currently in the neutral zone which typically indicates that momentum is gearing up for the next rally. Dogecoin’s volume has also surged by 136.59% over the last 24 hours which suggests high buying pressure. If Dogecoin bulls can push the price towards the nearest resistance at $0.68696, Dogecoin is likely to test the $1 level by early 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Consolidates After Last Week’s Rally Shiba Inu recently reached a new peak at $0.00003 which was its highest level since April. This uptrend was fueled by Shiba Inu’s massive token burn strategy which surged past 7,400% over the last few months. Even whales have shown increased interest in Shiba Inu by accumulating $9.8 million worth of SHIB tokens in a span of two weeks. Alongside this increased investor confidence, Shiba Inu’s Shibarium network has also recorded 541 million transactions in record time. Despite this positive momentum, Shiba Inu’s price has entered a consolidation phase today with a 8.83% decline over the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu is currently trading for $0.0000292 with a minor 5.94% decline in its trading volume. Lunex Network (LNEX) Outshines Memecoin Market with 175% Price Jump Aside from these meme coins, another token that is gaining traction in the crypto DeFi space is Lunex Network (LNEX). By integrating the most attractive features of decentralized and centralized exchanges on a single network, Lunex Network is making it easier for traders to execute cross chain transfers. With the crypto market expected to grow exponentially in 2025, analysts are expecting Lunex Network’s price to skyrocket towards the $1 milestone in early January. The key driver behind Lunex Network’s rapid adoption is the platform’s strategy to integrate the latest Web3 technology on its noncustodial ecosystem. Since Lunex Network has strategically combined features of decentralized and centralized trading, the platform allows traders to make cross chain transfers without having to connect any third party wallets like MetaMask or PhantomWallet. Aside from making trading easier, Lunex Network is also giving investors a consistent source of passive income through its revenue sharing model. Every week, Lunex Network reinvests up to 18% of its exchange revenue into open market buybacks of the LNEX token that are all distributed as staking rewards. Since traders can start earning these rewards in as little as 30 days, both retail and institutional investors are flocking to Lunex Network to purchase tokens before the price skyrockets. Lunex Network’s price has already jumped by 175% from its initial price of $0.0012. Since LNEX tokens are still available for a low price of just $0.0033 each, now is the best time to invest in Lunex Network before the highly anticipated 20x rally before the end of Q4.

However, while the websites are blocked, their apps still work, leaving many questioning how effective this move is. Why the Crackdown? The Cambodian government is under pressure to address its reputation as a hotspot for cybercrime and crypto-related scams. Reports from the UN Office on Drugs & Crime revealed that criminal groups in Cambodia exploit cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering and dark web transactions Adding to this, a Chainalysis report highlighted over $49 billion in crypto transactions tied to Huione Guarantee, a key player within the Cambodian conglomerate Huione Group. Cambodia Gov Targeting Unlicensed Platforms The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) issued a directive on November 20, blocking 102 websites. While many targeted platforms were linked to online gambling, the inclusion of Binance and other major crypto platforms surprised many. The TRC explained that these platforms didn’t have proper licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator (SERC). Binance has partnerships in the country, including a 2022 agreement with SERC to assist in developing crypto regulations. Binance also provided training on crypto-related crime detection to Interior Ministry officials in mid-2023. Despite these actions, Cambodia’s relationship with Binance makes the situation more confusing. Limited Licensed Options Currently, only two companies are authorized to operate digital asset businesses under Cambodia’s “FinTech Regulatory Sandbox” program. Even these licensed companies can’t convert digital assets into local or foreign currencies, limiting their use. Crypto Demand Remains Strong Despite the crackdown, Cambodia remains a significant player in the global crypto landscape. It ranks among the top 20 countries for retail crypto usage per capita, with centralized exchanges handling 70% of transactions. Broad-based restrictions often fail where organic demand and practical applications exist,” noted Chengyi Ong, Chainalysis’s head of Asia-Pacific policy. This sentiment suggests that Cambodia’s crypto market may adapt and continue to thrive, even under tighter regulations.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 05:33:29

Following an astonishing return of 297% in November 2024, XRP has skyrocketed to its highest levels since 2017, igniting a wave of optimism among analysts who are now setting ambitious price targets for the altcoin. This surge in value is not just a fleeting moment; it suggests a broader trend of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency space. In addition, WisdomTree has recently joined the expanding roster of asset managers that are filing for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move is in response to the increasing demand for regulated investment products that are directly tied to XRP, indicating a shift in how institutional investors are approaching the cryptocurrency market. As interest continues to build, the landscape for XRP and similar assets is evolving rapidly, promising exciting opportunities ahead. XRP Soars in November, Achieving Record-Breaking Gains Since 2017 XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, has been the talk of the town in November 2024, registering a monumental 297% monthly return on investment (ROI), its highest since December 2017. The token's November close at $1.95 not only marks a seven-year high but also a decisive breakout above its 2021 peak, solidifying its bullish trajectory. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has surged an additional 14%, further fueling market speculation. Analysts now believe this altcoin has the potential to reach unprecedented levels. Jacob Canfield, an independent crypto trader, has set an ambitious target of $6.60 for XRP, citing Fibonacci extensions and historical performance relative to Bitcoin during previous market peaks. Highlighting Bitcoin’s current value—approximately five times its 2017 price when XRP reached its previous all-time high of $3.40—Canfield explained: “This would put the price around $6.60, exactly 2X the value of its previous high. I think this is probably the ideal FOMO target and would stop thinking double digits or higher and is very logical.” Similarly, Tony Edward, founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, has placed XRP’s potential target between $5 and $8, while recommending a more conservative profit-taking strategy. Neel, a crypto educator, pointed out that XRP's rally is a signal of increasing retail investor participation, driven by heightened media attention and its appeal to mainstream audiences. On-Chain Data Reveals Whale and Retail Accumulation XRP’s price surge has been mirrored by robust on-chain activity. Data from analytics platform Santiment reveals that XRP wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens have accumulated 679.1 million XRP—valued at $1.6 billion—over the past three weeks. Additionally, the number of non-empty XRP wallets has surpassed 5.5 million for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s eight-year history. This surge in wallet activity suggests a growing interest among both retail investors and whales, further supporting the bullish momentum. XRP’s futures market has also seen remarkable growth, with open interest (OI) reaching a new all-time high of $3.99 billion as of Dec. 2, 2024. This represents a staggering 100% increase from Nov. 28, when OI stood at $2.06 billion. The combination of rising spot accumulation, increased futures activity, and surging trading volumes paints a clear picture of the renewed interest in XRP among traders and investors alike. Ripple's ongoing legal victories and institutional partnerships have contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding XRP. With little resistance remaining on higher time frames, market experts predict a continued upward trend, particularly if XRP can maintain a close above $1.99 by the year’s end. Such a close would mark its highest yearly finish in history, further solidifying its bullish narrative. As XRP’s price and on-chain metrics continue to break records, the altcoin finds itself at a pivotal moment. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its trajectory, citing strong fundamentals, increasing adoption, and growing market momentum. Whether XRP can achieve the ambitious targets set by experts like Jacob Canfield and Tony Edward remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: XRP is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, captivating investors and traders worldwide. WisdomTree Files for a Spot XRP ETF, Joining Growing Industry Movement Meanwhile, WisdomTree, a prominent asset manager and one of the first companies to issue a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States earlier this year, has taken another major step in the cryptocurrency space. On Dec. 2, WisdomTree filed a Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot ETF backed by XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency. This move positions WisdomTree as the fourth company in the United States to file for a spot XRP ETF, reflecting a burgeoning interest in XRP-based investment products. The proposed fund, named the WisdomTree XRP Fund, is designed to give investors exposure to XRP’s price performance. Shares of the fund are expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. According to the filing, the fund will create and redeem shares using a cash-create method or in exchange for cash. WisdomTree may explore an in-kind model, which could allow for more efficient share transactions, pending additional approvals from regulatory authorities. In its filing, WisdomTree revealed that affiliates of Coinbase Global, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, will play a pivotal role in the fund's operations. Coinbase will serve as both the XRP custodian and the fund’s prime execution agent, ensuring seamless management of XRP transactions. The filing emphasized Coinbase's critical role in the US spot XRP exchange-traded product ecosystem. WisdomTree has a history of relying on Coinbase for cryptocurrency custody and execution, including its WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), which debuted alongside other Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, 2024. WisdomTree’s filing adds to the growing competition among asset managers vying to launch the first spot XRP ETF in the United States. Three other firms—Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares—have already submitted their own filings with the SEC. Bitwise: Bitwise was the first to file for a spot XRP ETF, submitting its Form S-1 on Oct. 2. The company is no stranger to the ETF market, having debuted its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) earlier this year. Canary Capital: Following Bitwise’s lead, Canary Capital filed for the Canary XRP ETF on Oct. 9. The firm has positioned itself as an emerging player in the cryptocurrency investment space. 21Shares: In partnership with ARK Invest, 21Shares filed its Form S-1 for the Core XRP Trust on Nov. 1. Unlike the other ETFs, this trust does not provide direct exposure to XRP but offers investors an opportunity to access the market indirectly. The flurry of XRP ETF filings comes at a pivotal time for Ripple and XRP. XRP recently reclaimed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, buoyed by its legal victory against the SEC and a series of bullish market developments. The interest in spot XRP ETFs indicates a growing demand for institutional-grade investment products tied to cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Analysts believe that a successful launch of a spot XRP ETF could further solidify XRP’s position in the market and attract a broader base of investors. Regulatory Hurdles Remain While the interest in spot XRP ETFs is mounting, the approval process remains uncertain. The SEC has historically been cautious with cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and custody solutions. However, the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year suggests a shift in the SEC’s stance, raising optimism for XRP-focused products. If approved, WisdomTree’s XRP ETF and similar offerings could serve as a significant catalyst for XRP adoption. By providing investors with a regulated and accessible way to invest in XRP, these funds have the potential to drive liquidity, increase market participation, and bolster confidence in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. WisdomTree’s filing for a spot XRP ETF sheds some light on the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. With several firms now competing for SEC approval, the race to launch the first US spot XRP ETF is heating up. As regulatory developments unfold, the launch of such a product could mark another milestone for both XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Investors and industry observers will undoubtedly be watching closely as the SEC evaluates these groundbreaking proposals.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 05:34:01

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw $6.4 billion in November inflows, driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Marathon Digital invested $600 million in Bitcoin between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30, while MicroStrategy further solidified its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with a 15,400 BTC purchase last week. Silk Road Bitcoin Moved to Coinbase Prime Wallet The United States government moved approximately $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) that was seized from the Silk Road marketplace to a Coinbase Prime wallet, according to blockchain records and data from Arkham Intelligence . On Dec. 2, a wallet linked to the U.S. government transferred around 19,800 Bitcoin, valued at close to $1.9 billion at the time, to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. This Bitcoin was originally seized during a 2021 investigation into James Zhong, who was later convicted of wire fraud connected to the Silk Road. US Government transferring Bitcoin to Coinbase wallet (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) The Department of Justice announced in 2022 that more than 50,000 Bitcoin were confiscated from Zhong, including some that was stored on a single-board computer hidden under blankets in a popcorn tin. While the authorities have moved many of these coins across wallets, the U.S. government still holds about $18 billion worth of Bitcoin. It remains unclear whether this recent transfer is part of a broader strategy to sell or trade the funds. Discussions among lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Donald Trump, have raised the idea of establishing a ”strategic Bitcoin reserve” for the United States. The U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the seizure of cryptocurrencies and other criminal assets, announced a partnership with Coinbase Prime in July for the custody of such tokens. This happened despite Coinbase facing a civil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June of 2023. The Silk Road marketplace was once a hub for illicit transactions involving weapons, drugs, and stolen credit card information, and was dismantled after the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015, and has since received a lot of support from the crypto community for a commutation of his sentence. President-elect Donald Trump also pledged to commute Ulbricht’s sentence on the first day of his second term. Bitcoin ETFs See $6.4 Billion Inflows in November In November, United States investors channeled close to $6.4 billion into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). During this month, Bitcoin’s market price also surged by 45% to reach new highs. The month-long rally saw Bitcoin prices climb from $68,000 to $99,000, thanks to very strong bullish sentiment. Spot BTC ETFs collectively attracted $6.87 billion in investments , offset by outflows that totaled $411 million. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dominated the inflows by securing $5.6 billion and accounting for almost 87% of the monthly total. Other major contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with $962 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF with $211.5 million, and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF with $71.2 million. These figures proved just how much investor confidence in Bitcoin’s price trajectory is growing. Outflows were primarily driven by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, which saw $364 million withdrawn, followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF with $40.4 million and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund with $6.8 million. Despite these outflows, the market maintained its strong optimism. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index also hit a yearly high of 92 on Nov. 22. While the index dipped slightly in December, it still reflects overwhelmingly positive investor confidence. Marathon Digital Invests $600M in Bitcoin ETF investors were not the only ones who stocked up on Bitcoin recently. Marathon Digital invested more than $600 million in Bitcoin over the past two months, according to a filing with the United States SEC on Dec. 2. The company revealed the acquisition of 6,484 Bitcoin between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30 at an average price of $95,352 per BTC. This amounted to a total cost of $618.3 million. Marathon also announced plans to issue $700 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031 through a private offering. The proceeds will be used for additional Bitcoin purchases and repurchasing existing convertible notes due in 2026. Some public companies that own BTC (Source: BiTBO ) As the largest publicly traded crypto mining company by market cap, Marathon Digital is the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after MicroStrategy, according to BitcoinTreasuries. On Nov. 26, the company called for the United States to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation strategy as it believes in the importance of securing Bitcoin reserves for economic and national security. Marathon compared the importance of holding Bitcoin to maintaining gold reserves, and argued that these assets provide stability in the event of declining confidence in the dollar. Despite advocating for Bitcoin accumulation, Marathon sold 63% of its mined Bitcoin in May of 2024, very shortly after Bitcoin’s fourth halving reduced the mining block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The sale involved 390 Bitcoin out of the 616 BTC that were mined that month. While President-elect Donald Trump promised to add Bitcoin to the U.S. Treasury reserve, some experts, like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, are skeptical about the likelihood of a Bitcoin strategic reserve being established during his term. MicroStrategy Bought 15,400 BTC in a Week MicroStrategy also boosted its position as a leading corporate Bitcoin holder by buying 15,400 BTC between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, funded through $1.5 billion raised from a stock sale under its at-the-market equity program. The purchase was completed at an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the United States SEC. During the same period, MicroStrategy sold 3.7 million shares of its Class A common stock, which generated $1.48 billion in net proceeds to fund the acquisition. As of Dec. 1, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries hold a total of 402,100 BTC, which is valued at close to $38.4 billion at current market prices. The firm spent $23.4 billion on Bitcoin purchases at an average price of $58,263 per coin, which is a 64% gain on its investments. This latest acquisition happened after an even larger purchase the week prior, when the company bought 55,000 BTC for $5.4 billion at an average price of $97,862. That transaction was funded through a combination of a private offering of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2029 and proceeds from the equity program. In addition to expanding MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor urged Microsoft to also adopt a similar Bitcoin-centric strategy. Saylor pitched the idea to Microsoft’s board, and claimed the tech giant could increase its market cap by almost $5 trillion by aggressively adopting Bitcoin. He suggested Microsoft convert its dividend payouts, stock buybacks, cash flows, and debt into Bitcoin, which he argued could add hundreds of dollars to the company’s stock price and create trillions of dollars in enterprise value.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 05:49:53

Peterson, who is known for developing a unique economic metric called the Secular Market Indicator, shared his concerns in a public statement that sparked controversy among investors. Peterson introduced his Secular Market Indicator six years ago in the Journal of Wealth Management. The metric is designed to gauge whether the economy is poised for long-term growth or stagnation, and the analyst claims it offers insights that go beyond traditional tools like the Shiller P/E ratio or the Buffett Indicator. Peterson criticized these older models, claiming they “went bankrupt in 2008” and can’t provide meaningful forecasts today. In contrast, Peterson’s model uses gold as a fundamental variable and treats it as a proxy for tangible assets such as commodities, as opposed to paper-based investments. Related News: XRP Price Nears the $3 Mark - What's Fueling the Mega Rally? Why is XRP Rising? Peterson announced that the Secular Market Indicator was “fully triggered” again for the first time since 2021. He claimed that stocks would not exceed an average annual return of 5% for the next decade and that a major market crash could occur within the next two years. Drawing parallels with past economic crises, Peterson draws attention to the bear markets in 2022, 2008 and 2000. Predicting that the first signs of a decline could appear as early as the summer of 2025, the author warns investors not to underestimate the speed at which such events will occur. Peterson’s bearish outlook also extends to the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. He recalled Bitcoin’s performance during previous market crashes, such as the one in 2022, warning that this cycle “may be no different.” *This is not investment advice.

This includes chip equipment maker, Naura Technology Group. According to a Reuters report , the United States launched its third such major sweep on Chinese chipmaking since 2018. The new plan imposes restrictions on Chinese chip toolmaking companies such as Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology. The package will limit China’s progress in developing AI-related technology by limiting the transfer of advanced memory chips and additional chip-making tools. The latest effort can decelerate China’s access to technologies that would reinforce its military or compromise U.S. security. The restrictions are especially concerned with chips made to use in artificial intelligence. This also includes other advanced chipmaking equipment that use high bandwidth memory. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says that this restrictive action would limit China’s semiconductor capability and therefore its military modernization. 20 semiconductor companies, two investment companies, and over 100 AI chip makers are included in the list U.S. companies including Lam Research, KLA, Applied Materials, and Dutch firm ASM International are likely to be impacted. More than 20 semiconductor companies, two investment companies, and over 100 chipmaking toolmakers are included in the list. One is Swaysure Technology, which is tied to Huawei and has already come under severe U.S. sanctions, and another is Shenzhen Pensun Technology. U.S. suppliers also now need special licenses to do business with those firms added to the Entity List. In a regular press briefing on Monday, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said these restrictions are against the norms of global trade. They will also disrupt the supply chains. He also added that China will protect the rights of its companies.

Expert Sets Timeline For 3 Digits,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-prepares-for-parabolic-surge-expert-sets-timeline-for-3-digits/,"XRP has been at the center of attention recently due to significant market movements and optimistic projections from analysts. The asset recently achieved a notable milestone by surpassing its 2021 peak of $1.96, a development that has sparked excitement among investors. XRP’s current price of $2.71 represents a 37.01% surge in the past 24 hours, with its peak reaching $2.8487. This surge has also pushed it above Solana, BNB, and USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency. JackTheRippler, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a detailed chart showcasing XRP’s potential for a parabolic surge. He predicts that the asset could achieve triple-digit values, signaling unprecedented growth for XRP. According to the chart, XRP has historically experienced significant upward trends following prolonged consolidation periods, and the current setup appears to mirror past patterns. #XRP prepares for a parabolic surge. We could see 3 digits next year! pic.twitter.com/7DCM7MtPxq — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 1, 2024 The Impending XRP Bull Run Renowned trader Peter Brandt recently noted the importance of XRP breaking through the $1.96 level , suggesting it was a key resistance point. Now that this milestone has been surpassed, the possibility of a major rally becomes increasingly likely. This sentiment aligns with JackTheRippler’s analysis, which suggests that XRP is on the verge of a significant upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation about the broader regulatory and political environment in 2025 is also boosting optimism. Over the years, XRP’s legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have shaped its trajectory. However, this could soon change as SEC Chair Gary Gensler leaves office on January 20. Experts believe the coming crypto-friendly SEC Chair will end Gensler’s long-running war against crypto. Gensler’s departure would create a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, speculation about policy changes under Donald Trump’s administration in 2025 fuels positive sentiment among investors. How High Can XRP Climb JackTheRippler is confident that XRP will triple digits in 2025. According to his chart, he expects the digital asset to reach $271.16, an astonishing 9,906% increase from its current price. JackTheRippler has previously shared extremely bullish expectations for XRP. In October, the analyst predicted that the digital asset would climb to $40 by the end of 2024, and at its current pace, it might achieve this on its way to $271.16.

The European Central Bank may drop offline digital euro payments if it can’t agree with smartphone makers on secure chip integration. In a digital euro progress report published on Dec. 2, the central bank has emphasized that secure elements — specialized hardware chips embedded in mobile devices — are essential to ensure offline transactions can be conducted safely and reliably. The ECB detailed ongoing discussions with device makers and technical service providers to overcome the complexities of deploying offline digital euro solutions. However, without consensus on implementation, the project might eventually face potential delays or a complete scale-back. “Due to its highly controlled environment, deploying an application remotely is complex and involves multiple stakeholders.” The European Central Bank You might also like: Russia’s central banker behind CBDC steps down While the ECB is exploring digital euro features, without agreement from tech partners its offline use could potentially be limited. Thus far, it remains unclear whether the offline feature will advance or stay as a conceptual idea given that the challenge isn’t unique to the eurozone. For instance, Sweden’s Riksbank, in its latest research report , also highlighted the technical and regulatory hurdles for enabling secure offline payments with the e-krona, the country’s proposed central bank digital currency. The Riksbank warned of liquidity risks stemming from unsynchronized balances between offline and online wallets, creating potential usability and security issues for recipients of offline transactions. To mitigate such risks, Riksbank suggested solutions like restricted offline usage or centralized liquidity pools but acknowledged these require further evaluation.

Struggling to pick up pace, the ETH price trend consolidates between 20 and 50 EMA lines in the 4-hour chart. Based on the current price action, a breakout of either EMA line will determine the upcoming trend. Let’s find out more in this Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, ETH price action reveals a rising channel pattern. The support trendline is in confluence with the 100 EMA line of the 4-hour chart. Despite the quick bullish movements in the rising channel, the ETH price failed to breach the critical resistance at $3,750. This has led to the ongoing bearish reversal characterized by a dome-shaped pattern. Tradingview The Ethereum Price had retraced to $3556 last night to test the 100 EMA line and the local support trendline. The price is currently preparing its bullish turnaround in the 4-hour chart. Further, the recovery run is now challenging the 20 EMA line. Technical Indicators: MACD: The MACD and signal lines are in a bearish alignment. However, the declining bearish histograms reflect the average line closing the gap and teasing a bullish crossover.

A bounce from this level could ignite a sharp V-shaped recovery, targeting the $3,759 resistance and reigniting bullish momentum. The U.S. trading session will play a pivotal role, with increased trading volumes and positive sentiment needed to fuel an uptrend. Conversely, failure to hold support could lower the Ethereum Price, potentially retesting $3,382 if sideways action persists. However, a market-wide recovery could see the Ethereum Price break above $3,750. This will set the stage for a rally toward $4,064. Will the bull run in ETH surpass $4,000 in 2024?

The ones that have experienced a huge rise during the 2021 bull run have again started to swell, hinting towards the return of pro-traders. After a magnificent run, the Bitcoin price has begun to remain stagnant a bit. This has enabled the other altcoins to swell, which have attracted massive gains. XRP & ADA prices, for instance, have surged beyond $1 after remaining stuck below $0.4 to $0.5 for quite a long time. Similarly, here are a few more tokens that may achieve the $1 milestone in a short while from now. Polygon (MATIC) The monthly chart of MATIC price suggests the price is about to experience a fine bullish push, which could initiate a 40% rally The conversion & baseline of Ichimoku Cloud are about to validate a bullish crossover, which could further flip the cloud to be bullish Besides, the monthly RSI is incremental and could reach the neckline of the parabolic curve at the upper threshold. Therefore, the Polygon price is expected to break the resistance at $0.75 anytime from now and secure $1 before the end of 2024 The Sandbox (SAND) The SAND price has broken from the multi-year descending pattern, the falling wedge and is accumulating strength for the next bullish wave The buying volume has dropped after a massive rise but the sellers are just restricting below the resistance zone between $0.79 and $0.88 while failing to drag the price lower Besides, the rally continues to remain within the accumulation phase, as suggested as the indicator just triggered a bullish divergence Secondly, the +Di displayed a bearish divergence but no specific movement was seen with the -Di while ADX remained elevated. This suggests the price is preparing for the next upswing beyond $1. Decentraland (MANA) The MANA price is testing one of the crucial resistances within the range of $0.74 and $0.81, which also collides with the 200-day MA. This range also collides with the neckline of the Adam and Eve chart pattern, which includes a v-shaped recovery followed by a parabolic curve. Besides, the RSI is about to re-enter the overbought zone, which may end up in a small pullback Therefore, the MANA price could rise beyond $1.1 and face a pullback to the zone, followed by a healthy rise towards the higher targets Algorand (ALGO) Algorand price has reached levels not seen since November 2022 and hence the token is expected to remain elevated as buying volume has increased heavily Besides, the RSI has entered the overbought zone and shows no signs of deviation, but after some point, the levels have to face rejection Therefore, the price is expected to reach $0.82, which may attract some bearish activity but the current support zone between $0.39 and $0.45 or a little higher, could offer a base to trigger a strong rebound With this, the price may remain elevated and mark $1; meanwhile, if the resistance at $0.66 holds the rally, the bearish narrative may fade off Other than these tokens, the two altcoins that are very close to reclaiming $1 are Mantle (MNT) & Ethena (ENA).

The upcoming US president promised to launch a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile, which will add to the existing BTC holdings. The creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States will kickstart a global movement, which will heighten the overall demand. Furthermore, more countries around the world have a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 100 percent, led by Japan and the United States, which is not sustainable in the long haul. US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve According to Denis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, there is a high chance that strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation will pass at the state level before the upcoming Trump administration gets to implement a similar policy. However, Porter noted that Trump could issue an executive order in the first week he gets into office, which could give the federal government a head start. I can now officially confirm and announce that 10 states will be introducing ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserves’ legislation here in the great United STATES of America. We are going to win with Bitcoin. We will lead the world. No one will come close. The word will follow our lead. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 3, 2024 Already, Porter confirmed that 10 different states in America have already laid out plans to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve. To facilitate the legislation process, Porter has requested the crypto community to donate to the Satoshi Action Fund. Meanwhile, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has cautioned crypto investors to keep their hopes low on the strategic BTC reserve. Furthermore, Schiff believes that the bill has no huge support other than Senator Cynthia Lummis and Ro Khanna. Impact on BTC Price I am more and more convinced that one day it will be virtually impossible to buy Bitcoin. We are painfully early. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 2, 2024 The imminent adoption of Bitcoin by nation-states, amid the ongoing mainstream adoption by institutional investors, will trigger a huge demand vs supply shock. As a result, Porter is of the opinion that it will be virtually impossible to purchase Bitcoin in the future.

According to a report by Nikkei Asia , these exchanges include industry leaders Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) implemented the restrictions due to the platforms’ lack of proper licensing from the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC). Cambodia blocks 102 domains The crackdown extends beyond cryptocurrency, with TRC acting chairman Srun Kimsann signing a directive that blocks 102 domains. They have primarily targeted online gambling operations. While website access has been restricted, mobile applications of these platforms remain accessible to users. The restrictions come as a surprise given Binance’s established presence in Cambodia. It also includes a 2022 memorandum of understanding with SERC focused on digital currency regulation development and a partnership with the Royal Group, a major Cambodian conglomerate. Binance spokesperson Lily Lee acknowledged the situation, noting that multiple platforms were affected and that they are “closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Cambodia maintains an important crypto position Despite the regulatory challenges, the Asian country maintains an important position in the global crypto landscape. It ranks among the top 20 countries for retail crypto adoption per capita, according to Chainalysis . Centralized exchanges facilitate 70% of the country’s cryptocurrency transactions, highlighting the potential impact of these restrictions. Currently, only two companies have received authorization under SERC’s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox program. These licensed entities can trade digital assets but face restrictions on exchanges involving the country’s legal tender – the riel and US dollars – or other fiat currencies. The regulatory action follows increased scrutiny over crypto-related criminal activities in Cambodia.

Under the partnership, Ethena will integrate Derive's basis trading, options, futures and vaults, leveraging Ethena's USDe stablecoin and staked USDE to boost liquidity and trading volume, the press release shared with CoinDesk said. Ethena will begin its basis trading on Derive’s perpetual markets, pending approval from the Ethena Risk Council. That's expected to boost volumes and liquidity on Derive, bolstering Derive users' ability to execute large orders at stable prices.In conjunction with this, the Lyra Foundation, which oversees the Derive protocol, will receive a multi-million dollar grant from the Ethena Foundation, and staked ENA (sENA) holders will be rewarded with 5% of the DRV tokens granted to the Ethena Foundation. The ENA token is a governance token for the Ethena ecosystem. “Integrating Ethena’s immense liquidity and strong user base with Derive.xyz’s unparalleled derivatives protocol not only unlocks significant opportunities for Derive.xyz users, but also positions it as the premier on-chain derivatives platform,"" Nick Forster, Founder of Derive.xyz, said.

Ethena's USDe is a synthetic dollar, which uses a hedged cash-and-carry strategy, also known as the basis trade, and collateralized stablecoin to maintain the $1 price peg. The on-chain derivatives protocol is also debuting vaults for staked USDe (sUSDe) holders, enabling them to load up on reward by combining Ethena's staking yields with Derive' structured product strategies. Ethena has over $4 billion in TVL as of writing, with over 300,000 users and integrations with the largest centralized exchanges like Deribit and ByBit. Meanwhile, with a TVL of $79 million, Derive is the world's largest decentralised protocol, facilitating programmable on-chain options, perpetuals, and structured products.

CoinShares interpreted this figure as profit-taking after BTC tested the key psychological level of $100k. Short-Bitcoin products saw a modest inflow of $0.5 million during the past week. On the other hand, altcoins mostly attracted inflows, including Ripple’s XRP. According to the latest CoinShares report , Ethereum saw inflows totaling $634 million, reflecting a dramatic shift in sentiment that has driven its year-to-date inflows to $2.2 billion, surpassing its 2021 record of $2 billion. XRP experienced inflows of $95 million, the largest on record, likely due to the hype surrounding the possible launch of a US ETF. Closely following XRP were Cardano and Chainlink, with $0.9 million and $0.8 million in inflows, respectively. Litecoin, however, saw a modest $0.2 million in inflows during this period. Meanwhile, multi-asset products and Solana experienced outflows of $16.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Zooming out, digital asset investment products attracted a total of $270 million in inflows last week, revealing an unusual contrast in asset flows within the class. Although US ETFs began offering options, despite high initial volumes, ETP volumes have not seen a similar increase, with last week’s total at $22 billion compared to $34 billion the previous one. Inflows this year have reached a record-breaking $37.3 billion.

While big buyers like MicroStrategy are still active, other cryptocurrencies are seeing more attention. The U.S. government’s recent transfer of nearly 20,000 Bitcoin to Coinbase has raised eyebrows, with many experts calling it a bad move, especially as Bitcoin’s global importance grows. Why Are Experts Criticizing This? Jason Lowery, a US Space Force engineer, labeled the move a “huge strategic mistake,” arguing that Bitcoin’s value goes beyond price. He compared the sale to an act of ignorance, warning that the government might regret it later. Lowery even suggested a scenario where the government might reverse course, recalling historical decisions like Executive Order 6102, which forced Americans to sell their gold to the government in the 1930s. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the critics, stating that selling Bitcoin makes little sense. Crypto educator Toby Cunningham called it short-sighted, adding, “If they sell, the market will absorb it instantly.” Was It Really a Sale? As of now, it’s not clear if it was an actual sale or not. According to Spot On Chain, a crypto analytics platform, the transfer could be related to managing or consolidating Bitcoin wallets rather than liquidating assets. Julio Moreno from CryptoQuant added that only 10,000 BTC might have been sold, while the rest—around 9,800 BTC—was sent to a new wallet. In contrast to earlier sales, which caused sharp price drops, this move only led to a minor dip in Bitcoin’s price to about $95,800. Despite the transfer, the U.S. government still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, approximately 183,850 BTC, worth $17.7 billion, largely seized from operations like the takedown of Silk Road Crypto Impact When the transfer was detected, Bitcoin prices briefly dipped by almost 3% to $94,500. However, the market quickly recovered, with Bitcoin trading around $96,000 at the time of writing. Analysts are closely monitoring whether Bitcoin can push past the important $100,000 mark or if the rally will be limited by profit-taking and investors spreading their capital into other assets. Is Crash on Horizon? With this sudden sell-off plan, there is also a rumor that President Joe Biden might sell off a large amount of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings before leaving office to make it harder for President-elect Donald Trump to create a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve, as he promised during his campaign. The U.S. holds a lot of Bitcoin because of its efforts to seize assets from illegal activities. If Biden sells this Bitcoin, it could limit Trump’s ability to use it for his reserve without needing extra funds. Some people believe Biden has used similar tactics in other areas, like foreign aid, to block Trump’s plans. Will this move break the current bull run?

An 89.5% growth in just one week? Unbelievable! But what if I say that something even more exciting is happening in the XRPL-based meme coin market? Excited to know more? Then, read on! XRP’s Rise and Meme Coin Gains Like I mentioned before, XRP has witnessed significant growth lately. In the last 30 days, with a surge of 441.5%, it has outperformed all the other top ten cryptocurrencies, triggering excitement among XRP enthusiasts. At the time when the crypto world is discussing excitedly about the enviable performance of XRP, a totally unexpected trend has emerged in the XRPL-based meme coin market. The trend has truly left most meme coin enthusiasts speechless with excitement. Some XRPL-based meme coins, including ARMY, BEAR and MAG, have shown impressive growth lately. ARMY’s Spectacular Growth Considering that the meme coin market has dropped by at least 4.2% in the last 24 hours, the general trend in the market appears ‘less bright’. However, the same is not the case when it comes to the XRPL-based meme coin market, implying that at this moment, this market is more tempted to follow the XRP trend than the general meme coin trend. In the last 24 hours, ARMY, one of the most prominent XRPL-based meme coins, has seen a rise of 50.2% – far higher than Dogecoin’s -2.4%, Shiba Inu -0.1%, Pepe’s +0.2%, Bonk’s +0.2%, and dogwifhat’s 2.35. Indicating a notable growth in market activity in the ARMY market, ARMY has experienced an excellent surge in trading volume of at least 48%. XRPL Meme Coins Gaining Momentum ARMY is not the only exceptional player in the XRPL-based meme coin market. If it were, the trend could have been ignored as a one-time wonder. The story of BEAR is not different. With a massive 30-day rise of 395.6%, it has expressed its solidarity with ARMY. Notably, in the last 14 days alone, the BEAR market has witnessed an increase of 224.4%. There is no wonder about reports citing an increase in users moving from Solana and Etheruem to XRP Ledger. Volume Comparison and Market Concerns Can this be interpreted as XRPL taking over the meme coin market? Well, that sounds like an exaggeration. Data indicates there is still a long way to go for the XRPL market if they really want to become a market leader. The volume analysis is enough to reveal this reality. The daily trading volumes of the top meme coins like Dogecoin ($11,929,910,703), Shiba Inu ($3,149,361,501), Pepe ($4,666,566,941) and Bonk ($754,672,721), are far higher than ARMY’s $74,388.56 and BEAR’s $2,085,276. XRP’s Market Achievement At this stage, it is important not to ignore the achievements the XRP market has recently made. The most important of which is its rise to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing Tether. It seems that speculations regarding the launch of XRP ETFs and reports regarding improving regulatory clarity are offering the necessary optimism that the market needs to grow higher and higher.",News|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 07:28:13

Why? Well, for starters, this isn’t just any routine appointment. Trump promised to kick out Gary Gensler , the current SEC Chair, on his first day back in office—and Gensler has already announced he’s stepping down. So, who’s going to take the reins? And what could this mean for crypto’s future? Gensler’s Era: Love It or Hate It Let’s talk about Gary Gensler for a sec. During his time at the SEC, he really went all-in on crypto regulation. Some people loved that he cracked down on fraud and made things like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs a reality. Others? Not so much. His “regulation-by-enforcement” style rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, especially those who think the U.S. should be leading in crypto innovation—not scaring companies away. With Gensler out of the picture, Trump has a big chance to shift gears. Pro-crypto voices are already buzzing about what comes next. Will the SEC finally focus on clarity and innovation? Or are we just trading one set of problems for another? Who’s Likely to Land the Job? Okay, here’s where it gets interesting. Prediction markets like Kalshi are pointing to Paul Atkins as the frontrunner. This guy is all about innovation and seems to be the polar opposite of Gensler. He’s pushing for clear, pro-business crypto rules, and honestly, that’s music to a lot of ears in the industry. But he’s not the only name being thrown around. There’s Dan Gallagher, Mark Uyeda, Robert Stebbins, and Heath Tarbert, too. Solid contenders, sure, but none have the same buzz as Atkins. Trump’s transition team is apparently in the final stages of picking someone, so we’ll know soon enough. What to Expect If Atkins—or someone like him—gets the job, we could see a huge shift in how the U.S. handles crypto. Instead of enforcement crackdowns, we might get clearer rules that help companies innovate without fear. That could attract more businesses and investors to the space, which is a win-win, right? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Politics is messy, and big promises don’t always pan out. Still, for now, all eyes are on Trump’s announcement. Could this be the moment that changes everything for crypto?

US Government Moves 10,000 BTC To Coinbase",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-a-bitcoin-sell-off-coming-us-government-moves-10000-btc-to-coinbase/,"As the Bitcoin price consolidates just below its all-time high of $99,540, a significant move by the US government has raised concerns among investors. The government has transferred a substantial amount of its seized Bitcoin holdings to Coinbase, potentially signaling intentions to sell. This echoes similar actions that had previously impacted the market earlier this year. US Government’s Bitcoin Transfer According to market intelligence firm Arkham, the US government moved approximately 10,000 Bitcoin, worth around $1.92 billion at current market prices, to two separate wallets. One wallet contains Bitcoin valued at $969 million, while the other holds approximately $949 million. This strategic allocation has drawn attention, especially given the government’s history of selling seized Bitcoin, which can create notable selling pressure in the market. Data from crypto analytics firm Dune indicates that the US government currently holds a staggering 183,422 BTC, valued at over $17.6 billion. This accounts for roughly 0.93% of the total Bitcoin supply. Should the government decide to sell a portion of these holdings, it could exert significant downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, reminiscent of previous sell-offs that followed major transfers. A Halt To Government Sales In 2025? Historically, such actions have led to increased volatility. For instance, NewsBTC reported in April, when the Bitcoin price peaked at $73,700, that the government transferred over 30,000 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road marketplace. This followed a previous seizure of more than 50,000 BTC from James Zhong, who allegedly obtained these funds through illegal means related to the Silk Road in 2012. Following these transfers, Bitcoin experienced substantial price fluctuations and a downward trend over the subsequent months. In 2022, the government also sold 9,800 BTC, with plans to divest an additional 41,500 Bitcoin. This history raises concerns that the latest transfer could lead to a similar outcome, potentially jeopardizing Bitcoin’s recent upward price momentum. However, there are emerging hopes that such moves could be curtailed in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to assume office on January 20, and he has proposed a strategy that includes making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the US. This approach would involve the government purchasing nearly 1 million BTC rather than selling its current holdings, with plans to use these assets to help reduce the nation’s $36 trillion national debt. This proposal has been introduced in Congress by US Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis under “the Bitcoin Act,” which has garnered bipartisan support . With the recent shift in leadership from Democrats to Republicans securing a majority in the House, there is optimism that this bill could come into effect in the second or third quarter of 2025. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,000, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

In the past month specifically, XRP has appreciated in value by more than 400% making it third largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. With such an unprecedented heightening, Ripple is, however, keen to warn that it has registered a steep rise in cases of fraudulent scams. Ripple’s Stance Against Fraud As a courtesy of social media platform X, Ripple assures its customers that neither they nor founder nor CEO Brad Garlinghouse will ever ask users to send XRP. The message from the firm said , “Ripple will never ask you to send XRP, and neither will Brad, David, Monica, Stu, or anyone else from Ripple.” Stay vigilant!” Ripple has also described its strategy for addressing scams, which involves partnering with law enforcement agencies like the FBI, monitoring fraud-related activities with other experts, and guiding users to report any scam. XRP’s Latest Success Lead To Scammers Targeting Investors The recent upsurge of XRP due to hope in Ripple’s cases against the American SEC and rising institutional adoption also make the token a favourite of fraudsters. The partnerships in cross-border payment solutions and overtures to an XRP-supported exchange-traded fund or ETF have added to the lift of Ripple across the market. However, this surge has also attracted poor-minded people who are aiming to make profits using the increased investment juice such as deep fake, phishing emails and fake giveaway schemes.

In an effort to regulate the crypto market, Cambodia has blocked access to sixteen major crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX and Coinbase. Nikkei Asia reported that the exchanges failed to secure licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator, which is necessary for operating in the country. The ban is placed across 102 domains, among which most are related to online gambling tied to crypto exchanges by the Telecommunications Regulator of Cambodia on Nov. 20. These exchanges are reported to be operating without the proper licenses and authorizations required by Cambodian law. While the websites are placed under the ban, mobile applications are still functional. This ban might be put in place to cater to the growing population of digital asset users in the country, which is expected to rake around $8 million in 2024, according to Statista . The Digital Assets market in Cambodia will reach $8,031,000 in revenue in the next year, although growth is anticipated to taper off through 2025.

Regulatory background and context Binance, one of the blacklisted exchanges in Cambodia, has held a long relationship with the country since signing a memorandum of understanding with the SERC aimed at creating digital currency regulations in 2022. Additionally, the company partnered with the Royal Group, a significant business conglomerate in Cambodia, to add force to blockchain adoption and also trained the country’s Interior Ministry officials in Jun. 2023 on detecting crypto-related crimes. Despite these efforts, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume has been debarred. “ We are closely monitoring the evolving situation, ” said Binance spokesperson Lily Lee in relation to the ban.

The Bitcoin price soared close to $100K and the older altcoins, which remained silent for quite a while, became active. This was followed by a huge rise in market sentiments and a massive influx of volume. Now that both appear to have halted for a while, the question arises whether the bulls are about to experience extreme fatigue in the coming days. If so, what’s next for the ongoing bull run? Apart from many things in common, the current bull run is showing some dissimilarities too. The traders have become more vigilant now as they are extracting profits after a brief rally followed by some relaxation phase. The BTC price is the best example, which is stuck within a range after experiencing a 65% to 70% drop in the trading volume. Currently, popular altcoins like XRP & ADA are attracting huge volume, which has kept the price elevated, but this Santiment data shows the trend could fade soon. The above chart shows the ratio between the positive and negative sentiments of BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, & XLM. Soon after Donald Trump’s victory, the ratio of Bitcoin spiked heavily, close to 60%, while the average range was around 20%. Besides, the sentiments of altcoins also surged to some extent but quickly faded out. This suggests the euphoria from a week ago is showing trader fatigue. Despite the massive growth in XRP, XLM, or ADA prices, the traders have gone quieter a bit after taking profits in late November. The markets now appear to have been moving in the opposite direction of the expectations. Therefore, as per Santiment, the silence towards the top caps should be considered an encouraging sign that FOMO won’t be interfering with any further upswing in the coming days. Hence, the markets may witness a calculated approach for the upcoming bullish action, excluding the euphoric sentiments.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 07:56:13

Analysts Warn of Sharp Correction,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-crash-to-0-60-analysts-warn-of-sharp-correction/,"The post XRP Price Crash to $0.60? Analysts Warn of Sharp Correction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has once again drawn attention from the crypto community, not just for its recent price surge but also for concerns about its centralized token supply. According to Crypto analyst IncomeSharks, over 43% of XRP tokens remain locked and are not in circulation, raising fears of a sharp drop back to $0.60 soon. 43% XRP Held By Ripple In a recent tweet post, IncomeSharks pointed out that nearly half of XRP’s total supply remains locked away. Ripple, the company behind XRP, controls 38.9 billion tokens in its escrow accounts . This level of centralization has raised worries among investors about the potential for manipulation. https://twitter.com/IncomeSharks/status/1863717475168424230 “Imagine if you were on Pump Fun and saw the developer owned 43% of supply,” the analyst remarked, drawing parallels to tokens with high centralization, which often trigger concerns about manipulation. XRP Price To Plunge To $0.60 To support his critique, IncomeSharks shared a chart showcasing XRP’s historical price trends. The chart reveals a familiar pattern, sharp price spikes followed by steep corrections. In April 2021, XRP soared to nearly $2 but lost 75% of its value within two months. Similarly, after hitting $3.40 in 2018, the token plunged by 92% shortly after, suggesting its price is heavily influenced by speculative trading. Recently, XRP surged to $2.74 , marking an impressive 410% rise in just one month. Meanwhile, the chart hints at another possible correction to $0.60 a drop of almost 4x from its current price level, following past patterns. Pump-and-Dump Allegations IncomeSharks pointed out that XRP is often criticized for its frequent price jumps followed by steep drops, known as pump-and-dump cycles. A big reason for this concern is that Ripple still holds a large amount of XRP tokens, which gives them significant control over its supply. There’s a reason why many in the crypto space don’t trust this token,” IncomeSharks added, reflecting the general skepticism in the community",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 07:57:49

Effectively avoid dependence on powerful ASIC miners and GPUs, and avoid mining machines and GPUs consuming a lot of energy when running. Eliminate CPU mining: When Bitcoin was first launched, mining was a relatively simple process that could be completed using the central processing unit (CPU) of an ordinary computer. Early miners could use personal computers to get Bitcoin rewards. At that time, the network was small and the difficulty of mining cryptographic equations was low, so ordinary users could mine. However, as more and more miners joined the network, competition intensified and the difficulty of mining increased. This resulted in miners needing to install more powerful hardware to benefit from the mining process. Adoption of GPU Mining: As the difficulty of Bitcoin mining increased, miners switched from hardware using CPUs to devices using GPUs. Compared to CPUs, GPUs are better suited for the parallel processing required by the PoW algorithm, making mining more efficient. This shift marked a turning point in the development of Bitcoin mining technology, allowing miners to optimize operations and profitability. GPUs allow miners to mine more Bitcoin in a shorter period of time and contribute to network security by increasing the computing power dedicated to the blockchain. With the shift to GPUs, mining pools also became popular, where miners combine their computing resources to increase their chances of earning Bitcoin. Upgrade GPU+AI mining: The powerful new features of the AI ​​application building block suite help mines upgrade to faster, more powerful, and more efficient levels of security and profitability. Applications built on BitconeMine AI can now benefit from faster reasoning, larger models, improved performance analysis, and more.

Analyst Jason Pizzino tells his 121,100 followers on the social media platform X that peak cycle highs may still be a ways off for assets like stocks and crypto. “When we take a broad look at the market there are still a lot of investors that are thinking the stock market, real estate and crypto gains so far are ‘too good to be true’ and this time they’re going to get out before the crash. This is NOT how macro, end of cycle tops are formed. The 18-year cycle ‘Everything Bubble’ peak still has more time to develop and bring major FOMO (fear of missing out) unlike what we have seen.” The analyst predicts that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other assets are gearing up for additional rallies in the bullish market cycle. “Bitcoin, real estate, stock markets and altcoins are setting up for the biggest pump in history. I think it has already started, but there are still plenty of investors asking, ‘When will it start?’ Look around, the markets have been up for years and don’t look like they will stop any time soon. Especially not now that we have a perfect ‘This time is different’ scenario brewing within US politics.” He also says that Bitcoin may now be on the verge of entering an explosive phase of the market cycle based on historic precedence. “The Bitcoin four-year cycle has officially entered the right side of the cycle, which means this is a strong market. Three out of the current four cycles have fooled the majority of people into thinking the cycle would end early, aka a left-translated cycle like in 2011, 2019, and most recently 2024. Each time, Bitcoin has gone on to make a new all-time high in the second half of the four-year cycle, the ‘right’ side.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 08:12:00

In a recent X post , Armstrong warned that the Coinbase team will immediately cut ties with law firms that hire people who have committed “bad deeds” against the crypto industry while under the Biden Administration . He believed that law firms are still unaware of the crypto industry’s stance on the previous administration His declaration followed a recent case where Milbank, a law firm based in New York that Coinbase worked with, hired ex- SEC chief Gurbir Grewal as a partner in its New York office. Gurbir was head of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement for three years before stepping down on Oct. 11. Armstrong stated that Coinbase has terminated its partnership with Milbank and refuses to work with the law firm for as long as Gurbir is still a partner at their office. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules. If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders,” Armstrong wrote in his post. We've let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs. Senior partners at these law firms seem unaware of the crypto industry's position on this.… https://t.co/k8R6NtfTV1 pic.twitter.com/RT0k408i9f — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 3, 2024 You might also like: The next SEC Chief should stop going after crypto companies Moreover, Armstrong urged other crypto industry players to do the same. He believed that officials who were responsible for trying to destroy the crypto industry should be held accountable for their actions. “We as an industry should not be putting money in their pocket after the abuse. Let your law firms know that hiring these folks means losing you as a client,” he said, adding that these figures should find work in other fields, as he does not believe in “permanently cancelling people.” Throughout his tenure at the SEC, Grewal has led the government agency to more than $20 billion in civil penalties and over 2,400 lawsuits. On the day of Grewal’s departure, the SEC announced that he authorized more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms, digital asset operators, and virtual currency purveyors for allegedly breaking federal securities laws. Coinbase amidst the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ The SEC under Biden’s Administration has been accused of being fiercely anti-crypto, going so far as waging a “war on crypto.” Up until October 2024, there have been eight lawsuits with settlements valued at $19.45 billion aimed at crypto firms under the Biden Administration. Compared to last year, the value has increased by 78.9% compared to the previous year. In March 2023, the SEC sent a notice to Coinbase, informing the exchange that it planned to take enforcement action, alleging the exchange of violating several securities laws. The exchange fired back at the regulator by filing a lawsuit to compel the commission to respond to a request for new rules for the cryptocurrencies. However, the SEC asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing a lack of obligation. In June 2023, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and its related entities, but did not name Armstrong or other executives.

This represents a notable 31.1% increase in its circulating market cap quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) compared to Q2. The XRP price also experienced a significant increase of 28.5% during the same period. However, with the recent victory of President-elect Donald Trump and a clearer horizon on the regulatory front in the US, these metrics have fallen short, with the last three weeks’ rally being the largest in nearly 7 years. XRP Sees 94% Surge In Daily Transactions Research firm Messari and its Q3 report show that the recent momentum can be attributed to several key developments. Most notably, asset management firm Grayscale launched its XRP Trust in September, giving accredited investors a new way to gain exposure to XRP. This development, along with S-1 filings by exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares and WisdomTree to launch XRP ETFs in recent months, underscores the growing institutional interest in the token. In Q3, several key network metrics reversed previous declines. Average daily transactions soared by 94% QoQ to reach 1.7 million, while new addresses increased by 10% to 105,000. However, the increase was largely driven by microtransactions (transactions involving less than 1 XRP), which Ripple’s report noted were associated with a spam messaging campaign. Notably, this increase in new addresses contrasts with a 34% year-over-year decline in quarterly new addresses from Q3 2023 to Q2 2024. Despite the uptick in certain metrics, total active addresses fell by 3% QoQ, driven by a 20% decrease in active sending addresses, while unique receiving addresses rose by 7%. Price Nears 2018 Record High Payment transactions also displayed remarkable growth, increasing by 110% QoQ after experiencing declines in the previous two quarters. This surge followed a significant spike related to inscription activities that began at the end of 2023. In addition to payment transactions , NFT-related activities on the XRPL also saw notable changes. NFT minting and burning transactions increased by 93% and 148%, respectively, while NFT creation and offer acceptance transactions saw slight declines. Despite this, if going deeper into the Q4 data, XRP has seen its most notable uptrend in years, with its market capitalization soaring by nearly $130 billion in just three weeks, making it the third largest digital asset on the market, just behind Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Its price has clearly followed suit, with a colossal 432% uptrend in the past few weeks to a current trading price of $2,71 per token, close to the record high of $3,040 reached during the 2018 bull run, and now with only a 20% gap between the current price and the all-time high. Overall, the data from Q3 and part of Q4 paints a picture of a growing and evolving XRP ecosystem characterized by increased transaction activity, institutional interest, and a commitment to improving XRP’s value proposition.

Cardano breaks $1 for the first time since 2022 amid bullish momentum, while memeFi token Cutoshi emerges as a high-upside alternative. Table of Contents Cardano sees huge gains Can Cutoshi reach $1 from its current $0.0259 level? With the crypto market riding the bullish wave, Cardano is seeing some major gains. The token has reached multi-year highs, breaking $1 for the first time since 2022. However, there’s a new token, Cutoshi , that is seen as a promising alternative with significant upside. Cardano sees huge gains Cardano (ADA) has been one of the strongest performers this cycle. Currently in 8th place among crypto assets, the token saw a 239.59% increase in the last 30 days. Cardano is currently a multi-year of $1.20, boosted by major developments in the markets. The crypto bull rally has been one of the main contributors to Cardano’s rise. However, what was even more impactful was what was driving the bull rally. Notably, Cardano is one of the tokens that stands to benefit the most from the coming major shifts in US regulations. Source: CMC Most recently, traders are bracing for potential Cardano spot ETFs in the United States. So far, the SEC’s Gary Gensler was a major roadblock for that development. The SEC Chair was reluctant to approve spot altcoin ETFs, citing high risks and potential for manipulation. However, with his resignation, the agency is likely to take a new course. What is more, the incoming US administration will likely be much more favorable to crypto regulation. As an established project, Cardano stands to benefit a lot from the regulatory change. With regulatory clarity, institutions are likely to pour new capital into credible projects like Cardano. This is also reflected in the technical analysis of the token. Momentum indicators all suggest a strong buy, with moving averages trading far below Cardano’s current price . This suggests a strong outlook for Cardano in the near future. Can Cutoshi reach $1 from its current $0.0259 level? Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space. However, investors who are opting for high-risk, high-reward plays are looking at Cutoshi (CUTO) as an alternative. This memeFi token is attracting attention from traders who value a strong technical foundation and utility. This combination is proving strong, as Cutoshi reached $1.2 million in presale investments in December. Cutoshi is a token that combines memecoins with DeFi. Its mascot is the Chinese Lucky Cat, a symbol that is recognized throughout the world. At the same time, its inspiration is Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary Bitcoin creator. Like Satoshi, Cutoshi is focused on decentralization and digital freedom. At the heart of its mission is creating a decentralized ecosystem run by its users. Its multichain DEX wants to make DeFi more accessible than ever, offering a secure way for investors to handle their crypto. Security is key, as DEXs enable traders to retain the custody of their coins, securing them from misuse. If Cutoshi succeeds in its mission, it has the potential to join the top 200, or even 100, crypto projects. At current prices, this would mean it has a real shot at $1. Currently trading at $0.031, the bullish case for the token would mean a significant upside. To learn more about Cutoshi, visit the official website.

The popular meme coin recently surged by 20%, reaching new price highs and fueling investor optimism. With the crypto market experiencing a December rally, SHIB appears poised for further gains. This breakout could begin a significant price rally, with the potential for the token to double in value soon. Could Shiba Inu Price Double Soon? The Shiba Inu price is gaining attention as it approaches a crucial resistance level that could determine its next major move. Currently facing a stiff resistance level near $0.00003250, SHIB has shown steady consolidation, building momentum for a potential breakout. If it successfully surpasses this resistance, analysts predict the price could rally by 83%, doubling its current value. This potential move comes as SHIB mirrors historical patterns of sharp upward trends following prolonged accumulation periods. Shiba Inu price is attracting attention as trading volumes rise and its community continues to lend strong support. The broader cryptocurrency market rally, marked by Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing $95,000 and Ethereum (ETH) climbing past $3,600, is expected to amplify SHIB’s upward momentum. TradingView SHIB’s price action may see double-digit gains as market conditions remain favorable. The significant burn activity within the SHIB ecosystem is also contributing to its optimistic outlook. According to Shibburn data, over the past 24 hours, SHIB recorded a staggering burn rate increase of 3,162.%, with 2,022,950,833 tokens burned. This reduction in circulating supply could play a vital role in boosting the token’s value. The surge in SHIB coincides with gains in other popular meme coins , such as Dogecoin price , Pepe (PEPE), and WIF. Their upward trajectories indicate growing investor confidence in meme-based digital assets. Shiba Inu Price Eyes For A Break Out The recent SHIB price hovered at $0.0000295, reflecting the growing optimism across the broader cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu is targeting a critical resistance level at $0.00003. If this resistance is successfully flipped, the SHIB price prediction could surge to $0.00004 within the week. Conversely, failure to overcome the $0.00003 resistance could result in a pullback to $0.0000295. Such a retracement would erase recent gains and test SHIB’s investor confidence. The MACD indicator signals minimal momentum, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line, hinting at a potential upward bias. The Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 44.43, indicating strong trend strength. This suggests that if a breakout occurs, it could lead to a decisive movement in either direction. SHIB Price Chart By TradingView To sum up, the Shiba Inu price momentum, coupled with favorable market conditions and increased token burns, positions it for potential exponential growth. With key resistance levels in sight, a breakout could trigger significant gains, doubling its value and rewarding optimistic investors.

Between the high-end steak and well-aged wine, Trump reportedly suggested that Canada should consider becoming the 51st state of the United States if it can’t manage its economy under his looming 25% tariffs. “If your country can’t survive unless it’s ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion, maybe it should become a state.” – Donald Trump With three-fourths of Canada’s exports dependent on the U.S. market, Trump’s threat was a potential death knell for Canada’s economy, forcing the Canadian leader to start scrambling for solutions. Tariffs: Economic warfare or a dealbreaker? Trump has never hidden his disdain for trade deficits or what he calls “unfair trade practices.” So of course he wants protectionist trade policies. That’s the America First agenda. His latest salvo—a proposed 25% tariff on Canadian goods—was positioned as a response to perceived failures by Canada to control drug smuggling and illegal migration across their shared border. Roughly 75% of Canada’s exports head south of the border, making the U.S. its lifeline. Economists estimate that these tariffs could slash Canada’s GDP by 2.4% within two years and eliminate up to 1.5 million jobs. The Canadian economy could spiral, with effects likely hitting industries ranging from lumber to automotive manufacturing. Trudeau , caught between a rock and a hard place, argued that such tariffs would backfire, hurting U.S. consumers as much as Canadian producers. “These tariffs would kill our industries,” Trudeau reportedly said, emphasizing that costs for American citizens would inevitably rise. Essential goods like timber, steel, and even groceries could see price hikes, making Trump’s tariff plan a political gamble on both sides of the border. Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s Public Safety Minister, labeled Trump’s strategy as “reckless” in Canadian Parliament. “This isn’t just about Canada,” he said. “The U.S. would face supply chain disruptions, higher prices, and industrial slowdowns.” Trump says Trudeau could be Governor Trump’s latest comments, though humorous on the surface, carried a chilling undertone. For a nation as proud of its sovereignty as Canada, the remark was nothing short of incendiary. The US president went even further, offering Trudeau a hypothetical deal: retain his title as prime minister but also take on the role of governor if Canada were absorbed into the U.S. The statement reeked of provocation, which Trudeau countered with a pointed response. While refraining from escalating the rhetoric, he made it clear that Canada wouldn’t entertain such notions. “Canada is a sovereign nation,” Trudeau reportedly said, maintaining a calm but firm tone. Yet behind closed doors, Canadian officials are undoubtedly calculating the potential fallout of a prolonged economic standoff. Implications on the global economy If Trump’s tariffs become a reality, the consequences will stretch far beyond Canada, or even China and Mexico. Economists warn that global financial markets will be caught in the crossfire too. The World Bank estimates that tariffs on this scale could knock global GDP growth down by at least 0.5%, dragging major economies into slower recovery trajectories after years of pandemic-driven uncertainty. Meanwhile, with its own trade relationship with the U.S. already strained, China could be affected as North American tariffs disrupt global commodity flows. At the same time, Canada is exploring diversification strategies, seeking to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market. Trade agreements with the European Union and Pacific nations are back on the table as potential lifelines, though economists warn such shifts will take years to materialize.

Despite massive rallies across the market, the report from Santiment spotlights a surprising level of neutrality in market sentiment, which could allow continued growth as the uptrend matures. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1863843202886672675 Notably, over the past 30 days, major altcoins like Stellar ( XLM ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ) have experienced record-breaking gains. Stellar surged by an impressive 512%, XRP rose 444%, and Cardano increased by 280% over the last month, respectively. Market participants have observed these dramatic price movements, yet euphoria has noticeably cooled after a wave of profit-taking in late November. For context, this profit-taking wave dominated the scene after Bitcoin ( BTC ), the industry’s firstborn, attempted to breach the $100,000 mark. The bearish trend led to a retracement for BTC and the rest of the market, but a recovery has since ensued. You might also like: Over $9m lost in November phishing scams affecting 9.2k victims, data shows Despite the recovery, Santiment’s findings show that the hype surrounding these assets has not transitioned into widespread FOMO. Retail traders appear to have stepped back after capitalizing on earlier gains, leading to a quieter atmosphere. Historically, market trends often move contrary to prevailing trader sentiment. Santiment suggests that the current lack of retail enthusiasm is a positive indicator for further market climbs. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju confirmed this trend last month. The reduced noise surrounding top-performing assets implies that the market could experience sustained upward momentum without the volatility often driven by FOMO-induced buying. This period of neutrality in trader sentiment syncs with historical patterns in which quieter periods have preceded bullish moves. Interestingly, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes BTC could still witness further growth to $500,000, possibly benefiting the rest of the market. Market veteran Michaël van de Poppe holds this sentiment, stressing in a recent analysis that the ongoing bull run is not yet over. A great chart. This bull market is far from over. It did start recently and $XRP sparked the fire. I expect similar returns to be happening on the #Altcoins , but I also expected this entire market to 10x in the upcoming year.

IOTA ( IOTA ) rose 46% in the last 24 hours to a six-month high of $0.504, bringing its market cap past $1.7 billion at press time. The gains extended its monthly gains to over 350% while its daily trading volume jumped 83,% hovering over $705 million at the time of writing. The altcoin’s recent price rally was supported by a jump in futures open interest. According to CoinGlass , open interest in the futures market hit a record high of $87.89 million, up over three times from last week’s low of $26.27 million. Why is IOTA rising? IOTA rallied after developers opened the voting process to upgrade the IOTA L1 mainnet to the new Rebased protocol . https://twitter.com/iota/status/1863583910510092773 Rebased is IOTA’s largest upgrade to date, introducing multiple features such as the ability to earn IOTA staking rewards, an initial target inflation rate between 6% and 7%, support for deploying Move-based smart contracts, and full decentralization of the IOTA ledger. IOTA rebased upgrade is expected to reduce transaction costs, introduce an adaptive fee-burning mechanism, and implement sponsored transactions to abstract transaction fees. The voting process for the Rebased upgrade will last for seven days, concluding on Dec. 9, while the counting process will take an additional seven days, ending on Dec. 16. IOTA’s rally comes as the altcoin market is gaining momentum, as evidenced by the Altcoin Season Index at 81, indicating that many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This surge aligns with heightened optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reaching 76, signaling strong bullish sentiment prevailing in the market.

After IOTA’s recent surge, analysts now predict more gains for the altcoin According to pseudo-anonymous analysts Team LAMBO Charts, IOTA has broken out of a large falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal in technical analysis, and has also breached a major resistance level at $0.40. They predict the altcoin could surge to $0.70 in the short term, followed by a rally to $1 , with a much more bullish mid-term target of $2.60—which would represent a 430% hike from the current price level. Meanwhile, another market commentator observed that IOTA has broken out after two years of accumulation. He anticipates further gains for the altcoin as whales start rotating recent profits from other altcoins into IOTA. Sharing a three-day price chart, he predicted that IOTA could rise to $3.50, provided it successfully breaches the $1 level in the short term. IOTA could pullback before its next move IOTA price, 50-day and 200-day EMA — Dec. 3 | Source: crypto.news On the daily chart, IOTA has moved above both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at $0.1914 and $0.1710, respectively, which have recently formed a golden cross, which can mean a major upside for the altcoin in the near future. IOTA RSI and Stochastic Oscillator chart — Dec. 3 | Source: crypto.news However, the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have reached overbought levels, suggesting that a pullback is likely. Therefore, the altcoin could retreat to retest the support at $0.30 before resuming its upward rally. The next major resistance is at $1, a level IOTA failed to breach on two consecutive attempts in 2022. A breakout above this resistance could propel the altcoin to retest $1.49, its peak from December 2021.

Ripple’s XRP led the altcoin rally by soaring to a yearly high of $2.80. Other altcoins like DOGE, XLM, ENS, and HBAR also saw impressive gains. This increased activity coincided with South Korea’s decision to delay crypto taxation until 2027. Meanwhile, DWF Labs announced its relocation to Abu Dhabi to expand its Web3 footprint, and Coinbase withdrew its application to enter Turkey’s growing crypto market. South Korean Investors Dive Into Altcoins South Korea's crypto market experienced a remarkable surge after retail trading volumes reached $18 billion in 24 hours. This allowed the crypto market to outpace the nation’s entire stock market by 22%, according to a Dec. 2 report by 10x Research. Markus Thielen, the founder of 10x Research, shared that this was the second-highest trading volume of the year for South Korean retail investors, driven largely by high-momentum altcoins. Among the standout performers, Ripple’s XRP accounted for about $6.3 billion of the trading volume, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) at $1.6 billion, Stellar (XLM) at $1.3 billion, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at $900 million, and Hedera (HBAR) at $800 million. Thielen noticed that these tokens, which are often referred to as “dino coins” by crypto natives because of their longstanding presence in the market, saw big gains over the past week. XRP, ENS , and HBAR surged by about 89%, 74%, and 152%, respectively. BTC funding rate vs Korea crypto trading volumes (Source: 10xResearch ) The report also shed some light on a divergence between Bitcoin's relatively mild funding rate, sitting at 15% annualized, and the explosive trading activity in altcoins. Thielen interpreted this as a strong indicator that the crypto market entered an ”alt season,” where momentum-driven trends dominate trading. Ripple’s XRP has been at the forefront of this rally after it climbed from $0.50 to a new yearly high of $2.80 in just a month. This growth propelled XRP to become the third-largest crypto asset by market cap after it jumped past both Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT). XRP’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) South Korea Delays Crypto Tax to 2027 The rise in altcoin trading may be related to the news that South Korea's crypto tax launch was delayed yet again, and is now set to take effect in January of 2027. The decision was announced after lawmakers reached an agreement to postpone the measure for an additional two years. The ruling People’s Power Party (PPP) secured the delay despite opposition from the Democratic Party (DP), which wanted to amend the tax plan. The DP's proposal to raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders to 50 million won (or approximately $36,000) failed to gain traction, and left the government’s original amendment intact. DP floor leader Park Chan-dae announced the agreement at a Dec. 1 press conference , and mentioned that there is a need for more institutional preparation before taxing crypto traders. Park’s comments agreed with earlier statements from DP leader Lee Jae-myung, who argued that crypto taxation was not yet systematically feasible. The decision now allows the DP to redirect its focus to other legislative battles, including the taxation of dividend income and inheritance tax reforms. Park Chan-dae speaking at the Dec.1 press conference This latest delay was the third time South Korea’s crypto tax was postponed since lawmakers initially approved it in December of 2020. It was originally set to launch in January of 2021, but the tax’s implementation was first pushed back to January 2023, then to January 2025, and now to 2027. The DP recently tried to adhere to the 2025 timeline while raising the tax threshold to align with stock market trading rules, claiming that the majority of investors would avoid taxation under their proposal. However, the PPP resisted these efforts and prevented the rival bill from moving forward. The repeated delays caused a lot of frustration among South Korean crypto traders. One investor even called the situation a “complete mess” and blamed both the government and opposition for poor handling of the issue. However, many crypto investors still welcome the tax postponement. Abu Dhabi Becomes DWF Labs' New Home Crypto is making headlines in other countries as well. Well known Web3 venture capitalist and crypto market maker, DWF Labs, announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Abu Dhabi, UAE. The move was confirmed by founder and CEO Andrei Grachev on X, and its main goal will be to improve the firm's involvement in real-world assets (RWA) and to expand financial services across the Middle East. The company's structure already includes regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, and Switzerland. Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which are both part of the UAE, have been competing to attract businesses by offering unique regulatory frameworks and economic zones. DWF Labs is currently listed as an ecosystem partner of Dubai’s Crypto Centre in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), which houses a number of major crypto companies like Bybit, Solana, and Binance. Ripple also operates in the UAE from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Here it benefits from tailored digital asset regulations introduced earlier this year. Abu Dhabi’s virtual asset ecosystem is concentrated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), which is a financial hub known for its independent legal framework based on English law and its progressive crypto regulations. It was first introduced in 2018. The ADGM also recently adopted comprehensive DLT Foundations Regulations in 2023. Companies like Blockdaemon, M2, Laser Digital, and even traditional financial giants like BlackRock have established operations there. DWF Labs emerged in 2022 as an offshoot of a high-frequency trading firm, and boasts an impressive portfolio that is valued between $72 billion and $77 billion. It also consists of over 700 projects. Coinbase Abandons Turkish Crypto Expansion Plans Meanwhile, Coinbase withdrew its pre-application to enter the Turkish crypto market, according to documents released by the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB). The company initially joined more than 90 other enterprises seeking entry into Turkey’s growing crypto market but now requested a liquidation of its application. The reasons behind Coinbase’s decision have not been revealed yet. A Coinbase spokesperson stated that the company routinely evaluates markets for expansion, and mentioned that its strategy is guided by market conditions, regulatory environments, and internal priorities. This aligns with Coinbase’s mission to deliver accessible and secure crypto services globally. Coinbase applied for entry into the Turkish market in August, and joined other well known crypto firms like KuCoin and Gate.io. However, by the end of November, at least 14 companies, including Coinbase and Bitget, withdrew their applications. Despite these withdrawals, Turkey is still a major player in the crypto space. It ranks as the fourth-largest market globally by trading volume and holds the 11th spot on Chainalysis’s 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index .",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 09:43:45

SEC drops a bombshell by appointing Jorge Tenreiro to Chief Litigation Counsel, a move that signals the agency’s commitment to strict crypto oversight. Recently Tenreiro has updated his profile as SEC’s Chief Litigation Officer. Tenreiro is widely recognized for his aggressive enforcement tactics in the crypto space, and this promotion comes at a critical moment as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. After the US selling Bitcoins, this major change in the SEC’s front is a sign that Trump’s presidential tenure to make crypto a leading investment asset in the US will not be easy. Here’s what it means for you! A Tough Enforcer for Crypto Tenreiro’s track record with the SEC underscores his approach to crypto regulation. Previously, he led the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, where he oversaw some of the SEC’s most contentious cases. His role in the Ripple lawsuit, where the SEC alleged XRP was an unregistered security, solidified his reputation as a key figure in shaping crypto enforcement. He also supervised cases that resulted in a $30 million settlement with Kraken and initiated legal action against Coinbase, two of the most significant crypto exchanges in the U.S. What Tenreiro’s Promotion Means for Crypto Notably, this promotion gives Tenreiro even more authority, making him a central figure in deciding how the SEC handles upcoming crypto cases. Despite hopes for more favorable regulations under Trump’s administration, Tenreiro’s appointment suggests the SEC won’t ease up on its hardline approach. His focus will likely remain on enforcing securities laws, targeting token offerings, ICOs, and market manipulation, and ensuring compliance across the board. Community Reaction Prominent crypto lawyer John E. Deaton has voiced strong criticism of Jorge Tenreiro, the newly appointed Chief Litigation Counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Responding to a post by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, Deaton labeled Tenreiro as the prime example of a lawyer crypto firms should avoid hiring. Alderoty had earlier urged the crypto community to distance itself from attorneys involved in SEC lawsuits against crypto firms or those who supported such legal actions. The remarks highlight growing tensions between the SEC and the crypto industry as debates over regulatory approaches and enforcement actions intensify. Ripple Case Sets the Tone In this regard, the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit remains a landmark case, not just for Ripple but for the entire industry. If the SEC wins, it could set a precedent for treating many cryptocurrencies as securities, subjecting them to stricter regulations. On the other hand, a Ripple victory could force the SEC to rethink its strategy. Tenreiro’s leadership in this case and others like it will be crucial in defining how crypto will be sustained in the U.S. For the crypto industry, this new chapter is a mixed bag. While regulatory clarity under Trump could boost innovation, Tenreiro’s leadership shows that companies can still expect a watchful eye from the SEC.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 09:43:47

WisdomTree submitted its S-1 registration form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), becoming the fourth firm to do so. The filing adds to the bullish sentiment XRP has enjoyed in recent weeks. XRP ETF Fillings Pile Up On Dec. 2, WisdomTree submitted a Form S-1 filing for its WisdomTree XRP fund which seeks to provide investors exposure to the price of XRP by issuing shares that will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. As the filing detailed, Coinbase will act as the fund’s prime execution agent and XRP custodian. “Coinbase serves as the XRP custodian and prime execution agent for several competing exchange-traded XRP products and … plays a critical role in supporting the U.S. spot XPR exchange-traded product ecosystem,” the filing reads. Moreover, Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the administrator for the proposed trust.

XRP ETF filing #4… https://t.co/pekqC0Vcs6 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 2, 2024 Hopes Surge For U.S. XRP ETFs Under Trump Regime The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC could delay XRP ETF applications from hitting Wall Street fast enough. In October, the SEC unleashed a last-minute appeal , challenging a July 2023 court ruling that found that XRP sales on secondary markets to investors did not qualify as securities transactions. Ripple filed its cross-appeal soon afterward in response to the SEC’s legal move. With SEC chair Gary Gensler on the way out as pro-crypto President-elect Trump assumes office, XRP backers believe that regulatory clarity is coming, and that will set the stage for a spot XRP ETF despite the ongoing appeal. And investor optimism is showing: WisdomTree’s filing comes as XRP’s price rockets. The asset hit a seven-year high price of $2.81 per coin on Monday. It’s now trading for $2.70, according to CoinGecko data, a 24-hour jump of over 32%.

The surge has not only boosted XRP’s market cap but also its network growth as seen with its increasing wallet count. XRP Network Growth Soars According to Santiment’s latest analysis , XRP has seen an impressive increase in network growth, with 22,357 new wallets created on Sunday alone, marking a notable milestone for the XRP Ledger. This uptick highlighted strong crowd engagement and growing utility amidst recent political shifts, stablecoin approval rumors, and ETF interest that appears to have pushed its market cap above $154 billion. While the influx of retail activity may lead to short-term price fluctuations, the long-term implications of such network expansion are promising for XRP’s adoption and sustainability. XRP has attracted fresh gains of more than 10% in the past 24 hours that briefly pushed its price above $2.60, but experts predict that a new peak is unlikely to transpire this year. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BINPAY, said, “XRP was in an accumulation phase for nearly three years – around 900 days. The duration of such a phase often determines the strength of the subsequent rally, so it’s no surprise that from November 4, XRP has surged around 404%. It remains uncertain if it will be enough to push XRP to a new all-time high; an update to its ATH could potentially occur in the coming year.” Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlighted the critical role of Coinbase whales in driving XRP’s ongoing rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium for XRP has ranged between 3% and 13%, highlighting significant buying activity by large investors on the platform. This contrasts sharply with Upbit, a major Korean exchange known for its strong XRP trading volumes, which has shown no significant premium during this surge. The disparity suggests that while Korean retail investors maintain steady interest, institutional players on Coinbase are likely the primary catalysts behind XRP’s recent momentum, shaping its price trajectory in the current market. SHIB, BAND Trails Behind XRP in Network Growth Several altcoins have followed XRP’s suit. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Band Protocol (BAND) recorded notable network growth over the weekend. SHIB recorded 7,548 new wallets, while BAND saw 35 new wallets, a remarkable increase relative to its usual activity levels. These surges in wallet creation reflect heightened interest and participation in their respective ecosystems. However, as with XRP, such network growth is accompanied by potential volatility.

XRP price nears $3 after soaring 425% in a month,https://finbold.com/not-a-typo-xrp-price-nears-3-after-soaring-425-in-a-month/,"Once trading at a modest $0.50 on November 3 with a market cap of $28.56 billion, XRP has skyrocketed to $2.66 as of December 3, a jaw-dropping 429% surge in just one month, with its market cap swelling to an extraordinary $151.4 billion, as per Finbold market cap data . XRP 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold This meteoric ascent has catapulted XRP to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It’s not just climbing—it’s dominating. Over the past week alone, XRP has gained an eye-popping 88.87%, with a 12.31% increase in the last 24 hours. The token’s trading volume has also exploded, reaching $42.61 billion in the past 24 hours, up 30.37%. Outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP is comfortably trading above its 200-day simple moving average and has recorded 20 green days in the last 30—a 67% success rate. XRP whale activity The driving force behind XRP’s incredible rally is a confluence of factors, starting with unprecedented whale activity. On-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that XRP whale transactions have hit record levels, indicating that major investors are making significant bets on the token’s future. $XRP Whale Activity Hits All-Time High! “ #XRP whale activity is at an all-time high, indicating that XRP has now been embraced as a valuable asset by whales.” – By @theKriptolik More details 👇 https://t.co/OfKdPLUkn0 pic.twitter.com/bsukMB4vFP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 2, 2024 When whales move, the market listens—and this time, the message is loud and clear: XRP is being embraced as a core asset in the portfolios of high-net-worth investors. Adding to the bullish sentiment, institutional interest has hit new highs. The $100 billion asset manager WisdomTree recently filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF, a move that could open the floodgates for even more institutional capital. Such developments are fueling speculation that XRP’s utility is no longer just theoretical but a core component of the crypto industry’s future. With XRP breaking past critical support at $2.37, the psychological $3.00 resistance level is now in sight. Analysts agree that clearing this milestone could trigger even more explosive gains, particularly as investor enthusiasm continues to swell. You've got to admit, $XRP is a good looking chart. Last time it broke a long wedge pattern it rose another 5,600%!

Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo has suggested that the SEC may soon abandon its lawsuit against Ripple, marking what could be a pivotal moment for XRP. Giancarlo’s comments align with broader optimism surrounding SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s impending resignation in January, a development that has emboldened the crypto market as a whole. The Ripple case has long cast a shadow over XRP, but the tide appears to be turning. If the lawsuit is indeed dropped, it would not only clear the path for Ripple but also signal a potentially more accommodative regulatory environment for crypto in the United States.

Digital asset institutional flows have moved upward in the last two months. These investors rallied in the positive sentiment around the market after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs. ETH funds saw inflows of $634 million, marking a turnaround as investors increased their appetites. The asset remains a top choice for firms due to its staking feature and the approval of its spot ETF products. At the moment, investors are setting sights on a bullish drive on the heels of ETF inflows. Although the ETH price failed to break multiple resistance levels like Bitcoin, an uptick is still within the grasp of bulls. Several analysts opine that Ethereum will eventually notch its bull run , similar to Bitcoin, which is leading the altcoin season. Decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers mark another positive attraction for investors. ETH monthly inflows stand at $1.4 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) move to $16.2 billion. Crypto Products Record Weekly Inflows A new CoinShares Weekly Fund Flows report shows total market gains totaling $270 million, a drop from previous weeks after the United States elections. This figure has pushed yearly numbers to $37.3 billion while total AUM soars above $152 billion. “ while the flows displayed an unusual dichotomy between assets within the asset class. Since the launch of options on US ETFs, despite their high initial volumes, we have not seen a commensurate rise in ETP volumes at US$22bn last week, compared to US$34bn the week prior. Total inflows this year so far are at a new record of US$37.3bn,” CoinShares explained. Bitcoin Posts Outflows After several weeks of positive movements, Bitcoin saw $457 million outflows, reducing gains in the last 30 days to $6.2 billion. The market leader recorded massive entrants in the market as bulls project possible crypto regulations in the United States. Bitcoin price soared to multiple all-time highs trading above $99K before a price retracement. Altcoins generally moved sideways, although Ethereum and XRP led inflows. XRP posted $95 million in inflows, while monthly growth stood at $115 million. Litecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink pulled in slight $0.2 million, $0.9 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.

According to an exclusive Reuters report, crypto firms are included among the companies listed in the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund subject to an investigation by the fund’s ethics council. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, with $1.8 trillion in investments. It owns 1.5% of listed shares in 8,700 companies across the globe. This year, the fund has increased its holdings in crypto exchange, including Coinbase , Block Inc., and Marathon Digital . With Coinbase in particular, the fund owns a 0.83% stake, which is worth around $453 million. “The Council on Ethics in 2025 will take a closer look at companies involved in cryptocurrencies and gambling/casino, where there is a significant risk of money laundering,” said the council in a drafted document filed to the country’s finance ministry. Gambling firms that the fund has invested in are also under scrutiny for their high risks for money-laundering. You might also like: Norway Central Bank to decide on digital currency recommendation next year Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s Council of Ethics is tasked with probing companies the fund has invested in to ensure that they operate respectably from a business standpoint. If they do not, the council will recommend the fund to divest from those companies or place them on a public watch list. So far, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has excluded 189 companies due to ethical violations, including aircraft manufacturing companies Airbus and Boeing for creating nuclear weapons as well as Glencore and RWE for producing coal or coal-based energy. Other reasons why the fund might decide to divest from companies include violations related to human rights, environmental damage, corruption and production of tobacco and canabis. The council is also going to investigate shoe manufacturers such as Nike, Adidas, Asics and Puma for potential violations regarding inhumane working conditions, ranging from long hours and low salaries to the workers’ inability to form unions. Even if the crypto firms listed in the fund aren’t found to have violated any money-laundering standards, those firms could very well be tried on the grounds of environmental damage. In April, Norwegian regulators introduced a new framework that would crack down on crypto mining in an attempt to limit or altogether eliminate crypto mining in the nation. Norway’s ministers have voiced their concerns in regards to the environmental impact of crypto mining, citing its greenhouse gas emissions as incompatible with Norway’s sustainability goals.

This also marks a trend-reversal rally, gaining momentum as it surpasses the $0.050 psychological mark. With the new bullish rally at play, will the VET prices reclaim the $0.10 psychological mark? Let’s find out in our recent VET price action analysis. VET Price Analysis In the weekly chart, the VET price action showcases a long-coming resistance trendline, keeping the bullish growth under check. This resistance trendline started as the 2021 bull market started to lose momentum. Tradingview During this, the VET price fell to a low of $0.01317 in June 2023. However, since then, the VET price action has started to form a higher low formation, resulting in a support trendline. Therefore, the VET price movement has given rise to a symmetrical triangle pattern. In the recent bullish turnaround, the price surge from Nov. 5 resulted in a 256% rally. Starting from $0.018, the VET price has reached the current market price of $0.066. This has resulted in five consecutive bullish candles and surpassed the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.045. Further, it results in a new 52-week high at $0.070 and increases the chances of an uptrend continuation. VeChain Technicals and Price Targets The bullish turnaround has resulted in a merger between the 50- and 200-week EMA lines, which increases the possibility of a golden crossover. Furthermore, the MACD and signal lines have regained a positive alignment with the bullish histograms resurfacing. Hence, the technical indicators project a bullish extension of the VET rally. Based on the trend-based Fibonacci levels, the upside price target for VeChain stands at $0.1846, which could result in a new all-time high beyond $0.2823. On the flip side, the $0.050 will likely remain a strong support. Read More: VeChain Price Prediction: Will VET Price Hit $0.50? FAQs 1. What is the next target for VeChain (VET)?

According to a leak reported by Fox Business , Ripple is anticipated to launch RLUSD in the American digital finance market in the coming days after months of testing. The forthcoming stablecoin will bolster Ripple’s position in the U.S. digital market and the wider stablecoin ecosystem. RLUSD To Reportedly Go Live On Dec. 4 The New York Department of Financial Services is reportedly set to approve Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Sources revealed to Fox Business that the company expects to roll out the new offering as early as December 4. Unlike XRP, which has suffered regulatory setbacks in the U.S. and price instabilities, the RLUSD stablecoin seeks to maintain a steady value tied to the U.S. dollar. This stability makes it much more attractive to individuals and institutions looking for a safe and reliable digital asset for transactions. Winning approval from the NYDFS, one of the strictest financial regulators, would strengthen RLUSD’s credibility. According to @EleanorTerrett 's recent article, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is close to approving RLUSD. This approval highlights Ripple’s dedication to operating within a strict regulatory framework. 2/11 https://t.co/NyQDaMMc1d — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) November 29, 2024 If the NYDFS indeed gives its blessing, the RLUSD stablecoin could revolutionize Ripple’s position in digital finance. This would enhance its competitiveness with other stablecoin issuers and fortify its standing in the U.S. market. Ripple’s Grand Foray Into The Stablecoin Market As you may recall, Ripple initially announced RLUSD in April 2024. The asset, the company said at the time, would be fully backed by U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and “other cash equivalents.” Then in August, the blockchain payments firm kicked off testing of the stablecoin on its own XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the second biggest crypto network, Ethereum. Ripple eased investors’ fears by revealing that it would use both the RLUSD stablecoin and XRP in its near-instant international payments solution to serve its customers worldwide and significantly improve their experience. Notably, Ripple is teaming up with Uphold, Moonpay, and Bitstamp to introduce the stablecoin. These strategic collaborations will promote the asset’s adoption by customers by leveraging the top exchanges’ huge user bases and expertise in digital payments. The price of XRP has been climbing since Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6 as investors anticipate a more lenient regulatory environment under his pro-crypto administration. Further gains were fueled by the revelation that crypto foe Gary Gensler will step down from his role as the Securities and Exchange Commission chair in January, which could signal that a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund is now a matter of when not if. Moreover, the forthcoming RLUSD approval could help propel XRP above the longstanding all-time peak of $3.40.

In contrast, numerous altcoins have outperformed, charting mindblowing surges, such as ADA, AVAX, TRX, LINK, HBAR, and many others. BTC Stalls at $95K It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency slumped hard and fell below $91,000, which became its most violent correction since the Trump-induced rally started in early November. However, the asset didn’t stay there for long and started to recover ground in the following days. The weekly peak came on Friday as BTC neared $99,000. Nevertheless, the bears managed to defend that level and pushed bitcoin down to approximately $96,500 during the weekend. Monday morning started with a surge to $98,000 but that was short-lived as BTC plunged to $95,000 almost immediately. Another rollercoaster followed suit with bitcoin jumping to $97,500 before it was driven south once again to $94,500. Despite its recovery attempts since then, BTC now trades just inches above $95,000. This decline means that BTC’s market cap has remained below $1.9 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has been pushed south hard. The metric is down to just 52% after peaking at nearly 60% weeks ago, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 3.12.2024. Source: TradingView These Alts Do Good The past few days belonged to XRP and yesterday was no exception as the asset skyrocketed by another 25% at one point and neared $3 for the first time in almost seven years. Although it has retraced since then to $2.6, its market cap of $150 billion still places it as the third-largest cryptocurrency by that metric. Other massive gainers over the past 24 hours include ADA, which has soared by 17%, AVAX (11%), TRX (14%), DOT (16%), LINK (27%), SUI (15%), HBAR (42%), and quite a few others. The total crypto market cap has gained $70 billion since yesterday as it has all gone to the alts. The metric is above $3.6 trillion once again. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

It sounds pessimistic, doesn’t it? Considering the optimistic nature of the current cryptocurrency market scenario, there seems to be no reason for the analyst to express a pessimistic view. Yet, the analyst sticks to his ‘not-so-welcoming’ view. Should altcoin enthusiasts be worried? A New Kind of Altcoin Season One thing that everyone agrees on right now is that the crypto market is going to witness an altcoin season soon. The thing that triggers disagreement is: will all the altcoins benefit from this season? Many, like Ki Young Ju, hold the depressing opinion that only a select few altcoins will benefit from this alt season. Bitcoin’s Separation From Altcoins Until recently, the correlation between bitcoin and altcoin was strong. To prove that the Bitcoin market no longer shares this tight connection with the rest of the crypto market, the prime argument that Young Ju puts forth is the one highlighting the creation of its own paper-based Layer 2 ecosystem by Bitcoin using ETFs, funds and similar tools. Breaking the Altcoin-Bitcoin Correlation The general belief is that altcoins move together with bitcoin. In the scenario of a weaker correlation, the belief is simply irrelevant. Anyway, the best thing about this new trend of altcoins breaking this correlation is that a few altcoins are showing the capacity to exhibit independent trends. The crypto expert also acknowledges this new trend in the altcoin market. In the last 30 days, XRP has surged by 423%, Dogecoin by 174.6%, Cardano by 272.9%, Avalanche by 115.2%, Stellar by 485.6%, Chainlink by 128.9%, Polkadot by 158.7%, Hedera by 689.4%, Pepe by 143.9%, and Cronos by 182.45. Survival Strategies for Altcoins There is a way out of this trap for the altcoin market. Young Ju presents two options: Either develop paper-wrapped products, like Bitcoin ETFs, or build a real internet money system using stablecoins or Bitcoin. The funniest part is that both these options look equally tough. Anyway, there is no option. The altcoin market has to make a choice.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|CRO,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 10:05:20

Shiba Inu To See Double-Digit Gain Currently, SHIB is facing a crucial resistance level of around $0.00003050, and analysts are closely watching how the coin reacts. According to Shib Knight , a well-known crypto analyst, the price chart is forming a bullish “cup and handle” pattern. If SHIB successfully breaks above this resistance, it could soar, potentially reaching levels above $0.000045, marking an 83% rally. This follows patterns of past sharp upward trends after periods of steady consolidation. In addition to the cup and handle formation, SHIB’s chart also shows a Golden Cross, a pattern indicating a potential bullish trend. The 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are also signaling a bullish crossover, which further supports the theory of an upward move, driving SHIB’s price to experience double-digit gains. Shiba Inu Network Growth Another factor driving Shiba Inu to surge more is its growing popularity, as shown by its network growth. Over the past week, 7,548 new wallets have been created, with significant increases in key address metrics. Santiment data highlights this surge, with new addresses up by 62.54% and active addresses rising by 57.88%. Meanwhile, this growing interest suggests Shiba Inu could gain more popularity in the long run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bullish Sentiments for XRP & ADA May Fade Soon-Here’s Why FOMO May Not Work This Bull Run , Whale Burn 2.022 Billion Shib Token In addition to this, an anonymous whale burned over 2 billion SHIB tokens , pushing the burn rate up by more than 3,160%. This reduction in supply could also contribute to the price rally, especially as Shib’s price is trying to recover and break above the $0.00003 level after dropping from $0.00003316 on Dec 02. With growing interest and more coins being burned, Shiba Inu might soon double its price if it breaks through key resistance points. FAQs How high will Shiba Inu go in 2025?

This is primarily due to the fading opportunities of speculative investments attached to memes and the growing demand for coins with established use cases and thriving communities. Rexas Finance has risen up the ranks and is seen as the token that will take DOGE’s place in getting investors’ eyes. RXS is not a simple cryptocurrency; it’s a universe of brilliance that seeks to change the world by financing and monetizing true assets. Rexas Finance has the wind at its back, registering strong presale figures and entering the market with new concepts, certainty, and safety to become the leader of the new wave in the blockchain industry. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenization of Real-World Assets Rexas Finance is redefining the blockchain industry with an emphasis on digitizing physical assets (RWA). Rexas enables everyone to build wealth by allowing fractional ownership of expensive assets such as land, rare goods, and other valuables such as agriculture. RXS uses various features to create a safe, rapid, and public medium for 21st-century investors through blockchain. Rexas Finance achieved amazing success during its presale phases, collecting over $19 million and moving 278 million tokens in eight stages. The eighth stage bears the price of $0.10 for RXS, which is reasonable for long-term players. The design of these strategies is to cater to varied investors while gaining steam ahead of the anticipated tier-one exchange listing in 2025. Considering the projected launch price of the coin at $0.20, first-round participants are poised to realize two-fold returns on investment right after listing their coins. Rexas Finance has five core elements as the engines of its ecosystem that make it a one-stop shop for blockchain investing: 1. Rexas Estate: Investments in real estate are now possible through property tokenization. Investors interested in having a share of the real estate do not need to own property in total but only a part of it, thus lowering entry barriers into the market. 2. Rexas Launchpad: Designed to enhance several new blockchain projects, the Rexas Launchpad platform offers a fair fundraising approach while giving RXS holders the opportunity to invest early in companies they believe in. 3. Rexas Token Builder: By feeding primary elements into this construction module, companies and individuals can generate tokens backed by blockchain without requiring high-level development skills, enabling effortless asset tokenization. 4. Rexas GenAI: The AI-enabled platform offers NFT creators essential insights and assistive tools to improve and optimize workflows within the digital asset domain, resulting in increased productivity and creativity. 5. Rexas Treasury: A multi-chain yield optimizer, the Treasury allows users to deposit crypto assets and generate great interest while enabling them to switch between blockchain networks. Tokenomics Rexas Finance has developed its tokenomics to demonstrate long-term viability and growth. The total number of RXS tokens does not exceed 1 billion. Of this amount, 42.5% is earmarked for the presale to enable early investors to purchase the asset. Additionally, 22.5% has been set aside for staking rewards to encourage holders with a long-term view. Fifteen percent comes from liquidity, ensuring trading remains stable, while lower proportions are allocated for treasury, marketing, collaborations, team bonuses, and gifts. This allocation simultaneously funds the project’s growth and serves the needs of its community, which is highly beneficial for the project’s future prospects. Listing and CertiK Audit Rexas Finance is listed on top cryptocurrency monitoring platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. This higher visibility and exposure make it easier for investors interested in RXS to track its performance. Furthermore, Rexas Finance has completed a SOC 2 audit through CertiK. This bolsters investor trust in the platform’s smart contracts and infrastructure, ensuring that the project can be executed properly. Community Engagement and Giveaway Rexas Finance also aims to build and maintain a robust community. To encourage more users to join and increase activity in the ecosystem, the platform will hold a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will each receive RXS tokens worth $50,000, offering an exciting opportunity to be part of this project. To win the giveaway, interested investors must visit the official Rexas Finance platform and complete tasks like following REXAS social media channels, reposting informational content, or inviting friends. The more tasks completed, the higher the chances of winning, making the giveaway engaging. How to Buy RXS Tokens The process of acquiring RXS Tokens is straightforward: 1. You should download compatible blockchain wallets, including ERC-20 wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 2. Acquire either ETH or USDT from the trading platform that deals in cryptocurrencies. 3. Transfer the funds into your wallet. 4. Visit the Rexas Finance official site and link your wallet via WalletConnect or another supported tool. 5. Specify how many RXS tokens you want to buy, approve the transaction, and pay the gas fees. After the transaction is completed, your RXS tokens will be sent to your wallet, allowing you to use them or stake them within the Rexas network. Conclusion Unlike Dogecoin, its meme-coin predecessor, RXS has the potential to create a better future. Rexas Finance is a project designed to tokenize real estate and is built to last. Its innovative features focus on tokenizing real-world assets and performance during the presale phase, making it a standout project in the crypto market. With its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, CertiK audit, and community-driven $1 million giveaway, RXS is well-positioned to introduce the next generation of blockchain technology. While all investments carry risks, RXS is an exciting opportunity for investors looking beyond meme coins. Visit the Rexas Finance website now and join the presale for this project.

XRP Price Prediction Amid Whale Accumulation,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-high-can-xrp-go-xrp-price-prediction-amid-whale-accumulation/,"The post How High Can XRP Go? XRP Price Prediction Amid Whale Accumulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The last month was simply special for XRP; a steep growth from $0.51311 to $1.95710 in just 30 days was definitely unusual, as well as exciting. This development brings to a vital question: what will be the future of XRP – the most controversial crypto? And, the story begins here! XRP’s Stunning November Performance The talk of the town is XRP’s exceptional performance in November. The XRP market truly deserves this newly gained attention and even this late appreciation, for the fact that it outperformed almost all the other top cryptocurrencies last month. How is it even possible for a crypto, which was considered ‘partly filled’ until recently? The 297% rise in November of XRP – the highest monthly return since December 2017 – definitely says a lot about its future potential. At the start of the month, with a price of $0.51311, there were no signs for an impending massive uptrend, other than the general expectation among investors that the US election could overturn the market scenario. On November 5, when the political scenario started to tilt towards Pro-Crypto Leader Donald Trump, the market showed its first sign of growth. Between November 5 and 30, what we saw was a steep climb from just around $0.5 to a few micro points less than the milestone of $2 – which the market achieved on the first day of December itself. Bold XRP Predictions from Top Analysts There is no confusion that the XRP market is unlikely to face any disruption in its upward momentum anytime soon; even during the previous month’s bull cycle, it only faced two corrections, both minor in nature. But how far can the market go up? There are analysts who predict the next target of XRP to be $10. The problem with these exaggerated predictions is that most of them have no digestible reason to support them. Meanwhile, Jacob Canfield’s $6.60 target looks convincing for the simple reason that it has the one element that most of the other predictions lack: a solid reason to support it. Canfield’s prediction is backed by Fibonacci extensions and Bitcoin’s 2017 comparison. Increased Activity in the XRP market from Retail and Whales Who will fuel this predicted growth, retailers or whales? Neither whales nor retailers seem to be ditching the XRP market anytime soon. There are enough indications in the XRP market data that new retail investors are entering the market. Additionally, a recent report says that whale accounts accumulated 679.1M tokens worth $1.6B in three weeks. So, the trend is clear. XRP’s Bullish Momentum and Key Resistance Levels In the last 24 hours, the XRP market has seen a rise of 15.1%. The coming days are not going to be easy for XRP, considering that there is little resistance left on the higher timeframe of the XRP chart. However, the one thing that most XRP enthusiasts agree on is the potential of the XRP to close above the $1.99 mark – to mark its highest yearly close in history.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 11:40:29

This immense activity has generated an estimated $20 million in revenue within a week, highlighting the lucrative potential of these tools.

FatBot changes the game by offering an intuitive design, robust functionality, and attractive incentives, making it accessible and rewarding for experienced traders and newcomers.

This partnership combines expertise and innovation to deliver a tool that meets the highest standards in crypto trading.

Value of BTC trades at No data found for bitcoin on 31 minutes ago, bringing the year-to-date gain from 56% on October 20 to 120% as of December 3. The YTD performance has slumped due to the recent BTC crash. Although many altcoins have shot up over triple digits, Bitcoin is catching up. Ethereum price’s YTD performance is lackluster, stands at 45%, and is well below BTC. Although Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s popularity is due to its first-mover advantage and its being a secure, decentralized network. In addition, many narratives, like digital gold, inflation hedges, and uncorrelated assets, have kept BTC at the forefront of the crypto market since its inception in 2009. Can Bitcoin End 2024 on Positive Note? Industry veterans’ speculation of a bull run post-US elections was right, and Bitcoin is likely to end November 2024 on a positive note. Many even expect a six-digit target for BTC by the end of November, and this is due to the historical returns . History shows that Bitcoin has always performed massively in the fourth quarter. Historical Bitcoin Price Performance With that said, if Bitcoin price hits a new ATH in November or December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which stands at No data found for bitcoin on 31 minutes ago, could finally hit the $2 trillion mark. Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization While Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around No data found for bitcoin on 31 minutes ago, with Ethereum, the duo controls nearly 65% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Despite the seven-month consolidation, Bitcoin’s $1.93 trillion market cap remains strong, anticipating it reaching $2 trillion before 2025. BTC: A composition of 24-hour Trading Volume Being the top crypto has its benefits; more people tend to flock toward the asset. Likewise, BTC’s 24-hour trading volume stands at No data found for bitcoin on 31 minutes ago. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, contributes a major portion of this volume. Binance’s share of BTC’s 24-hour trading volume comprises spot and perpetuals trading. While spot volume hovers around 11%, perpetual volume is 41%. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, etc, follow Binance. Key Bitcoin Upgrades With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, it is necessary for the network to remain secure, decentralized, and scalable. This is possible by upgrading the Bitcoin network regularly. Here are some notable upgrades the Bitcoin network has received or planned to receive since its inception in 2009.

The token’s daily trading volume hit a yearly high of $994 million, signaling increased trader interest and liquidity. Plus, rising open interest indicates more capital is entering the market, fueling new buying activity. This explosive rally has investors buzzing with excitement, driven by institutional activity, market rumors, and broader optimism in the crypto space. Big Money Moving into ONDO One of the key reasons for ONDO’s rise is significant institutional interest. Crypto influencer Grey BTC recently pointed out that Upbit, a major crypto exchange, has been steadily accumulating ONDO for the past five months. Upbit now holds more ONDO than early investors like Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures. This large-scale accumulation signals strong confidence in the token’s potential and has sparked what Grey BTC calls a “clear race” to acquire ONDO. Adding to the hype, the influencer predicted that ONDO could hit $15 by 2025, further boosting investor confidence. Rumors of a Binance Spot Listing Speculation is another major factor. ONDO Futures are already available on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges. Now, investors are speculating about the possibility of a spot listing on Binance. If true, this could make ONDO more accessible to everyday traders, increasing demand and potentially driving its price even higher. Market Metrics Back the Rally The numbers tell an exciting story. ONDO’s trading volume surged by over 300% to $834 million, and Open Interest in ONDO Futures jumped 50% to $297 million. These metrics show that more investors are getting involved, adding momentum to the rally. However, there’s a note of caution. ONDO’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 85, meaning the token is in overbought territory. This could lead to a short-term price pullback. On the flip side, on November 28, ONDO’s Exchange Netflow turned negative, indicating more ONDO tokens are being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited. This movement suggests a supply squeeze is forming, as approximately $4.10 million worth of ONDO has been moved to private wallets over the past week. This reduced availability of ONDO on exchanges, combined with rising demand, could be contributing to the price spike. Why RWA Tokens Are a Big Deal ? Beyond the current rally, as per Phoenix Group, a leading on-chain analytics platform, four cryptocurrencies—OM, PENDLE, ONDO, and POLYX—are currently dominating the Real-World Asset (RWA) market. Moreover, these projects are showing strong weekly trading volumes, reflecting robust activity and notable price fluctuations. Phoenix Group highlights the resilience of these tokens in the market, with ONDO notably benefiting from growing investor interest and tightening supply.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ONDO,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 11:46:12

Besides, the recent comment from Tron founder Justin Sun, calling TRX the “next XRP”, has also triggered discussions in the market, especially after the unprecedented rally of the XRP price recently. Notably, this surge comes amid soaring interest of the market participants towards the digital assets space as well as altcoins. Justin Sun Calls TRX The Next XRP The rally of over 15% in Tron price has caught the eyes of investors today, with a flurry of investors speculating on the potential reasons behind the TRX surge. Notably, a flurry of reasons could have contributed to the recent gains in the crypto’s price. For context, the recent shifting focus towards the altcoins, rising institutional and retail interest towards the token, and others might have contributed to the gains. However, Tron founder Justin Sun has caught the eyes of the traders recently with his recent posts on social media. In a series of X posts, Sun compares TRX with Ripple’s native crypto, XRP, which has fueled discussions in the market. Source: Justin Sun, X For context, the founder has called TRX the “Next XRP”, which has attracted the focus of the XRP community as well as the crypto market enthusiasts. In a separate post, Justin Sun once again echoed a similar sentiment, and said “TRX=XRP”. The comparison with one of the top altcoins , XRP, which has noted a robust rally recently, has fueled discussions in the broader crypto market. Source: Justin Sun, X Meanwhile, the XRP price was one of the top-performing assets in the digital assets space last month. A flurry of positive developments of Ripple, including Gary Gensler’s resignation update, XRP lawsuit advancements, XRP ETF filings by top players, and others, might have contributed to the recent gains. Having said that, the comparison not only gained investors’ attention but also sparked discussions if the Tron price would follow the same path as XRP. TRON Price Rallies TRX price today rallied more than 15% today and exchanged hands at $0.236, while its one-day trading volume skyrocketed 116% to $2.49 billion. Notably, the crypto has noted a jump of 23% over the last seven days, while witnessing a monthly surge of around 44%. Furthermore, TRX Futures Open Interest rose 43% to $184.82 million, suggesting a bullish sentiment hovering in the market. However, the Relative Strength Index of the crypto was at 77, indicating an overbought condition for the asset. Usually, the overbought scenario hints towards a potential short-term pullback, as some investors might book profit due to the massive surge in the asset’s price. Tron (TRX) Price Chart Despite that, many investors appear to be bullish on the crypto, especially after Justin Sun compares Tron with XRP.

XLM however, is now showing signs of exhaustion as its rally to $1 hits a snag. Still, crypto analysts believe that Lumen has room to go as the altcoin season starts. Stellar Price Analysis: Early Signs Of A Bullish Pennant Showing Stellar price was trading at $0.55 on Tuesday, November 3, down by 15% from its highest level in November. On the positive side, the coin is showing signs of forming a bullish pennant chart pattern, which is a popular sign of a continuation. A pennant is characterized by a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. In most periods, this pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout, especially when it is supported by high volume. The XLM price has also moved above the 50-week and 200-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It also remains above the key psychological level at $0.50 and the resistance level at $0.4400, its highest level in November 2021. Stellar’s Market Value to Relative Value (MVRV) has slipped to 2.7 but remains significantly above its lowest level this year. The indicator remains below the extreme level of 6, which it reached in 2021. XLM Price Chart Therefore, more Stellar Lumens gains will be confirmed if it blasts above the year-to-date high of $0.6347. A move above that level will be a signal that there are more bulls left in the market, who will be keen to push it to the all-time high of $0.80. A move to $1 will be confirmed if it rallies above that resistance level. On the flip side, a drop below the support at $0.4402, its November 2021 high will invalidate the bullish view. Such a move will raise the odds of mean reversion, a situation where an asset drops to its mean. If this happens, Stellar price may drop to the key support at $0.20, its highest level in July 2023. XRP To Determine The Next XLM Price move Whether the Stellar lumens price jumps to $1 will depend on the next price action of Ripple . That is because the two cryptocurrencies often have a close correlation since they are in the payments industry. Also, Stellar was started by Jed McCaleb , a Ripple co-founder. The two coins have jumped because of the recent Donald Trump victory and the impending changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts expect that Ripple’s legal tribulations will end soon, opening for a potential XRP ETF. Similarly, Canary Capital has already filed for a spot XLM ETF, which could be approved in 2025, leading to more institutional investment. Therefore, the odds of the XLM token hitting $1 will increase when Ripple continues its bullish trend.

Fuse , the payments-focused blockchain, announced its strategic partnership with Stargate , a cross-chain asset bridge, to integrate the latter’s functionalities into the Fuse ecosystem. The integration aims to enhance interoperability across the multichain networks on Fuse and its overall liquidity, for more efficient business payments across users. According to the team statement, Fuse will leverage Stargate’s Hydra technology, to deliver seamless, secure and cost-efficient digital asset transfers in its ecosystem. Fuse Network users will be able to transfer native assets cross-chain while accessing Stargate’s unified liquidity pools with instant guaranteed finality. Enhancing Multichain Asset Transfers on Fuse Stargate allows users and DApps to swap 1:1 native assets cross-chain by accessing Stargate’s unified liquidity pools. In addition, users can add liquidity to the platform’s Omnichain protocol and earn stablecoin rewards for every transfer made using Stargate. The partnership with Stargate will open a new channel for Fuse users to enjoy these benefits and more, the statement adds. Fuse Network will be able to expand its ecosystem and offer users a frictionless experience for transferring digital assets across multiple blockchains. Notwithstanding, by utilizing Stargate’s unified liquidity model, Fuse eliminates the need for traditional liquidity pools, supporting a more streamlined and scalable approach to cross-chain transactions. This is in line with Fuse’s mission to provide global, borderless and cost-friendly payment systems to businesses and individuals without facing liquidity hiccups. Leveraging Stargate’s Hydra technology will remove the complexities of transferring liquidity across the Fuse network while enhancing the platform’s scalability, usability, and simplicity in making payments. It also aligns with Fuse’s broader roadmap, which includes significant upgrades such as the Fuse Ember transition to modular architecture and zkEVM compatibility. Cross-chain Bridges Set To Boost Liquidity on Fuse By reducing the challenges of transferring assets, Fuse is set to benefit from added liquidity on its platform. The Hydra technology will allow Fuse users to bridge key digital assets such as USDC, USDT, and WETH from over 20 chains directly onto the Fuse Network. As alluded to, the 1:1 swapping model backs every native asset in locked reserves on Stargate’s core blockchains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, and Arbitrum. This ensures users' funds are secure and enhances reliability without relying on dedicated Fuse liquidity pools. Moreover, Hydra’s composable asset model allows users to interact with various decentralized applications on supported blockchains (or the omnichain ecosystem). This expands the innovations on Fuse while enhancing the utility and accessibility of the Fuse Network. The ability to tap into unified liquidity through Stargate’s multi-chain infrastructure eliminates the need for separate liquidity pathways and reduces reliance on incentivized liquidity programs, creating a more efficient system for users and developers. More importantly, the partnership will remove any fees or slippage while transferring assets across Stargate’s core chains to Fuse, allowing users to make high-volume trades and transactions seamlessly. Finally, the integration of Stargate will allow the majority of DeFi liquidity on Fuse to migrate to Stargate-backed assets without the need for additional capital reserves or complex governance decisions.

While people were wondering who Trump would nominate to be SEC chair instead of Gensler following this announcement, a new report came from FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett. The Fox reporter said sources said Trump will announce a candidate to replace Gary Gensler tomorrow. Who Can Be Nominated for SEC Chair? While there are many names that could replace Gary Gensler, the most prominent candidate is former SEC member Paul Atkins. Other than Paul Atkins, Robinhood Chief Legal Officer Dan Gallagher, Willkie Law Firm Partner Robert Stebbins, and current SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda are among the popular candidates. While there is curiosity about who Trump will nominate to be SEC chairman, the person he nominates will need to be approved by the Senate to head the agency. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Is Resigning! Gary Gensler has served as the institution’s 33rd president since April 17, 2021. However, he will step down from his position on January 20, 2025. Gensler has increased oversight of the cryptocurrency sector during his tenure, imposing sanctions on many cryptocurrency companies for fraud and securities registration violations.

According to a weekly report , BTC could maintain upward momentum this month and rally past $100,000 if short-term holder (STH) demand can meet long-term holder (LTH) supply. At the time of writing, BTC was changing hands at $94,800, following a week of consolidation between $90,000 and $98,000. Can STH Demand Meet LTH Supply? Bitcoin long-term holders have begun to capitalize on increased BTC demand in the market to distribute their held supply on a large scale. Heightened BTC demand from institutional investors and the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market drove the latest rally. The LTH supply recorded a peak in September, and since then, this cohort of market participants has distributed roughly 508,990 BTC. While this figure represents a significant volume, Bitfinex revealed that it is smaller than the 934,000 BTC LTHs spent during the March rally, which led to bitcoin’s high of $73,666. The last eight months saw LTHs re-accumulate after distributing their bitcoins before the halving. However, with the resumption of a redistribution phase among this cohort of investors, STHs have been buying and accumulating rapidly. Per Bitfinex’s analysis, a reduction in the LTH-held supply is expected at this stage of the bull cycle. BTC Needs ETF Inflows And Strong Demand As LTHs continue to take profits, BTC needs positive ETF flows and strong demand from marginal buyers in the short term to maintain upward momentum. This is because the supply entering the Bitcoin market from LTHs has been sustained for the past two weeks, and a weak spot demand would fail to absorb the supply, resulting in a significant price correction. It is worth mentioning that the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which measures the profit margin at which this investor cohort is selling their BTC, signals the market is not near the top. In past cycles, this metric has shown LTHs selling at an average profit of 3.5x at market tops; however, at the time of writing, the SOPR average hovered around 2.6x. Also, the final leg of the bull market starts when the STH supply crosses the pre-halving cycle high of 3,282,000 BTC; this figure is currently at 3,252,000 BTC.

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL.

Here is some advice if you are one of the newbies to crypto. How to make a start First of all, when entering the world of crypto, you will soon realise that this is a financial playground that is not fully controlled by banks, governments, or Wall Street. At least not yet. Unlike the stock market, you don’t need a broker to make trades for you. You can just set up a wallet, transfer some funds to it (your bank allowing) and then set up an account at a cryptocurrency exchange. There are many of these exchanges, spread across the internet, and based in various jurisdictions that might require some basic KYC (Know Your Customer) details, before you can start trading. Many countries still negative on crypto You do need to bear in mind though that a lot of the exchanges can be problematic depending which country you are based in. For example, would-be traders based in the UK are not allowed to access many crypto exchanges, due to geolocation restraints imposed by the FCA, the country’s regulatory watchdog. It may take a change of government before UK citizens are able to avoid this kind of censorship in the future. When, and if, you are able to sign up to a crypto exchange, and you are then able to see the huge amount of cryptocurrencies on offer, you are perhaps going to be confused as to just what to buy. Beware crypto influencers on social media Warning! If you follow any of the many ‘crypto influencers’ on YouTube and other social networking platforms, you are likely to be presented with all sorts of glittery cryptocurrencies that could make you into a millionaire overnight - or so the influencer would have you believe. What these people don’t say is that very often they are actually paid by the crypto projects that they are extolling the virtues of. The more people they can get to buy this or that cryptocurrency, the more exit liquidity there will be as the influencers themselves, together with the project founders, sell their tokens to the naive retail investors who have been convinced into buying them. Do your research Now, before going any further, it does need to be said that there are valid cryptocurrencies out there that do have some decent fundamentals. For example, Bitcoin has an extremely compelling use case as a store of value, while Ethereum, Solana, and Sui, are other layer-1 blockchains that could be the financial platforms of the future. There are all sorts of cryptocurrencies that seek to disrupt many other niches in the business world, but if you are looking to invest in them, you will need to do a LOT of investigation into their potential. Memecoin mania Many new retail traders are bound to be attracted by the bright lights of the memecoins. Yet again though, this particular niche in the world of cryptocurrencies carries the most extreme warning level possible. To put this into perspective, memecoins have absolutely nothing backing them at all, except faith that they will go up in value as more people jump onto the latest pump to the upside. There is no doubt that you will come across this or that story of traders who made millions by backing one memecoin or another. Yes, this has happened, but how many traders strike it rich here? Not many. Armed with a good knowledge of trading, and probably gained over a period of a few years, there is the possibility that some success could be achieved here. Without this, it is a case of pinning the tail on the donkey. The safe bet is Bitcoin When all is said and done, the good, safe bet, is probably Bitcoin. Yes, there can be wild swings still to the up or downside, and there are bear markets at the end of the normal 4 year cycle, whereby Bitcoin can lose more than half of its value. However, if investing in Bitcoin, your time horizon needs to be at least a few years. It is 100% certain that the purchasing power of your fiat currency will go down over time, and in these worrisome times, this is likely to be at an accelerated rate. Over a long enough time frame, Bitcoin has been proven to increase in value against just about every other asset. Buying and holding it is probably a far less stressful pastime than trading altcoins or memecoins. Think long and hard about this.

Despite recent growth, the uncertainties surrounding Coinbase's business model and the crypto market make it a risky investment with only a 25% chance of exceeding its current stock price. Favorable regulation and increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies are critical for Coinbase's long-term value, but these factors are already priced in. Given the high level of uncertainty and the need for more stable revenue, I recommend holding on to the stock rather than investing now. Overview Coinbase ( COIN ) is a blockchain company. As based on a nascent technology, it is uncertain but promising. After Election Day, bitcoin securities have risen wildly, foreseeing looser regulation from the Trump administration (Figure 1). Coinbase is one of the beneficiaries, and I estimate that the run-up will keep in the coming weeks. Figure 1: Seeking Alpha Despite this, I do not recommend investing in the company now due to the uncertainties surrounding it. In my base case, I estimate a value near its current stock price, but incorporating the risk, I estimate a 25% probability of having a value greater than its current stock price. Its revenue fluctuated from a low $590 million in 2022Q3 to a high $1,450 million in 2024Q1. From this high, it decreased to $1,129 million in the last quarter. Free cash flows fluctuated wilder and went from -3,059 million in 2022Q2 to $3,219 million a couple of quarters later (Figure 2). It is hard to value a company with such uncertainty. Either way, I will estimate its value, assigning probabilities to the most significant uncertainties. But first, I will identify what must happen to stabilize its business model: 1) The source of revenue must be more stable; 2) Bitcoin must eliminate its speculative nature and have an economic reality; it must be useful; and 3) regulatory barriers must be cleared away. Figure 2: Author Aiming for more stable revenue streams and economic reality for crypto Revenue is highly volatile due to crypto trading. Diversifying to a more stable revenue stream is critical for me to assign a better risk-return ratio for the company. The company is working on this diversification, but I think they are not at a comfortable point. Transaction revenue grew 98% year over year in the last quarter to $572 million, higher than subscription and service revenue, the more stable stream, which grew 66% to $556 million. So, those stable revenue streams were 49% of total revenue a year ago and now 46%. One of the revenue streams not linked to speculation is revenue from stablecoin. Its revenue has increased by 43% to $246 million. Stablecoin grows thanks to higher on-platform USDC balances, which is good news for the company. As more institutional entities trade USDC, they are using cryptocurrencies to make real-world transactions based on the real economy, which means the crypto utility is higher. Even with transaction revenue, I prefer that those transactions be from institutional players rather than consumers. Institutional entities mean two things to me. Firstly, they derive a more stable flow of transactions, and secondly, they provide credibility to cryptocurrency transactions since they are used by professionals. However, this trend—fees from stablecoin—gives more certainty to Coinbase's cash flow but makes monetizing more challenging. Coinbase charges 0.3% for cryptocurrency transactions but 0.15% for USDC conversion to USD . Besides, clients that hold $500 million assets or higher are exempt from any fee. So, institutional clients who have grown so much are paying less for the services. Sales and marketing costs have increased 110% to $165 million, from 12% of revenue to 14%, a clear sign that the company is making less for the same effort to acquire and retain customers. The Base service launched a year ago is another promising revenue stream that can create stable inflows for the company. Base is a software layer over the blockchain Ethereum network. Coinbase develops this layer and allows developers to code applications that can use Ethereum. Base is classified as Other Revenue that has grown from $51 million in 2023Q3 to $77 million in 2024Q3. It is just $26 million that doesn't move the needle yet. It is something that I will be watching closely, but it isn't meaningful now. Besides generating more stable revenue, with Base, the company tries to de-intermediate crypto networks to create proprietary networks, trying to capture the associated network effects. Regulation When investing in a company like Coinbase, it is critical that the regulations align with the industry's interests. Regulations must get looser. Crypto supporters demand that the industry not be regulated as a financial company. They claim that those strict regulations are contrary to innovation and will prevent the industry from growing and raising the needed funds. Under Trump, agencies like the SEC may reduce pressure to enforce actions against crypto firms. Regulation could shift from controlling crypto companies to protecting consumers from fraud. It may even promote self-regulation within the industry rather than heavy federal oversight. The House has passed the FIT 21 bill, a pro-crypto regulation bill supported by both parties. With the new Senate, the way is cleared. Figure 3: Seeking Alpha Even though Trump's Administration supports crypto regulation, as the market has demonstrated since election day, nothing is for granted. Coinbase allocated $25 million to Fairshake for pro-crypto advocacy ahead of the U.S. midterms. They will continue to support StandWithCrypto.org . I think the regulatory issue is one of the most certain of the three critical drivers of Coinbase's value. However, I think it is already priced in, as Figure 3 shows. Valuation Figure 4 shows the company's value drivers, considering a year as the last four quarters to capture the latest information. Regarding margins, I utilize a measure I call Cash Margin, which involves adjusting net income for non-cash items such as amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax. Figure 4: Author As outlined throughout the article, there is too much uncertainty in the company and the industry. In this section, I will define a case based on what I estimate would be a plausible scenario. Later, in the risk section, I will quantify my uncertainties to grasp the probability of the value estimate being higher than the current stock price. My base case scenario is based on Figure 5. I expect revenue growth for the next year to be 45%. Later on, the growth rate will decrease to 17%. So, I believe the company will grow like a tech company in these ten years. The scenario is optimistic and assumes regulations will be favorable, the company will innovate, and it will be easier to get funding. The Cash Margin will be 30% during the period. This is the average for the last three years. It is quite uncertain because the company must expand its client base, and we don't know if it will be difficult. We have seen that the percentage over revenue has increased in the last 12 trailing months. On the contrary, a more favorable regulation will make it easier to gain customers. I am confident margins will be around 30%. Net working capital has fluctuated from -59% to 126%. I assume that it will converge to zero accumulated over the next ten years. Cash flows will be discounted at a 14.0% WACC because the beta is 3.34. The risk-free rate is 4.2%. The company's leverage is 34% of total capital. The perpetual growth rate is set at 3%. Figure 5: Author Figure 5 shows that my value estimate is $324 per share, a 9% premium over its current stock price. It is, in my opinion, a value close to the current stock price with no margin of safety. The implied multiple Price to Free Cash Flow is 51, in line with the current multiple (Figure 6). Figure 6 Risks In this section, I am trying to model the uncertainty in the revenue growth rate and cash margin. It is based on the valuation section scenario, and I will use a triangular probability function. I don't want to define a precise probability function because I have no evidence to support it. In reality, it is like considering multiple scenarios. Revenue growth's likeliest value is 29%, the average base case over the ten years. I believe that the revenue growth rate can be as low as -10%. That is the case where competition from Binance or other network operators leads the market and gets market share from Coinbase. I consider 50% to be the highest revenue growth rate. In this scenario, Coinbase grows at a formidable rate, the industry grows fast, and Coinbase gains market share. The cash margin varies from 20% to 45% and is around 30% of the base case. In the model, this variable has less impact than the revenue growth rate. The revenue growth rate explains 84% of the variation of value, the independent variable, and the cash margin is 16%. The result of the model is shown in Figure 7. It reflects the cumulative probability of the stock value, a sensitivity graph showing the different ranges of stock value based on each of the other growth rates, and a cash margin with the variables I have just described. The conclusion is that the probability of getting a value greater than the current stock price of $296 per share is 25% (the blue area), so the risks I have described will give a lower chance of getting that value. Figure 7: Author My base case has little margin of safety, and when I incorporate the uncertainties, there is only a 25% chance of achieving a value higher than the current stock price. Conclusion There is too much uncertainty in Coinbase and, in general, in any crypto security. I seek to clear this uncertainty by three things: The revenue stream must be more stable. Bitcoin must eliminate its speculative nature and have an economic reality; it must be useful. And third, regulatory barriers must be cleared away. My conclusion is that the company has room to advance on those three fronts. Risks are weighted in my valuation, with just a 25% probability of having a long-term value greater than its current stock price. I recommend holding on to the stock.",COIN,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-03 11:58:40

OK, not literally, but just two weeks after call and put contracts for BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) began trading, we now have Cboe cash-settled FLEX options on both the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index and the Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index. These options debuted without much fanfare on Monday and have opened up a new ""defined outcome"" market, according to Jeff Park, the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise. Park says they allow for the customization of over-the-counter strategies while completely cutting out counterparty risk. That paves the way for innovative strategies focused on principal protection and range accrual at a time when giant companies like Microsoft might be contemplating a BTC investment. But here's the dampener: BTC isn’t really responding to all the excitement. The largest cryptocurrency is trading flat near $95,000 and testing the patience of bulls who are itching for that landmark break above $100K. The lackluster response could be a sign of market exhaustion, especially given whispers the U.S. government possibly moving to liquidate its holdings. The dollar index (DXY) is a bit tentative too, with traders holding fire till they see Tuesday's U.S. JOLTS job report. Expectations are that vacancies rose to 7.48 million in November from the previous 7.44 million, per FXStreet. A hotter-than-expected number could lift the dollar, lead to reduced bets on a Fed interest-rate cut and put pressure on BTC. Looking at the wider crypto market, major tokens like ETH are mostly calm, though XRP and ADA are still riding a wave thanks to retail investor enthusiasm. Money is also being rotated into darlings of the previous bull run like LINK, which has gained 24% in the past 24 hours. Even litecoin (LTC) is rising. One thing to note — XRP’s wild price spikes have a history of marking major BTC and crypto market tops, as we'll see in our TA section down below. There are rumors flying around that Solana is about to announce something big related to airdrops. According to Fox journalist Eleanor Terrett, President-elect Donald Trump might announce a replacement for the outgoing SEC-chair Gary Gensler's as early as Tuesday. Now for something jaw-dropping: Yield farming on Avalanche-based TraderJoe is heating up with the most traded pair, AVAX/USDC, offering a 24-hour APR of over 1,000%. Can you believe it? Investor demand for stablecoins is going through the roof. Late Monday, annualized deposit rates for USDT and USDC shot up to nearly 30%, while USDe spiked as high as 60% on AAVE.

An unhealthy fixation on native tokens, coupled with hardware installed in areas with low demand, means far too many DePIN projects lack sustainability. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks —otherwise known as DePINs for short—are ambitious projects that represent a huge undertaking. They involve so much more than launching a flash-in-the-pan memecoin in a couple of clicks. You might also like: Unlocking the power of community: DePINs are shaping a new economy | Opinion The goal of connecting real-world assets, such as energy grids and transport networks, to blockchains is one that takes time, resources, and scale. Because of this, it’s little wonder that The Block Research suggests funding has now hit a new all-time high of $1.91 billion. Deepening interest in artificial intelligence has given the burgeoning DePIN sector another boost—but not all projects are born equal, and those that survive in this competitive landscape need to overcome sizable structural issues to reach their full potential. Transfixed on tokens One particular issue relates to the mistaken notion that startups need to launch a native token to be successful. This can be a fatal error, as it means the value of a network is tied to the wider market and macroeconomic events that are completely out of its control. Helium ( HNT ) is a good example of what this looks like in practice. This blockchain-based platform was created with the vision of cultivating a people-powered wireless internet network, meaning those who operate hotspots would be rewarded with HNT tokens. But in reality, the project’s success lay in how this digital asset launched at an opportune time—right in the middle of a huge bull run that generated FOMO among investors. Huge rises in this token’s value weren’t a reflection of this network’s resilience or how many clients it had. This essentially stripped HNT back to a mere memecoin with little utility. In fact, when you look at Helium’s annual recurring revenue, a sobering statistic emerges. Even with $1 billion worth of hardware, it would take the Internet of Things close to 1,000 years to break even. Other contenders in the space include peaq, a network that says it’s home to more than 50 DePINs. Healthy scrutiny is needed here, as it’s difficult for most blockchains to handle the transaction volumes of a single decentralized physical infrastructure network, let alone 50. And that brings us to the biggest lesson that up-and-coming DePIN brands need to learn: you don’t need a token of your own as long as rewards for users are liquid. We’ve already seen how such digital assets can even land projects in hot water, with Pollen Mobile facing lawsuits in the US after being accused of “minting coins from thin air” and flogging them for cash. DePIN delivers one of the poorest returns on capital employed across any industry on Earth—and its decentralized nature means that the financial burden is passed on to those who invest in a project rather than the founders. And for this sector to really make an impact, founders should be focusing on creating demand-driven solutions, shifting their efforts to attracting more clients rather than making their networks bigger. Let’s explain what this means in practice. Instead of adopting a “build it and they will come” model, a demand-driven approach would mean hotspots pop up in the areas where there are already paying customers who want them. India is a prime example of a market where there’s an insatiable demand for internet connectivity, but 600 million people lack access. By severing ownership from installation, a DePIN investor could purchase hardware that it is then put to use where it is actually needed—in some cases halfway around the world. Rethinking DePINs Of course, hardware is a crucial element when creating DePINs—but right now, the incentives are misaligned. Too many projects have sold equipment at inflated prices, all while becoming reliant on shifting more units to bolster their revenues. Others have allocated a share of each purchase to token burning in an attempt to make these digital assets more palatable. While this may inflate their price in the short run, it means such cryptocurrencies violate the Howey Test , which determines whether an asset is a security. Worse still, it often means that investors enter a project for all the wrong reasons—putting financial interest first instead of benefiting others. The “build it and they will come” method creates an environment where DePIN hardware lies gathering dust and unused, but aggrieved investors continue to demand a return. But generous payouts can prove unsustainable, creating high levels of apathy when rewards dwindle. Insisting on distributing compensation in the form of a volatile native token can also be exceptionally off putting to corporations, who would prefer to be paid using digital dollars instead. Going demand first means that a native token’s value is of secondary concern, and the focus can rightly return to ensuring that a DePIN does the most good. The first step is to find consumers who would benefit from this infrastructure and then ensure that hardware funded by investors goes to those who reach them. This helps generate actual revenue and means a network grows organically. When it comes to rewards, distributing revenue in the form of stablecoins can make income streams far more transparent and predictable than they are today. In the old-fashioned world of infrastructure, careful planning and research are performed before a single dollar of capital is spent. Feasibility studies examine whether an ambitious project is achievable, who it would serve, and where they are based. DePINs should follow the same approach—and put end-users at the heart of their strategy. Blockchain technology and spreading funding costs across a broader cross-section of people can be truly transformative—enabling emerging markets to finally access the technology they need to grow their economies and become more prosperous. But the DePIN projects trying to make this happen need to realize that throwing a native token into the bargain for the sake of it risks creating an unnecessary distraction that could ultimately prove harmful in the long run—and spark no end of legal and regulatory headaches. Sustainability is the name of the game here. Too much supply and too little demand will always spell disaster. But putting demand first and incrementally increasing supply along the way is a recipe for success—and should serve as the roadmap for helping the DePIN sector thrive and change the world.

Users must do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. Analysts highlight Dogecoin, XRP, and Yeti Ouro as top picks, with XRP soaring, DOGE poised for a breakout, and YETIO offering presale discounts for early investors. Table of Contents The XRP show continues; Is DOGE next? Investors flock to Yeti Ouro Amid a slight pullback to start the week, analysts believe that it could be the best time to invest in Dogecoin, XRP and the new DeFi altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO). Dogecoin has had an unimpressive weekly showing and can now be acquired at a slight discount, while XRP has been one of the best performers in that time and is likely to continue soaring. Yeti Ouro is in its first presale stage, where it’s going for a discounted price as well, making it the best time to get in before it explodes. The XRP show continues; Is DOGE next? It has undoubtedly been XRP’s bull rally. The token has quadrupled its value since the start of November as it repays investors who have stuck with it during the trying times. XRP price started the week with a 20% rise in just 24 hours. This was even more impressive given it was against the tide, as seven of the other top cryptos were in the red, with Solana leading the dip at 6%. This brought the total gains over the past seven days to 50% for XRP. Ripple’s XRP price hit a peak of $2.5 on Sunday night, its highest in six years and ten months. The last time XRP was at this level was in mid-January, 2018, during the bull rally, where it set its all-time high at $3.84. At $2.5, XRP’s market cap was a staggering $141.5 billion, which flipped Tether to become the third-largest crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum. At that market cap, it was more valuable than Japan’s largest bank, MUFG, and American banking giant Citibank. XRP has since dipped slightly, allowing Tether to reclaim its position. However, its unfazed momentum in the November bull rally indicates that it’s only a matter of time before it cements its claim to the third position, which it held for years before the SEC came in with its bogus lawsuit and obliterated the token’s market. As XRP soars, Dogecoin has been a mixed bag. It was among the first to surge after the November 5th elections, but since then, it has been trading sideways on most days. In the past week, it has dipped over 5% and is struggling to maintain its price above $0.4093. The memecoin’s sideways trading has allowed it to consolidate over the past week, which precedes a major upward breakout. It has struggled to rise past the critical resistance level of $0.43, but once it does, it will surge toward the key psychological level of $1. Investors flock to Yeti Ouro Investors are also flocking to Yeti Ouro, a new DeFi altcoin that they believe will yield greater returns than XRP and DOGE. Yeti Ouro’s ongoing presale has attracted thousands of investors who have purchased over 70 million YETIO tokens, raising $842,000 for the project. Yeti Ouro is focused on offering utility through its native YETIO token, setting it apart from most meme coins today which rely purely on speculation. The token powers its Yeti Go play-to-earn racing game, where players pay race entry fees and receive rewards for winning races in YETIO. They can also purchase weapons and customizations in YETIO and stake the tokens to unlock exclusive rewards. Yeti Ouro has capped the token’s supply at one billion tokens and allocated 5% to the token burning mechanism, further boosting its performance by making it deflationary.

Top 4 Altcoins to Buy for a Potential 10x Return by 2024 As 2024 approaches its close, the crypto market has experienced significant price surges, signaling a bullish trend. Amidst this, several altcoins have gained attention for their potential to deliver massive returns. Here are four altcoins that could see a 10x increase in value by the end of the year. XRP XRP price has surged by an impressive 95% over the past week, reaching $2.60 amid a broader market rally. This growth is largely attributed to Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is nearing a resolution in Ripple’s favor. Additionally, the XRP Ledger’s decentralized capabilities continue to draw investors’ attention. Ripple’s upcoming launch of the RLUSD stablecoin adds further optimism. If the momentum holds, XRP could soon surpass the $3 mark, pushing it closer to its all-time high of $3.84.

But even before this potential market surge materializes, XRP has begun its parabolic run with a $2 climb. After coming in late to the market-wide crypto rally party after the US elections, XRP is now beginning to redeem itself, buoyed by fresh and favorable market developments. Alongside XRP, young altcoin JetBolt is blazing ahead of the potential bull run with its explosive presale, selling more than 100 million tokens since its debut. Its groundbreaking feature, zero-gas technology is also capturing massive whale interest. With the bull run underway, could JetBolt reach new heights in presale figures, and can XRP record a fresh all-time high at $5? Let’s find out. XRP Price Forecast: Is XRP Heading Towards a Long-Awaited $5 Breakout? Ripple’s XRP is on a tear. After witnessing somewhat bearish investor actions and a stagnant price movement after revisiting the $1 mark, XRP is again hitting the green on the price charts. Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s 6% rise seems to be a continuation of its rally, which started on December 2nd. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.58—a value that the third-largest cryptocurrency has only seen after six long years. XRP’s 24-hour price chart shows its notable price pump over $2.80 on December 3, 2024 — source: CoinMarketCap website With its bullish charge, is XRP en route to the $5 mark? Technically, XRP needs to keep its upward trajectory above $2.58. A successful hold above this level could push a rally to a high of $3.57. In summary, XRP smashing $5 is not impossible. However, the cryptocurrency would need to maintain current buying momentum alongside other favorable market conditions. Despite positive prospects for the RLUSD stablecoin, New York’s Department of Financial Services has not officially confirmed its approval yet. XRP would also need to overcome the challenges that would reflect in its on-chain metrics, stalling its climb to $5. Is JetBolt (JBOLT) The Rising Star of the Next Bull Run? While XRP’s target to register a fresh ATH at $5 could face delays, JetBolt (JBOLT) is surging ahead of the anticipated crypto bull run. This hot market newcomer has sold over 100 million tokens since its presale commenced—a herculean milestone for such a young presale coin. Behind the narrative of growing whale interest in JetBolt are its real and innovative features that challenge the status quo. While clogged blockchain networks could sometimes charge hefty gas fees in transactions, JetBolt offers game-changing zero-gas technology. This high-tech feature enables users to carry out hassle-free and gas-free transactions, bringing down the traditional barrier of expensive gas costs. Beyond seamless transactions, JetBolt takes the complexity out of staking tokens with its easy-to-use crypto-staking platform. It also adds a layer of excitement to staking by giving stakers a chance to earn bonus rewards when they connect with friends on the platform. Moreover, JetBolt taps the potential of merging blockchain technology with AI. JetBolt provides token holders with crypto news and blockchain trends via its AI-powered tool. Aside from these cutting-edge innovations, JetBolt could be pulling in whales and crypto buyers to its exciting presale because of presale advantages. Early movers could get an exclusive chance to enjoy up to 25% extra tokens when they purchase Alpha Boxes or acquire JetBolt (JBOLT) tokens in batches. As whales flock to accumulate JBOLT, the presale frenzy indicates growing confidence in its capability to shine among other coins in the next bull run. Conclusion — XRP Eyes $5 Price Target While JetBolt Gains Massive Whale Traction Ripple’s XRP has been witnessing an impressive run lately, bolstered by positive market developments. While it is not impossible, it could take a while for XRP to smash $5. Meanwhile, fresh entrant JetBolt’s electrifying rise is hard to ignore. Bursting onto the crypto scene with a presale that has sold over 100 million tokens, JetBolt continues to gain interest from blockchain whales seeking revolutionary next-gen altcoins.

The re-election of Donald Trump and the impending resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler are key catalysts driving renewed interest in XRP. On-chain metrics and blockchain usage data suggest mixed fundamentals supporting XRP's recent performance surge. The biggest question is what are investors willing to pay today for tomorrow's potential? At a $262 billion fully diluted market cap, XRP is more 'valuable' than Wells Fargo. When I covered the XRP/Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ) for Seeking Alpha back in March, the coin had been lagging the broader smart contract segment in the digital asset market. I hypothesized that XRP was lagging for a reason, and cited several data points that I felt justified that assertion. Things change. Not only is XRP no longer lagging other smart contract gas tokens, but in just three weeks, XRP has rapidly morphed from a laggard to a top-performing asset over the last 12 months: Data by YCharts On November 6th, XRP's 12-month performance was negative 10%. Fast-forward to December 1st; the token has a 12-month return approaching 300% and has also taken out both Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Tether ( USDT-USD ) for the number 3 spot on CoinMarketCap's asset valuation list after Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). CoinMarketCap Justified? Let's try to find out. In this update, we'll dive into possible news-related catalysts that could be driving this move and review many of the same blockchain usage metrics that I shared in my March piece. Potential News-Related Catalysts Perhaps one of the biggest reasons exuberance has returned to the 'alt-coin' market in recent weeks is the re-election of former US President Donald Trump. Something that was generally foreshadowed by myself and others over the summer was that President Trump was clearly positioning to be the friendlier candidate for the digital asset market. Subsequent to Trump's victory last month, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler announced he would be stepping down on inauguration day. Gensler's SEC has been widely viewed as antagonistic to the cryptocurrency industry, and the agency developed a reputation for being 'capricious and arbitrary' in addition to being active from a litigation standpoint. The latter of which has specifically had an impact on XRP Ledger developer Ripple Labs. In my view, President Trump's re-election and Gary Gensler's eventual resignation are two very positive catalysts for Ripple Labs and by extension XRP token holders. We've also seen several applications for XRP ETFs from companies like Bitwise and 21Shares. Monthly Stablecoin Transfer Volume (IntoTheBlock) That said, the bigger catalyst may be the planned launch and potential regulatory approval of the RLUSD stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. The chart above is showing the monthly transfer volume currently seen on EVM blockchains on a monthly basis. Monthly volume surpassed $1 trillion for the 3rd time in the last 5 months in November. Total stablecoin supply recently hit a new record of $192 billion last month, per data from IntoTheBlock. Stablecoins are a very important part of the public blockchain ecosystem, as they allow end users the ability to swap out of digital currencies into something with more perceived stability on-chain without requiring a centralized exchange. Furthermore, stablecoin payments allow P2P transactions with a familiar unit of account on public blockchain rails. This opens up the possibility of quick, inexpensive cross-border settlement at scale. With hypothetical catalysts seemingly flashing 'bullish,' the bigger question for me is what the actual on-chain data is saying. On-Chain Metrics In my March article, I chose not to compare daily active addresses between XRP and top L1 smart contract chains like Solana or Ethereum because, frankly, the number for XRP is substantially lower and there are perhaps better historical peers. In the chart below, I'm showing XRP Ledger against Algorand ( ALGO-USD ) and Stellar ( XLM-USD ): 30 Day Active Addresses (CoinMetrics) The chart above shows the 10+ year trend in 30 day active addresses for all three chains mentioned above. During the 2022 spikes in usage, each of these chains had very similar levels of active users. However, more recently, the XRP Ledger has not been able to maintain the same level of average active user growth as the other two chains: Chain 30 Day Actives Fully Diluted Cap Ripple 54.9k $262.6b Stellar 174.6k $30b Algorand 130.8k $4.9b Sources: CoinMetrics, CoinMarketCap, as of 12/2/24 If we compare 30 day active users against the fully diluted market capitalizations for each of the three chains listed above, we can get a much better sense of what the market is paying for the level of users currently being served by the XRP Ledger. If we look at XRP based purely on value transferred, the spike in recent weeks is quite significant: 30 Day Average Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) At a 30-day average of $38.3 billion in transferred value, XRP is a large standout. It is currently averaging more daily transferred value than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. However, even with this enormous move higher in transferred value, the fees paid to the XRP Ledger network are still well below top chains in the market like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. Consider, at $24k in fees on December 1st, XRP is trading at an annualized price to fees ratio of 29,977x fully diluted fees. For comparison's sake, Solana trades at 59x fully diluted fees and Ethereum trades at a 188 fully diluted P/F multiple. Risks In Chasing Here Elaborating on some of my points above, investors have to ask themselves what their valuation framework is and what they're willing to pay for any digital asset based on that valuation framework. My own framework may differ from what is generally accepted in the broader cryptocurrency market, but something that I think everyone in the space should be mindful of is the market value to realized value of these assets. This ratio shows the valuation the market is giving each token over what has actually been paid for those tokens on average. The more extreme this ratio gets to the upside, the greater the likelihood of a pullback. MVRV (CoinMetrics) The chart above shows the raw, unsmoothed MVRV for XRP, XLM, ALGO, BTC and ETH going back to the beginning of 2020. At a MVRV ratio of 2.66 on December 1st, XRP has the second highest MVRV ratio today of the assets shown (after only XLM) and is at the highest level XRP has traded since the 2.88 MVRV reading back in April 2021. This happened to coincide with when the price of the XRP token peaked during the last crypto bull cycle. Closing Takeaways The regulatory environment appears to be quickly improving for the US crypto industry. The report of impending NYDFS approval of RLUSD is also significant because the XRP Ledger has long been positioned as an alternative to the SWIFT system. But I believe these gains in the XRP token are more indicative of excitement from regulatory catalysts than anything else. The on-chain data doesn't justify this enormous price move in the XRP token, in my view. On one hand, transferred value has been surging. But on the other hand, what is the right price for a token that doesn't generate rewards from staking? At a fully diluted market capitalization of $262 billion, the market is implying XRP token is more valuable than Wells Fargo ( WFC ) and American Express ( AXP ). I can't say I think that's justified today. I should note that I do have indirect exposure to XRP through the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ). That fund has a 4% allocation to XRP and is one of the only ways that I'm aware of to get exposure to XRP through a traditional brokerage account if one wishes to do so. I'm not going to call XRP a sell at this point, but I'm certainly not chasing this rally.",ALGO-USD|XLM-USD|GDLC|XRP-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-03 13:30:00

In a move aimed at enhancing user experience, the company has announced the integration of Apple Pay into its Onramp app services. This exciting development is set to make cryptocurrency transactions significantly more accessible for millions of users, streamlining the process and encouraging broader adoption of digital currencies. On the other hand, Coinbase has also made headlines by withdrawing its pre-application to enter the Turkish cryptocurrency market. This decision marks a notable shift in its international expansion plans. Coinbase Fully Integrates Apple Pay into Onramp App Services, Elevating Crypto Accessibility In a move that signals further convergence between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Coinbase, the leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced the full integration of Apple Pay into its Onramp app services. This development, effective from Dec. 2, allows users logging into apps built on Coinbase’s Onramp platform to seamlessly transact using Apple Pay. The integration simplifies crypto transactions for millions of Apple Pay users, presenting a significant leap in user accessibility and convenience. Coinbase has positioned this as a key feature requiring no additional setup from app developers, making it a plug-and-play enhancement to its Onramp ecosystem. Apple Pay and the Evolution of Crypto Payments Apple Pay’s foray into cryptocurrency isn’t unprecedented, with integrations already established across platforms like Binance, BitPay, and MetaMask. However, its incorporation into Coinbase’s services holds particular significance due to Coinbase’s dominance in the US cryptocurrency exchange market. Social media platforms, including X, have been abuzz with optimism following the announcement. Influencer Asser Fawzi encapsulated the sentiment, describing the move as a potential “tipping point” for broader crypto adoption, citing the ease and security associated with Apple Pay as major factors that could bring new users into the digital asset space. Coinbase Onramp aims to streamline cryptocurrency adoption for users and developers by removing technical barriers. Apple Pay’s integration aligns with this mission, leveraging iOS’s extensive user base to provide a familiar and secure entry point for Web3 transactions. This step could prove especially disruptive to traditional financial systems as it offers: Ease of Use: Apple Pay’s intuitive interface reduces the friction often associated with crypto transactions. Enhanced Security: The integration adds a layer of trust for crypto-curious users hesitant about blockchain’s perceived complexity. Regulatory Compliance: Coinbase Onramp supports transactions in over 60 fiat currencies while adhering to regulations, fostering a sense of legitimacy. Zero Fees for USD Coin (USDC): Users benefit from free on-ramp and off-ramp transactions involving USDC, Coinbase’s native stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The Onramp service already supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and more than 20 blockchains, making it a versatile tool for developers and users. Apple Pay’s ubiquity in traditional finance systems means its integration with Coinbase could be a turning point in the mainstream adoption of digital assets. As Coinbase Onramp simplifies blockchain interactions for average users, the crypto industry could witness a shift in demographics, welcoming users less familiar with the intricacies of blockchain technology. Experts believe this move could foster deeper trust and understanding of cryptocurrencies, addressing key adoption bottlenecks by providing secure and seamless payment options. The integration of Apple Pay with Coinbase Onramp represents more than just a technological update—it’s a paradigm shift for the cryptocurrency sector. By marrying the accessibility of traditional payment systems with the revolutionary potential of blockchain, Coinbase is setting the stage for a new wave of adoption. As developers and users begin to leverage these capabilities, the industry may see greater trust and participation from mainstream consumers. However, challenges such as regulatory scrutiny and uneven global market penetration remain hurdles Coinbase and its peers must navigate carefully. Whether this move becomes the much-needed catalyst for mass adoption or simply another step in crypto’s slow march toward the mainstream, one thing is certain: Coinbase is solidifying its position as a bridge between the worlds of traditional and digital finance. Coinbase Withdraws Application for Turkish Crypto Market Amid Unclear Circumstances In a related development, Coinbase has officially withdrawn its pre-application to enter the Turkish cryptocurrency market. According to documents released by the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB), Coinbase also requested liquidation of its position in the country, marking a sudden halt to its previously announced expansion plans. This development follows a broader trend of companies reassessing their strategies in Turkey’s rapidly growing cryptocurrency ecosystem. While Coinbase has yet to provide specific reasons for its decision, the move has sparked widespread speculation about the challenges and opportunities in one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets. Coinbase initially filed its pre-application with the CMB in August, joining over 90 enterprises vying to tap into Turkey’s burgeoning crypto scene. The country ranks fourth globally in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume and holds the 11th spot on the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis. This market appeal stems from Turkey’s unique economic dynamics, where rapid inflation and currency devaluation have driven citizens to seek financial stability through cryptocurrencies. The Turkish lira's volatility has made Bitcoin, stablecoins, and altcoins popular hedging instruments among the population. Despite this favorable backdrop, Coinbase’s decision to withdraw its application and request liquidation signals potential underlying issues. While the exact motives remain undisclosed, several factors could have influenced Coinbase’s decision: Regulatory Challenges:Turkey has been tightening its regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges, requiring them to meet stringent compliance standards. These include anti-money laundering measures, tax reporting obligations, and minimum capital requirements. Navigating these regulations could have presented significant operational challenges for Coinbase. Market Competition:The Turkish crypto market is already crowded, with established local players like BtcTurk and Paribu commanding a significant share. Additionally, international exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin have made inroads, intensifying competition. Economic Uncertainty:While crypto adoption in Turkey is high, the nation’s broader economic instability could pose risks for foreign businesses, particularly those in highly volatile sectors like digital assets. Strategic Reprioritization:A statement from a Coinbase spokesperson suggests that the withdrawal aligns with a broader strategy to adapt to evolving market conditions. The spokesperson noted:“Coinbase continually assesses potential markets for expansion as part of our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and accessible cryptocurrency services worldwide. Our strategy remains adaptive to evolving market conditions, regulatory landscapes, and our internal priorities.” The Bigger Picture: Challenges in Turkey’s Crypto Landscape Coinbase is not alone in reassessing its position in Turkey. Recent reports indicate that at least 14 applicants, including prominent exchanges like Bitget, have withdrawn their submissions to the CMB. This trend comes amidst what some analysts describe as growing friction between regulators and the crypto industry. Turkey has taken proactive steps to regulate the space, introducing new laws and oversight mechanisms. However, these measures, while aimed at ensuring consumer protection and financial stability, have also created an environment of heightened scrutiny and operational hurdles for incoming players. Despite these challenges, Turkey remains a critical market in the global crypto landscape. Its large, tech-savvy population, combined with a strong demand for alternative financial instruments, positions it as a key player in shaping the future of cryptocurrency adoption. Coinbase’s decision to pull back from Turkey may be a temporary pause rather than a permanent exit. As the global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, companies like Coinbase are likely to adopt a cautious and measured approach to international expansion. For Turkey, the withdrawals by Coinbase and other major players bring attention to the need for a balanced regulatory framework that encourages innovation while ensuring compliance. With its high adoption rates and growing ecosystem, the Turkish market remains a lucrative opportunity for exchanges willing to navigate its complexities. In the meantime, local players and established global exchanges already operating in Turkey are expected to strengthen their positions, capitalizing on the reduced competition from new entrants.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 13:37:14

Other voices are saying the party should start early next year. Either way, now is the time to allocate. The Telegram gaming platform Dogizen , with its unique ICO approach and position within one of the hottest sectors right now, makes it the ideal pick. Dogizen has already raised $1.4m and is offering 47.30% gains before the presale concludes. The best crypto 2025 is staring you right in the face. Why Dogizen is ready to seize the best crypto 2025 crown For starters, Dogizen employs the unique approach of delivering its ICO directly to Telegram’s 950 million user base . No ICO has ever done this before. For the first time, ICO investors can buy, claim, and hold their tokens within one familiar interface. Given Telegram’s high levels of trust within the crypto space , this is the ultimate platform to launch an ICO on. Also, Dogizen is sitting within a bit of a golden sector right now: Telegram gaming. These new games are contained within the Telegram app and don’t require additional downloading. Their simple, addictive nature and ability to earn crypto for the players is onboarding crypto newbies at a phenomenal rate . Plus, according to a recent report by Game7 , 21% of new Web3 game launches happened on Telegram in 2024. That clearly explains Telegram gaming’s surge to around $1.5 billion in market cap in around six months. Telegram’s popularity in the developing world is set to grow, and combined with the power of Telegram games, the next 1 billion users piling into crypto could well have Telegram to thank. Why Dogizen has a superior strategy to its rivals Besides its unique ICO approach, Dogizen has caught degens’ attention thanks to its superior approach to tokenomics. Dogizen’s key rivals, such as Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, have all reached considerable market caps: $500 million to over a billion in some cases . However, since these projects distributed tokens via airdrop, recipients were basically given free money and dumped the tokens immediately. Tanking the price in the process. Dogizen has seen this error a mile away and is slowly building loyal support with its ICO instead. Plus, Dogizen aims for its market cap to be around $10 million upon listing. Considering the multiple hundreds of millions Dogizen can expect its market cap to be after looking at its rivals, there’s ample room for the DOGIZ token to pump on the open market. As the bull run builds, altcoin season soars, and Dogizen’s market cap starts to emulate its peers; 100x for today’s presale investors looks highly likely. You can buy DOGIZ on the official Dogizen website .",Sponsored,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 13:40:32

This is just a preview of the insights available in CoinDesk's latest report, Driven by Demand: The People-Powered Crypto Movement in APAC . Download the report today for even more exclusive findings. The region already boasts a higher adoption rate than its neighbors at 24% versus a worldwide average of 7.8%. The report found this is driven by a range of factors including rising internet penetration, evolving regulatory environments, speculative interest, practical utility, growing understanding, and a belief in crypto's future potential. Surveying 4,267 people across Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and the UAE, it found that 50% of adults in the region are somewhat or very positive toward crypto – despite a regional adoption rate of less than half that. “This highlights enormous potential for future growth,” the report’s authors wrote. A further 27% held neutral views on crypto and 24% said they remained skeptical of its value. But positive sentiment is growing, with 50% feeling more positive about crypto than they did a year ago. “This upswing in sentiment might be influenced by several factors, including Bitcoin’s recent strong performance and an absence of any notable, recent scandals,” the report noted. “However, sentiment can be fickle, so there's an urgency for market players to responsibly capitalize on these favorable conditions.” Financial Transformation More than six out of ten adults in the region believe that digital assets will play a significant role in the future of global finance and investment, according to the survey. As the region undergoes a financial transformation coupled with fast development in emerging markets, the report noted a grassroots-level interest and embrace of crypto. Over half of adults think crypto will be used for everyday purposes, despite crypto not being legal tender in most countries in the region. “This optimism suggests a sense of inevitability about crypto's role in daily life,” the report said. It also states that further adoption will be driven by practical benefits. A total of 29% of respondents said that 29% value crypto for the ability to make payments within their country, 27% for cross-border transactions and 30% for access to financial services-though the report does not state what proportion of respondents have used crypto for these purposes. Nevertheless, it states that these motivations “underscore a pragmatic approach to crypto adoption, one based on tangible benefits and real-world applications.” Emerging Markets The report also reported higher interest and adoption in emerging markets compared to more established financial jurisdictions such as Japan and Australia. Despite the two’s relatively favorable crypto regulation and infrastructure, actual adoption remains lower compared to other areas due to a comparatively weaker demand. “Conversely, places like the Philippines and the UAE not only have effective enablers in place to support crypto adoption, but also strong underlying demand,” the report said. “[This results] in some of the highest crypto adoption rates in not just APAC, but the world.”",Coindesk News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-03 13:48:39

This surge suggests a potential breakout, with bullish sentiment building around the coin. However, despite SOL’s upward trend, XRP’s recent monthly gains have surpassed Solana’s entire market cap, highlighting a contrasting dynamic in the altcoin sector. Solana Price Fumbles As XRP Market Cap Gain Stifles SOL Growth The XRP price has added an impressive $128 billion to its market cap, surpassing the entire market cap of Solana price in just 30 days. This significant surge has been a major factor in shifting investor attention and capital from Solana to XRP. While retail investors and meme coin activity initially drove Solana’s popularity, XRP’s meteoric rise has overshadowed SOL’s growth, leaving Solana to struggle in the market. XRP’s dominance in the market has essentially outpaced Solana, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment towards the former. Currently, Solana has a market capitalization of $106.89 billion. SOL Technical Analysis Hints $400 to $600 Target Crypto analysts report that the Solana price prediction has recently surged after breaking out of an 8-month-long bull pennant pattern. This move marks a significant milestone as the cryptocurrency has secured a monthly breakout, signaling its upward momentum is far from over. The rally has sparked bullish expectations, with analysts forecasting a potential price surge to $400 and $600 in the coming months. This continued rise could position Solana as one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market, further solidifying its place among major blockchain projects. Despite its recent surge, market sentiment remains highly optimistic, with many experts predicting more gains for SOL. Investors are closely monitoring the market, anticipating further asset value growth. Tweet The token has shown notable fluctuations recently, reflecting both positive and negative market sentiment. As of the latest data, the SOL price is trading at $224 with a slight pullback after a brief period of upward momentum. Despite this, the cryptocurrency’s price remains within a crucial range that traders closely monitor. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Solana price has recently dipped below the neutral 50 mark, suggesting a weakening in buying momentum. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator has decreased bullish momentum, reinforcing the expectation of potential price consolidation or further correction in the short term. Solana Price Chart by TradingView In conclusion, while Solana’s recent breakout signals growth potential, XRP’s surge has overshadowed its market cap.

Despite declining profitability in its software business, MicroStrategy transformed into a ""digital goldmine"" by leveraging low-interest convertible bonds to amass Bitcoin. The company holds 402,100 BTC, valued at $38.20 billion, and aims to raise $42 billion to accumulate more Bitcoin through its aggressive ""21/21 plan"". MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Yield, measuring acquisition efficiency, stands at 56.4%, with a target of 6-10% annually, reflecting its strategic focus on Bitcoin accumulation. Investment Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has become the undisputed darling of Wall Street in 2024, having risen by over 500%. Love it or hate it, the numbers don't lie: it has outperformed every asset in existence this year, even the one responsible for its own rise, Bitcoin. mstr-tracker.com Let's get straight to the point. The reason why this stock is rising so much, it's because it's not even a traditional company anymore. It's a high-stakes bet on Bitcoin's price and potential for adoption. Citron Research has recently taken a short position on the stock, calling it ""overheated"". Other skeptics are calling it a ponzi scheme. We, on the other hand, are looking at the full picture here. This stock has the potential to reach half a trillion dollar market cap, and it all depends on one man's plan - Michael Saylor. MicroStrategy as a Software Company The truth is that MicroStrategy is not the best software company you can buy. The company's business intelligence segment has seen its profitability decline steadily over the past decade. Between 2010 and 2019, MicroStrategy averaged $3.94 in annual earnings per share ((EPS)), but by 2024, that figure dropped significantly due to massive share dilution and operational losses. With shares increasing from 10.1 million in 2019 to 216.24 million in 2024 , EPS now sits at just $2.18 TTM. Operational losses have also deepened, with TTM losses of $406.7 million reported in 2024. CCN The ""Infinite Money Glitch"" and the ""21/21 Plan"" Disregarding the software segment of the business, MicroStrategy has transformed itself from a losing business into a ""digital goldmine"", metaphorically and literally. The company is essentially raising funds through low-interest convertible bonds and investing it all into Bitcoin. This means that they are converting an inflating asset into a scarce one, for free. These bonds are issued at a 0% interest rate and investors are willing to lend the company money with the prospect of converting those loans into shares in the future. Additionally, MicroStrategy has used Bitcoin's volatility to its advantage, by turning impairment losses into deferred tax benefits. For example, in 2022, Bitcoin-related impairments accounted for nearly 77% of operating expenses, but these also positioned the company to benefit when Bitcoin prices rebounded this year. With 402,100 BTC at the time of writing this report, valued at $38.20 billion, MicroStrategy now holds close to 2% of Bitcoin's lifetime supply. Following its Q3 2024 earnings release, the company has announced a more aggressive accumulation plan for Bitcoin. This ""21/21 plan"" aims to raise $42 billion, split evenly between equity and debt, to accumulate even more coins. The Bitcoin Yield, which measures the efficiency of Bitcoin acquisitions relative to shareholder capital deployment is how the company evaluates its strategy. As of Q4 2024, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Yield stands at 56.4%. The proposed annual target is 6-10%. HedgeMix This high yield is probably unsustainable in the long run but really shows the company's ability to acquire Bitcoin at favorable prices and with efficient financing. The higher the yield, the more effectively MicroStrategy enhances shareholder exposure to Bitcoin without excessive dilution or over-leveraging. Historically, each 1% change in Bitcoin Yield has corresponded to approximately 4,557 BTC acquired. Using this correlation, we can estimate the company's annual Bitcoin acquisitions under three scenarios: HedgeMix If Bitcoin's price stabilizes around $100,000 in the coming years, the 21/21 Plan could increase MicroStrategy's holdings to between 600,000 and 700,000 BTC by 2027. In the longer term, our projections estimate the company's holdings to exceed 1,000,000 BTC by 2032 under the bullish scenarios. Valuation Valuing MicroStrategy is not an easy challenge since traditional methods such as DCF models fail to capture the company's dual role as a software company and Bitcoin treasury. Instead, we choose to value the company based on its Bitcoin holdings and the premium investors are willing to pay for it. As of the 2nd of December 2024, MicroStrategy's 402,100 BTC holdings are valued at approximately $38.20 billion, taking an average price of $95,000 per coin. After accounting for $4.57 billion in liabilities, its net Bitcoin assets stand at $33.63 billion. MicroStrategy currently trades at an NAV premium of approximately 2.54. Under various Bitcoin price scenarios, this premium has a dramatic impact on the implied share price: $95,000 BTC: Implied share price of $395 which is the current price. $250,000 BTC: Implied share price could soar above $1,000 at the same NAV multiple. $250,000 BTC with a tech premium such as 8x: Share price could exceed $3,400. HedgeMix The valuation further depends on MicroStrategy's ability to execute its 21/21 Plan and maintain its efficiency in acquiring Bitcoin. However, what is remarkable about the company's model, is that unlike traditional revenue sources that cannot be adjusted, Bitcoin's value could keep increasing as long as MicroStrategy keeps acquiring and holding it. If Bitcoin's price rises over time, ""Bitcoin revenue"" grows in parallel. Assuming a Bitcoin price from $75,000 up to $1,000,000 and various multiples on NAV, we can extrapolate some price estimates for MicroStrategy, from the most conservative to the most bullish scenario. (This valuation also assumes that BTC holdings remain constant). HedgeMix Now, you also might be worried if this is a very bullish target price for Bitcoin. We are simply using some publicly available valuation methods like the Bitcoin rainbow chart , which is predicting an average Bitcoin price between $200,000 and $1,820,000 by 2032. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart And it looks like we are being conservative here. The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model by PlanB is forecasting a price of $5 million by 2032, based on the assumption that the ongoing supply reduction will continue driving the price upwards. And we're not the only ones sharing this bullish sentiment. Here are some predictions for Bitcoin's price by analysts within the next 8 years: HedgeMix Now, if you are worried about the 2.54x NAV premium, you really have no reason to. The company is essentially offering Bitcoin exposure as a regulated equity vehicle, something that institutional investors love. It is also a tax-advantaged way for retail investors to hold Bitcoin through retirement accounts. Lastly, the company is still generating cash flows through its software segment, justifying an extra premium. As for the worries about liquidation, although valid, we really see no reason to stress at the current Bitcoin price levels. MicroStrategy's average Bitcoin price is around $58,000 . As volatile as the digital currency is, there is a long way to go before it drops to those levels that could force the company to start liquidating its holdings. Lastly, the company is currently borrowing at essentially 0% interest rates, and in any worst-case scenario, it is still generating some decent cash flows that could help weather any potential storm. Catalysts Donald Trump's recent presidential victory is widely seen as favourable for Bitcoin, as he intends to create a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Growing legislative support, thanks to Senator Cynthia Lummis's BITCOIN Act, is also bullish for Bitcoin. Any positive catalysts for the cryptocurrency translate to bullish momentum for MicroStrategy. A potential inclusion to the Nasdaq 100 Index in the next rebalancing before the end of the year could attract inflows from ETFs like QQQ, QQQM, and QQQE, estimated at close to $1 billion. Upcoming changes in accounting standards after December 15 will allow MicroStrategy to report its Bitcoin holdings at market value, which could be seen as a positive event for shareholders. Ben Werkman on X Summary We are very bullish on the long-term potential for MicroStrategy and Bitcoin in general. The company's revolutionary strategy of converting fiat capital into a deflationary and appreciating asset is appreciated by Wall Street as well. If Bitcoin's price continues to surge beyond $100,000, MicroStrategy could see its NAV multiply even further. This will translate to more demand for shares, which will keep outpacing dilution and keep pushing the share price higher. Our target share price is close to $1,000. Although some risks are evident, the market's enthusiasm reeks of confidence in this stock, and so do we. We believe there is more substance to the hype and there is still plenty of space for the company to grow.

Ripple (XRP) and the phase seven presale favorite IntelMarkets (INTL) are similarly attracting the interest of investors looking for big growth potential. While XRP has passed the $2 price for the first time since 2018, INTL has given early buyers a 610% return. Since this altcoin will also tap into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts may be worth $826B by 2030, experts are very bullish. They foresee INTL potentially soaring by 900% in 2025. Kyle Chassé: Traders Should Watch Solana (SOL) Carefully for Price Growth Solana (SOL) is showing some green price charts as one of the best cryptos. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana jumped over 35% in the past month alone. During that time, its value moved between $165 and $223. Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé also remains optimistic for Solana (SOL). According to his X post, this altcoin has seen its highest monthly close. This is very bullish behavior that could lead to more price growth. This Solana price prediction is also backed by its technical analysis. TradingView shows that the Solana coin now trades above its 50-day EMA ($206) and 100-day EMA ($185). This could mean further upside potential. Pharaoh Makes a Bullish Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction Ripple (XRP) is another altcoin experiencing price growth right now. On the one-week chart, the Ripple price increased from $1.45 to $2.43, a 70% surge in just a few days, according to CoinMarketCap. The technicals for Ripple (XRP) are also showing some good signs. TradingView shows that this altcoin trades above its 10-day EMA of $1.79 and its 20-day EMA of $1.47. Additionally, its MACD level sits at 0.36, which is in the buy zone and suggests a good entry point for buyers. Market expert Pharaoh also made a bullish Ripple price prediction. In his X post, he said that this altcoin could see a surge to a new ATH soon. In other words, the Ripple crypto may jump past $3.40 soon. IntelMarkets (INTL) Soars 610%, Further Gains Incoming IntelMarkets (INTL) is also capturing attention as one of the hottest new ICOs. It has already seen a price surge of 610%. Since this presale is now in phase seven, this percentage will continue rising before it ends. People are excited about the long-term growth potential of IntelMarkets as it will introduce the first AI-powered smart trading platform. On it, people will find many features that do not exist anywhere else, like self-learning trading robots, autopilot bots, and more. By holding the INTL token, traders will also receive: Governance Voting Rights: The ability to vote on important issues for the platform. Reduced Trading Fees: Up to 30% discounts on trading fees. First Access: INTL holders will get new IntelMarkets products and features first. Currently, one INTL costs only $0.064, a 610% surge from its starting presale price of $0.009. However, phase eight will bring another jump to $0.073. Additionally, a top-tier crypto exchange may trigger a rally to $0.11. In other words, those who buy this altcoin now may get a 71% return. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Soar Like Solana (SOL) & Ripple (XRP)? Although Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are among the top 10 altcoins right now, experts are also bullish on IntelMarkets (INTL). They think that INTL could see faster price growth as it has a smaller market cap. Therefore, many experts forecast a potential 900% surge for INTL sometime in 2025.

CLSK stock valuation remains attractive, with significant capacity growth and a substantial Bitcoin treasury, suggesting further upside potential if Bitcoin prices rise. CleanSpark's high short interest (19%) could lead to volatility but also offers potential for swift stock movement upon an upside breakout. Despite risks like rising Bitcoin difficulty and volatility, CleanSpark's strategy and bullish Bitcoin outlook support a Strong Buy rating. CleanSpark overview Bitcoin miner CleanSpark ( CLSK ) posted fourth quarter earnings on Monday night, and the stock is off about 6% pre-market following the report. The last time I covered CleanSpark was in early October, and the stock is up 68% since then. Seeking Alpha At the time, I called out a bottoming pattern in the chart that looked like it had strong potential, as well as a compelling valuation. The bottoming pattern certainly worked out as the stock has added two-thirds to its value since, but the valuation hasn’t really budged. As we dig into the fourth quarter results, the fact that the valuation hasn’t moved has me remaining quite bullish. Let’s dig in. CLSK stock - Resistance overhead, but only a matter of time That’s how I’m viewing the price chart today, following that huge advance. We have what should be a strong resistance level right around $15, which was the bottom of the trading range from February to July. When that broke, it was a nasty development. However, if the stock can sustainably reenter that range, I think it could be off to the races. StockCharts We can see the stock closed on Monday right under that level after a failed move in November. For now, we have the PPO in positive territory, and a neutral Chaikin Money Flow index. The stock is trading right at the 20-day EMA pre-market, and just over the relative high from October. This is a decision point for investors as we are either going to see it bounce from these levels, or suffer a larger breakdown. My absolute line in the sand in terms of short-term support is the rising 50-day SMA, currently just under $12. Obviously, the direction of Bitcoin itself is critical, and I detailed my views on the OG alt-coin recently. StockCharts Bitcoin is obviously consolidating after its parabolic move following the US election. We have a lower high in place now, so unless and until we get a move over $100k, Bitcoin is drifting sideways to down. This is normal after parabolic moves, so I’m not concerned; investors have to take moves like this into account, and you’ll get sellers into profit. The first level to watch is the 20-day EMA at ~$93k, and then the 50-day SMA at ~$81k. I don’t think we’re going to see the 50-day SMA anytime soon, but I would not be surprised to see the 20-day EMA taken out temporarily during this consolidation phase. While the short-term looks choppy, I absolutely remain bullish on Bitcoin, and believe it is only a matter of time before we get a bunch of new highs. Should that be the case, it stands to reason CleanSpark and the other miners should follow suit. On the valuation front, I’ve recreated the chart I showed back in October noting that CleanSpark’s valuation relative to Bitcoin had plummeted. StockCharts The blue rectangle is the time that has elapsed since my October article, and we can see the valuation really hasn’t moved. By extension, that means I’m still just as bullish on the valuation as I was then, fueling my still-bullish view on CleanSpark. Finally, CleanSpark’s short interest is a staggering 19% of the float, meaning that if we do get an upside breakout, we could see the stock move quite swiftly. Short interest is not the reason to buy or sell CleanSpark on its own. Short interest makes a stock extremely volatile, and stocks with high short interest often have it for a reason. But it’s a potential help for the bull case if and when we do get the breakout. A record year CleanSpark’s full-year results showed revenue more than doubling year-over-year to $379 million, although it did miss expectations by about $7 million. GAAP earnings came to a loss of 69 cents per share, again missing estimates. However, I’m not particularly concerned about current results with CleanSpark; it’s in a high-growth phase where it’s rapidly investing in and deploying capacity, as well as building its Bitcoin treasury for future value. The company’s strategy has been to continue to prioritize owned infrastructure in building its hashrate, which is now on course for 37 EH/s by the end of the year, and 50 EH/s into 2025. In the past year, the company has added 423 MWs to its portfolio, which more than doubled its capacity over that period to 726 MW. CleanSpark noted it has hundreds of MW in the near-term pipeline ready to deliver, which will continue to boost its capacity to mine. CleanSpark’s capacity helped it produce about 7,100 Bitcoin. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $246 million, up enormously from $25 million in the prior year. While GAAP earnings were negative, the company’s EBITDA number shows sustained progress on building capacity profitably. As we’ve seen corporations hold Bitcoin as a store of value, the balance sheets of miners have taken on new significance. CleanSpark ended the year with $122 million in cash and equivalents. In addition, it held just over 8,000 Bitcoin, and produced 655 more in October, subsequent to the end of the quarter. Just the balance at the end of September is worth about $760 million at today’s Bitcoin price, so it’s a massive portion of the company’s market cap. Keep in mind that as CleanSpark continues to build its Bitcoin balance – which it can do given it has plenty of cash to operate and build its mining capacity – its correlation to Bitcoin’s price should rise. That helps drive the bull case given the relatively low valuation of CleanSpark to Bitcoin. While CleanSpark showed a net loss for the fiscal year, the company continues to build capacity, as well as its Bitcoin hoard. Q4, then, shows in my view, continued progress for the bulls, and a share price that doesn’t yet fully reflect the company’s potential. Risks to consider Obviously, CleanSpark is not exactly a safe and stable stock, as it carries with it significant risk. However, with significant risk comes significant potential reward, and I suspect that if you’re looking for a blue chip to park retirement money, you wouldn’t be here. Any potential position you might take should be carefully considered, and prudently sized. One of the things that is out of CleanSpark’s control that can impact the bull case is its ability to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Bitcoin difficulty continues to rise – as it will forever – meaning it takes more capacity to mine the same amount of Bitcoin, all else equal. CoinWarz Difficulty is at its highest-ever level once again, and this will simply continue to rise over time. The rate at which it rises is of particular interest to miners, CleanSpark included. The risk here is that if difficulty moves a lot higher, it means the number of Bitcoin that can be added to the balance sheet declines. Another risk is that the price of Bitcoin itself falls significantly. I’ve made it clear I don’t think that’s likely to happen, but it definitely could. If it does, CleanSpark shares are likely to suffer meaningfully. Lastly, volatility and short interest are factors here. I touched on this earlier, but wanted to drive the point home. For some context on CleanSpark’s volatility, the implied volatility of at-the-money options for one month from now is about 150%. That’s 15X the S&P 500, so that’s what you’re dealing with here. That level of volatility in and of itself is a risk to shareholders. I mentioned short interest earlier, and we have nearly one-fifth of the float shorted today. However, with all factors taken into account, I believe CleanSpark is likely to continue its bull run, particularly given my bullish stance on Bitcoin itself. CleanSpark should benefit from higher Bitcoin prices, and potentially from its extremely low valuation relative to Bitcoin normalizing. I’m reiterating my Strong Buy on CleanSpark after FQ4 results.",CLSK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-03 13:55:11

Expert investors believe that the DTX Exchange could surpass the XRP price by 2025. There are some positive developments in Ripple's regulatory case, but DTX Exchange has the edge with its robust infrastructure and industry-disrupting capabilities. This guide will check how the Ripple-SEC ruling can impact XRP price and why DTX Exchange can surpass major altcoins in 2025. Ripple-SEC Lawsuit Update: Final Verdict Timeline Shortened Ripple has been handed a significant win with the granting of a motion for upset and the US court's decision to speed up the final judgment in the Ripple SEC case is a generous stride towards victory. This development is essential in the long battle that has plagued XRP, the native token of Ripple. Ripple acquired this latest success following the SEC's failure to prove its case in favor of it, which is presently affecting the regulatory events in the U.S. Jeremy Hogan, the attorney supporting Ripple predicted that the SEC case could be concluded around the middle of 2025, especially if there is a change in the leadership at the SEC. As expected these news have made a big impact on the XRP price rise and a new SEC chair is being expected to take over the battle hence igniting hopes that this legal battle may soon be over. How Will It Impact XRP Price? The effect of this win on the XRP price can now be seen, as it has increased by nearly 15% in the last three sessions. The $1.65 is the local resistance level, which can be a barrier to the XRP price. Due to the Trump win and SEC case developments, the XRP price has already broken the multi-year resistance, which can soon create a new all-time high. However, the XRP price has already extended; hence, traders are advised to be cautious while trading. DTX Exchange Undervalued Price See Huge Demand According to the extrapolation, the DTX Exchange could rise to $5 in the first half of 2025, making the current price of $0.1 highly undervalued. This projection is based on the upcoming launch of the DTX Exchange on Tier-1 exchanges like Binance. Also, the outstanding fundamentals of DTX Exchange play an important role in its growth story. DTX Exchange uses advanced technology like VulcanX and AI to create the best trading platform. It aims to bridge the gap between conventional and digital finance with a strong positioning in DeFi. Features like multi-asset trading and 1,000x leverage, along with community benefits like incentives and active rewards, make DTX Exchange stand out in the crowd. Also, the advanced trading tools like quantitative and algorithmic trading make it an updated and advanced trading solution for modern-age traders. The testnet launch has proved its efficiency, recording 10,000 transactions per second, one of the highest in the industry. Also, Solid Proof, a well-known audit firm, has reviewed DTX Exchange tokens. The audit confirms the platform’s security, giving you confidence to investors.

Chromia , ta Layer 1 platform that combines blockchain with relational databases, has announced the launch of the Asgard mainnet upgrade. The mainnet is the first major technical update for the blockchain, introducing new features designed to enhance the capabilities of the blockchain. The Asgard mainnet also introduces specialized Extensions – Oracle Extension and AI Inference Extension – to support the growth of decentralized finance and AI-enabled applications on the Chromia Network. These Extensions are a modular system that adds specialized capabilities to Chromia’s relational blockchain. In addition, they provide customization to decentralized applications and complement the platform’s core features, including its relational data architecture, modular network design, and gas-free economic model for end users. Asgard Mainnet Introduces Oracle Extension The first Extension launched, following Asgard’s unveiling, is the Oracle Extension . This Extension will bridge the gap between off-chain and on-chain environments, providing real-time data feeds to DApps on the platform. These data feeds are updated with each block, meaning fast, sub-second updates. This continuous data flow ensures that Chromia DApps can operate with accuracy and reliability. In addition, the Extension supports the development of complex DeFi applications such as decentralized exchanges, futures and options platforms, and lending protocols. These protocols receive critical price data, ensuring precise trade execution and secure collateral management. “The Oracle Extension lays the groundwork for an expansion of decentralized finance activity on the Chromia network and the growth of network value,” said Ludvig Öberg, VP of the Chromia Platform Unit. The Oracle Extension is part of Chromia’s plan to interconnect with the broader crypto and blockchain ecosystems. It adds to the recent developments in integrating CHR and the Chromia Network with select centralized exchanges (CEXs) and cross-chain wallets. This aims to make Chromia more accessible and interconnected, driving increased user activity and total value locked (TVL) on the network. AI Inference Extension Set To Launch Q1 2025 The team statement also confirmed the launch of the second piece of the Chromia Extensions puzzle – AI Inference Extension. Expected to launch in Q1 2025, the AI Inference Extension is a module that will enable developers to execute AI models directly on-chain using Chromia’s decentralized provider network. The project’s recently formed Data and AI Division is focused on creating tools to enhance transparency in AI training data and inputs. Yeou Jie, Head of Business Development at Chromia, explained the benefits and futuristic innovations set to be brought about by the Extension’s launch, stating: “As the world’s only relational blockchain, Chromia has demonstrated its ability to bring transparency to AI and other data-intensive use cases. The AI Inference Extension will take this a step further, enabling on-chain execution of AI models.” A public demonstration of the Oracle Extension has been released following the Asgard upgrade. Notwithstanding, the Extension will also be integrated into several DApps, with the team expecting the Oracle to support other DApps apart from DeFi, including AI, gaming, and enterprise use cases. Finally, the team also announced its plans to continue bridging blockchain technology solutions with real-world problems and expand its potential in areas such as data availability, and zero-knowledge solutions slated for future releases.

Launching on December 3, the staking initiative allows ORBT holders to generate passive income by relying on Orbitt’s buyback mechanism to not only enhance their holdings but also contribute to ecosystem growth. Orbitt staking program In addition to staking rewards, ORBT stakers will gain access to Orbitt PAD, a new launchpad for exclusive, rigorously tested projects. Orbitt promises up to $100 thousand in funding, marketing, and development assistance to support these projects. Pixel, Orbitt’s founder, described the initiative as an example of Orbitt’s dedication to sustainable growth: We’re thrilled to bring ORBT staking to our community and reward those who believe in our long-term vision. This program exemplifies Orbitt’s dedication to sustainable growth and genuine value creation. — Pixel Marketing Lead DataNinjaa shared Pixel’s sentiment: This isn’t just about staking. It’s about rewarding trust and participation in a community-centric ecosystem. — DataNinjaa Orbitt’s buyback wallet The staking initiative is fueled by Orbitt’s buyback wallet , which holds over 5 million ORBT tokens (~25% of the total supply). A new buyback mechanism funded by fees from Orbitt’s MM Volume Booster services ensures these tokens are always replenished. Participants have four staking tiers at their disposal, with staking for 30 days yielding 2x rewards, scaling to 4x if users commit to 180 days. In addition, every Volume Boosting package purchase triggers an automatic ORBT token buyback, contributing to market demand and the token’s value. New partnerships on Orbitt This launch follows Orbitt’s recent expansion of its middle-man (MM) services to platforms like Pump.fun, Meteora, and Raydium . As Orbitt continues to grow, the ORBT token is expected to play a central role in the ecosystem. Most importantly, the token will be used to unlock new products, enable access to Orbitt PAD, and reward community members.

Under the agreement, announced Tuesday, Minima will work with ARM's Flexible Access Program , which gives 70 or so startups access to the hardware giant’s intellectual property portfolio and chip design system. The “Minima Chip” will provide each device with a secure node capable of verifying data, generating tokens, enabling peer-to-peer messaging and generally bringing “blockchain everywhere,” the companies said. The concept of IoT and blockchain first emerged with projects like IOTA , and the idea has become part of a wider trend in crypto known as decentralized physical infrastructure networks ( DePIN ), which includes use cases around telecoms (Helium) and storage (Filecoin). Much of Minima’s effort to date has been in the auto industry, working with companies such as Volvo, running full nodes within the head units of cars to underpin things like telemetry data attestation, battery passports and enhancing EV charging flexibility using tokens generated by private wallbox charging devices. Blockchain-embedded chips offer a sleek and secure design approach, as opposed to initial testing phases in a sandbox, when it’s fine to download software, said Minima CEO Hugo Feiler. For live enterprise deployment, it’s preferable to isolate the operations of the blockchain from the complexity of an existing tech stack by having it captured on a chip, he said. Having each device do proof of work also brings a guarantee of decentralization, although the actual mining happens in a much more collaborative manner using the Minima consensus system, Feiler said. He used the analogy of a motorway as a “classic example of a permissionless network.” “It’s the road that everyone has to use, and you've got Volvos, Audis and Teslas etc that don't trust each other, but they have to be able to trust the information and the data that is coming from those devices,” Feiler said in an interview. “So it's about enabling secure communication between those vehicles, and transparent value as well, such as deployment across EV charging infrastructure.” Neil Parris, ARM's director of partner success and business models, said the access program accelerates startup innovation and time to market. “With ARM Flexible Access, new players like Minima gain a streamlined, cost-efficient route to prototype development, giving them the freedom to experiment and design with confidence,” Parris said in a statement.",Tech|IoT|Distributed Ledgers,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIL|MARKET|IOTA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-03 14:00:00

Thus, the question remains whether buyers can regain control and defend this level once more. As uncertainty looms, all eyes are on this critical zone, which could determine whether Bitcoin bounces back or faces a deeper downward trajectory. With market volatility increasing, this article aims to delve into BTC’s renewed drop toward the $93,257 support level, assessing the likelihood of a bullish defense at this critical point. It examines technical patterns, market sentiment, and key levels to better gauge Bitcoin’s next price direction. Bitcoin Slides Back Toward $93,257 On the 4-hour chart, BTC exhibits negative sentiment, attempting to drop below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward, with its sight set at the $93,257 support level. Furthermore, a continued descent to this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, the asset could experience more declines. Also, an analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 44%, following a failed attempt to break above the 50% mark. This indicates a struggle to sustain upward momentum and points to moderate bearish pressure, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. If the RSI continues to drop, it may signal heightened selling activity. On the daily chart, the crypto giant displays significant downside movement, highlighted by bearish candlesticks after a failed recovery attempt to surge toward its previous high of $99,575. The inability to sustain the previous uptrend implies a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing pessimistic sentiment in the market. As Bitcoin aims at the $93,257 support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates growing bearish momentum, with the signal line retreating to 62% from the overbought zone. This means that upside pressure is fading, and a shift in market sentiment may be underway. Given that the RSI continues to decline, it could signal a pullback or consolidation, with decreasing buying interest and the potential for bears to take control. Market Sentiment: Bulls Vs. Bears At $93,257 Bitcoin is currently aiming for a retest of the critical $93,257 support level, setting the stage for a battle between bulls and bears. If the bulls manage to defend this key level, BTC could begin to rise again, aiming for its previous high of $99,575. A successful breakout above this level could pave the way for a new all-time high. However, should the bears dominate at this support level, Bitcoin could continue its decline toward the $85,211 mark. A break below this level might trigger more downside, pushing the price toward additional support zones.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|btc|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Relative Strength Index|RSI|Simple Moving Average|SMA,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 14:00:06

Bitcoin Withdrawal Linked to US Government's Removal of 10,000 Silk Road BTC, According to QCP Reports In its latest market update, QCP noted that the news triggered a shift in market sentiment, with the front-end volatility curve tilting more toward put options rather than calls. This trend suggests an increase in bearish betting or hedging activity among traders in response to the large-scale trading. Despite the decline in cryptocurrency markets, traditional stocks continued to rally, with the S&P 500 hitting its 54th all-time high this year, underscoring the ongoing strength of broader financial markets. The Bitcoin market has historically responded to significant movements of seized assets, particularly those associated with illicit activities such as the Silk Road case. Market participants often view such transfers as potential precursors to liquidation events, adding to short-term uncertainty and volatility. QCP’s analysis highlights the contrasting dynamics between crypto and stocks, with Bitcoin facing temporary headwinds while stocks continue to thrive amid broader economic optimism. *This is not investment advice.

In a recent X post , dtcpay announced that it will begin to strategically shift its support to only accommodate stablecoins for all of its token payments services, starting January 2025. Following this transition, the Singaporean payment firm will no longer support payments for Bitcoin( BTC ) and Ethereum( ETH ) starting next year. Despite both BTC and ETH still maintaining their spots as the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. “This means we will phase out support for Bitcoin and Ethereum by the end of this year, all other stablecoin & fiat currency services will continue to remain available,” said the firm in a post. 🧵1/ Major Announcement: dtcpay Will Support #Stablecoin & Fiat #Payments Starting January 2025 As we wrap up 2024, dtcpay is excited to announce that, starting Jan 2025, we will transition to only support stablecoins for all our Digital Payment Token ( #DPT ) payment services. pic.twitter.com/lCrWuJdHeZ — dtcpay (@dtc_pay) December 3, 2024 You might also like: Singapore Gulf Bank wants to raise at least $50m to buy stablecoin firm: report Moreover, dtcpay plans to extend support to more stablecoins to its payments services, including First Digital USD( FDUSD ) and Worldwide USD, in addition to the currently supported Tether( USDT ) and USD Coin( USDC ). The reason behind dtcpay’s transition to a stablecoin-only model is to “provide our customers with a more reliable, scalable, & secure payment experience.” Stablecoins have grown in popularity for banks and other payment firms in many parts around the world due to their value reliability, as it is pegged to fiat currencies, most often the U.S dollar. The firm’s shift to stablecoin payments reflect a wider adoption trend going on in Singapore. According to data from Chainalysis , stablecoin payments in Singapore have surged to almost $1 billion USD in the second quarter of 2024. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, this value went up 100% from nearly reaching $500 million. The report also revealed that 75% of payments that use Singaporean stablecoin XSGD were valued at $1 million or below, with nearly 25% of transfers valued below $10,000, which indicates a growing adoption rate for retail activity. In November 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore released a regulatory framework aimed at enhancing the stability of single-currency stablecoins. As previously reported by crypto.news, the regulations apply to non-bank issuers of single-currency stablecoins linked to the Singapore dollar or other G10 currencies, if their circulation goes over S$5 million.

As stablecoins see growth in payment use cases—ranging from peer-to-peer transactions and online merchant payments to cross-border B2B payments and corporate treasury solutions—Orbital has identified a critical need for comprehensive data to quantify their adoption for consumer-sized payments. “Stablecoins are transforming global commerce, but businesses lack clarity on how to leverage them effectively for consumer payments,” said Luke Wingfield Digby, Co-Founder of Orbital and head of the company’s dedicated research team. “Our new dashboard fills this gap, providing actionable insights on which tokens, blockchains, and exchanges are driving consumer adoption in this fast-evolving space.” Key Insights from the Dashboard Orbital’s Stablecoin Payments Dashboard offers a novel view into stablecoin consumer payment trends: Continued Growth Across Market Cycles: Adoption of stablecoins for consumer payments has steadily increased, demonstrating resilience through crypto market fluctuations and a strong product-market fit for payments. Token Dominance: Tether’s USDT leads with over 90% of stablecoin transactions for consumer payments, underscoring its continued preference among users. Blockchain Preferences: TRON is the market leader in terms of being the blockchain of choice for consumer payments, holding 44% market share. Binance Smart Chain (37%), Polygon (4.5%), and Solana (3.3%) follow, with all other blockchains combined making up the remaining 11%. Payment Wallets: Consumers favour making stablecoin payments from exchange accounts (66% share) rather than self-hosted wallets (34% share). Binance is the clear lead, with OKX the runner up, and then a very long tail of exchanges with small market share beyond that. Regional Trends: The EMEA region emerges as a hotspot for consumer stablecoin payments, with activity peaks corresponding to populous countries such as Turkey, Nigeria, India, and Pakistan. Methodology Behind the Dashboard The Orbital Stablecoin Payments Dashboard tracks stablecoin adoption for the “payments” use case by analysing consumer-size transactions (up to $10,000). Partnering with blockchain analytics leader Artemis.xyz , the dashboard focuses on filtering out unrelated activity like DeFi and speculative trades, ensuring accurate insights into payment trends. In addition to on-chain data, Orbital plans to integrate additional data sources for a holistic view of stablecoin usage across industries and regions. This methodology empowers businesses with actionable insights into stablecoin payment behaviours. Empowering Businesses in a Stablecoin Era The dashboard equips businesses with the intelligence they need to decide which tokens and blockchains to support for accepting crypto and moving money cross-border, ensuring they remain at the forefront of consumer payment stablecoin adoption trends. It also provides insights into consumer behaviour, helping businesses adapt their payment strategies for a rapidly evolving digital payments landscape.

The top US crypto exchange came under fire online after it announced last week that it wouldn’t support Celo’s ( CELO ) upcoming migration from a standalone layer-1 chain to an Ethereum layer-2. Multiple Celo executives blasted the decision, including Celo Foundation president Rene Reinsberg and Marek Olszewski, the chief executive of Celo developer cLabs, who said Coinbase’s announcement felt “like a wrench in Ethereum’s layer-2-centric scaling roadmap.” Coinbase, however, says it plans to “reevaluate” Celo L2 after the technical migration is complete . “Any accusation that Coinbase does not support the scalability of Ethereum is not true. Coinbase is focused on being a bridge to the cryptoeconomy and we are in support of L1s and L2s.” The exchange says its customers must withdraw any CELO from their accounts by January 13th. The project is scheduled to migrate to a layer-2 solution on January 16th. Celo says the migration will have numerous technical benefits. “Native bridging between Celo and Ethereum, which was previously not possible, will now be a reality. This advancement significantly enhances the security of token transfers by reducing reliance on external bridges, which have often been a point of vulnerability. With native bridging, Celo can offer a more secure and streamlined experience for users, ensuring that transactions within our ecosystem are both safe and reliable.” Celo launched a layer-2 testnet in July.

Tenreiro, has joined the agency as its Chief Litigation Counsel, sparking discussions in the crypto market. This appointment by the SEC indicates that despite optimism over pro-crypto regulation after Donald Trump’s election win, the agency maintains its strict stance toward the digital assets space. Notably, Tenreiro has faced immense criticism from the crypto community for his aggressive stance against the digital assets space. Ripple Lawsuit Lead Attorney Joins US SEC As Chief Litigation Counsel The lead attorney for the US SEC in the Ripple lawsuit, Jorge G. Tenreiro, has joined the agency as its Chief Litigation Counsel, his LinkedIn profile shows. This development has once again fueled speculations in the market, especially after the market expected a dovish stance by the US SEC with Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement. The development was also highlighted by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, with many criticizing the agency for such a move. In addition, given the aggressive viewpoint of Tenreiro towards the crypto sector, many anticipate the agency to continue with its harsh stance ahead. Source: Bill Morgan, X Meanwhile, last week digital assets enthusiasts were hoping for the crypto cases to drop by the US SEC under Trump’s administration. However, with the latest move to appoint Tenreiro as Chief Litigation Counsel, the agency is likely signaling its commitment towards strict crypto oversight. Notably, previously, Tenreiro has led the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. He was also responsible for some of the most crucial cases of the US SEC. Besides, his role in the XRP lawsuit has further highlighted his aggressive enforcement tactics toward the crypto space. What It Means For The Crypto Market? The Ripple lawsuit has recently gained notable traction after the blockchain firm won a court order to speed up the judgment procedure in the XRP case . This has triggered a massive rally in the XRP price , sending it to number three position in the top crypto by market cap list. However, with this recent appointment of Jorge G. Tenreiro by the US SEC, many anticipate a topsy-turvy scenario ahead for the broader crypto market. This promotion would grant him additional authority in the agency, aiding him in handling the upcoming SEC cases. In addition, it also weighed on the investors’ sentiment, dampening hopes over pro-crypto regulations under the Republican administration. Notably, in a recent X post, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty urged the market enthusiasts not to “hire any lawyer who was involved in suing any crypto company or project”. Commenting on that, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton said “the number one lawyer on top of that list is Jorge Tenreiro.” These comments highlight Tenreiro’s reputation among the crypto market experts as well as enthusiasts. Having said that, the market might keep a close track of the future developments of the US SEC amid hopes of a favorable regulatory environment for the digital assets space under the Trump administration.

ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-next-in-line-after-xrp/,"Cardano could be the next to surge after XRP, as the ADA price shows signs of an imminent market recovery . A crypto analyst has projected that the ADA price could experience an epic breakout to $4.88 this bull cycle. The analyst has grounded his bullish prediction on the Cardano price action, providing insights into its potential future movements based on technical analysis and current market conditions. ADA Price Set Sights On $4.88 Alan Santana, a prominent TradingView analyst, has released a report declaring that additional price growth for Cardano is possible in this bull cycle. Sharing a detailed price chart of Cardano’s movements from 2021 to the present and its future price trajectory, the analyst projected a significant rise to $4.88 by 2026. Alan Santana revealed that the ADA price has been in a long consolidation phase for 915 days since May 2022. Surprisingly, the popular altcoin had broken out of this range earlier this month , producing the highest bullish volume ever seen. Cardano’s current market position indicates that it is steadily emerging from a market bottom , a development that often precedes a sustained upward trend. Alan Santana has underscored that Cardano’s recent trend shift is only the beginning, as the cryptocurrency has more room for growth in this bull cycle. Furthermore, the analyst revealed that the primary focus of his technical chart analysis is not to predict a new all-time high or determine how far up Cardano will reach by 2025 . Instead, the analysis aims to highlight Cardano’s short-term price action based on a long-term chart. Looking at his price chart, Alan Santana has pinpointed the 0.8875 Fibonacci level as the main support level for Cardano. This support was initially a resistance level ADA had conquered during last month’s bullish breakout. The analyst underscored that the breakout signified the highest level the ADA price had reached since May 2022. Alan Santana has predicted that if Cardano can break above the main support at 0.8875, the market sentiment will remain “super bullish,” and additional price growth should be expected. On the other hand, if Cardano fails to break the 0.8875 level, it could drop to a secondary support level at 0.6330. If Cardano faces a retracement to 0.6330, the TradingView analyst has emphasized that the cryptocurrency’s overall market structure will still remain strong. These solid fundamentals have prompted the analyst to forecast a major rally to $2 for ADA, if it can maintain a price above the 1.30 Fibonacci level. Will Cardano Mirror XRP Price Surge? Cardano is currently exhibiting potential that mirrors XRP, as the optimism surrounding the ongoing bull market could ignite a price surge for the ADA price . Since the beginning of the year, Cardano’s price has been stuck in a consolidated and declining state. This underperformance led to growing concerns among crypto members, with many labeling ADA a dead coin . However, with new signs of a potential price rally , Cardano could achieve XRP-like gains if market sentiment shifts in its favor. As of this writing, the price of XRP has been trading at $2.6 after surging by more than 428% in the past month.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA price|adausd|ADAUSDT|analyst|Cardano news|Cardano price|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 15:30:44

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme coin, retreated to $0.00002765, down by 16.2% from its highest level this month. This retreat was mostly due to the ongoing pullback of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin slipped below $95,000 as the rally to $100,000 seemed elusive. Still, crypto analysts believe that SHIB price has more upside now that the altcoin season index has jumped to 80. In most periods, meme coins like Shiba Inu tend to perform well when altcoins are rising. You might also like: XRP price surges 15% in 24H as network growth drives rally, but will it last?

In Shiba Inu’s case, these burned tokens come from fees in projects like Shibarium and ShibaSwap. Shibarium is the network’s layer-2 network, while ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange where users swap tokens. Data shows that the ShibaSwap has over $26 million in assets, while Shibarium has handled almost 600 million transactions. The BONE tokens collected in these chains are converted into SHIB and burned. Shiba Inu price could jump by 60% SHIB chart | source: crypto.news Technicals point to a potential SHIB price jump in the near term. It has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) flipped each other. This cross is a popular bullish sign in technical analysis. Shiba Inu has formed a cup and handle chart pattern, a popular sign of a bullish continuation. The recent consolidation is part of the handle portion of this pattern. Its MACD indicator has moved above the zero line, while the MVRV indicator has risen to 3.2. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back and retest the year-to-date high of $0.000045, which is about 63% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.0000022 will invalidate the bullish view.

Specifically, the project, which was continued by its community after Terraform Labs (TFL) collapsed in 2022, shows a 19.75% surge to LUNC’s press time price of $0.0001546 in the last 24 hours, and the 30-day chart is even more impressive, demonstrating that the token is up 89.80%. LUNC 30-day price chart. Source: CojnMarketCap Why did LUNC rally 80% in 30 days Such performance is not particularly surprising, given the good news associated with Terra Classic that emerged in recent months and the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. To begin with, Terraform Labs received court permission for its bankruptcy plan, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreeing to be paid only after creditors’ cryptocurrency claims are satisfied. The resolution fell in line with expectations , as evidenced by LUNC’s 5% climb in the 24 hours that preceded the hearing. Additionally, the price action has likely been driven by a massive deflationary move – the biggest burn in LUNC’s history – recorded in early November. The 137 billion token burn came shortly after the team announced the closure of the Shuttle Bridge interface and the elimination of all remaining cryptocurrency in the associated wallets. LUNC burn chart. Source: Lunc Metrics More broadly, numerous digital assets have recently entered into a frenzy as Donald Trump’s re-election – and the confirmation SEC Chair Gary Gensler will resign on January 20, 2025 – sent Bitcoin (BTC) toward $100,000 and Ethereum ( ETH ) above $3,500. The developments also enabled other prominent cryptocurrencies – long depressed by regulatory and similar issues – to skyrocket, with XRP , arguably the star of the current phase of the bull market, surging 403.20% in the last month. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Can LUNC make a massive comeback in 2025? Despite the current momentum – and despite deflationary measures implemented by the Terra Classic team – LUNC’s rally remains fraught. The token is well-known for its volatility, and the network’s staking and minting mechanisms remain a concern . Furthermore, Terra Classic’s association with one of the highest-profile cryptocurrency scandals and the collapse that, arguably, triggered the ‘crypto winter,’ means that the ongoing rally is probably more a sign of the broader digital assets optimism and the euphoria from the bankruptcy finally winding down than a show of confidence in LUNC’s future.

Specifically, Bitcoin is forming a potential head-and-shoulders on the hourly timeframe, a classic bearish technical pattern , according to cryptocurrency on-chain expert Ali Martinez in a post on X on December 3. Notably, the pattern is marked by a peak (the head) flanked by two lower peaks (the shoulders), and it has historically signaled a price reversal. In this case, Bitcoin is hovering near $95,000, aligning with the neckline of this pattern. Martinez suggested the target could plunge below $90,000 if a breakdown occurs.

Source: TradingView /Ali_charts With Bitcoin trading in the range of $94,000 and $95,000, Martinez noted that it is just above the critical support level at $93,000, marked by the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern. Bitcoin could revisit the demand zone around $91,000 and $90,000 if the support fails, potentially leading to further bearish momentum. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

The leading digital asset has flirted with this price target as part of the post-election bull run . Bitcoin’s push to $100,000 To this end, some analysts still believe there is a path to Bitcoin hitting a new record high. For instance, crypto trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe, in a post on X on December 3, stated that there is a need for patience, noting that if Bitcoin reclaims the $98,000 level, it will usher in the asset’s momentum toward the ‘magic wonderland’ of $100,000. “BTC still patiently waiting to break $98K to get ourselves into the magic wonderland of $100K+.

Source: TradingView Overall, as Bitcoin’s push toward $100,000 remains in focus, key market players are showing confidence in the asset. For instance, software company MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) has continued its Bitcoin buying spree, adding 15,400 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin. The acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 402,100 BTC, acquired for $23.4 billion at an average of $58,263 per BTC. The current value of its Bitcoin stash is estimated at around $38 billion. Regarding corporate investment in Bitcoin, attention is now on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), where the company’s shareholders will vote on a proposal to add the asset to the company’s balance sheet on December 10. If approved, this move could be the catalyst Bitcoin needs to break $100,000 before the year ends. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,126, reflecting losses of about 1.3% in the past 24 hours. In the weekly timeframe, the digital currency is up by 1.7%.

In the lofty role, Tenreiro will supervise the lawsuits and investigations within the Division of Enforcement that provide the backbone of the SEC’s regulatory work across industries. Tenreiro’s Path to Leadership Joining the SEC’s crypto assets and cyber unit as deputy chief in October 2022, Tenreiro rapidly rose to take the helm of the division when his predecessor, David Hirsch, left the agency in mid-2023. Under his tenure, the crypto unit launched several high-profile enforcement actions, including lawsuits against major exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken, and a lengthy court fight with Ripple Labs. His notable achievements included the record settlement of $4.47 billion from Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon, in what became the largest settlement in the history of the SEC. This historic settlement showcased Tenreiro as an aggressive enforcer within the financial world. A Controversial Figure Tenreiro’s hard-nosed approach to crypto enforcement has earned him praise and criticism in equal measure. Observers within the industry applaud him for holding players in an unregulated market to account, while critics such as crypto lawyer John Deaton claim that he has overplayed his hand, stifling innovation. His name is also associated with controversial cases, such as the SEC’s lawsuit against Terraform Labs and the accusations of misconduct during the agency’s probe into crypto firm Debt Box that forced two SEC attorneys to resign. A New Leadership Landscape Tenreiro’s appointment comes amid broader changes at the top of the SEC. Laura D’Allaird and Mark Sylvester have been appointed co-chiefs of crypto assets and cyber, a role previously held by Tenreiro. Meanwhile, Tenreiro’s elevation to the position comes amid the most politically charged era and possible regulatory changes under a new administration. President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to scale back scrutiny of the crypto industry could go a long way in determining the tone for the SEC’s enforcement agenda. By taking up the mantle, Tenreiro will be positioned at the fulcrum point to dictate not just the SEC’s enforcement game but probably that of crypto regulation in the United States.",Blockchain|Regulation|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-03 15:49:31

Veteran Analyst Reveals Possible Bullish Catalyst For This Spectacular Price Milestone,https://zycrypto.com/cardano-at-3-veteran-analyst-reveals-possible-bullish-catalyst-for-this-spectacular-price-milestone/,"Dan Gambardello, a veteran market analyst and founder of Crypto Capital Venture, is uber-bullish about Cardano (ADA). As one of the most outspoken advocates of ADA, he has forecasted that the coin could swiftly rocket to the ambitious $3 level. What Will It Take For ADA To Hit $3 Quickly? According to Dan Gambardello, Cardano presently has many positive developments within its ecosystem contributing to its latest upsurge. While he did not name the specific developments, Gambardello suggested that ADA could blast off to $3 if it secures bullish news about potential spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as XRP has done in recent times. In other words, he believes Cardano’s price could see an XRP-esque ballistic rally if asset managers file paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETFs offering traditional investors direct exposure to the ADA cryptocurrency. Such a development would broaden investors’ access to the cryptocurrency in America. Notably, XRP has been on a roll ever since Donald Trump defeated Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Nov. 6. The crypto is up 402% over the past 30 days while Cardano’s ADA has posted a 260% rally during the same timeframe. XRP Beats ADA In Terms Of ETF Applications After the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on U.S. exchanges, crypto spectators projected that Ripple’s XRP, Solana, and ADA would likely be the next cryptocurrencies to land on Wall Street. Although a slew of companies have already submitted filings with the SEC to introduce ETFs tied to XRP and Solana, no ADA application has been made so far. The only interesting thing related to ADA that has landed on the SEC’s desk is NYSE Arca’s request to convert Bitwise’s $1.4 billion crypto index fund to an exchange-traded product. The Bitwise fund currently holds popular assets, including Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Avalanche. Besides Bitwise’s basket application, XRP currently has four applications exclusively linked to the token from prominent asset managers such as Canary Capital , 21Shares , WisdomTree , and Bitwise . The XRP applications have increased after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he would resign when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office on January 20 — a development widely viewed as a positive for XRP, a coin that has been the focus of a prolonged suit under Gensler’s leadership.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-03 15:51:00

The trend appears more bullish daily as it poises for a big price movement. Litecoin ended last month’s trading on a strong bullish note after staying indecisive for almost three months. This bullish move started with a key break above the $77 level and the price formed a higher high and higher low pattern daily. Breaking slightly above the important $100 level, a rejection occurred and the price dropped back. The bulls pushed back and managed to close that month above the mentioned level. Interestingly, volatility increased this month and the price broke out of the yearly high. As seen on the daily chart, the trend seemed to have completely shifted to the upside as it now looks highly bullish. Negative sentiments have faded away and as shown on the daily chart, there’s no sign of selling at the moment. Even though the sellers show up, it must drop below $50 before we can consider a bearish shift. While this breakout has signalled a long-term move, Litecoin looks more bullish daily as it sets for massive growth. It has been on a buying spree since the start of the month following a 30% surge. Bigger gains are underway! LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Surging through the $140 level, the next target resistance level to watch for buying is $150. If they claim it, $160 would be the next resistance level to keep in mind. The recently flipped yearly $113 high is the closest support level to keep in mind for a pullback. Dropping below this level could bring a retest at the $106 and $98.5 supports – all flipped in the past week.

Table of Contents PolitiFi tokens have huge impact on the crypto landscape More than a meme coin: political stakes are crypto’s killer app Join PolitiFi 2.0 with DUM FreeDum Fighters (DUM) is in the final innings of its presale with just four days left, having raised over $700k. As political-related cryptocurrencies continue to grab attention in 2024, FreeDum Fighters has seized the opportunity with the most unique project yet. Positioning itself as a PolitiFi leader beyond the U.S. election, FreeDum Fighters offers features that appeal to a broad user base. The project’s adoption is expected to rise as Trump takes office and ushers in a new era for cryptocurrencies. Trump’s inauguration in January makes political-focused cryptocurrencies an attractive opportunity for investors, and DUM is among the top picks. However, with the ICO ending in four days, there is limited time to attain this token at a fixed price of $0.000113. Don’t miss out – secure yours before it’s too late. PolitiFi tokens have huge impact on the crypto landscape The crypto market has changed dramatically in 2024, and the PolitiFi sector has been a big part of that. Tokens paying homage to political figures or events have risen and drawn hundreds of millions of dollars in investments. The hype around these tokens remains, with the PolitiFi sector seeing $287 million in 24-hour trading volume, reaching a $490 million market cap. Trump-themed token Patriot is a top gainer this week, pumping 36%. Meanwhile, Biden-themed Jeo Boden has posted an 11% gain. The ability of these tokens to create humor in an otherwise serious realm of society has been a big draw. Yet, no token has a balance of humor and politics quite like FreeDum Fighters, which seamlessly injects satirical narratives into innovative political utilities. The project introduces several captivating characters such as MAGATRON, Kamacop 9000, Dark MAGA (Elon Musk), Sleepy Joe. Through these entertaining characters, FreeDum Fighters cultivates a unique memetic-political synergy that positions it to lead the PolitiFi sector in 2025 and beyond. You might also like: MAGA-themed coin FreeDum Fighters raises over $500k in presale for PolitiFi 2.0 plans More than a meme coin: political stakes are crypto’s killer app Quite like the predictions market Polymarket, FreeDum Fighters offers users ways to engage with political events from the blockchain. Polymarket stands as crypto’s killer app in 2024, but FreeDum Fighters brings a twist. As mentioned, two of its characters are MAGATRON and Kamacop 9000. These are mechanized figureheads representing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Both have a corresponding staking pool – Trump’s is FreeDum, and Harris’s is LibDum. Users can stake their tokens in their favorite and earn rewards. Right now, Trump has the lion’s share of tokens in his pool – even though Kamacop 9000 has a higher APY. Why? Because users are choosing to support who they think will carry the industry forward rather than fatter profits. Beyond staking pools, FreeDum Fighters runs weekly debates in which users can engage in political discourse, arguing for or against that week’s chosen topic. The winning side earns DUM rewards. FreeDum Fighters is a lot more than a political meme coin. It’s a hotbed preparing for a new era of political and crypto alignment. We’re likely to see countless new use cases and trends emerge from the platform, so it’s not one you want to miss. All of this is turning a lot of attention to the project, especially considering its exchange debut is just four days away. In a recent video, top crypto analyst Crypto June said it is “Going to explode like MAGA Trump.” Join PolitiFi 2.0 with DUM Investors can take advantage of this unique project by participating in its presale at the ground floor price. To buy DUM, visit the project’s presale website, connect your wallet, and choose the amount of DUM to buy and the crypto to pay with. Rest assured that the project is safe and secure. It has received smart contract audits from Coinsult and Solid Proof , neither of which found issues with its code. Follow FreeDum Fighters on X or join its Telegram for updates.

Starting in January 2025, it will only support stablecoins for all payment services. The company will stop supporting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by December 2024. According to the announcement, dtcpay affirmed that this change is due to the high volatility of these cryptocurrencies. dtcpay Says Stablecoins is More Reliable Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to the value of stable assets, like the US dollar. They provide a more stable option compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. dtcpay focuses on these stablecoins to create a smoother and more reliable payment experience for users. Notably, this shift shows a growing trend in the fintech industry, where more people see stablecoins as a way to connect the volatile cryptocurrency market with everyday use. Meanwhile, the company will support stablecoins like First Digital USD (FDUSD) and Worldwide USD (WUSD), in addition to USDT and USDC. dtcpay will also continue supporting transactions in fiat currency, ensuring its services are open to everyone. The company’s focus on stablecoins matches global trends as more countries recognize and regulate stablecoins as valid options for digital payments. Wyoming to Launch Stablecoin Beyond dtcpay, the quest for stablecoins is growing across the globe. Recall that Wyoming is pushing for the next phase of its crypto sector growth. This time around, the state is looking at venturing into consumer payments. Wyoming plans to launch its United States dollar-pegged stablecoin as part of this new phase and has decided to name it Wyoming stable token. However, the stablecoin will launch officially in the first quarter of 2025. Wyoming hopes to offer individuals and businesses a faster and cheaper way to conduct transactions. Additionally, it serves as an extra source of revenue for the state. On a larger scale, Wyoming’s stable token will serve as a model for the future federal digital dollar. According to Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, success for the state is equivalent to “the adoption of a stablecoin… that’s transparent, that is fully backed by our short-term Treasurys [and] that’s dollar dependent.” Paxos Floats New Stablecoin USDG in Singapore Similarly, Paxos, a blockchain giant, introduced its latest stablecoin, Global Dollar (USDG) in Singapore. USDG reflects Paxos’s mission to combine secure compliance with innovative digital finance solutions. Ronak Daya, Paxos’s Head of Product, stressed the need for a solution that combines regulatory compliance with real economic incentives for enterprises. He expressed that USDG is a strategic response to the demand of modern businesses. Paxos partnered with DBS, Singapore’s largest bank by assets , ensuring secured management of USDG reserves. DBS is responsible for cash and custody management and ensuring institutions and individuals trust USDG’s reliability.

In an X post, Ju insisted that this altcoin season will be “weird and challenging” because only a few chosen assets will record significant gains and “win the game.” According to the CryptoQuant founder, the altcoin market sentiment is good, but the sector is not seeing a notable inflow of fresh liquidity, and this could hamper the growth of most crypto assets. Altseason to Play Out Differently The altseason refers to when capital flows from bitcoin (BTC) to other cryptocurrencies. During this time, BTC retraces its steps and consolidates within a particular range, its dominance and market share declining, while altcoins skyrocket and possibly hit new highs. From Ju’s perspective, BTC is drifting away from the crypto ecosystem and developing its own paper-based layer-2 entity. The CryptoQuant CEO said this development is being pushed by Bitcoin spot and futures exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and the stocks of Bitcoin-friendly companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR). Unfortunately, bridging from the paper-based L2 Bitcoin ecosystem to altcoins is impossible. Ju explained that altcoins used to move together due to their correlation with BTC; however, that pattern has broken, and only a handful of cryptocurrencies are showing independent traits because they are attracting new liquidity. “Alt season is no longer defined by asset rotation from #Bitcoin. The surge in altcoin trading volume isn’t driven by $BTC pairs but by stablecoin and fiat pairs, reflecting real market growth rather than asset rotation,” the crypto analyst clarified in a separate tweet . Following Bitcoin’s Path The CryptoQuant founder’s opinion is substantiated by altcoin market dynamics over the past 24 hours. While most large-cap altcoins have been in the red, others, like Ripple’s native token, XRP , and Chainlink ( LINK ), have skyrocketed to levels not seen in years. Meanwhile, Ju asserted that altcoins now have two options: build a real internet money ecosystem using stablecoins and BTC or create paper-wrapped versions like Bitcoin. He then suggested that altcoin investors find cryptocurrencies that can work on one of the two options and hold them long-term.

The current adjustment reflects a decrease to $2.64 from $26.40. This presents an opportunity for new network users to fund their wallets with a smaller amount of crypto, thereby attracting a larger user base. The modification was applied to XRP Labs nodes on October 16. However, adjusting the reserve requirement required a validator reset and a consensus vote from all validators, which only took place yesterday. Developers have said that the high reserve of 10 XRP has slowed down the network’s uptake, which was not why they made it high. They explained that the high reserve was meant to keep the record from getting too big for the nodes to store. They also wanted to stop people from making fake accounts with little to no XRP, so they made the 10 XRP reserve minimum. 1 XRP instead of 10 XRP – The details On December 2, blockchain data shows that XRP Ledger cut the base reserve needs from 10 XRP to just 1 XRP. This allows new network users to fund their wallets with less crypto, which could make it easier for more people to join. It also lets people spend some XRP that they would have had to save up before. XRP account reserve requirements The ledger developer WietseWind said, “The number one concern would be increased activity on the ledger to the point where it becomes a challenge for infrastructure.” He said that it was a good problem that they could handle. He also claimed that engineers would develop means to accommodate the extra strain on the network and could manage it. The change happened on 2nd December on the XRP ledger website. An XRP holder showed in an X post that owner reserves had gone down from 2 XRP ($5.12) to 0.2 XRP ($0.51). This means that users only need to hold on to 0.2 XRP for each item they own. XRP Ledger papers say that objects can be trust lines, signer lists, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or owner directories. Some oracles are also things that need to be reserved by their owners. XRP prepares for a seamless flight For a long time, Ripple Labs, the development team behind XRP, has conflicted with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple denies that XRP is a security and that the SEC should have registered it, but the SEC maintains that it is. Ripple is appealing the decision that penalized them $125 million in the lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghose said that XRP would have done better than Bitcoin if it had not been for the SEC’s distractions. Paul Atkins, the most highly anticipated SEC candidate, is one that crypto entities believe would give them an easy time. The decision to cut reserve requirements comes at a time when the XRP Ledger native coin is experiencing significant growth. Before Donald Trump was elected US president, XRP was worth less than a cent per coin. However, since the election, it has increased to $2.65, jumping 435% in 30 days to reach its highest level since February 2018. Large holders are significantly influencing this move. According to on-chain data, XRP has gone up 14% in the last 24 hours, doing better than Bitcoin and all the other big cryptos. Over the weekend, the token quickly beat Solana’s SOL and tether (USDT), and as of Tuesday, it was the third-largest token by market cap. In addition, XRP trading volume has also been reported to have hit $3.7 billion on the South Korean crypto Exchange – Upbit. Trading volumes of XRP tokens against the Korean won hit $3.7 billion on Upbit in the last 24 hours. With Trump entering office in 2025, Ripple will be more eligible to compete with other crypto companies without any distractions.

Facing a slight rejection, it appears indecisive while remaining strongly bullish. The past week saw XRP through another stunning rally as it doubled its price to hit a new multi-year high of $2.9 yesterday – an inch away from its all-time high – ATH. That level was rejected and the price retraced slightly to where it is changing hands at $2.73 at the time of writing. Currently, the bulls are trying to reiterate action, but there’s not enough volume to sustain the momentum as trading remains calm on the day. Looking back from where the price picked up in November, XRP is up by 5x with no signs of cooling off the rally. It appears highly bullish daily, but from a technical standpoint, the asset appeared to have reached an extremely overbought condition on the weekly chart. This suggests an imminent drop, which will likely happen anytime soon. Though there’s still room for an increase. But when the price reaches an exhaustion point, we may see a deep correction before resuming bullish. Surpassing BNB, Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT) in the last 48 hours of trading, XRP is the 3rd largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $155 billion at the time of writing. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview While the bulls are trying to sustain pressure, a daily candle close above yesterday’s $2.9 high should bring a full recovery to the current ATH of $3.3 before rallying hard to $3.7 and $4. Failure to push above the previous daily high could result in a retest of the flipped $1.9 high as support. Lower support levels to consider for a pullback are $1.63 and $1.28.

At the same time he also took a slight dig at Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO whose actions led to the collapse of the exchange and the wiped out billions in user funds. Buterin portrays Sam Bankman-Fried as the ultimate choice for crypto villains, highlighting their actions that put users’ funds at risk. Buterin believes that wallets are the window between a user and the Ethereum world, and a user only benefits from any decentralization, censorship resistance, security, privacy, or other properties that Ethereum and its applications offer to the extent that the wallet itself also has these properties. Emphasis Placed on Privacy And Security While he noted that there has been a lot of progress on improving user experience, security and functionality of Ethereum wallets, this post, particularly focuses on the ideal properties of an ideal Ethereum wallet, emphasizing security and privacy. While Security lies at the forefront of his vision, he advocates for social recovery mechanisms using multi-signature wallets. He noted that a good wallet should simultaneously be good in two areas: protect users from hacking or malicious activities by the wallet developer and from their own mistakes. His preferred solution to this has been social recovery and multisig wallets, with graded access control. He noted that more complicated guardian architectures, such as having multiple timelock durations at different thresholds, can help maximize the chance of successful legitimate account recovery while at the same time minimizing the risk of theft. But who or what should the guardians be? Experienced crypto users can use friends and family’s keys to create a fresh address, eliminating the risk of collusion. However, he also noted that this option is not available for most new users. A second option he noted was institutional guardians, that is firms that only sign transactions if they receive confirmation of the request, such as a confirmation code or video call for high-value users. However, these services have been attempted for a long time, but have not been successful thus far. Multiple personal devices can be challenging for inexperienced users and risky for theft or loss. Passkeys, backed up on devices or in the cloud, provide a hybrid of password security and hardware assumptions. While passkeys are valuable, they alone aren’t strong enough to protect life savings. ZK-SNARKs offer an option for converting centralized IDs like zk-email, Anon Aadhaar, and Myna Wallet into Ethereum addresses. These addresses can only be used for transactions if a ZK-SNARK proves ownership of the centralized ID. Privacy, an Everyday Feature He places emphasis on privacy as an everyday feature rather than an afterthought. He suggested that wallets should natively support multiple addresses per user, with each tied to specific applications. This would prevent activities from being traced across platforms. Integrated private transfer systems, powered by zero-knowledge technology, would make separate privacy-focused wallets redundant. Buterin’s essay suggests artificial intelligence could transform wallets into intuitive companions, analyzing patterns and propose preventive measures against threats, and help the crypto space grow beyond its current vulnerabilities.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 15:58:21

The cryptocurrency’s value doubled amid a broader market rally, reflecting increased investor enthusiasm and robust sentiment. The conclusion to the long-drawn battle between the US SEC and Ripple also plays a pivotal role in adding a tailwind to this uptrend. Ripple’s seven-year consolidation followed by its run-in with the SEC and the exponential rally, it wouldn’t be surprising to compare it to the electric car manufacturing company, Tesla. Both the assets share a similar price action and legal troubles. If this similarity continues, the technical outlook suggests that the XRP price could continue its ascent and multiply to a digit target. Will XRP Price Reach $13 Due to Ripple’s Shared Story With Tesla? The XRP price draws comparisons to Tesla’s historical stock performance, hinting at a potential surge to $13. A similarity has been noted between Tesla’s price action following its SEC lawsuit resolution and XRP’s current trajectory. Both assets experienced extended consolidation phases lasting seven years before breaking out after resolving their legal disputes with the SEC. This parallel has fueled speculation that XRP could replicate Tesla’s exponential rise. Tesla’s stock soared over 3,400% after overcoming its legal challenges, and if XRP price mirrors this trajectory, the cryptocurrency could see a significant upward move. Ripple’s victory in its SEC case earlier this year has provided a strong foundation for optimism. Source: TradingView Ripple Price Technical Analysis: XRP Soars to Six-Year High After 400% Rally Ripple price has skyrocketed this month, with Ripple climbing over 400%, reaching above $2.5, a six-year peak. At the time of reporting, the price of XRP is trading at $2.58, with a surge of 7% in the past 24-hours. The cryptocurrency now stands just 36% below its all-time high (ATH) of $3.84, achieved in January 2018. For the first time since then, XRP price has reclaimed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassing both Tether and Solana. Its market cap now sits at an impressive $156 billion. If top altcoin sustains its upward trajectory, it could soon break through the $3 mark. Analysts suggest the cryptocurrency may edge closer to its ATH of $3.84 if bullish momentum persists. The Relative Strength Index is currently at 85, indicating an overbought region for Ripple price. XRP price chart: TradingView Key Drivers Behind XRP’s Surge: Ripple is nearing a victory in its prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This potential win has significantly boosted investor confidence in XRP. Large-scale trades on Coinbase have driven up demand, increasing price premiums and providing substantial momentum for XRP’s recent rally. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is poised for release, pending approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The upcoming launch has further fueled market optimism. Ripple’s recent surge highlights its growing momentum, bolstered by regulatory clarity and market optimism.

The dog influencer who was the inspiration behind the memecoin $BERT is sadly no more. The report came last week that the adorable puppy had died in his sleep, in what his owner, Kathy Grayson, defined as a “sudden and shocking” moment. “We’ve been together almost every second of every day for more than 11 years,” she told the media. Adopted from Petfinder after his breeders abandoned him, Bert was more than just a dog for Kathy, he was her family, her light, and inspiration. Over the years, the 11-year-old Pomeranian had accumulated a strong following on social media. Besides having 400,000 followers on Instagram, he even appeared in a Netflix movie and did photoshoots for luxury brands. The Paddington Bear look-alike was recently part of the fun competition for the Honorary NYC Dog Mayor Election of 2024 when it caught the eye of the crypto community, which rallied behind the pooch and began marketing for the dog on social media, urging people to vote for Bert. This resulted in a flood of votes for Bertie, with the dog winning by about 96% and the election participants calling out “election fraud.” NYTimes reported Bert’s total votes rising to over 4,000, a sharp increase from about 1,000 votes it received in the first round. “It was really cuckoo with people alleging election fraud — in a dog election,” said Kathy. In her latest statement, Bert’s proud mom said the crypto community’s support was simply from “passionate individuals” showing their love for the dog. Eventually, Bert conceded, and another dog won while Bert became the deputy mayor. But it was earlier this month and now Bertie is no more. His memory, however, is alive with the memecoin. As the official website of this Solana-based memecoin states , “Abandoned by breeders, adopted and crowned by the people.” The community behind the $BERT memecoin is now focusing on turning this heartbreak into a global movement for good. And that is what “gives me hope is the incredible movement that has formed in his name,” said Kathy. From Pomeranian to Powerhouse: $BERT Inspiring the World These past two months, Bert has gone from being a beloved pet to inspiring one of the most remarkable memecoins. Launched at the beginning of October, $BERT started at a price point under $0.0001. At that time, its market cap hovered between a range of $500K and $5 million. That was up until November 13 when the value of the memecoin representing the pomeranian suddenly ripped up. The memecoin recorded a whopping 60x increase in its value as it went from almost $0.003 to $0.180, according to DEXTools . In a matter of just 48 hours, its market cap jumped over 125%, going from less than $1.4 million to $180 million, with tens of thousands of holders joining in to make it one of the most traded tokens on Phantom, Solana’s most popular wallet. Meanwhile, on the centralized exchange (CEX) MEXC , the $BERT price made an all-time high (ATH) at $0.218. Since then, the price has declined significantly, hitting about $0.040 on Nov. 21st. However, volatility is part of the course in the crypto sector, more so for memecoins, which are known for their heightened fluctuations. As of writing, the $54 million market cap $BERT is trading at $0.059 while managing $8.274 million in 24-hour trading volume. At This shows continued interest from investors in $BERT, as memecoins lead the crypto bull market narrative, which has also begun gaining traction among CEXs like Coinbase, Robinhood, Kraken, and Binance, as they start listing memecoins to capitalize on this trend. $BERT’s community is already growing steadily and strongly, with 25.46K holders now investing in $BERT, which has a total supply of just 980 million, all of which is circulating in the market. On the utility side, you can now spend $BERT in 136 countries with the new Zebec Silver Card. It’s super easy to use, works with Apple Pay and Google Pay, and there’s no cost to get started—no issuance fees, no KYC. On top of that, 1% of every $BERT transaction goes straight to dog shelter charities, so every time you spend, you’re helping dogs in need. So, the community-powered $BERT memecoin isn’t only about speculation, though. It is actually on a mission to help dogs worldwide, which holds even more significance in the aftermath of Bert’s departure from this world. The $BERT community is actively engaged in charity contributions to dog shelters, helping provide food, care, and resources. They have committed an initial $100K grant for the cause. Bert’s owner, Kathy, who now owns 1% of the $BERT supply that was originally granted to the dog, has also “pledged to hold” and use portions of it to help dogs in need worldwide, in Bert’s honor. A statue of Bert has also been commissioned in his memory. To further take the movement forward, the project has launched a $BERT-powered AI-driven platform called Woofhub that connects dogs in need with loving homes through real-time adoption alerts. At the same time, the project is raising awareness for shelters. Recently, BERT also introduced the WOOFhub Dog Collar , a new way to make life easier and safer for dogs and their owners. It comes with QR codes and NFC chips that connect to custom dog profiles on woofhub.com, so if a dog ever gets lost, reuniting them with their owner is quick and simple. The collar also has lights to keep dogs visible at night and can be personalized to match every pup’s unique vibe. It’s practical, thoughtful, and just the beginning of what WOOFhub is working on. This is all just the beginning, $BERT plans to further expand its tools and foster new partnerships to build a brighter future for our furry friends and have a much larger impact on the crypto ecosystem and the world.",Press Release,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-03 16:01:43

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL.

BlackRock's Spot Bitcoin ETF Surpasses 500,000 BTC in AUM This achievement comes less than a year after its debut on January 11, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. According to the fund’s latest disclosures, IBIT held 496,854 BTC as of Nov. 29. According to K33 data, single-day net inflows of $338.3 million (about 3,526 BTC) on Monday brought its total assets to 500,380 BTC. “This is unprecedented growth,” said Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33. “BlackRock’s IBIT has accumulated more than 500,000 BTC in just 233 trading days.” Ian Unsworth, co-founder of Kairos Research, highlighted that IBIT’s holdings currently represent 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply, underlining its importance in the market. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink previously described IBIT as “the fastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs” during an interview in March, when the fund surpassed 250,000 BTC. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has increased by 38% and is currently trading around $95,000. US Bitcoin ETFs Are Closing in on Satoshi's Assets U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted net inflows of $353.6 million on Monday, adding to a record $6.6 billion in inflows through November.

As the cryptocurrency market experiences a surge following the recent U.S. elections, ADA has emerged as one of the standout performers. Analysts are increasingly optimistic about its future, with some forecasting that the altcoin could reach as high as $3 if its positive momentum continues. Cardano Price May Hit $3 If This Happens, Say Experts Crypto experts suggest that if Cardano price surpasses the $1.20 mark, which previously marked the height of a bull run, it could rapidly ascend to a new all-time high (ATH). This projection is based on patterns observed in Bitcoin’s recent performance, which achieved a similar breakthrough a few weeks ago. Tweet Bitcoin has recently maintained its position above $95,000 after briefly touching $98,000 earlier this month, driven by a strong bullish market. With the price of BTC on track to test the $100,000 mark, altcoins like ADA are also showing impressive growth. The surge in Bitcoin’s value has sparked positive momentum across the cryptocurrency market, pushing other best altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Ripple (XRP) to significant gains. Cardano Technical Analysis: How High Can ADA Go This Weekend? The value of ADA has experienced a remarkable 30% increase in the past week, with its monthly growth soaring by a staggering 258%. Should the bullish trend continue, the ADA price could break new records, surpassing the $2 level and potentially reaching $2.5. The market’s strength may fuel this continued rise, and if Bitcoin achieves its $100k target, ADA could well hit the $3 mark in the near future. The ADA price saw a notable uptick in price, rising by 5% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $1.20, showing promising signs of upward momentum. On the daily chart, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is signaling bullish activity. The MACD line (blue) has crossed above the signal line (orange), which typically indicates increasing buying pressure. Additionally, the histogram has shifted to green, reinforcing the idea that positive momentum is gaining strength. Cardano Price Chart By TradingView Cardano price has gained significant attention amid the ongoing bullish market. With recent impressive price movements, analysts believe ADA could surge to $3 if its upward momentum continues, particularly if it surpasses key resistance levels and Bitcoin hits $100,000 .

Ethereum Price Today Follows BTC’s Drop: What’s Next? Ethereum price performance relative to its peers showed strength, but the recent $2 billion worth of BTC moved by the US Government coupled with Korea’s Martial Law could be causing Bitcoin to slide lower. If this trend continues, it could weigh against ETH’s strength and could catalyze a drop. Will Ether hit $3,000 first or climb up to revisit $4,000? Regardless, ETH’s strength shows a paradigm shift that hints at an end of Ether’s boring 2024 performance has ended and that it is ready to compete with top altcoins and even BTC. Furthermore, a sideways movement in BTC or a climb toward $100k could catalyze ETH price to extend its gains. Ethereum Price Chart Today *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 17 seconds ago. Ethereum’s innovative smart contract technology has made it a standout altcoin since its inception in 2015. Continuous major network upgrades ensure Ethereum stays ahead in smart contract innovation. The latest upgrade, Cancun, launched on March 13, 2024. Ethereum Price Outlook ETH’s year-to-date (YTD) performance continues to increase and currently sits at 33%. This recent slump in Bitcoin price has affected the YTD gains, which have dropped from 50% since November 11.

Since its all-time high of $571 billion in November 2021, Ethereum’s value decreased by half in October, but has spiked recently due to Bitcoin’s new ATH. Still, Ethereum maintains a strong lead over other popular cryptocurrencies: Solana (SOL): $98.8 billion Ripple (XRP): $89.8 billion BNB (BNB): $91.0 billion Despite this recent downtick and recovery, the 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is No data found for ethereum on 17 seconds ago.

Binance is the largest contributor to this trading volume – about 11% is contributed by spot trading and nearly 40% from futures trading. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, and ByBit follow Binance. Ethereum Morphs to Proof-of-Stake Technology The London hard fork is a significant Ethereum blockchain upgrade. It changed the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter). He explained how Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is more decentralized than Proof-of-Work (PoW). Key Ethereum Blockchain Upgrades in the Past 5 Years Here are some key upgrades in the past five years that shaped Ethereum as the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. 2024 : Cancun-Deneb (“Dencun”) : This upgrade aimed to improve Ethereum’s scalability, security, and usability, setting the stage for further enhancements. 2023 : Shanghai-Capella (“Shapella”) : Enabled the withdrawal of staked Ether (ETH), marking a significant milestone in Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. 2022 : Paris (The Merge) : Successfully transitioned Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, reducing energy consumption and increasing security. Bellatrix : Prepared the Ethereum network for The Merge by introducing the necessary PoS consensus logic. Gray Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring a smooth transition to PoS. 2021 : Arrow Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” again, providing more time for the transition to PoS. Altair : Introduced several improvements to the Beacon Chain, including better validator incentives and enhanced security. London : Implemented the highly anticipated EIP-1559, which reformed the transaction fee market, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Berlin : Introduced several protocol upgrades, including improved gas efficiency and enhanced security features. 2020 : Beacon Chain genesis : Launched the Beacon Chain, marking the beginning of Ethereum’s transition to PoS. Staking deposit contract deployed : Enabled users to deposit ETH and participate in the PoS consensus algorithm. Muir Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” to ensure a smooth transition to PoS. ETH Gas & It’s Effect on Ethereum Price The blockchain upgrades Ethereum receives aim to solve the trilemma of blockchain, i.e., balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. The switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) enhanced these aspects. Ethereum’s transaction fees (gas fees) plummeted post-upgrade, drawing more investors. Gas fees are like taxes, measured in Gwei, required for secure transactions. As of December 3, the gas fee for a transaction on the ETH network as of No data found for ethereum on 17 seconds ago is 14 Gwei. When Ethereum’s on-chain value grows, presenting opportunities, investors flock, driving gas fees up. This typically occurs during market upswings, peaking at all-time highs.

The won has become one of the worst-performing Asian currencies, dropping over 13% this year. You might also like: Missed the XRP price surge? 3 old-school crypto to consider The turmoil was triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s decision to declare emergency martial law. He attributed the move to the opposition party, accusing it of ties to North Korea. Yoon said : “I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order.” Therefore, Bitcoin and other altcoins plunged as many investors rushed to liquidate their assets as the political crisis escalated. In most periods, investors are often driven in fear when a major event happens. For instance, similar sell-offs occurred at the onset of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by rebounds as investors adjusted to the new circumstances. This pattern likely explains the recovery seen in BTC and altcoins after their initial plunge.

The proposal would categorize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) as “non-productive property,” alongside dormant real estate and luxury items such as yachts. This classification would place them under a proposed “unproductive wealth tax,” replacing the current real estate wealth tax The idea, introduced during the French Senate’s debate on the 2025 budget, suggests taxing increases in cryptocurrency value even if the assets haven’t been sold. This represents a departure from the current system, where taxes on cryptocurrencies are only applied when profits are realized, such as when assets are sold. Bad news for French crypto holders. The government has plans to tax unrealised gains on Bitcoin 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/YV6sx8aWKK — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) December 3, 2024 Senator Sylvie Vermeillet, the proposal’s sponsor, argued that this change would align cryptocurrency taxation with other wealth categories. Last month, The Tax Law Council in Denmark recommended proposing a bill to tax unrealized gains and losses on crypto assets under an inventory taxation model. The proposed bill aims to address the unfair taxation of crypto investors and simplify the tax rules for crypto assets. You might also like: Coinbase to list MOG meme coin This tax isn’t law….yet The Senate debate included a preliminary vote on the proposal. Notably, only supporting senators were present, meaning the vote does not yet reflect a final decision or broader consensus. If the proposal advances, it would need approval from the French National Assembly before becoming law. For those unfamiliar with the concept, unrealized gains refer to the increased value of an asset that hasn’t been sold. For instance, if Bitcoin’s value rises after purchase but is not sold, the owner currently owes no taxes on that increase. The proposed tax would change this by applying levies on that paper gain, even if the asset isn’t converted to cash. This debate comes amid a global trend of governments grappling with how to regulate and tax cryptocurrencies. In the U.S., crypto taxes only apply when assets are sold. Some countries, like Germany and Portugal, offer tax exemptions for long-term holdings or classify digital assets more leniently.

Ethereum’s momentum is taking it closer to $4,000—a level it hasn’t flirted with in ages. Meanwhile, VeChain’s November rally turned heads, up 153%, with forecasts hinting at an even brighter 2025. And Qubetics ($TICS)? What makes Qubetics such a game-changer? Unlike many of its predecessors, it’s laser-focused on addressing real-world challenges, particularly with its groundbreaking QubeQode IDE. Ethereum and VeChain are no slouches either, but Qubetics stands poised to redefine how businesses and developers implement blockchain technology in practical and impactful ways. Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): The Next Big Thing Blockchain’s been called revolutionary, but let’s face it: building dApps isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Enter Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE—a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process to the point of ridiculousness. Think of it like Canva, but for blockchain applications. Drag, drop, and—voilà—your app is live. Want to tokenise a supply chain? Done. Looking to create a digital loyalty programme for your cafe? Easy peasy. QubeQode doesn’t just streamline development; it democratises it. Small businesses, solopreneurs, and even mega-corps can dive into blockchain without hiring a team of nerdy coders. Imagine a local farmer tokenising their inventory for buyers or a content creator launching NFTs without breaking a sweat. It’s not just a tool; it’s an invitation for everyone to join the blockchain revolution. The numbers tell a story too. Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, selling over 261 million $TICS tokens to more than 5,900 holders, raising $4.2 million so far. At $0.0282 per token, there’s a 10% price hike coming this weekend. Miss the boat, and you’ll be kicking yourself when the value shoots to the moon. How high? Analysts predict $0.25 per token by the presale’s end (an 783% ROI), $1 post-presale (3,787% ROI), and $5 within a year. Let’s talk big money: if you put $85,000 into $TICS at today’s price, you’re looking at $754,250 at $1 or a jaw-dropping $15.05 million at $5. That’s not just life-changing—that’s wealth-changing. Ethereum: Marching Towards $4,000 Ethereum’s the backbone of decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs, but it’s not resting on its laurels. After busting through the $3,454 resistance last week, ETH is now inching closer to the $4,000 psychological level. The bulls are out in full force, and the daily RSI sits at a healthy 68, signalling room for more growth before hitting overbought territory. What’s fuelling this rally? A mix of improved network scalability, rising adoption in institutional finance, and DeFi’s relentless expansion. Ethereum’s got staying power because it’s not just about today; it’s about what’s next. With Ethereum 2.0 enhancements like sharding on the horizon, the network’s scalability and speed will only get better—a critical factor as DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces grow more complex. Here’s a scenario: Let’s say ETH hits $4,000 in the next rally. If you’re holding $85,000 worth of Ethereum at $3,691 (current price), you’re cashing out at $92,136. Not bad for a short-term play. And if it heads toward its all-time high of $4,878, you’re sitting on $112,425. The potential upside is solid, but what makes Ethereum a must-have in any portfolio is its role as the infrastructure layer for decentralised applications. But don’t get complacent. A dip below $3,454 could see ETH retest $3,335, presenting a buying opportunity for those who missed the earlier rally. Either way, Ethereum’s a blue-chip asset for a reason, and it’s got plenty of room to grow as crypto adoption broadens. VeChain: Solving Supply Chain Nightmares VeChain might not have Ethereum’s name recognition or Bitcoin’s price tag, but it’s quietly carving out its niche as a blockchain powerhouse. Specialising in supply chain solutions, VeChain’s tech ensures transparency, authenticity, and efficiency in tracking goods—from farm to fork, so to speak. It’s the tech you didn’t know you needed but can’t live without. November was a banner month for VET, surging 153% to $0.0515. And it’s not stopping there. Predictions peg it at $0.06 by January, $0.09 by spring, and $0.108 by October 2025. If you’re thinking long-term, some even predict VeChain could hit $1 within five years. That’s a potential 1,840% return for early adopters. Picture this: You drop $85,000 into VET at $0.0515. By October 2025, at $0.108, that’s $178,688. If it touches $1, we’re talking a cool $1.65 million. That’s the kind of ROI that turns heads and changes bank accounts. Why is VeChain a standout? It’s all about utility. Whether it’s preventing counterfeit goods in luxury markets, ensuring food safety, or tracking carbon credits, VeChain’s got a use case for just about every industry. As global supply chains become more digitised, VeChain’s blockchain solutions are poised to become indispensable. Add favourable regulations under the incoming U.S. administration, and you’ve got a recipe for growth. Time to Make Your Move Crypto doesn’t wait for anyone, and neither should you. Whether it’s Qubetics redefining blockchain with QubeQode, Ethereum powering the DeFi and NFT revolution, or VeChain solving real-world supply chain issues, these are the top crypto by market cap and utility you should consider right now. Qubetics’ presale is your first stop—don’t miss out before the $TICS price jumps 10% this weekend. Load up on Ethereum while it’s surging toward $4,000. And keep an eye on VeChain as it builds momentum. The best investments aren’t just about numbers; they’re about timing.

37177474,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/is-bitcoin-self-custody-under-threat-in-europe-,1733246193,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/37177474.jpeg,Is Bitcoin Self-Custody Under Threat in Europe?,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/is-bitcoin-self-custody-under-threat-in-europe-,"For centuries, self-custody has symbolized financial autonomy, enabling individuals to secure their wealth—from gold to cash—without intermediaries. Bitcoin extends this principle into the digital realm, offering a censorship-resistant, decentralized way to hold assets. Yet, upcoming European regulations under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) threaten to complicate self-custody for Bitcoin users. A New Regulatory Era MiCA, adopted in April 2023, aims to regulate crypto-assets comprehensively in the EU. The revised TFR applies the “Travel Rule” to Bitcoin transactions, requiring detailed sender and recipient information for compliance. These changes will come into effect in 2025, making it harder for Europeans to interact with Bitcoin self-custody wallets without cryptographic proof of ownership. One proposed solution is the “Satoshi Test,” where users verify wallet ownership by sending a small amount of Bitcoin (e.g., one satoshi) from their wallet to the exchange. While simple for existing holders, this process creates a paradox for new users: they need Bitcoin to verify ownership but cannot acquire Bitcoin without passing the test. This “catch-22” risks alienating new adopters, steering them toward custodial solutions that compromise Bitcoin’s ethos of decentralization and financial sovereignty. Privacy and Security Risks In an effort to comply with the new regulations, some exchanges are exploring alternatives to the Satoshi Test; These involve using end-to-end encrypted messages signed using the private key to confirm ownership of the wallet cryptographically for example via the WalletConnect Network. This preserves privacy and yet helps institutions to be compliant. The core ethos of Bitcoin technology and cryptocurrencies is decentralization and privacy. Centralizing sensitive user data not only creates attractive targets for cybercriminals but also contradicts the principles that have driven the adoption of cryptocurrencies. The recent history of data breaches in the financial sector underscores the dangers of storing large amounts of personal data in centralized repositories. “Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins” The adage ""Not your keys, not your coins"" serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s core philosophy: control over private keys equals control over assets. Users must carefully evaluate exchanges' self-custody support, as cumbersome processes or centralized data storage undermine Bitcoin’s promise of financial freedom. The TFR is only the beginning. Future legislation, like the proposed Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3), signals growing regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin self-custody. To preserve Bitcoin’s core values, the industry must proactively develop solutions that comply with regulations while protecting user privacy. This is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin in Europe. Users should advocate for exchanges that prioritize self-custody and privacy-preserving measures. Exchanges, in turn, must innovate to comply with regulations while staying true to Bitcoin’s decentralized principles. As Europe tightens its regulatory framework, the choices made by Bitcoin users, exchanges, and regulators will determine whether Bitcoin continues to empower individuals or becomes entangled in centralized systems. By championing privacy and self-custody, we can ensure Bitcoin remains a tool for financial sovereignty and freedom. This is a guest post by Jess Houlgrave.

Data from blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant indicates that BTC could witness a sharp and significant uptick within the next one to two months. According to a report by pseudonymous digital asset analyst Crypto Dan, a signal usually seen once or twice in each bull market has just appeared. It indicates that BTC could skyrocket soon as it approaches the final phase of this cycle. BTC Could Skyrocket in 2 Months The signal called the golden cross of the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator entails the SOPR 365-day moving average crossing the SOPR 30-day moving average. Only in bull seasons have these indicators crossed, and the market has experienced a strong rally within the following two months each time. Crypto Dan said the signal occurs once or twice throughout an entire bull cycle, and it is the second in this upward phase that kicked off in January 2023. Notably, the upcoming rally is likely to be the largest in the final phase of this cycle. The crypto analyst mentioned that the magnitude of these runs often increases as the market advances toward the later stages of the bull cycle, while declines and corrections are smaller and happen over a shorter time frame. If this signal’s indications are to come true between the end of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, Crypto Dan expects the market to witness new capital inflows and the creation of additional crypto funds. This rise in demand and liquidity will help bring the market to its peak. BTC Slips Below $95K Meanwhile, analysts are speculating on bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory based on current demand and supply. Long-term investors have been rapidly offloading their holdings to realize profits, while short-term BTC holders have been accumulating; however, it appears demand is no match for supply. Market experts have identified $90,000 and $95,000 as key support levels for BTC, stating that the asset has a higher chance of rallying to $100,000 if it remains above the latter. On the other hand, BTC could tumble all the way to the $80,000 region if it slips below $90,000. At the time of writing, BTC had fallen slightly intraday to $94,800. While the asset holds steady, it remains to be seen how long it will take to break out, as Crypto Dan’s analysis has predicted.

The tech entrepreneur also discussed Microsoft’s upcoming shareholders’ meeting, where they will vote on whether to adopt Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Michael Saylor Reveals Reason For MicroStrategy’s ‘Bitcoin Strategy’ In a CNBC interview , Michael Saylor suggested that his company adopted the Bitcoin strategy because of BTC’s volatility and capped supply. While discussing how they profit from this strategy, Saylor highlighted how the flagship crypto has outperformed other commodities like gold and silver. He stated that Bitcoin has a 60% volatility and ARR (annual recurring revenue), unlike these other commodities with low volatility that don’t even last that long. Saylor further remarked that BTC is the only commodity invented in the history of the human race that is “absolutely capped.” In line with this, the MicroStrategy co-founder said that Bitcoin will continue to rise as it becomes more scarce. Michael Saylor also mentioned how BTC has outperformed the S&P index and is more volatile than these stocks. The flagship crypto also has an edge over these stocks, with Saylor noting that investors can put 100% of their liquid assets in the crypto per SEC rules, something that public companies can’t do with securities. Saylor’s remarks come just as MicroStrategy recently acquired 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion. The software company has bought Bitcoin for four consecutive weeks now, spending over $11 billion in the process. When asked if he wasn’t concerned that the volatility means that Bitcoin could experience significant moves to the downside, Saylor said that he thinks BTC will “surge through the roof” and then rally to as high as $180,000 before dropping to $140,000. It is worth mentioning that Saylor and MicroStrategy lived through the 2021 bear market, so they are unlikely to be fazed by any retracement the flagship crypto might face. Thoughts On Microsoft’s Bitcoin Vote Microsoft will vote on December 10 on whether to adopt Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Michael Saylor believes the company should not hesitate to embrace the flagship crypto. During the interview, he stated that Microsoft could add a trillion dollars to its market cap and $150 to its share price if it put all its existing cash into Bitcoin. Saylor added that the company could add another $1 trillion and $150 to its share price if it converts its existing dividend into Bitcoin. The MicroStrategy co-founder believes the same will happen if Microsoft replaces their share buybacks with investing in BTC. Michael Saylor also believes that investing in Bitcoin is an excellent way for Microsoft to de-risk and grow its enterprise value. Interestingly, Saylor recently gave a three-minute pitch to Microsoft shareholders on why they should adopt Bitcoin. Saylor has received praise from renowned author Robert Kiyosaki for his company’s Bitcoin Strategy.

The political earthquake in Washington is sending crypto assets to their all-time highs. Among the various market segments, meme coins are among the biggest gainers. One token is expected to replicate the returns Doge did and it’s not Pepe. A new altcoin, Cutoshi , is gaining traction in the market. Dogecoin Sees Renewed Interest Among all the memecoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the most legendary. After a spectacular growth in 2021, Dogecoin is once again attracting interest and delivering returns. Notably, the original meme coin saw an increase of 161.04% in the last 30 days. Source: CMC The catalyst for Doge’s latest growth is the monumental political change in the US. With Trump’s victory, Dogecoin’s main promoter, Elon Musk, will soon have an influential position in Washington. Musk did not hesitate to use his position to pump Doge, naming its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after the token. Still, Dogecoin hasn’t reached the heights of its 2021 bull run and it’s still 43.06% below its all-time high. While its moving averages indicate a strong buy, Doge will face significant resistance near the psychological level of $0.5. Pepe Sees Major Potential Pepe was one of the strong performers this cycle, thanks to the bull market. Notably, the token was up 131.57% in the last 30 days, currently trading at $0.00002016. The reason for this strong performance was Pepe’s listing on major exchanges. Source: CMC In November, Pepe won a listing on both Coinbase and Robinhood. This gave millions of tradersaccess to the token, pushing trader sentiment up. This has also catalyzed whale accumulation, as large traders bought 10 trillion Pepe tokens after the listing. The bullish momentum for Pepe continues. Currently, the token is trading above most moving averages , indicating that there’s significant upside potential for the token. Still, the oscillators are mostly neutral and Pepe’s large market cap will weigh on its performance in the future. Can Cutoshi Replicate Doge’s Growth? While Pepe has had a strong run this cycle, it will not be the token that can give Doge-like returns. Instead, another token, Cutoshi (CUTO), seems a more likely candidate. This token combines memecoins with DeFi, appealing to a broad base of investors. On November 22, this new token raised $1 million in its presale. This sentiment is expected to continue, thanks to growing interest in meme coins and DeFi. Cutoshi is a meme token, with a Chinese Lucky Cat as its mascot, that focuses on utility. By blending memecoins and DeFi, its goal is to make DeFi more accessible to traders and users. The project is also hosting a meme competition, rewarding aspiring artists with $2,000 for their submissions. For those who wish to learn more, can do so here! While DeFi has strong benefits compared to CEX’s it is still inaccessible to most traders. This is why many opt to give custody over their assets to shady entities, sometimes with disastrous results. Cutoshi wants to fix this by creating a multichain DEX that’s accessible to all. This goal and its clever use of memes, indicates that it may be a token that can capture attention like Doge did in the past.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

Today, it processed $1.1 billion in 24-hour trading volume, which is more than Bonk despite its market cap being five times higher. And with the Coinbase listing yet to go live, we could potentially see another uptick in momentum in the coming days. Moo Deng’s resurgence this week underscores the market-moving importance of centralized exchange listings, and this is also partly why Catslap has rocketed 66% in the past 24 hours. Is Catslap the Next Moo Deng? CEX Listing Announcement in 2 Days Catslap is a viral meme coin that has shot up 66% to a $, buoyed by anticipation for an upcoming exchange listing alongside a significant institutional money investment. The token launched on 23 November and got off to a fast start. But after retracing with the broader market, it’s back on the rise again. Investors are awaiting a “major announcement” in two days that will reveal a centralized exchange that Catslap will list on. But excitement is soaring after it was revealed yesterday that Chicago-based trading house Jump Trading made a $500K investment into $SLAP. Huge 97 ETH buy! Whales want more $SLAP https://t.co/gbZUKaPA0B pic.twitter.com/vajxXyop0V — Catslap (@CatSlapToken) December 2, 2024 Could Jump Trading’s inside contacts convince top tier-1 exchanges like Coinbase and Binance to list the token? Catslap recently caused a buzz by unveiling its “Slap-to-Earn” gamified experience, where users choose a character they want to slap, and then get to work and earn $SLAP tokens. With that, analysts have high hopes. Crypto June even says it could make millionaires. The project also has a staking mechanism encouraging users to lock up their tokens long-term. Another feature is its burn mechanism, which will decrease the circulating supply over time, making the remaining $SLAP tokens more valuable. This is more than just an average meme coin. It has all the hallmarks of a project that could rival Moo Deng and beyond.

A source said Trump has reached out to Atkins but is still waiting for her to accept. Paul Atkins was an advisor to the RSR token, RSR rose by 20% following the news. Trump’s decision to nominate Atkins is in line with his campaign promises to support the crypto industry. While Atkins has yet to officially accept the position, her selection is seen as a direct response to widespread dissatisfaction with the tenure of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler, who announced his resignation effective January 20, had faced heavy criticism for his sanctions-focused approach to regulating the crypto industry. During his tenure at the SEC, Gensler has taken numerous enforcement actions against exchanges, token issuers and other crypto assets, often citing violations of securities laws. His critics have argued that he has failed to provide clear regulatory guidelines and fostered uncertainty across the industry. Paul Atkins is a well-known figure in financial and regulatory circles. He served as SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush and is widely respected in conservative and establishment Republican circles. Since leaving the SEC, Atkins has emerged as a strong supporter of the crypto industry and has served as co-chair of the Token Alliance at the Chamber of Digital Commerce since 2017. *This is not investment advice.

Although its bullish momentum is losing steam, crypto analyst Alan Santana has shared a bold Ethereum price prediction, suggesting it could hit the $15k level by the end of 2025. On the other hand, the BNB price has extended its rally but appears to be limited above the $685 level. Meanwhile, Lunex Network continues to hit impressive presale milestones. Within a few days of hitting the $0.0033 milestone, Lunex’s holders anticipate another price increase to $0,0038. This would mark over 210% ROI for early adopters who bought the token at its starting price of $0.0012. Analysts believe the $1 mark is on the cards for this new deflationary titan in 2025. Lunex Holders Anticipate Another Price Increase To $0.0038 Low fees, advanced liquidity, and revenue share model have attracted savvy investors to the Lunex Network (LNEX) presale. The project has introduced an aggregation protocol that sources liquidity from multiple exchanges and even splits a single trade through several exchanges to ensure the best possible prices. Its smart contract verifies transactions to ensure that each trade is accurate. With this smart contract approach and real-time information aggregation, Lunex offers trading that is not only secure but highly efficient. For advanced users, Lunex Pro will provide premium services with unique tools, including custom trading approaches, faster execution speeds, and live market data. These unique features are perfect for high-volume traders who need precise tools to execute strategies and manage their portfolios effectively. What’s more interesting is its revenue share model that offers real passive income. Lunex will use a portion of its revenue from subscription and trading to buy LNEX tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be redistributed to those who staked LNEX. The project has already raised over $3.8 million in presale. Meanwhile, Lunex is preparing to enter the DeFi market, expected to explode to USD 213.19 billion by 2030 . Grabbing even the smallest share of this market share could increase LNEX's valuation exponentially to close in on the $1 mark. Ethereum Price Could Hit $15K In 2025 Crypto analyst Alan Santana has been making headlines, predicting a significant upswing for Ethereum in 2025. Santana notes that while the top altcoin has been lagging compared to Bitcoin’s price performance, the ETH token is on track for a massive price movement. He also predicted a potential rise in Ethereum’s value to around the $15K level during the 2024-2025 bull cycle, repeating similar gains similar to or slightly less than the previous cycle. Santana’s prediction is based on growing institutional adoption, such as the recent Hong Kong Bank launch that will enable its users to trade ETH tokens. Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis had also previously predicted a move to the $15K mark. His forecast was based on a hypothetical 200% increase from ETH’s previous high of approximately $4,880 in November 2021. This would mean a 500-600% gain for buyers who purchased ETH coins below the $2000 mark. According to him, this is a relatively low-risk bet in the crypto world. Ethereum’s technical structure aligns with this bullish sentiment. The token has seen an uptick in open interest, surging from 6.32 million ETH to over $27 billion, marking a 17% month-to-date gain. ETH price also validates an uptrend after surging by 35% to $3.4K in the past month. BNB Regains The $625 Support Level BNB’s price has grown remarkably in the past month. However, the token is paring off some gains after failing to hold support near the $650 level . Its price is now hovering below its 100-hourly simple moving average. The bulls have regained the $625 support, and if they manage to hold this level, the BNB token could witness fresh rallies. The on-chain technical indicator aligns with a bullish sentiment. Its relative strength index is above the neutral level, at 50, and is currently increasing. Moreover, BNB’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence has decreased in the bearish zone. Notably, if the bulls fail to hold the $625 support level, the next target would be the $615 level. Notably, if the bulls fail to hold this significant support level, the price of BNB coin could continue its downtrend toward the $600 support. Any additional losses could push BNB's value downwards, initiating a more significant decline toward the $588 level. Best Token To Buy While Ethereum and BNB coins are great prospects for long-term gains, the Lunex presale presents intriguing opportunities for short-term gains. Savvy investors are flocking to the presale to capitalize on this opportunity before the price soars.

Capital is flooding in, with XRP generating over 150% higher trading volume than Bitcoin on Coinbase. Meanwhile, ICO token Crypto All-Stars is also seeing huge demand as its raise nears $8 million. WisdomTree XRP Spot ETF Triggers Pump Ripple’s XRP has seen its price rocket since Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November. It’s now trading at a 440% monthly premium and has added $100 billion to its market cap in one month. As such, XRP is trading higher than its 2021 bull market peak and just 29% from its 2018 all-time high (ATH). Today’s XRP rally was spurred by Wall Street money manager WisdomTree filing for an XRP spot ETF. They’re joining the race alongside Bitwise and Canary Capital. The ETF aims to give investors price exposure to XRP via shares tradable on the Cboe BZX Exchange. XRP’s Volume Surpasses Bitcoin’s On Coinbase Trading volume is a key measure of where the market’s attention lies, and right now, it shows that all eyes are on XRP. Coinbase is the second-most active centralized exchange by trading volume and the most popular in the United States. And right now, trading volume for XRP is 1.5 times higher than it is for Bitcoin. In the past 24 hours, $2.3 billion worth of XRP has changed hands on the exchange, accounting for 21.39% of its entire volume. Bitcoin takes second place with $1.5 billion, accounting for 14.65% of Coinbase’s volume. Notably, demand for XRP on Coinbase is creating a significant price premium on the platform. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase's minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. Meanwhile, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—has shown no significant premium so far. pic.twitter.com/ENESB2Zrkv — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 2, 2024 It’s a similar story to Binance. XRP is leading the way with $5.5 billion in volume and a 10% market share. XRP’s explosive rally this month has instilled more confidence in crypto traders. By adding $100 billion to its market cap in one month, XRP has set the tone for how parabolic the crypto bull run could get. With that, traders are positioning in tokens that they think could pump next. Hedera and Kaia are top performers among large caps, each rising 39% today. Meanwhile, a new market emergent, Crypto All-Stars, is also drawing attention as its presale raise surges toward $8 million. Analyst Backs New Altcoin Crypto All-Stars to 100X After IEO Crypto All-Stars is an innovative project that creates utility inside the meme coin sector. It’s building a meme coin staking layer that lets users deposit their DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and more to earn passive rewards. Typically, the only utility of meme coins is “buy low, sell high.” Despite that, the sector has a market cap of $130 billion. Crypto All-Stars hopes to lift that by creating a tangible way for holders to use their meme coins. Users lock their tokens up in Crypto All-Stars’ “MemeVault,” and they’ll generate passive rewards over time. However, the caveat is that they must hold $STARS tokens, and their rewards depend on how much they have. https://twitter.com/all_stars_coin/status/1860745219719020763 This creates a dynamic where holders of all the top meme coins will be vying to accumulate the same token, which analysts think is a juncture with massive potential. For instance, the Crypto June recently said it can 100x. The analyst noted that the presale will end in 20 days, meaning prospective buyers should act quickly to avoid missing out. With the crypto market taking off this month, it’s no surprise that traders anticipate such significant gains for a new innovative project like $STARS.

37177905,2q5bacpx7AOe,1733247563,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png,Trump's Top SEC Chair Pick Paul Atkins Reluctant to Take Job: Source,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/03/trumps-top-sec-chair-pick-paul-atkins-reluctant-to-take-job-source,"A lot of stars would need to align for Paul Atkins, reportedly president-elect Donald Trump’s top candidate to chair the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to take the job. It is an unattractive role for him because of the amount of work needed to turn around the bloated agency he believes was mismanaged by outgoing SEC chair Gary Gensler, a person familiar with Atkins' thinking said. Reluctance to clean up Gensler's “ mess ” has been shared by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Chris Giancarlo, who has advocated for Atkins to take the SEC job and was once considered a candidate himself. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, was spotted at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort this week, one industry source said. He was scheduled to interview for the SEC chair role Sunday and Monday, said another person with knowledge of the meetings. Atkins is the founder and CEO of Patomak Global Partners, a global consulting firm specializing in strategy, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Patomak serves crypto firms, but they are a small part of its diversified practice, which includes traditional financial clients, public companies, trade associations, law firms, banks and insurance companies. Prior to starting Patomak, Atkins was a commissioner of the SEC from 2002 to 2008, appointed by former President George W. Bush. During his time at the SEC, Mark Uyeda and Hester Pierce , who later became commissioners, worked as counsel to Atkins. Atkins is well regarded in conservative circles. According to a source close to Atkins, he is friendly with Key Square Group founder Scott Bessent , the billionaire hedge fund manager selected by Trump to become Treasury Secretary. Atkins is reluctant to leave his practice, the person familiar with his thinking said. Taking up the SEC chair role would require him to resign from his business interests, which he may only do once his firm is well-positioned to operate without him, sources said. Other candidates Crypto attorney Teresa Goody Guillén is also said to be under consideration by the Trump transition team. Binance co-founder Changpang Zhao , Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson and other crypto executives are privately and publicly supporting her based on her pro-crypto views and experience serving and arguing against the SEC on behalf of blockchain clients. Guillén has declared on X that she wants to “Make Crypto Great Again” and has been polling the public on the most effective ways the agency could address regulatory challenges. Last week, crypto executive and former acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks was believed to be a lead candidate to helm the SEC, gathering strong support from Web3 proponents and at one point leading the odds on prediction market Kalshi. But his lack of securities law experience made him a longshot, sources said. Circle Chief Legal Officer and Head of Corporate Affairs Heath Tarbert is reportedly being considered. He is a former CFTC chair, assistant Treasury secretary, and associate White House counsel. ""We won't comment on speculation,” said a Circle spokesperson. Brad Bondi was floated as a possible candidate, and while he has been described as “ pro-crypto ,” critics privately said he has little experience in Web3, and is more of a traditional securities lawyer with a background serving the SEC and opposing the agency in court. But Bondi’s trump card, as it were, could be his close ties to the Trump administration. His sister Pam Bondi was nominated to become U.S. attorney general and is a Trump loyalist who represented the former president during his 2020 impeachment trial. Similarly, former SEC investment management director and Kirkland and Ellis partner Norm Champ is a Trump campaign backer who told CoinDesk “I would be honored to serve as SEC Chair if President Trump thinks I am the right person for the job.” But his traditional securities background has not gathered excitement in the crypto community. Trump’s pick for Manhattan’s U.S. attorney, Jay Clayton, has strongly endorsed attorneys Robert Stebbins and Dalia Blass, sources said, whom he supervised as SEC chief from 2017 to 2020. Crypto experts have been outspoken against them. “Stebbins personally signed off, approved and encouraged 80 or so SEC crypto-related enforcement actions, including the most controversial of all – the SEC case involving Ripple,” wrote Ripple Labs advocate and former SEC attorney John Reed Stark on X . The SEC partially lost that case when a judge ruled that XRP sales by Ripple Labs on public exchanges did not fall under the definition of a security; the agency has said it will appeal that decision. “Big Crypto is extraordinarily powerful and will have a lot of influence in the SEC Chair’s selection and I can’t imagine Big Crypto allowing Bob Stebbins to get the SEC Chair nomination,” Stark wrote. Republican SEC commissioner Uyeda could become acting chair of the SEC after Gary Gensler steps down on inauguration day if the Senate doesn't confirm his SEC pick by January 20. Commissioner Pierce, another favorite for the role, has privately stated she is not interested in being the chair on an acting or permanent basis, which would improve Uyeda’s chances. Whether he would stay in the role is less certain. “I expect Trump may prefer to bring in someone new of his own ,"" crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky stated on X. Robinhood chief legal officer Dan Gallagher was said to be a top SEC chief candidate before the election, but he has since said he is not interested. “I have made it clear that I do not wish to be considered for this position.” Gallagher told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “I feel I can make tremendous progress to democratize finance in my current role, and I will remain a vocal and consistent advocate for positive change in our markets."" Atkins, Guillén, and Uyeda declined to comment for this story. Trump transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, Brooks, Brad Bondi, Stebbins, and Blass did not respond to requests for comment. Washington experts say the Trump administration will likely roll back the SEC’s oversight of the $3 trillion digital assets market in favor of the CFTC. The latter agency is widely perceived to take a lighter touch because the market it regulates – derivatives – is dominated by sophisticated institutional traders rather than retail investors with less risk tolerance.

However, from an overall perspective, the cryptocurrency gained up to 0.81% of value. Despite the upward swing in the previous weeks, the bears remained on the leading in the past week. TAO/USD 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of Bittensor coin confirmed a declining market trend for the currency. Bittensor coin value has dropped down to $601.16, a low amidst the rising bearish pressure. As the volatility levels are expanding widely, this increases chances of a reversal in the market trends soon. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the market volatility. As this distance is expanding rapidly, this indicates a rising market volatility. Moving on, the upper side of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $658.29. Whereas, its lower side, serving as the support band, is present at $440.37. TAO/USD 1-day price chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. Currently at 56.85 and still moving downward, this indicates a rising bearish pressure. The price movement remained exceedingly bearish today, resulting in a substantial loss.

TAO/USD 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Bittensor coin revealed a bearish market trend for the currency. TAO/USD value has depreciated to a low of $601.168 in the past few hours of the day. Red candlesticks on the four-hour price charts indicate a negative market, as the selling pressure continues to accelerate. The Bollinger bands are expanding, which confirms an increasing volatility. This increase in the market volatility signals a relatively higher market unpredictability for the coming hours. Side by side, the upper Bollinger band has now switched to a $680.127 high, thereby signifying the resistance. Whereas the lower Bollinger band is present at $575.55, indicating the support. TAO/USD 4-hour price chart The RSI indicator is present within the neutral region. Its value has receded to 47.08 over the span of the past four hours. That is because the bears are now ruling the market, leading to a substantial decline. The descending curve on the RSI graph refers to a negative market and a higher selling pressure. If the bearish strength continues to increase, the RSI value can get close to the oversold region.

The announcement comes just a day after the platform listed its first Pump.fun token, Moodeng (MOODENG). Coinbase added MOG to its roadmap for upcoming listings. There is no hard and fast rule for the actual listing, as in the case of Moodeng (MOODENG), which launched its first market just hours after being added to the roadmap. The official Mog Coin account corroborated the news, adding to the token’s exposure. COINBASE MOGS 🫵😹 https://t.co/D1aX2554TV pic.twitter.com/15AH0IpQB1 — MOG COIN (@MogCoinEth) December 3, 2024 MOG has been a staple in meme space, with regular roll-over from other memes and the potential to join blue chip memes and change its entire trading profile. MOG is just outside the list of top tokens with valuations over $1B, and has been trading flat for weeks. The potential Coinbase listing can revive this meme asset. The listing of MOODENG came as a surprise since Coinbase apparently limited itself to established tokens, not ones originating from Pump.fun. Additional speculations are also pointing to Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) as a potential upcoming addition to Coinbase. For now, PNUT is not on the roadmap, and a listing is assumed to be based on social media rumors. While new listings are constantly flowing into the meme token market, the main price drivers remain top blue-chip assets. They are valued higher, and price swings affect the market. MOG has the chance of joining that list, extending its appeal to general Internet users, without pressure to support a token-based cult. Coinbase to list Base version of Mog Coin Coinbase will list the asset’s Base version, tapping the L2 potential for much lower fees. In the case of a spot listing, this will be the asset to be deposited and traded officially. MOG already has 130,470 users, in the usual range for well-established memes. Mog Coin started as a friendly joke in the summer of 2023 and was launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 version is also active, with 43,716 holders. The asset resembles older memes with an engaging, but not fanatic online community. The big advantage of Mog Coin is its long-term presence and more stabilized liquidity. Both the Ethereum and the Base version of MOG pumped by around 20%, as there is no new inflow of liquidity. The token still relies on decentralized pairs, on Uniswap and Aerodrome. Both versions rallied to $0.0000024, retaining their usual low range. A listing on a major exchange and more exposure could achieve an even bigger rally, as it happened with MOODENG and earlier, PEPE. The recent decision to expand meme listings led influencer Murad Mahmudov to once again proclaim the meme super cycle is far from over, with more liquid listings coming. Big buyers come to MOG One of the signs of more potential liquidity for MOG was the growth of Wintermute 3 holdings. The market maker started accumulating from October onward, ending up with 5.5T MOG. Wintermute now holds around 1.14% of the MOG supply on Ethereum, entering the top 10 wallets. An addition to Wintermute has been correlated with new listings, though it is not a guarantee. Crypto.com has also accrued MOG after a competitive campaign for token deposits. Even before the listing, addresses related to Coinbase were also accumulating MOG in the ERC-20 version. The address holds 312B MOG, a relatively small amount, potentially fit for experiments. In addition to transparent holdings, data from Bubblemaps shows small-scale connected clusters of wallets for the Base version of MOG. For now, the supply is not sniped or posing risk of dumping on the community. Wallet clusters have already formed, though holding a smaller fraction of the MOG supply. | Source: Bubblemaps MOG remains moderately decentralized , with top wallets holding a smaller proportion of the token’s supply. Those conditions can change without a warning, in case whales and market makers move in, skewing the balance. Wallet clusters may also affect MOG in the short term. MOG has been more active since its Binance perpetual futures listing. As the token gains popularity for being the ‘first internet culture coin’, a retail listing may also boost spot volumes and lead to aggressive price expansion in the short term. MOG remains risky and has gone through 70% drawdowns, in addition to active rallies and jumps to a new price range.

The announcement, made on December 3, 2024, sent MOG’s value up by over 20% within just one hour, propelling the coin’s market capitalization to nearly $1 billion. This move comes as Coinbase continues to expand its meme coin offerings, adding more tokens to its listing roadmap. Coinbase’s Expansion into Meme Coins Coinbase has made significant moves in the meme coin market over the past month. After adding tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Floki (FLOKI), Dogiwfhat (WIF), and Moo Deng, the exchange has now set its sights on MOG Coin (MOG). According to a tweet from Coinbase’s official assets account, MOG will be listed on Base, the platform’s Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution. Base, which currently holds close to $4 billion in user deposits, provides faster transactions and lower fees for traders. The inclusion of MOG Coin in Coinbase’s listing roadmap highlights the growing interest in meme coins, which have gained substantial popularity in 2024. Meme coins have been part of a larger trend within the crypto space, seeing both large price movements and high trading volumes. Coinbase’s decision to list MOG further underscores its commitment to expanding its meme coin offerings. MOG Coin Price Rally MOG Coin has experienced significant growth in 2024. After its initial rise in early 2024, the coin has moved from a market cap of around $50 million in February to surpassing $475 million by mid-March. As of press time, MOG ranks as the tenth-largest meme coin by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. Its recent price surge brings it close to its all-time high, which was recorded in November 2024. Trading at $0.000002385, MOG price is up 6% after the price swayed between an intra-day high and low of $0.000002804 and $0.000002076, respectively. The token’s success has been attributed to its appeal as a meme coin, described as having “effortless cosmic domination” behind its concept. Despite its light-hearted origins, MOG has gained serious attention from investors, and its inclusion on Coinbase is expected to increase its visibility in the market. What This Means for Meme Coins Meme coins have become a significant part of the cryptocurrency landscape, with a combined market capitalization exceeding $125 billion in 2024. The rise of meme coins, including MOG, reflects broader trends within the digital asset space, as more users and investors are drawn to tokens linked to cultural events and social media trends. Coinbase’s decision to list more meme coins like MOG further cements the importance of these tokens in the crypto ecosystem. Concurrently, earlier last month, Binance Futures announced the listing of MOG with up to 75X leverage. While meme coins are often highly speculative, the listing of MOG on Coinbase offers the potential for more liquidity and market exposure, especially as the platform integrates features like Apple Pay to make crypto more accessible to mainstream users.

The solution goes live following a six-month beta phase, MatterFi stated in a Dec. 3 press release shared with crypto.news. According to the announcement, the aim is to enable secure digital finance for both humans and artificial intelligence. Key to the infrastructure is an AI-powered agent for the solution “send-to-name” that means users don’t need complex wallet addresses to transact. Integration with software wallets, hardware wallets and AI agents and leveraging chain-agnostic financial rails means users get multiple security layers when transacting. MatterFi provides the platform that helps users guard against attacks such as hacking, phishing and SIM swaps among other security risks.

Its use is more like access available with global finance apps such as Revolut and PayPal. “Enterprise adoption of newer DeFi technologies is not what it should be because of perceived risks and vulnerabilities surrounding these technologies. Not only that, the complexity of these technologies and reliance on complicated addresses has stalled adoption,” MatterFi founder Michael “Mehow” Pospieszalski said. Notably, MatterFi says all transactions remain private, something critical in the crypto market that data shows recorded a 150% spike in web3 phishing attacks in 2024. In October, blockchain security platform Certik reported that phishing attacks and private key leaks had seen users across the ecosystem lose $668 million in Q3, 2024. Data shows 80% of those that suffer phishing attacks lose money. In May 2024, MatterFi and neobank EQIFi announced a collaboration that aimed to bolster crypto security. The platforms targeted MatterFi’s technology to help address rising issues around crypto theft, fraud and money laundering. EQIFi and MatterFi revealed the partnership would leverage the “send-to-name” feature via a peer-to-peer platform to bring this benefit to users.

Despite market fluctuations, DOGE continues to show resilience. Analysts predict it could reach $1, driven by strong momentum. This optimism is further fueled by Elon Musk’s upcoming address to Congress on December 5. Will Elon Musk’s Congressional Address Propel Dogecoin to $1 on Dec 5? On December 5th, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will address U.S. lawmakers in Washington, D.C. The event draws considerable attention, as both figures are prominent advocates for change, especially in areas affecting taxpayers and government efficiency. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is well-known for his influence on cryptocurrency space, particularly Dogecoin. His involvement in politics has grown recently, with a clear focus on pushing for a more efficient government and advocating for tech-driven solutions. Meanwhile, Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and political figure, has gained attention for his economic reform and government transparency positions. The upcoming Congressional address is expected to generate significant discussion on the future of U.S. governance and economic policy. Speculation is also rising regarding how Musk’s influence could impact Dogecoin’s price, with some analysts predicting a potential surge toward the $1 mark. Dogecoin, which has long been associated with Musk, saw a notable rally earlier this year, driven by his public endorsements and tweets. While the price of Dogecoin remains volatile, the intersection of technology, politics, and cryptocurrency may lead to unpredictable outcomes in the coming weeks. As December 5th approaches, eyes will be on Washington, D.C., to see how the political discourse unfolds and whether it influences the price of Dogecoin in the short term. BIG week for The @DOGE Elon and Vivek will be addressing members of congress on December 5th in Washington, D.C. It will be interesting to see which members will be supporting US taxpayers and which will be supporting the bureaucratic status quo We’re here for all… pic.twitter.com/plJDNx09f8 — Department Of Government Efficiency Community (@doge_eth_gov) December 1, 2024 Dogecoin Price Analysis Over the past week, the DOGE price has shown significant upward momentum, increasing by 174%. Over the past week, the meme coin has surged by more than 10%, indicating a bullish trend. At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trading at $0.4017, with a slight decrease of 5% in the past 24-hours. A resurgence in bullish momentum could push the Dogecoin price forecast to a $0.5 resistance level, sparking further investor interest. If the meme coin breaks this resistance level, it may gain the strength to approach the $0.7 mark by the end of this week. With strong buying pressure, the DOGE might see an extended rally above $1 after Musk’s address. This might see the meme coin surge by more than 150%, marking a potential upward trend. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView In conclusion, while the Dogecoin price remains volatile, Elon Musk’s upcoming Congressional address could catalyze further gains. If market sentiment aligns with Musk’s influence, DOGE might surge toward the $1 mark, driven by renewed investor optimism. ​​ The post Will Dogecoin Price Jump to $1 As DOGE’s Elon Musk Set to Addresses Congress on Dec 5? appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|dogecoin price|Dogecoin price prediction,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-03 17:51:00

But the challenge is choosing the right coins to invest in during altcoin season. Some do well, some do better, and some don’t do much at all. Pepe Coin is raising its hand for a massive gain, and SUI is headed for a place among the big boys, but laurels go to Rollblock , a new online casino that will last a lot longer than altcoin season – this is one for the future. Rollblock (RBLK): Online gambling gets a home on the blockchain Blockchain tech is relatively new, but it is becoming ubiquitous. Rollblock is now bringing blockchain transparency and security to the $500 billion online gambling market and doing it in the most lucrative way imaginable. Rollblock is in the lead right out of the starting gates because it's not the promises of what may be or what it will do – it’s a done deal. Rollblock’s online casino is live and operational, serving tens of thousands of users with hundreds of games and doing it all on the secure backbone of Ethereum. Now, Rollblock is building its liquidity pool with a presale offer and offering all RBLK token holders a weekly share of the revenue generated on the online casino. This token is in presale, which means that it is likely to skyrocket once it hits the open markets. However, with a lucrative token promising passive income, nobody would be willing to sell this exciting new token. Sui (SUI): New layer one breaks out in altcoin season Sui has had a fantastic 2024. Sui’s market cap is up 416% this year alone and is on the verge of breaking into the top 20. Sui’s not even been around for two years, and it is already among the large-cap tokens. There are many Layer1 solutions on the market, but none showed the growth that Sui did. If Suican become legit competition for the ailing Toncoin and the stagnating Tron, Sui may just be one to watch this altcoin season. Pepe Coin (PEPE): cementing meme coin’s place among the best Meme coins have a torrid reputation as pump-and-dump schemes or rug pulls. However, Pepe coin has cast doubts on the meme coin critics by entering the top 20 coins, becoming the third meme coin to enter the top 20 after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Meme coins have a different value system from what TradFi principles and high school economics classes are used to. These are the tokens of the future, governed by community consensus. Pepe Coin’s extremely low price point (four zeros after the decimal point) and blistering clearance times make it the perfect microtransactions payment system. Ignore Pepe Coin at your peril this altcoin season. Conclusion Altcoin season is where crypto profits got its reputation from, and with Pepe coin now a legitimate currency and Sui threatening the big Layer1 players, it’s the best time ever to get involved with smaller, undervalued tokens that have enormous growth potential. Sui and Pepe Coin are available on most good crypto exchanges, but investing in the GambleFi giant Rollblock is only available through their website. Rollblock is available at $0.037.

David Marcus says Libra, later renamed Diem, would have “solved global payments at scale.” The tech executive notes his team spent months briefing “key regulators” in the US and abroad prior to announcing the project in June 2019 alongside 28 other companies. “Two weeks later, I was called to testify in front of both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, which was the starting point of two years of nonstop work and changes to appease lawmakers and regulators. By spring of 2021 (yes they slow-played us at every step), we had addressed every last possible regulatory concern across financial crime, money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, buffers, and so much more, and we were ready to launch. We had worked on a slow rollout of a limited pilot that some members of the Fed’s Board of Governors were supportive of. At last, Chair Jay Powell was ready to let us move forward in a limited way. The story, as I heard it, is that Jay Powell was told by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at one of their biweekly meetings that allowing this project to move forward was ‘political suicide,’ and she would not have his back if he let it happen. I wasn’t in the room when this conversation happened, so take these words with a grain of salt, but effectively this was the moment Libra was killed.” Marcus claims the U.S. Federal Reserve then told banks participating in the Libra project that it wasn’t comfortable with their involvement. “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100% a political kill – one that was executed through intimidation of captive banking institutions.” The Diem Association shuttered in early 2022 and sold off its intellectual property and other assets to Silvergate Capital Corporation, a bank that itself shut down the following year. Marcus now serves as the chief executive of Lightspark, a startup that aims to build Bitcoin ( BTC )-based enterprise payment solutions.

Along with the commencement of staking and governance, this marks the start of the first phase of Namada’s five-stage decentralized mainnet rollout. This marks an important step forward, offering comprehensive data protection and selective disclosure across the multichain landscape. Introducing Namada Namada is designed to enable the protection of users’ personal data when using on-chain assets and engaging in cross-chain transactions. Its key innovation, the MASP (multi-asset shielded pool), can support the shielding of user data related to any asset, enabling shielded interactions across different blockchain networks. Namada enables selective disclosure, giving users the ability to share transaction data publicly and to specific parties. Additionally, Namada is introducing a unique shielding rewards system for users protecting their personal data. Christopher Goes, co-founder of Namada, said, “Namada’s mainnet is a major accomplishment for the many contributors and community members who have worked hard to take Namada from an early idea to a real, operational protocol. “Individual control of data and freedom of disclosure is necessary for a free society. We aren’t there yet, but the Namada mainnet is an important step in the right direction.” The launch is fully decentralized, with the Anoma Foundation supporting the Namada ecosystem by proposing the mainnet candidate software and genesis balances. However, the foundation abstains from running validators, ensuring that the Namada community retains full control over the platform’s launch and direction. Adrian Brink, co-founder of Namada, said, “Namada is an important missing link for the crypto space. Real adoption has been held back by the lack of user control over sensitive data. “The goal of Namada is to give both individual and institutional users, who may have been waiting on the sidelines, the same freedoms and protections they have off-chain.” Key features of Namada Namada introduces a suite of innovative features designed to protect user data while enabling seamless shielded cross-chain interactions. Shielding rewards – Namada’s MASP supports the shielding of data for various assets within a unified shielded set. Users collect shielded set rewards for shielding their assets and enhancing on-chain data protection for everyone. Shielded actions – Users can engage in cross-chain activity, such as DeFi, while keeping their personal data shielded. User data is protected even when interacting with transparent DApps (decentralized applications) and chains. On-chain governance – NAM token holders participate in governance by staking their tokens to vote on protocol upgrades and other decisions. This mechanism ensures that the community has a direct role in the evolution of the network. PFG (public goods funding) – A portion of the NAM inflation is dedicated to funding public goods, supporting projects that benefit the broader Namada ecosystem and beyond. CPoS (cubic proof-of-stake) – Namada’s unique staking mechanism incentivizes network security by adjusting staking rewards based on the network’s current staking ratio. Validators and delegators are rewarded for securing the network, with penalties for protocol violations designed to discourage collusion and enhance overall security. Community-driven genesis process This process will unfold in five stages, each driven by community decisions via on-chain governance. Discussions around the mainnet release candidate software, configurations, genesis block draft and tokenomics have taken place within the Namada community forum , ensuring a transparent, decentralized and collective approach to the launch. The Anoma Foundation proposed the initial set of genesis allocations, including a total supply of one billion NAM tokens with no lockups, distributed among community members, early contributors and future development initiatives. This decentralized approach ensures that the network’s launch and ongoing governance remain in the hands of its users. Namada is poised to support IBC-based assets initially, but can be upgraded in the future to support additional ecosystems, with the aim of becoming the data protection layer for the entire multichain ecosystem. About Namada Namada is the shielded asset hub rewarding users to protect the multichain. By leveraging advanced ZK (zero-knowledge) cryptography, Namada enables selective disclosure of personal data, offering unparalleled data protection across assets, applications and blockchain networks. It introduces shielded cross-chain interactions and shielding rewards for users who protect their data and strengthen its shielded set.

Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and a prominent advocate for the cryptocurrency industry, is said to see the position as a daunting challenge, especially since he sees the agency as having been mismanaged under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Atkins reportedly sees cleaning up Gensler’s “mess” as a significant deterrent to taking on the job. Atkins’ hesitations appear to have been echoed by other regulatory figures, including former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo. A staunch advocate of pro-crypto policies and a supporter of Atkins’ candidacy, Giancarlo has also expressed concerns about the significant work needed to reform the SEC. Giancarlo himself was once considered a candidate for SEC chairman.

Amid this, Cardano (ADA) along with other major cryptocurrencies has experienced a notable rally and has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts. Meanwhile, the altcoin has surged more than 272% in upside momentum in the past 30 days. $231 Million Outflow, A Bullish Sign? Despite significant upside momentum, on-chain metrics hint that ADA is likely to carry this rally in the coming days. According to the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass , since November 23, 2024, ADA’s spot Inflow/Outflow data shows that exchanges have seen a significant $231 million outflow. Source: Coinglass The outflow is a term that defines the amount of assets moved out from the exchanges. In the context of cryptocurrency, outflows often lead to price rallies, reduce the likelihood of selling pressure, and attract investors and traders. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near the $1.20 level and has experienced a modest price decline of 2% in the past 24 hours. However, during the Asian trading session, ADA reached a two-year high of $1.326. Additionally, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 8.5%, indicating a modest increase in trader participation amid ADA’s bullish outlook. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Despite these developments, experts suggest that ADA is currently facing strong resistance near $1.25 and appears to be struggling to breach this level. Based on recent price action, if the altcoin breaks and closes a daily candle above the $1.30 level, it could see a significant 32% upside momentum in the coming days. Source: Trading View Historically, whenever the ADA price reaches or breaks a resistance level, it tends to consolidate before a notable upside rally occurs on the chart. Currently, increased whale interest and confidence in the token suggest potential signs of bullish momentum or a buying opportunity. Geopolitical Uncertainty However, today, December 3, 2024, sentiment appears to be shifting to the downside as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared emergency martial law. This significant development has triggered a notable sell-off of assets in the past few hours.

Market sentiment remains cautious following the U.S. government’s transfer of 10,000 BTC worth approximately $962.88 million from a Silk Road-seized wallet. While this development stirred some jitters, the spotlight has shifted to altcoins like XRP and Solana ( SOL ), which are steadily climbing toward significant milestones, positioning themselves as frontrunners in the race to reach a $200 billion market cap by 2025. With XRP leveraging its growing ecosystem and Solana capitalizing on its DeFi dominance and scalability, both cryptocurrencies are positioned to make significant strides in the evolving digital asset market. XRP XRP, currently priced at $2.59 with a market cap of approximately $146 billion, has cemented its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). With growing regulatory clarity, an expanding ecosystem, and rising institutional demand, XRP is on a clear trajectory to potentially reach a $200 billion market cap by 2025. This milestone would represent a price of approximately $3.55 at the current circulating supply, underpinned by strong fundamentals and favorable market dynamics. The growing regulatory clarity surrounding Ripple Labs serves as a critical catalyst for XRP’s future. Speculation that the SEC may drop its lawsuit against Ripple has eased long-standing uncertainties, bolstering investor confidence and opening doors for institutional participation. Additionally, Ripple’s ecosystem expansion is accelerating, with the anticipated launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, which is expected to enhance liquidity and boost XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and institutional settlements. XRP price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The approval and potential launch of XRP-spot ETFs in the United States could further redefine the market for XRP. Notably, WisdomTree has filed an S-1 with the SEC for an XRP-spot ETF, marking a significant step in institutional interest. This move builds on the success of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), which attracted $217 million in net inflows since its January 2024 launch. Moreover, on-chain data reveals record-breaking whale activity, signaling robust confidence among high-net-worth investors in XRP’s long-term prospects. With these factors aligning, XRP is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious $200 billion market cap, solidifying its place as a leading cryptocurrency in the evolving digital asset landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana, currently valued at $105.62 billion with a price of $222.38 per token, is on track to potentially reach a $200 billion market cap by 2025, representing an additional $94.38 billion in growth. The biggest catalyst for Solana’s growth is the anticipated approval of spot Solana ETFs, with major players like VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise filing applications. With the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler sparking hopes of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the chances of ETF approvals have never been stronger. Solana’s on-chain metrics further strengthen its case. It dominates the decentralized exchange ( DEX ) space with a 45% market share, processing over $6 billion in daily DEX trading volume. Solana price and market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $8.74 billion, nearly doubling since mid-2024, according to DefiLlama. Moreover, Solana’s decentralized applications (DApps) have seen record activity, with 28.87 million unique active wallets interacting with the network in a single week, demonstrating unmatched user engagement in the blockchain space. Institutional confidence in Solana is also at an all-time high. In Q3 2024, Solana-native applications attracted $173 million in investments, a 54% increase quarter-over-quarter, according to Messari . High-profile partnerships, such as Franklin Templeton launching an SEC-compliant money market fund on Solana and Société Générale deploying a MiCA-compliant stablecoin, further highlight the network’s appeal to traditional financial institutions. These developments not only boost Solana’s credibility but also drive adoption on a global scale. As both XRP and Solana capitalize on regulatory breakthroughs, ecosystem expansions, and institutional adoption, their march toward $200 billion market caps appears increasingly feasible. XRP’s focus on liquidity and institutional settlements, combined with Solana’s DeFi dominance and scalable infrastructure, positions these assets as frontrunners in the cryptocurrency race for 2025. With strong fundamentals and strategic initiatives driving their momentum, XRP and Solana are poised to reshape the digital asset landscape, solidifying their roles as leaders in the blockchain ecosystem.

37178631,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/why-bother-trying-to-scale-bitcoin,1733249035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/37178631.jpeg,Why Bother Trying To Scale Bitcoin?,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/why-bother-trying-to-scale-bitcoin,"The public discussion around scaling in the last few years has become poisoned and captured by an incredibly toxic and defeatist attitude: “Why bother?” “Why bother trying to scale? Basic napkin math shows it's impossible no matter what we do for everyone to self custody.” “Why bother trying to scale? People are stupid and lazy anyway, even if we did people would just use a custodian anyways.” “Why bother trying to scale? I’ve got mine, I’ll be rich enough for self custody, who cares about the stupid and lazy plebs anyways?” This attitude is permeating the entire space more and more as time goes on, with a plethora of different rationalizations and reasons for it depending on who you talk to. It is a completely defeatist, dystopian, and pessimistic view of the future. I say that as someone who is incredibly pessimistic about a large number of issues that I see in this ecosystem. Talking yourself into losing is one of the fastest ways to wind up losing. Bitcoin as a distributed system depends on being dispersed enough, and having enough independent system participants, that it can resist the coercive or malicious influence of larger participants. This is critical to it continuing to function as a decentralized and censorship resistant system. If it cannot remain dispersed enough in its distribution then natural tendencies in networks will likely gravitate towards larger and more dense participants until they effectively have an outsized control over the whole network. That will ultimately very likely spell the end for Bitcoin’s most important property: censorship resistance. What is mind boggling to me is, even though we aren’t in a perfect place, we have made massive progress in the last decade. Ten years ago we had people screaming about raising the blocksize. Now we have the Lightning Network, Statechains, and now Ark. We have people experimenting with wildly improved federated custodial models using BitVM. We even have a vague inkling of ways to implement covenants without a softfork if some new cryptographic assumptions pan out and prove practical to implement in a usable way. Even if we do bump into a ceiling eventually we can’t get around, every bit of ground we gain means room for more people to self custody. It means more room for more custodians, allowing more numerous small scale ones to enable people to custody with people they trust more than disconnected corporations, for that more numerous herd to impose greater competitive pressure for custodians in general. To maintain that wide dispersion of entities directly interacting with the network that it needs to maintain its decentralization. Why are so many Bitcoiners willing to throw up their hands and give in to defeatist sentiment? Yes, we have more problems to solve than we did ten years ago, but we have also covered a massive amount of ground in expanding scalability in that ten years. This isn’t a binary situation, this isn’t a game where you win or lose with no middle ground. Every improvement to scalability we can make gives Bitcoin a higher chance of success. It entrenches and defends Bitcoin’s censorship resistance that much more. I’m not saying that people should naively buy into every promised solution or hyped thing, there are definitely problems and limitations we should remain cognizant of. But that doesn’t mean throw in the towel and give up this early. There is so much potential here to actually reshape the world in a meaningful way, but that won’t happen overnight. It won’t happen at all if everyone just gives up and kicks back expecting to get rich and apathetically stops caring about it. Blind pessimism and blind optimism are both poison, it’s time to start looking for a balance between the two rather than picking your drug of choice and sinking into delusion.

Right now, analysts' Solana price predictions all point to a festive boom to the $800 mark - a historical performance that could be fueled by its record-breaking DEX volume uptick and the recent Firedancer Upgrade. But that's not all. A new crypto, Rollblock, is capturing attention with its GambleFi solution and Web3 gaming innovation. In fact, its presale had already garnered over $6.6M, and analysts predict it could increase 800% by the time it concludes. The holiday season is here. Can these high-potential duos dominate? Let's find out. Solana price prediction: Analysts predict $800 surge for SOL Despite the growing adversities, the Solana price clinched a new ATH from its post-FTX woes, and now the Solana price prediction has come out even better. The token did capture the market's imagination this year with an impressive 268% YTD gain. Analysts are even eyeing a bigger milestone of $800, a level that once felt overly ambitious but now seems so much like its natural progression. This optimism stems from Solana’s relentless innovation and an ecosystem thriving on cutting-edge technology. Central to its upward trajectory is the Firedancer upgrade, which brought a transformative leap aimed at turbocharging scalability and performance. And now, an uptick in on-chain metrics tells a more alluring tale. Solana DEX's record volume of $110B in November has outpaced Ethereum's. Institutional interest is also at an ATH, especially with Bitwise's recent filing. That's why savvy experts are gaining confidence from its over-100% post-FTX surge and Real Vision's Raoul Pal chipping in a near-term Solana price prediction of $800. Therefore, the $800 mark isn’t just a dream—it's looking so much like Solana’s next destination. iGaming on blockchain: New crypto Rollblock set for historical festive boom The highlight of this year's holiday has been the new DeFi and GambleFi contender, Rollblock. This innovative new crypto casino platform is set to redefine the fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and online gambling. With a clear focus on utility—Rollblock offers more than promises. This new crypto casino delivers a tangible bridge between blockchain and the multi-billion-dollar online gaming industry. Offering over 7,000 gaming options and an extensive sports betting platform, it caters to a broad audience. But the true allure lies beyond entertainment. Rollblock provides investors with unparalleled passive income opportunities, a feature that has driven its presale success and positioned it as a game-changer in both the DeFi and gaming spaces. At the heart of its investment appeal is its revenue-sharing model. Additionally, RBLK holders benefit from cashback rewards and staking opportunities, with potential returns as high as 30% APY. That spells out why analysts are weighing in with bold predictions of massive returns from its current presale stage—the price is just $0.037, and over $6.7M has been raised already. Conclusion The crypto market is alive with possibilities, and all eyes are on two standout contenders: Solanaand Rollblock. Solana's incredible resilience and innovation are setting the stage for a potential $800 price surge. Meanwhile, Rollblock is revolutionizing the GambleFi and Web3 gaming landscape with its unmatched utility and passive income opportunities, already raising over $6.7M in its presale.

In a blog post titled “The Cure,” Hayes called the ICO the “most value-destructive” offering of the year. Hayes delved into the post-launch stagnation of EOS. His criticism centers on the project’s controversial methods, particularly its centralized governance structure. He offered a cautionary tale about the perils of investing in projects that promise revolutionary technology but fail to deliver in the long run. EOS ICO: The ICO That Set a Record, But Fell Short When EOS launched its ICO in June 2017, it quickly became the largest token sale in crypto history, raising $4.1 billion in a year. The crypto community was excited, hoping it would solve scalability issues and improve decentralized governance. However, after launch, EOS struggled with technical glitches, governance problems, and a lack of innovation. By 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Block.one for conducting an unregistered securities offering. This ultimately led to a $24 million settlement. EOS’s big promises were gradually revealed to be empty. The Risks of Overvalued Tokens: Hayes’ Cautionary Advice One of Hayes’ key messages is the danger of investing in high Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) and low float tokens. He warned that tokens listed on centralized exchanges, like EOS, can usually be overvalued, leading to significant losses for investors. According to Hayes, these tokens often appear promising at first but fail to live up to expectations, as was the case with EOS. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the risks associated with such tokens and advocates for more caution in the marketplace. Hayes drew attention to the stark contrast between EOS’s initial hype and its long-term stagnation. Despite these failures, EOS maintained a market cap of $1.2 billion. Hayes sees this as a reflection of the crypto market’s unpredictable and volatile nature. At its peak, EOS’s price reached $22.89 in April 2018, but it has since plunged by 95%, trading at just $1.15 today. Hayes Urges a New Vision for ICOs While Hayes is critical of the EOS ICO, he is not entirely dismissive of the ICO model. He calls for a return to ICOs that offer real opportunities for retail investors to participate in projects with long-term potential. Hayes advocates focusing on new projects that can prove their worth through innovation. He emphasizes the importance of delivering on promises to gain trust and support. He believes this is the key to reviving investor confidence and ensuring the success of future blockchain ventures.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A $25K Ethereum prediction fuels market excitement, with XRP eyeing $3.8 and WallitIQ set to soar from $0.01 to $30. Table of Contents WallitIQ presents the best market gains in the brewing bull run Ethereum price set to rise massively to $25,000 as analyst predicts XRP price set to reclaim $3.8 amid positive developments in the SEC case Conclusion A $25,000 analyst prediction on the Ethereum price has sparked excitement in the market as the altcoin shows strength amid recent trends. As the market eyes a potential Ethereum price rally, the XRP price is also poised for a significant price rebound towards $3.8. However, new presale star WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the standout opportunity in the crypto market amid analyst predictions of a price jump from $0.01 to $30. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a rare presale opportunity for early investors to capitalize on life-changing returns in this brewing bull market. You might also like: Crypto whales eye PEPE at $2, but experts predict WallitIQ will hit $15 by 2024’s end WallitIQ presents the best market gains in the brewing bull run Although Ethereum (ETH) and the XRP price have the potential for a price surge, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a better opportunity to profit from its ongoing presale. Presales are known as one of the best profit possibilities in the crypto market. However, venture capitalist firms and angel investors willing to buy in on early projects have swallowed these opportunities in recent years. With WallitIQ, the public presale again brings this opportunity to the broader market. This opportunity enables investors to buy early into an exciting project introducing a unique crypto wallet solution integrating artificial intelligence. Capitalizing on artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, WallitIQ aims to solve core issues related to security, user experience, and financial literacy in the decentralized wallet ecosystem. WallitIQ will also introduce unique intelligent security solutions, personalization features, and educational resources to provide a straightforward solution to identified issues with existing crypto wallets. However, the uniqueness of this wallet solution shines via other unique features such as smart transactions, predictive analytics, market insights, AI chatbot, and many more. Analyst insights suggest that WallitIQ may be the breakout star of this bull run. With predictions of a price surge to $30 from its presale price of $0.00171, the profit margin presents a potential that rivals the best rises the market has ever seen. The prospects of the new coin reassure investors of making insane gains amid the bullish market trends. Furthermore, the WallitIQ smart contract has passed an audit by SolidProof , and the coin is already listed on CoinMarketCap . The early signs align for a massive price surge on WallitIQ, and its ongoing presale is the best opportunity. Ethereum price set to rise massively to $25,000 as analyst predicts The Ethereum price is trading above $3,500 for the first time since July when market excitement was high for the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Analyst insights suggest the recent trend could indicate a brewing rally after months of underwhelming performance. As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates ahead of a surge to $100,000, the Ethereum price is gaining momentum to kickstart its rally. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is $3,566, with a 5% surge in the past week. With investors eyeing an altcoin season in the coming months, analyst predictions set a $25,000 target for the Ethereum price. XRP price set to reclaim $3.8 amid positive developments in the SEC case The XRP price has shocked crypto enthusiasts in recent weeks. It has been hitting a bullish trend since Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections earlier in November. Since then, the price has seen a 200% gain as investors anticipate a possible end to the four-year-long Ripple—SEC battle. With an end to the conflict on the horizon, investors are anticipating an XRP price surge to massive highs in this bull run. As of this writing, the XRP price is at $1.66, a price level that has not been seen since 2021. Conclusion WallitIQ , Ethereum, and the XRP price present exciting market opportunities to target in this bull run. However, WallitIQ appears to be the favorite for obvious reasons. Analysts’ predictions for the new presale star tease a potential return of over 30,000% for early investors. The profit margin is a contender for the best gains in this brewing market, and it would be a mistake not to buy in early. Buy WLTQ on the ongoing presale at $0.0171 before the presale price rises to $0.0243 in the next stage.

This upswing has caught the attention of investors as bullish market trends dominate December. LUNC’s momentum is further strengthened by increased token burns, with 3.1 billion tokens removed from circulation. This reduction in supply may support continued price growth as investor interest in LUNC intensifies. LUNC Price Leaps 30% After Huge 3.1 Billion Token Burn Terra Classic has experienced a significant surge in value, with its price shooting up by 30% following a recent token burn of over 3.1 billion tokens. The burn, part of ongoing efforts to reduce the circulating supply of LUNC, has sparked renewed interest in the token. Since May 13, 2022, a total of 392.84 billion LUNC tokens have been burned, significantly shrinking the coin’s circulating supply. Currently, there are 5.52 trillion LUNC tokens in circulation, down from the total supply of 6.51 trillion. The recent burn is seen as a strategic move to increase the token’s scarcity, often leading to price appreciation. The 3.1 billion tokens burned in the last week have contributed to the growing optimism surrounding LUNC’s potential in the market. Source- LUNC Burn Can Terra Classic Price Hit $0.01 In 2024? In the last 24 hours, the LUNC price has experienced a notable price increase, showing signs of an upward trend. The Terra Classic price is currently at $0.0001631, marking a more than 30% gain during the U.S. trading session. This surge highlights a larger positive momentum, as the cryptocurrency reached a daily high of $0.0001627 earlier today. The recent price action suggests that LUNC could be on the verge of breaking through its immediate resistance level of $0.000163. If it surpasses this, the cryptocurrency may target the $0.0001 mark. Continued bullish momentum could push the price even higher, potentially reaching $0.001 in the coming days. Technical indicators also support the idea of further growth for LUNC. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at around 78, signaling that the asset is overbought. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveals a slightly bullish trend as the MACD line moves above the signal line. This divergence suggests increased buying pressure, strengthening the case for continued upward movement. LUNC Price Chart: TradingView LUNC’s recent surge, fueled by the 3.1 billion token burn, highlights growing market confidence. Continued supply reduction and bullish market conditions could push LUNC’s price further, potentially reaching new highs.

By sourcing liquidity from on-chain and off-chain venues, Perennial Intents is delivering deeper markets, better prices, and a unified trading experience designed to move DeFi forward. Tackling DeFi’s Liquidity Fragmentation “Perennial Intents arrive at a pivotal time for DeFi,” said Kevin Britz, Founder of Perennial. “Despite its growth, only a fraction of crypto’s order flow happens on-chain, most of which is fragmented across hundreds of L1s and L2s. The rise of appchains and isolated AMMs has led to over 100 chains with $10M+ in TVL ( DeFiLlama ), each operating its own siloed financial ecosystem. This fragmented liquidity leads to worse trade execution, with higher costs, increased slippage, and limited leverage opportunities.” According to the team, Perennial Intents address these challenges by consolidating order flow into a unified liquidity layer. Instead of fragmenting liquidity into silos like appchains or AMM pools, intent-based trading integrates order flow across multiple venues, creating a more cohesive and efficient system. A Hybrid Model for the Future of DeFi Although intents are not new to DeFi, Perennial Intents introduce a layered model that combines intent-based off-chain order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. Perennial claims this model streamlines trading by pairing intent-based order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. The team claims this hybrid approach guarantees optimal price execution for traders while enabling solvers to dynamically manage liquidity without long-term collateral constraints—unlocking deeper markets and greater efficiency. One-Click Trading and the Perennial Petals Program Alongside Perennial Intents, the launch includes two additional upgrades: one-click trading and the Perennial Petals points program. Traders can now enjoy seamless trading with a single collateral account, while the Petals program rewards users with points for their trading activity, with 2x points available during the initial launch period. The team at Arbitrum shared their excitement for the launch, highlighting the transformative potential of intent-based derivatives. “Perennial’s work with intent-based derivatives is transforming DeFi by aligning market interactions with users’ specific goals,” said Peter Haymond, Senior Partnerships Manager at Offchain Labs. “This approach lets users define their desired financial outcomes, enabling more efficient and personalized trading on Arbitrum.”.

Trump has selected the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to chair the SEC, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. One source specified that Trump has reached out to Atkins but is waiting on him to accept. https://t.co/qszH4xX454 — db (@tier10k) December 3, 2024 Sources close to the matter told Unchained on Tuesday that Trump is finalizing his decision, with an announcement expected as soon as today. Crypto Community Welcomes Atkins’ Return Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, is regarded as a crypto-friendly figure. Currently the CEO of Patomak Global Partners, a consultancy advising banks, cryptocurrency companies, and financial trading firms, Atkins is recognized for his extensive regulatory experience. His selection has been widely interpreted as a nod to Trump’s campaign promise to support cryptocurrency innovation and provide clearer regulatory guidelines. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett had teased the potential announcement in a December 2 X post , writing, “NEW: @realDonaldTrump’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Stay tuned.” NEW: @realDonaldTrump ’s pick to replace @GaryGensler as @SECGov Chair could be announced as soon as tomorrow, sources tell @FoxBusiness . Stay tuned . — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 3, 2024 Gensler’s Departure Ends Controversial Tenure Gensler announced his resignation last month , effective January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. His time as SEC chair has been defined by an aggressive enforcement stance toward the cryptocurrency industry, targeting companies such as Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken for alleged violations of securities laws. While praised by some for maintaining the SEC’s hardline approach, Gensler faced criticism for a lack of clarity in digital asset regulations . @GaryGensler to step down as @SECGov Chair in January 2025, concluding a term of bold enforcement actions in the crypto space. #CryptoRegulations #GaryGensler #SEC https://t.co/iKmVa3QkSM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 21, 2024 In his farewell statement , Gensler expressed gratitude for his tenure, saying, “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans.” Atkins’ nomination is seen as part of a broader overhaul of the SEC’s leadership. In addition to Gensler’s departure, Democratic commissioner Jaime Lizárraga has announced his intention to step down in January, leaving the agency with two Republican commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, and one Democrat, Caroline Crenshaw. Crenshaw’s term is also set to expire, giving Trump the ability to reshape the SEC’s composition and policy direction. Peirce and Uyeda, known for their pro-market stances, have also been floated as potential candidates for the chair position. However, Atkins’ longstanding experience and industry ties make him a strong frontrunner. A Pro-Crypto Future for U.S. Regulation? Atkins’ potential appointment has generated optimism within the cryptocurrency sector, where Gensler’s enforcement-driven policies were seen as a hindrance to innovation. Atkins, by contrast, is expected to adopt a more collaborative approach, focusing on providing clear guidelines for compliance rather than pursuing punitive actions. Trump’s selection reflects a strategic shift in U.S. regulatory policy, with an emphasis on positioning the country as a global leader in digital finance. While the success of Atkins in achieving this vision is not guaranteed, his background shows an inclination to collaborate with the industry. As Trump narrows down his cabinet choices, Mar-a-Lago could be the setting for critical decisions shaping cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. The post Trump Expected to Announce Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins as SEC Chair Replacement appeared first on Cryptonews .",News|Paul Atkins|SEC Chair|US Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-03 19:01:46

Coinbase Cuts Ties with Milbank In a post on X, Armstrong revealed that Coinbase severed ties with Milbank following the latter’s decision to hire Gurbir Grewal, the former SEC enforcement director. The SEC had announced on October 2 that Grewal would step down, highlighting his role in recommending over 100 enforcement actions against noncompliance in the digital asset sector. By October 15th, Milbank welcomed Grewal to its litigation and arbitration team, with chairman Scott Edelman commending his accomplishments as a federal prosecutor and SEC official. Armstrong stated that this hiring prompted Coinbase to discontinue its relationship with the law firm. The Coinbase exec criticized senior figures within the agency for allegedly attempting to stifle the crypto sector without clear regulatory guidance, noting that some SEC staff chose to leave rather than participate in what he deems an “abnormal” tenure. While clarifying that he opposes “permanently canceling people,” Armstrong called on the crypto industry to collectively refuse to fund individuals whose past actions contributed to what he described as regulatory overreach. Coinbase CEO Aligns With Trump Team Armstrong had previously championed pro-crypto figures in government, backing Hester Peirce to lead the SEC. This mirrors the exchange’s hefty $100 million in political donations, including $40 million to Fairshake PAC. Although Armstrong refrained from directly supporting Trump’s campaign, his approval of policies like D.O.G.E. highlights an openness to cooperating with the President-elect’s administration. Last month, CryptoPotato reported that Armstrong is expected to meet privately with Trump to discuss high-profile government appointments crucial to the crypto industry, such as Treasury Secretary and SEC chair. Trump’s transition team reportedly arranged the meeting, reflecting the administration’s pro-crypto stance.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in a seemingly politically motivated move, prompting the military to attempt to enter parliament in Seoul. However, shortly thereafter, every single member of Korean parliament voted against the president’s declaration, making it invalid. During the commotion, BTC prices in KRW dipped dramatically. Says Korean-based CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, “South Korea’s financial markets are in chaos because of the president’s political show.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Traders often watch the price of Bitcoin in South Korea to spot arbitrage opportunities with the “kimchi premium,” which refers to the gap between BTC’s price in the country and US markets. According to Ju, the political scuffle in Seoul pushed the kimchi premium down to all-time lows. “Bitcoin kimchi premium hits an all-time low. Shouldn’t Bitcoin go up during times of political instability? Why did the people selling now even buy Bitcoin in the first place?” Source: Ki Young Ju/X According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, many whales deposited stablecoins into Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges, trying to catch “bottom-fishing opportunities” amid the price crash in Bitcoin. “The Korean crypto market has plummeted following South Korea’s declaration of ‘martial law.’ Many whales transferred large amounts of USDT to Upbit, likely aiming for bottom-fishing opportunities. Within 1 hour after the declaration of ‘martial law’ over 163M USDT flowed into Upbit.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,772.

President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly set on naming former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler at the top of the federal securities watchdog, according to sources with inside knowledge on the matter. Atkins has been a vocal supporter of the crypto industry, and many believe he could stem the scorched earth approach employed by the SEC during chair Gensler’s four years in charge. Ahead of Trump’s January inauguration, Gensler announced his resignation , much to the delight of blockchain proponents who felt hard done by his anti-crypto litigation agenda. The general crypto social media consensus suggested that Atkins is well endorsed by industry leaders, who expect fresh SEC leadership under Trump’s administration. Atkins was named as Trump’s preferred pick for the position over the past few weeks, and the President’s team even contacted the ex-SEC official to discuss the role. However, Atkins is hesitant to accept Trump’s offer, Coindesk reported . Insiders reportedly noted Atkins was reluctant to undo Gensler’s mess, a stance shared by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Chris Giancarlo, who was also mentioned as a possible SEC chair candidate. As for reports that I’m in mix to run @SECGov , I’ve made clear that I’ve already cleaned up earlier Gary Gensler mess @CFTC and don’t want to have do it again. DC rumors that I’m interested in some #crypto role @USTreasury are also wrong. — Chris Giancarlo (@giancarloMKTS) November 14, 2024 You might also like: Former commissioner Paul Atkins is top candidate for SEC chair Should Atkins refuse the appointment, at least two other crypto-savvy candidates have been mentioned in the mix. Former Binance U.S. CEO Brian Brooks and securities law expert Teressa Goody Guillén were named as potential options. EX-SEC official and Robinhood Markets CLO Dan Gallagher was also in contention before dropping out of the pool last month. Current SEC Commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce were floated as potential Gensler replacements, but crypto lawyer Jakes Chervinsky downplayed the chances. Chervinsky thinks President Trump would rather appoint a new official. Very low, only because I don’t think she wants the job. I’d give decent odds to Uyeda, although I expect Trump may prefer to bring in someone new of his own. — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) November 6, 2024 Despite uncertainty over Atkins’s decision, the industry is confident that Trump will nominate a pro-crypto official as his SEC chair when he takes office next month. The President and his transition team have also explored appointing the first U.S. crypto czar to spearhead digital asset policy in Washington.

The firm’s CEO, Josh Miller had previously teased the launch of an AI product in October. Yesterday’s video ended the speculation as the firm revealed its AI productivity browser, Dia. The message on Dia’s website homepage: “AI won’t exist as an app. Or a button. We believe it’ll be an entirely new environment — built on top of a web browser,” suggests that The Browser Company is keen on integrating AI into its product line. This AI integration would be following in the footsteps of other browsers like Microsoft Edge and Brave. The Browser Company shares ambitious plans for Dia AI browser According to The Browser Company, Dia is a web browser built to help users with everyday tasks using AI straight from the browser. It also teased features such as the “Write the next line” feature, which is similar to an advanced version of the AI chatbots by searching the internet and pulling contextual information. Other features advertised in the browser include workflow automation, such as assisting with emails, and shopping, among other things. The emphasis on automation is a tip of the hat to repetitive task reduction, a trend being advertised in the new generation of browsers that serve as productivity tools rather than just applications to surf the internet. With its Dia browser, the Browser Company is looking to take a bite of the blossoming AI apple. Its latest AI venture comes on the heels of a successful series A earlier this year, which raised about $50 million and brought the firm’s valuation to $550 million. Speaking about the future of the Arc browser, CEO Miller says the company has no plans to kill it. However, he hinted that it may be phased out naturally, saying, “In my bones, I feel like this is so obviously where the world’s going.” Competition and ethical concerns stand in the way of AI browsers While the idea of AI-powered browsers looks novel, Dia enters a competitive market. Established players like Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera browsers were earlier to the party. Edge hangs its hat on productivity by focusing on summarization and content creation. Brave appeals to users concerned about privacy with its LEO AI assistant, while Opera integrates with ChatGPT. By far, Microsoft Edge appears to have the biggest lead in the AI browser race, taking advantage of its large ecosystem and superior cross-platform operability. There are also reports of OpenAI considering developing a web browser that would integrate deeply with users’ online experience. If it goes down that path, it could also potentially intensify the competition in the AI browser space. While AI browsers could bring various AI capabilities closer to everyday users as part of their internet surfing experience, there are also several pressing questions about AI ethics and data privacy. Dia and other AI browsers would rely heavily on user data to automate tasks like document handling and email generation. This would also exponentially increase the risks of data privacy law breaches and misuse.

All of them have impressive features that could make a significant mark on the digital economy, but which one is truly poised for greatness in the near future? While Tron and Cronos are established projects, Qubetics is making waves with its recent milestones, especially as it surges into its 11th presale stage with $4.2 million raised, more than 261 million $TICS tokens sold, and over 5,900 holders. With the presale price currently at $0.0282, analysts predict a potential 871% ROI by the end of the presale and even greater returns once the mainnet launches. So, why is everyone talking about these three? Let’s dive into each one and see how they stack up in the race for dominance in the blockchain world. Qubetics: The New Contender in Town Qubetics has already raised over $4.2 million in its 11th presale stage. The project is shaking up the crypto space with its Layer 1 Web3 aggregated blockchain, designed to unify all blockchain networks—including Bitcoin—through chain abstraction. That’s right, Qubetics is enabling EVM, Wasm, and Bitcoin compatibility, making it a truly versatile solution for the digital economy. What makes Qubetics truly stand out, however, is the combination of its QubeQode IDE and its focus on real-world applications. The QubeQode interface makes blockchain development easy, even for beginners. It’s like a drag-and-drop builder for decentralized applications (dApps), powered by AI. Think of it as the WordPress of blockchain development—and it’s here to revolutionize how we interact with blockchain technology. With over 6,000 token holders and analysts predicting $TICS will surge to $0.25 at the end of the presale, the potential returns are staggering. Imagine entering the presale at $0.0282 and watching your investment soar as Qubetics becomes the next big thing. For example, a $10,000 investment at the current presale price could see you holding 354,000 $TICS tokens. At the projected $0.25 price per token, that could result in $88,500—an ROI of over 785%. And if Qubetics hits its $15 target after the mainnet launch, well… you do the math. But it’s not just the price action that’s grabbing attention. Qubetics is also addressing critical problems in scalability, security, and interoperability, all while making digital finance and tokenized asset trading more accessible. It’s solving real-world problems and promising decentralised VPN , and that’s something investors are starting to take seriously. For more information, watch this video . Tron: A Veteran With Momentum Tron has been around for a while now, and with good reason: it’s a blockchain that has built a reputation for offering fast transactions and low fees. Initially created by Justin Sun in 2017, Tron is an Ethereum competitor that allows for the decentralised creation and management of digital content. What makes it special is its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for content creators, streaming services, and other dApp developers. But lately, Tron has been looking even better. With its TRX token and continuous developments, including collaborations with major companies like BitTorrent, the platform is seeing increasing adoption. As of today, Tron is making strides with its DeFi ecosystem, and it’s positioning itself as an important player in the NFT space. Many investors are eyeing it as a reliable long-term hold due to its liquidity and transactional scalability. If you’re someone who prefers a more established crypto asset with a proven track record, Tron could be a safer bet. The project’s price currently hovers around $0.23, but analysts expect it to break out in the coming months, especially as its dApp ecosystem grows. Cronos: The Blockchain for DeFi and NFTs Now let’s talk about Cronos—a rising star in the DeFi and NFT space. Cronos is the native blockchain of Crypto.com, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s a layer-1 chain that aims to bridge DeFi and traditional finance, providing developers with fast, low-cost transactions. While Cronos has had a steady rise since its inception in 2018, its focus on scalability and interoperability makes it a serious contender in the race for DeFi dominance. Cronos allows projects to interact with Ethereum, Cosmos, and other blockchain ecosystems, ensuring that it’s able to tap into multiple chains. In fact, Cronos is known for its low fees, speed, and robust security. It’s built with developers in mind, offering easy integration with dApps and decentralized exchanges. For those who are already invested in Crypto.com, Cronos is a natural choice. The platform’s CRO token has seen consistent growth, and as the DeFi space expands, so too will Cronos’ ecosystem. While Cronos offers a compelling use case in the DeFi and NFT spaces, it’s important to note that Qubetics’ cross-chain vision and innovative tools like QubeQode set it apart by tackling a wider range of blockchain issues. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Is the Best Bet Right Now While Tron and Cronos have carved out strong niches in the crypto market, Qubetics is a game-changer with its multi-blockchain compatibility and groundbreaking QubeQode IDE. The ongoing presale, now in its 11th stage, has already raised over $4.2 million, and the price of $TICS is still incredibly low at $0.0282. Qubetics is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the future of the digital economy. With its $TICS token set to surge to $0.25 after the presale and the mainnet launch predicted to take it all the way to $15, now is the time to get in. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of something huge—Qubetics is the best ongoing presale to buy now, and it’s not too late to secure your place before the price skyrockets. Ready to jump in? Get in on the Qubetics presale today and start your journey to massive gains!

Alphractal’s Adjusted Sharpe Ratio indicator is approaching the Extreme Risk zone, indicating significant potential for near-term price volatility. The company urged investors to prepare for unpredictable moves as XRP approaches this critical threshold. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric is at 0.63, placing the market between the “Belief” and “Denial” phases. Historically, analysts have said that when NUPL reaches 0.7, it aligns with market tops, indicating that XRP may be entering overheated territory. Related News: Fresh News from South Korea Keeps Coming - Here's a Recap of All the Events Affecting the Bitcoin Price Alphractal’s Price Dynamics Models, which track the relationship between XRP’s cumulative market cap and circulating supply, have consistently identified market bottoms and tops in the past. According to the analysis, if XRP experiences a price rally similar to the 2017 rally, the model suggests a potential target above $10. XRP is currently sitting at a key resistance level set by the 2-Year Simple Moving Average (SMA) Multiple. This level played a key role during XRP’s 2017 breakout. Alphractal asked the critical question: Will history repeat itself? Alphractal also reported that 5,200 new crypto millionaires have emerged among wallets holding XRP following the recent surge. *This is not investment advice.

The Heimdall and Bor hard forks are live. They aim to improve performance and stability and include an upgradeable burn contract. The Heimdall Hard Fork According to the official documentation , the latest version of the Heimdall upgrade, namely v1.07-bone has been released for the Shibarium blockchain. Amid the numerous features of the upgrade are: Documentation enhancements Improvements to code validation Dependency upgrades; Bug fixes, etc. Following the hard fork, validators on Shibarium have to upgrade to the version before the Dencun hard fork takes place on Bor.

The Bor Hard Fork This particular release is focused on improved performance, blockchain management, security, as well as incorporating certain merges. One of the most important features of the Bor upgrade is the new burn contract. Per the official documentation: We are upgrading the burn contract to an upgradable version to support exciting future updates and enhancements.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2027 anticipates a price range of $ 0.00005776 to $ 0.00006925. In 2030, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $ 0.000113 with an average price of $ 0.000116. Bonk is one of the most successful crypto projects in 2024. The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.7 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2030, Bonk will reach $0.000292, which is approximately 15 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a substantial portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased by $0.000004080. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a massive descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading in its middle price range. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price has initiated a recovery as the crypto pair has secured support at the $0.00001812 level. The recovery can continue as long as buyers remain consistent. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000255. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by mid-2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Cryptopolitan’s Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000292 by the end of 2030, which is quite a bit above its current price.

In an announcement, Coinbase says that it has added MOG Coin ( MOG ) to its listing roadmap, which the exchange uses for transparency and to prevent insider trading on coins prior to them being listed. The announcement means the firm has determined the asset will likely be available for trading in the near future. MOG is trading for $0.000002414 at time of writing, up more than 8,776% in the last year. With a market cap of $944.5 million, Mog Coin is the 138th largest crypto project. MOG, which is available on both the Ethereum ( ETH ) and Base blockchains, is already listed on crypto exchanges such as Kraken, Gate, Bybit and Bitstamp. The project calls the digital asset “the internet’s first culture coin.” The name of the memecoin is derived from AMOG, which means the “alpha male of the group,” and its symbol is a “joycat.” “The idea for Mog began as a fun meme among friends, and in the Summer of 2023 the token was launched as a fair launch memecoin via a Uniswap V2 LP. Although it started as a joke among friends, when the project went live it became immediately clear that something truly special had been created. Mog immediately set itself apart from other projects through its open-ended memetic branding and unique content. The cultural underpinning of Mog, effortless cosmic domination, is an idea and mentality that anyone can adopt, and can be applied to any situation in life.” Coinbase also recently announced it added the new Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Moo Deng ( MOODENG ) to its listing roadmap. MOODENG is trading for $0.53 at time of writing. With a market cap of $526.4 million, it is the 206th largest crypto project.

In a new interview with CNN’s Inside Politics, Wood says Trump will likely usher in more business-friendly regulations for artificial intelligence (AI), digital assets and other tech-related businesses, causing them to flourish. “In the last four years, we saw massive concentration towards very few stocks. I think the market’s going to broaden out right now and reward companies who are at the leading edge of innovation, not just those who have already been very successful… We think it’s going to help small and medium businesses.” Wood says that US regulations on crypto, in particular, have hampered the country’s ability to lead in the sector. She also blames outgoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s aggressive position on digital assets for hurting the crypto sector. “I think the biggest problem we have is regulation, too much regulation, and we as a country, the US, almost lost our footing in the cryptocurrency world… Chairman Gary Gensler at the SEC didn’t think it was safe or what have you. And so we drove a lot of talent away from the United States. We think that’s going to change with a focus on crypto and AI. There are five major platforms evolving in the world today. I mentioned AI as the biggest platform shift. Crypto, or we call it blockchain technology, digital assets, is the second. Robotics, energy storage and multiomic sequencing. Those are all technology platforms that the US must seize and harness really, and lead the way, much like we did in the Internet. We were about to lose that given our regulatory system. And I think a change in the regulatory system with both crypto and AI as prime focuses is going to be quite meaningful.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, there has been no official confirmation from either Atkin or Trump’s team regarding these developments. SEC New Chair: Paul Atkin or Rumor? Although this rumored news is spreading like wildfire on social media, it has caught the attention of several crypto and ETF experts from Bloomberg . However, according to an expert’s post on X (formerly Twitter), Trump has reached out to Atkin for the SEC position, but the agency is still awaiting confirmation. Despite the lack of official confirmation, the buzz has influenced market sentiment. Altcoins like XRP, BNB, and XLM have seen modest gains of 3.4%, 3.2%, and 4.15%, respectively, as traders speculate on a more crypto-friendly SEC under Atkin’s potential leadership. Who is Paul Atkin? However, Atkin is a former SEC Commissioner who served under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008. He has been vocal in his support of the crypto industry and was the first libertarian to serve as an SEC Commissioner. Known for his innovative approach and crypto expertise, Atkin is regarded as capable of “returning the agency to the so-called gold standard,” according to a crypto expert on X (formerly Twitter).",News|Crypto news|SEC,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 19:55:40

But amid the gloomy forecast, lies a glimmer of hope: tokenization. Per the study, payment cryptographs — tokenization — can be a crucial ally in combating the runaway scams bedeviling the e-commerce sector. GP suggests that tokenization when fully exploited, can ensure timely and secure transaction completion. Through it, users can use biometrics and passkeys to unlock devices linked to their payment credentials. Thus, they act as a barrier to unauthorized access to one’s transactional data. The report states: Tokenization converts sensitive data into unique digital tokens that can be securely and efficiently transmitted over borders using standard definitions, reducing the need for complex verification processes. ~ Global Payments report GP’s findings also highlighted the centrality of the payment cryptographs to the global e-commerce sector. The firm reckons that the tokenization technology will account for $290 billion of the sector’s transactions by 2030. This potential has prompted major players, such as Amazon, to adopt tokenization. The tech giant is testing its Amazon Payments Cryptography Service which it intends to use in automating and consolidating its payment functions. America lags in fighting e-commerce fraud Interestingly, the report shows that the US is lagging behind Europe and Asia in its efforts to thwart digital fraud. This situation is due to the country’s fragmented market and its slower uptake of new standards. But that is changing now with the payments sector’s adoption of new tech such as passkeys. That’s an assertion that Amazon’s Senior Operations Lead Mark Smith concurs with. He suggests that the American payment industry was finding ways to modernize its infrastructure after years of following a different tangent. Smith’s views seem to resonate with Visa’s Head of Consumer Products, Marc Nelsen. He held that US banks delayed adopting self-authentication on mobile apps. That situation contrasts with Europe, where regulations require robust customer identification, leading to lower fraud rates. America’s shift in managing online scams draws from the increase in AI-based con games. The power of technology allows ill-intentioned actors to try mass phishing individuals and businesses. AI could be the key to taming growing phishing attempts Global Payments’ report also indicates that phishing attacks have increased with the continued adoption of remote work and artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional multi-factor authentication methods have struggled to keep pace with these advancements. In light of this development, the report calls for concerted efforts to fight this vice. It concludes that digital fraud taxes everyone by passing on the service costs to the end users. Through its ability to intelligently score risks and undertake behavioral analysis, AI offers firms the means for stemming payment fraud.

According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has made impressive strides, increasing 121% last month and 3% in the past week. Currently, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.3956, with its 24-hour trading volume down by 3% to $6 billion and its market cap dipping by 1% to $58 billion. With the Dogecoin price aiming for new price highs, analysts have revealed that it must break past resistance levels and overcome bear pressure to see any notable gains. Despite these fluctuations, the Dogecoin price still holds lesser investment and bullish opportunities than the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token which analysts are urging investors to invest in fast before its presale ends. Ripple (XRP) Gains Momentum: Could It Surge 54,540% In The Coming Days? Ripple (XRP), a well-known player in cross-border payments, has been catching analysts’ attention, with projections suggesting that it could rally 54,540% in 8 days. After a recent surge of 31% in just one week and 175% over the past month, the Ripple (XRP) price is gaining momentum, primarily driven by a wave of positive news. The most significant factor fueling this bullish trend is the announcement that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler will step down in January 2025. As a result, the Ripple (XRP) community may finally leave behind the lengthy regulatory battles it has faced. Ripple (XRP), now trading at $1.46, could be poised for an explosive rally as the regulatory landscape shifts to a more favorable stance. If the Ripple (XRP) cryptocurrency breaks free from its recent bearish trend, analysts predict it could soar by 54,540% in the coming days. Conclusion The forecasted 54,540% surge in 8 days, wallet features, and the low WallitIQ (WLTQ) price at $0.0171 draw savvy investors to its presale. Currently priced at an affordable $0.0171 , the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will jump to $0.0243 in the next stage, making now the perfect time to secure a stake before it skyrockets.

Crypto analyst Kevin, known on the social media platform X as @Kev_Capital_TA, has shared an updated perspective on a positive trajectory for the Dogecoin price, maintaining that the range of $1.30 to $1.50 is still a viable target. His recent post pointed to this price zone as a critical point of interest on his macro chart, aligning with the current market sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Revisiting Kevin’s Macro Analysis And Earlier Projections This bullish prediction regarding the Dogecoin price builds on Kevin’s earlier analysis from September 18, where he outlined broader price targets as it approached a golden cross on the weekly timeframe for the first time in four years. This technical pattern is often seen as a signal of sustained bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $245,000? Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It Back then, he suggested that the Dogecoin price performance during this cycle could lead to price levels ranging from $0.93 for moderate growth to as high as $3.80 in an exceptionally strong market environment. Interestingly, both of these targets would see the Dogecoin price trading at new price territories higher than the 2021 peak. At that time, the Dogecoin price was trading at $0.10 and was on its way to break above the upper trendline of a descending channel. Since then, it has reached a peak of $0.44, translating to a 340% increase. Since the analysis, the meme coin has manifested this golden cross, prompting a strong bullish outlook for its price trajectory. Kevin’s updated $1.30-$1.50 target represents a midpoint that reflects both the coin’s current trajectory and the potential for continued growth under favorable conditions. The Path To $1.5 Dogecoin’s chart patterns and broader market sentiment support Kevin’s optimism. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.4237 and has declined by about 2.5% in the past 24 hours since it reached a peak of $0.44. Interestingly, this $0.44 peak saw the Dogecoin price reach its highest point since May 2021.

However, the first step would be a decisive break above $0.44 and then a successive break above its current all-time high of $0.7316. Having already climbed by 330% over the past six weeks, Dogecoin is displaying signs of sustained growth, supported by market conditions and technical indicators. Dogecoin enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the outcome of the scheduled address by Department Of Government Efficiency leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to Congress on December 5.

By sourcing liquidity from on-chain and off-chain venues, Perennial Intents is delivering deeper markets, better prices and a unified trading experience designed to move DeFi forward. Tackling DeFi’s liquidity fragmentation Kevin Britz, founder of Perennial, said, “Perennial Intents arrive at a pivotal time for DeFi. Despite its growth, only a fraction of crypto’s order flow happens on-chain – most of which is fragmented across hundreds of layer-ones and layer-twos. “The rise of appchains and isolated AMMs has led to over 100 chains with over $10 million in TVL (total value locked), each operating its own siloed financial ecosystem. “This fragmented liquidity leads to worse trade execution, with higher costs, increased slippage and limited leverage opportunities.” According to the team, Perennial Intents address these challenges by consolidating order flow into a unified liquidity layer. Instead of fragmenting liquidity into silos like appchains or AMM pools, intent-based trading integrates order flow across multiple venues, creating a more cohesive and efficient system. A hybrid model for the future of DeFi Although intents are not new to DeFi, Perennial Intents introduce a layered model that combines intent-based off-chain order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. Perennial claims this model streamlines trading by pairing intent-based order matching with on-chain AMM settlement. The team claims this hybrid approach guarantees optimal price execution for traders while enabling solvers to dynamically manage liquidity without long-term collateral constraints – unlocking deeper markets and greater efficiency. One-click trading and the Perennial Petals program Alongside Perennial Intents, the launch includes two additional upgrades – one-click trading and the Perennial Petals points program. Traders can now enjoy seamless trading with a single collateral account, while the Petals program rewards users with points for their trading activity, with two times points available during the initial launch period. The team at Arbitrum shared their excitement for the launch, highlighting the transformative potential of intent-based derivatives. Peter Haymond, senior partnerships manager at Offchain Labs, said, “Perennial’s work with intent-based derivatives is transforming DeFi by aligning market interactions with users’ specific goals. “This approach lets users define their desired financial outcomes, enabling more efficient and personalized trading on Arbitrum.” About Perennial Perennial is a DeFi-native derivatives primitive designed to serve as the liquidity backbone for DeFi. Backed by leading investors, including Polychain, Variant and Archetype, Perennial has facilitated over $2.8 billion in trading volume. Its growing ecosystem includes integrations with prominent trading interfaces like Kwenta , Siren , Rage Trade and Cryptex Finance .

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 20:11:00

To read full editions, subscribe . A fund issuer has adjusted several of its crypto ETFs to accommodate those seeking a different type of exposure to the space. They’re crypto futures funds that had lost some luster when spot products became available — but now feature a twist. Bitwise officially converted three of its futures-based ETFs to “Trendwise” products that rotate between crypto and US Treasurys based on crypto market price trends. Essentially the funds will stick to investing in crypto futures when the 10-day exponential moving average of the price of BTC or ETH is above the 20-day EMA (when prices are gaining momentum), the company said Tuesday. They would rotate into Treasurys when the opposite is occurring. In other words, the strategies consider price momentum in an effort to boost risk-adjusted returns while reducing downside risk. Bitwise launched its BTC futures ETF in March 2023. It brought to market an ETH futures offering (and one holding both BTC and ETH futures contracts) in October 2023. A year later from the latter launches (just weeks ago), the firm then revealed these planned adjustments. The fund strategy changes are a few of the latest examples of crypto ETF innovation. As we’ve written about previously, a number of issuers have filed for so-called buffer or covered call strategies, for example, after the listing of bitcoin ETF options . Others seek to bring new crypto assets ( solana , XRP , etc .) into the ETF wrapper. WisdomTree published plans for a planned XRP fund on Monday — following Bitwise , 21Shares and Canary Capital. Though US spot bitcoin ETFs have been the category’s chief asset gatherers — with $31 billion of net inflows since their January launches — the crypto space appears poised to evolve and grow as more investors come in (and potentially under the oversight of more crypto-friendly regulators). With that, there should be plenty of demand for more nuanced products, and those with a focus beyond the largest crypto asset.

33767162,[object Object],1733259630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Price On The Brink Of Another Breakout: The ‘Game-Changing Implications’ Of Ripple’s RLUSD Mints,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-on-brink-breakout/,"XRP has been on a significant upsurge in the past few weeks. Notably, the XRP price recently surged to $2.81, its highest market value since January 2018, marking a significant milestone in its price trajectory. Interestingly, the XRP price rally has seen it overperforming most cryptocurrencies and overtaking BNB, Solana, and Tether USDT in market cap ranking. As the XRP price momentum grows, another stimulant might be on the rise that would send it on a greater surge. Particularly, fresh speculation around Ripple’s use of its escrow reserves for RLUSD mints is drawing attention across the cryptosphere. The RLUSD Minting Strategy And Ripple’s Escrow Rumors are that Ripple, the payment technology company behind XRP, may be planning to use its escrowed XRP as the initial reserve for RLUSD minting. As the largest holder of XRP, Ripple currently has approximately 37.24 billion tokens in escrow, with a set portion of 1 billion XRP tokens unlocked every month. Related Reading: Thinking Of Selling Your Dogecoin Already? Crypto Analyst Puts Price Top In The Double-Digits Meanwhile, RLUSD is Ripple’s new dollar-backed stablecoin that is expected to launch soon, with regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) anticipated on December 4. According to a crypto analyst on social media platform X, this dollar-backed stablecoin could provide Ripple with a mechanism to sell RLUSD to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, offering a significant boost in working capital. This approach could deliver two transformative outcomes for Ripple and the broader XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem: a substantial liquidity injection and a controlled reduction in XRP’s total supply. Furthermore, it would provide utility for the locked XRP tokens in Ripple’s possession. Game-Changing Implications For The XRP Price And XRPL With RLUSD, Ripple would be entering a stablecoin market dominated by heavyweights like USDT and USDC. However, given its longstanding history with the crypto industry, Ripple might be in a good position to compete with other stablecoins. If RLUSD becomes widely adopted, there will be an indirect demand for XRP, which will increase its utility. More demand for XRP in this context could positively affect its price. Additionally, the process of minting RLUSD might involve effectively locking up XRP tokens if used as escrows, resulting in a reduced circulating supply and further supporting price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.74 and is currently up by about 12% and 90% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. The rally follows intense whale accumulation, with wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP collectively amassing over 679.1 million tokens in three weeks, according to data from on-chain analytics company Santiment. Interestingly, this accumulation is currently valued at an approximate $1.66 billion. Such an accumulation trend could continue to push the XRP price on a positive path, with the next target being a break above $3 and a subsequent break into a new all-time high above $3.40.",Altcoin News|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-03 21:00:30

On-chain analyst Ki Young Ju tells his 379,400 followers on the social media platform X that the primary drivers of the current Bitcoin rally are entities not interested in loading up on altcoins. According to the CryptoQuant executive, altcoins now have to come up with a compelling use case as they can no longer rely on Bitcoin’s momentum to see higher prices. “Compared to the last cycle, the nature of capital flowing into Bitcoin has shifted. The current Bitcoin rally is primarily driven by demand from institutional investors and spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Unlike crypto exchange users, institutional investors and ETF buyers have no intention of rotating their assets from Bitcoin to altcoins. Moreover, as they operate outside of crypto exchanges, asset rotation becomes inherently less feasible… Altcoins should focus on developing independent strategies to attract new capital rather than relying on Bitcoin’s momentum.” Ki Young Ju also notes that the recent explosion in the volume of some altcoins is due to a rise in the liquidity of dollar-pegged crypto assets. “Altseason is no longer defined by asset rotation from Bitcoin. The surge in altcoin trading volume isn’t driven by BTC pairs but by stablecoin and fiat pairs, reflecting real market growth rather than asset rotation. Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” The analyst goes on to say that while he’s bullish on altcoins, he thinks that the rising tide will not lift all boats. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m bullish on altcoins. Just pointing out that only a select few attract fresh capital. Altcoin season will come, but it’ll be for a few, not every altcoin will hit its previous all-time high.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ripple (XRP) has smashed through resistance levels, reaching highs not seen in years, while Algorand’s bullish breakout signals a major comeback for the blockchain giant. These market movements aren’t just numbers on a screen; they’re a testament to the growing power and utility of digital assets. Qubetics ($TICS) brings a fresh perspective to the space, aiming to solve real-world challenges where traditional blockchains have fallen short. With tools like the QubeQode IDE, it’s setting a new standard in accessibility and innovation. Together, these three cryptos stand out as some of the best cryptos to buy right now. Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Blockchain Innovation Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain initiative; it’s a revolutionary ecosystem designed to streamline blockchain innovation for businesses and developers. Central to this groundbreaking approach is its Decentralized VPN , a secure platform that safeguards online activities while offering tokenized rewards for shared bandwidth. Imagine a freelance journalist confidently working across borders, knowing their data is secure from hacks and breaches. This feature ensures unparalleled privacy for professionals, businesses, and individuals. The presale stats are equally jaw-dropping. Now in its 11th stage, Qubetics has raised over $4.2 million, selling more than 261 million tokens to over 6000 holders. The current token price is $0.0282, but it’s set to increase by 10% this weekend. Analysts are bullish. Predictions suggest $TICS will reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering an 783% ROI. Post-presale projections include $1 and $5, translating to ROIs of 3,787% and 19,337%, respectively. Imagine investing $85,000 today. For more details, watch this video . At $1, that grows to $754,250. At $5, you’re looking at a mind-blowing $4.25 million. With a target of $15 after the mainnet launch, the sky’s the limit for Qubetics. Ripple (XRP): Breaking Long-standing Resistance Levels Ripple has recently shattered significant resistance levels, marking its resurgence as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Analysts are raving about the “Nike swoosh” pattern identified in XRP’s price movements, which signals a strong upward trajectory. For a coin that has long been priced under $1, breaking through $1.60 could unlock incredible potential for this asset. Market analyst EGRAG projects that if Ripple maintains its momentum, price targets of $1.60 and beyond are achievable. On a non-logarithmic scale, XRP could even soar to $6.40, delivering massive returns for investors entering at the current price. For those eyeing the next big move, Ripple remains a solid contender among the top crypto by market cap. Ripple’s consistent performance and groundbreaking analysis make it a strong contender. For those eyeing big gains, its rally is one to watch. Algorand (ALGO): Bullish Momentum Builds Algorand is making waves in the crypto market with its bullish breakout, fuelled by a double-bottom pattern that has caught the attention of top analysts. Recently surging to $0.359, ALGO is now primed for significant gains, with price targets of $0.750 and even $1.26 in the short term. ALGO’s recent technical indicators, such as its RSI and MACD, strongly support the bullish outlook. With no major resistance in sight, this asset is positioned to double in value, making it one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Its trajectory since recovering from an all-time high of $2.99 has been a testament to its resilience and growth potential. At its current price of $0.359, Algorand offers a significant opportunity for investors. As its bullish momentum grows, its role in the crypto ecosystem becomes ever more crucial. The Final Word: Don’t Miss Out The crypto market is full of opportunities, but these three projects stand out. Qubetics’ presale is your chance to invest in a groundbreaking ecosystem that’s simplifying blockchain development.

37183792,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622232,1733260541,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37183792.jpeg,Aave (AAVE) whale activity reaches two-year peak as lending expands,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/aave-whale-activity-reaches-two-year-peak/,"Aave (AAVE) has solidified its position in the top 40 of crypto assets. The Ethereum (ETH) expansion led to a recovery in lending. Aave is once again attracting whales at levels not seen since 2022. Aave activity is increasing with this year’s bull market. As with other assets and protocols, Aave benefitted from the inflow of stablecoins and the rise of ETH market prices. The latest upward leg for the crypto market also helped Aave recover its value locked to levels not seen since the 2021 bull rally. Aave now locks in more than $20B in liquidity, turning into the largest lending protocol after months of rebuilding. Aave is also considered one of the most undervalued protocols, with a market cap of $3.53B, just a fraction of the value carried in its lending vaults. Over the course of 2024, Aave successfully replaced the unwinding of Maker and turned into one of the key sources of yield. Even Donald Trump’s protocol, World Liberty Financial , planned to build an instance of Aave for its own share of liquidity. Aave had a slow return during this phase of the bull market, as the protocol was cautious about contagion and vetted its collateral assets. The real expansion of Aave started in October, with more sustainably high borrow volumes and growth of collaterals. USDC was the most borrowed asset, for its multiple applications in yield or trading. AAVE broke into the top 40 tokens AAVE broke into the top 40 after a 40% growth in the past week. The asset tracked closely the trend among altcoins, which have gone through accumulation for months. AAVE traded at $235.60, close to its 2022 range from before the bear market. Aave (AAVE) traded at a one-year peak above $237. | Source: Coinmarketcap The token traded near its yearly peak, with the highest volumes in the year to date. Open interest for AAVE expanded to a three-year peak above $171M , with a 70% prevalence of long positions. The open interest is much smaller compared even to meme tokens. AAVE is making a return after 900 days of accumulation and is yet to attract short-term traders. Trading for AAVE is split among exchanges, thus forgoing concentrated pumps on Binance. This led to a more gradual growth for the token until now, when the official altcoin market was announced. From 2025 onward, Aave will start unlocking its ecosystem reserve. Currently, AAVE tokens are more than 81% unlocked and have overcome the years of selling. The 2025 unlocks will be gradual, and will go toward ecosystem incentives. From this range, AAVE is expected to test the $400 level, then move above its peak levels over $629. In an extended bull cycle, AAVE is expected to rival the former valuations of MKR with four-digit prices in the most bullish scenario. Aave grows stablecoin liquidity One of the key features of Aave is its partnership with other DeFi protocols. Aave is gradually incorporating other assets, one of which is Ethena’s USDe. The synthetic stablecoin is considered riskier but has been released into Aave vaults. In two months, Aave moved up from an experimental 2M USDe to 620M. USDe can be used as collateral, releasing a total of $578M liquidity in other assets, with a margin for over-collateralization. AAVE diminished the supply of GHO, its native stablecoin, back under the cutoff range of 175M. The current supply of GHO is back at 169M tokens, for now delaying a buyback and burn of AAVE tokens. The liquidity profile of Aave is also shifting. The share of Arbitrum lending has increased to 20% of all volumes, with more influence from Avalanche and Optimism. Ethereum and Base remain the biggest platforms for Aave. In terms of whale transactions, Aave is also returning to levels not seen since 2022. AAVE saw a total of 587 whale transactions based on Santiment data. Those monthly levels are the highest since March 2022, before Aave cut its liquidity in response to the shrinking crypto market.

He has reportedly agreed to a maximum sentencing guideline of 360 months, or 30 years, in prison. Last July, Mashinsky was arrested in New York and charged with seven criminal counts tied to the operation of and the 2022 collapse of his company, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to manipulate the price of Celsius’ native token, CEL. “I said that Celsius had approval from regulators. It was false. I falsely said I was not selling my CEL tokens, I accept full responsibility for my actions,” Inner City Press quoted Mashinsky as saying in court. “I did not know which law it was violating, but I knew it was wrong … and illegal.” Mashinsky originally pleaded not guilty and attempted to have two of the charges — the commodities manipulation charge and a market manipulation charge — dismissed. However, the judge overseeing Mashinsky’s case, U.S. District Court Judge John G. Koeltl of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) ruled that his attorney’s arguments against the charges were “without merit” meaning that, if he went to trial, Mashinsky would have to face the full seven-count indictment. He pled guilty to commodities and securities fraud on Tuesday. Celsius halted withdrawals in June 2022, a month after the collapse of Do Kwon’s Terra/LUNA, citing “extreme market conditions.” The following month, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York, one of the first in a slew of bankruptcies of similarly-situated crypto platforms including Voyager Digital, BlockFi, Genesis and FTX. Read More: The Fall of Celsius Network: A Timeline of The Crypto Lender’s Descent into Insolvency Though the collapse of Terra/LUNA and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital put a squeeze on many crypto companies in the latter half of 2022, Celsius had itself — and its management — to blame for its financial woes. For years before Celsius' collapse, Mashinsky was telling customers on his regular livestreams not to “listen to the FUD-ers” about the company’s lending practices, assuring them that “Celsius does not do non-collateralized loans…Celsius will not do that because that would be taking too much risk on your behalf.” However, the company was, in fact, making uncollateralized loans. When it filed for bankruptcy, lawyers for the crypto lending platform admitted Celsius had a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.

However, as December rolls in, they’ve been re-investing profits into more promising projects. Most traders’ and investors’ #1 pick is RCO Finance (RCOF) , a new SolidProof financial platform. Many are investing heavily in RCO Finance because of its sheer utility and value, along with the 33,000% ROI that experts see RCOF bringing by 2025! Cardano Is Finally Moving and ADA Reaches Above $1: What’s Next? After months of sideways trading, Cardano’s ADA is finally moving. ADA is currently at $1.11, a level reached with the help of the recent post-US elections rally. In just 30 days, Cardano investors made an ROI of over 200% , and ADA seems to be holding levels above $1 well. However, Cardano investors are now taking profits, which is normal after rallies like the one ADA had. With that data in mind, experts say that ADA will pull back a bit in December. The pullback will be due to profit-taking and rebalancing, which is always needed in times like these. So, a future pullback for Cardano is more than normal. After the pullback, many saw the rise of ADA again. If the market heats up again in 2025, as in November, Cardano can rise by another 100% from the upcoming ADA dip. Solana Is Also Balancing: Where Will SOL Go Next? Solana’s SOL also did well in November. Namely, SOL surged by over 60% , but now, SOL is pulling back. Like Cardano, Solana investors have been taking profits, which is normal after a rally. Also, SOL needs to balance out its gains to sustain steady long-term growth. SOL is currently at $223, down by over 11% after reaching above $260 during the rally. Experts say that Solana could go to as low as $200 per one Solana token during the dip. After that, SOL will rise again, fueled by the 2025 bull market and increased memecoin trading on the Solana blockchain. >>> BUY RCOF NOW RCO Finance Is Catching Massive Bids From Cardano and Solana Traders As Cardano and Solana traders profit, most re-invest it in RCO Finance . RCO Finance is a new financial platform that brings massive utility and potential to the market. As a financial platform, RCO Finance gives you wide access to assets for trading/investing. Namely, you can trade/invest in over 120,000 assets with up to 1,000x leverage, making massive profits with even the smallest trades. However, this widespread access to financial assets isn’t what makes RCO Finance so great. Namely, it’s the fact that RCO Finance gives you access to sophisticated investment strategies. To do that, RCO Finance has created the AI Robo Advisor. The AI Robo Advisor is a revolutionizing tool that uses advanced AI and ML to create sophisticated investment strategies. First, it asks you about your risk tolerance, financial goals, and market preferences, and then it combines it with technical analysis and market data. With that, the AI Robo Advisor creates tailored and data-driven investment strategies that help you identify and take winning trades from losing ones. Also, the trades will be automated, and you’ll have access to research done on massive data in seconds. So you won’t have to waste hours determining where the market is going. Furthermore, the AI Robo Advisor will adjust your trades by digesting real-time financial information from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. It will inject the info immediately into your trades, allowing you to always trade in the direction the market is going. Also, you’ll be able to get into all the winning trades early, which isn’t possible for people as they can’t physically do the same amount of research as the AI Robo Advisor in a short time (seconds). So, you won’t have to spend hours figuring out where the market is going and losing out on momentum! Invest in RCOF Now for 33,000% Returns by 2025! You still have a chance to buy RCOF during its presale. Presales are great times to invest in promising tokens like RCOF, as they allow you to catch them at their lowest. With that in mind, in Stage 4 of the presale, you can buy your RCOF at $0.0777. RCOF will launch at $0.4-$0.6 when the presale ends, and the 33,000% will begin. So, by investing in RCOF during the presale, you’ll position yourself to catch the 33,000% move up!

To read full editions, subscribe . Coinbase is making a lot of money from Solana traders these days, but the influx of demand is also causing some headaches for America’s largest crypto exchange. Coinbase is receiving more Solana send and receive requests “than ever before,” according to an employee, and so-called dusting attacks have become commonplace, causing Coinbase to take longer than usual to show SOL transactions on users’ accounts. This gets at an interesting problem Solana faces: While the blockchain processes data very quickly, the venues that need to make use of that data sometimes struggle to keep up. Coinbase’s struggle is with data indexing, which is the process of taking blockchain transaction data — which comes as a jumble of bits — and putting it in a format that things like crypto exchanges can read. When a blockchain produces as much data as Solana does, this can get demanding and pricey. To contextualize how much data Solana produces, Blockworks Research data lead Dan Smith pointed to an experiment run by Eigen Labs to show the capacity of its EigenDA data product. Eigen Labs posted every block from 19 blockchains for a period of time in September, representing roughly 20 terabytes of data, and Solana accounted for a staggering 97% of the total. Coinbase’s indexers currently “can’t keep up” with Solana demand, a protocol specialist at the exchange wrote on X. Making matters worse, dusting has become “constant” on Coinbase, the protocol specialist wrote . Dusting refers to sending tiny amounts of crypto to many wallet addresses in hopes of tracking them. I moved SOL around on Coinbase while writing this article, and my wallet received two different dust transactions. This “dust” is trivial to the sender, but it can become a big strain for Coinbase’s data load. And Solana’s indexing challenges run deeper than just volume. Solana indexing is particularly difficult compared to Ethereum because the former lacks a uniform interface for smart contracts, which are the computer programs that run on the blockchain. “[W]hen you look at your transactions across many of these [Solana] programs, the data is just a jumble of bytes which are not human readable,” Tristan Frizza, founder of Zeta Markets, said. Since there’s no established way to read the data, it becomes difficult for indexers, block explorers, or data platforms like Dune to break down what different Solana transactions are actually doing. Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz said the Solana development platform will be rolling out three new features in the next two months that he estimated could solve 80% of Solana’s “read layer issues.” But until then, exchanges will keep having to index a blockchain that is seeing record demand.

Despite this uncertainty, key data from Santiment provides a glimmer of hope for Dogecoin enthusiasts. Over the weekend, Dogecoin whales accumulated an additional 160 million DOGE, signaling potential confidence in the meme coin leader’s upward trajectory. This renewed whale activity comes when Dogecoin attempts to regain momentum and reestablish its market position. Such large-scale accumulation often precedes significant price movements, suggesting the possibility of further upside in the coming weeks. Related Reading: XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together As DOGE inches closer to the psychological $1 target, the next few weeks will be critical for the meme coin. A breakout above key resistance levels could reignite retail investors’ enthusiasm and signal the start of a new bullish phase. However, failure to sustain this momentum may lead to continued volatility, testing the patience of even its most loyal supporters. Dogecoin’s path forward remains uncertain, but with whales stepping in and market interest reignited, the stage is set for a potentially transformative period for the popular cryptocurrency. All eyes are on DOGE as it sets its sights on the elusive $1 mark. Dogecoin Sets High Expectations Dogecoin is capturing market attention as it surpasses multi-year resistance levels and embarks on what some are calling an “only up” trajectory. This impressive rally has reignited interest in the meme coin leader, solidifying its dominance in the meme coin market. Analysts and traders closely monitor Dogecoin’s price action, with many expecting further highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Santiment, revealing that Dogecoin whales accumulated an additional 160 million $DOGE over the weekend. This significant whale activity lends credibility to the bullish narrative surrounding DOGE, suggesting that key market players are positioning themselves for continued upside. Historically, such large-scale purchases often precede substantial price movements, adding to the optimism that Dogecoin could maintain its upward momentum. Despite the bullish sentiment, risks remain. Dogecoin’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory, which currently faces a crucial test at the $100,000 level. If Bitcoin fails to break above this psychological barrier in the coming days, the broader crypto market could experience a pullback, potentially dragging DOGE down. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Hit $1 – Price Struggles To Break Above Major Resistance For now, Dogecoin continues to lead the meme coin market, setting new benchmarks and captivating investors. As whales double down and market dynamics evolve, the coming weeks will determine whether Dogecoin can maintain its rally or face a temporary correction. DOGE Testing Liquidity Dogecoin is positioning itself for a potential bullish continuation as it forms a technical pattern that, once broken, could propel the price to new highs. This pattern reflects growing optimism among traders, aligning with the broader upward momentum in the crypto market. However, DOGE faces a crucial test at the $0.44 resistance level, which has acted as a strong barrier in recent sessions. A decisive break above this level could set the stage for another significant rally. Currently, DOGE is testing demand around the $0.42 mark, a critical support level that has helped sustain its recent price action. Holding this level is essential for maintaining bullish sentiment. If DOGE breaks above $0.44, it could attract renewed buying interest, driving the price into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Cardano Transactions Rise To Multi-Year Highs – Metrics Support Bullish Outlook Conversely, failure to breach the $0.44 resistance could lead to prolonged consolidation. In such a scenario, DOGE may continue to trade within a tight range as the market awaits further catalysts. If demand weakens, the meme coin could even experience a correction, retesting lower support levels.

December 2024 is no exception, with projects like BTFD Coin , Book of Meme, and Ponke taking centre stage. These coins are redefining what it means to invest in memes, offering something for everyone—from groundbreaking presales to creative community-driven platforms and hilariously chaotic mascots. BTFD Coin, the hotshot of the month, has already raised over $700,000 in just one week, proving its massive appeal among crypto enthusiasts. Meanwhile, Book of Meme is revolutionising the meme coin ecosystem by prioritising user-generated content and creativity. And then there’s Ponke, a whimsical, unpredictable project that thrives on humour and chaos, reminding us that crypto doesn’t always have to be so serious. In this article, we’ll explore why these coins are being hailed as the best crypto presales to watch this month and what sets them apart from the competition. Get ready—it’s meme coin mania time. BTFD Coin: The Presale Powerhouse Taking the Crypto World by Storm When it comes to best crypto presales, BTFD Coin is running the show. Launching its presale on November 26, 2024, at an initial price of $0.000004, BTFD has climbed to Stage 6, now priced at $0.000058. The buzz is palpable, with over 18 billion coins sold and 1,700 loyal Bulls backing the project. What makes BTFD Coin the talk of the town? For starters, its presale is no ordinary event. It’s a 16-stage spectacle that’s already 25% complete, raising over $700,000 in record time. The coin’s ecosystem is a major draw, featuring a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a staking rewards program designed to keep investors engaged and rewarded. Let’s talk numbers. If you invested $4,000 at Stage 6’s current price of $0.000058, you’d snag around 68,965,517 BTFD coins. When the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, that investment could balloon to $41,379.31. Nearly a tenfold return—how’s that for explosive potential? But it’s not just about ROI. BTFD Coin has captured the imagination of a meme-hungry generation with its bold branding and community-first ethos. Social media is ablaze with memes, FOMO posts, and high-energy debates, making BTFD Coin not just an investment but a cultural phenomenon. With 10 stages left to go, the time to jump on this rocket is now. Book of Meme: The Creative Catalyst If there’s one thing that sets Book of Meme apart, it’s creativity. This unique project has carved out its niche by offering a platform where users can create and share memes, earning rewards for their contributions. It’s not just a coin; it’s a community of creators, united by their love for internet culture. The best crypto presales often focus on innovation, and Book of Meme delivers in spades. Its presale rewards early adopters with bonuses and exclusive features, setting the stage for organic growth. The developers understand the power of community, hosting regular events and interactive sessions that encourage participation and build loyalty. But what’s the real appeal here? For many, it’s the promise of combining financial gains with creative expression. As meme culture continues to dominate online spaces, Book of Meme is well-positioned to attract investors looking for both fun and profitability.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 21:33:00

This step taken by the company is revolutionary as it makes the company the first to embrace the use of cryptocurrency in the travel industry. Travelers can now pay with Bitcoin for cruises aboard Virgin Voyages’ ships, including the upcoming “Annual Pass.” The Annual Pass allows travelers to book a cruise as many times as they wish in a year. At $120,000, excluding taxes and fees, the pass provides access to premium sea terraces. The acceptance of Bitcoin is in line with the company’s effort to target young travelers who use cryptocurrencies due to their ease and accessibility. The company’s current fleet, which consists of ships such as Scarlet Lady and Valiant Lady, targets millennials with shorter itineraries and focuses on the Caribbean and modern facilities and features onboard. Accepting Bitcoin payments makes it even more attractive to millennial and Gen Z travelers. While other travel platforms such as Travala have allowed for cryptocurrency booking for hotels and flights, Virgin Voyages is the first to introduce the same for cruises. Bitcoin’s increasing institutional interest Virgin Voyages accepting Bitcoin is timely given that the cryptocurrency is celebrating a year of major achievements. There has been heightened institutional interest in Bitcoin as big-name institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity are backing spot Bitcoin ETFs. This institutional acceptance has made Bitcoin gain credibility as a mainstream investment commodity. Also, firms such as MicroStrategy have remained aggressive in their Bitcoin buying spree. The firm purchased 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion recently. The company now owns 402,100 BTC, which is approximately 2% of all the BTC in the market. MicroStrategy’s holdings are currently worth $38.2 billion at the current price of $95,000 per token. Likewise, Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings (MARA) has also j oined the accumulation bandwagon. During the month of October to November MARA purchased 6,484 BTC for a total of $618.3 million. As of November 30, the total amount of Bitcoin held by MARA was 34,959 BTC, worth $3.3 billion. At the national level, countries are considering using Bitcoins. El Salvador is still persistently buying Bitcoin and in the United States, the discussions are steering around President-elect Trump’s idea of having Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, Poland and Suriname are working to establish Bitcoin as an essential asset for their respective countries.

The Florida-registered company is one of the biggest crypto mining facilities in the world and is looking to keep expanding aggressively despite tough mining conditions after the 2024 halving. The company filed this acquisition with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Mara’s Massive Foray into Wind Energy The company announced this move earlier today but didn’t disclose the amount involved in purchasing the large wind farm. The Hansford county-based farm reportedly boasts a massive 240 Megawatt (MW) worth of interconnectivity and 114 MW wind power generation capacity. The company will likely use this power for mining purposes or in the booming carbon credits market. The facility was previously owned by National Grid Plc and Washington State Investment Board. The move presents a nice PR opportunity for the Bitcoin community as it shows that energy-intensive crypto-mining operations are moving towards renewable energy sources. In addition to this costly facility, Mara Holdings owns around 34,959 BTC ($3.3 billion), among the largest declared ownerships of Bitcoin in the world. However, it is a mining company, so its coffers change considerably with the overall climate. Bitcoin’s Shift to Renewable Energy? While 240 MW is a substantial amount of energy when it comes to household usage, it is minuscule in terms of the overall energy usage of the Bitcoin network. Operating at full capacity, the Texan farm purchased by Mara Holdings can generate about 7 gigawatt hours of energy in a year, while the total energy approximately consumed by the BTC network is reportedly anywhere between 120,000-160,000 gigawatt hours or 120-160 TWh. However, it is still a step in the right direction, as BTC’s environmental impact is routinely blamed for the climate crisis. This is even though several studies have shown that cryptocurrency is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s Carbon emissions, and they, too, are decreasing with time. Bitcoin is trading just above the $95k support level at press time. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains on course for a massive 2024-2025 bull market, and miners are expected to hold the crypto in place until their price targets are achieved.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-03 21:42:06

His defense attorney announced this during a court hearing in a Manhattan federal court. The charges relate to allegations of fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation concerning Celsius Network’s operations and its proprietary token, Cel. This decision follows a legal battle that started earlier in 2023 when Mashinsky was initially charged with seven counts related to the collapse of Celsius Network. Celsius Founder Alex Mashinsky Faces Guilty Plea for Fraud and Market Manipulation In a recent development , Celsius Network founder Alex Mashinsky intends to plead guilty to two counts of fraud after being indicted in 2023. These charges stem from accusations that Mashinsky misled Celsius Network customers, prompting them to invest in the company’s crypto services under pretenses. Prosecutors claim that Mashinsky artificially inflated the value of the company’s proprietary token, Cel, to mislead investors and customers. Moreover, Mashinsky is also accused of personally profiting from his actions. Federal prosecutors allege that he reaped approximately $42 million in proceeds from the sale of Cel tokens, further exacerbating the damage caused to investors. Earlier this year, Celsius Network’s former chief revenue officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, pleaded guilty to similar charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors’ ongoing investigation. More so, in September 2024, Mashinsky sought the testimony of six former employees to support his defense in his ongoing fraud trial. Mashinsky blamed his team for misleading investors and misrepresenting the company’s financial condition. This is a Breaking update, check back for more.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, supports President-elect Donald Trump and believes his administration will push advancements in AI, keeping the U.S. ahead of rivals like China. Other tech leaders also share similar views by highlighting the importance of America leading in technology. Sam Altman supports Trump’s role in AI leadership In a recent Fox News Sunday interview, Altman stressed the need for strong AI infrastructure, like powerful computers, advanced chips, and large data centers, to stay at the forefront of this technology. “We need to build that here and have the best AI infrastructure in the world,” Altman said. “I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that.” The OpenAI CEO described this moment as critical, with AI ready to transform industries and societies. He emphasized the need for America and its allies to lead this, ensuring AI is developed with democratic values. “This is an unusually important moment in the history of technology,” Altman said, adding that “The U.S. must lead this effort.” Altman’s idea of advancement is after Trump’s victory, and he raised a talk about partnerships between the new administration and Silicon Valley. Recently, tech leaders like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have also shown interest in working with Trump. Zuckerberg recently visited Trump’s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to discuss opportunities, while Musk has been vocal about U.S. technological leadership. Both have expressed openness to collaborating with the administration. Thus, Altman and Musk have a complicated history. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, left the organization and later criticized Altman’s leadership. Now, Musk is in charge of Trump’s Chief Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Altman is also hopeful about Trump’s approach to AI, but he also sees the challenges of dealing with regulations. Vice President-elect JD Vance has raised concerns that big companies like OpenAI and Meta might use regulations to strengthen their position and block smaller competitors. Altman disagrees with this, saying it’s important to encourage innovation from smaller companies. He pointed out that the U.S. has a unique ability to lead in innovation and that regulations should not stop smaller companies from growing, as they are often the ones driving important breakthroughs. Building strong AI infrastructure for the future The OpenAi co-founder is excited about AI’s potential to change industries, like improving medical diagnoses and offering personalized tutoring, but he also sees some downsides. He warned that AI could replace some jobs, although it might make other jobs more efficient. “Some jobs will improve, but others will disappear,” he said. He also expressed concerns about bad actors using AI for harmful purposes, like hacking or creating security threats, stressing the importance of developing AI ethically and securely. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and Switzerland are making progress in crypto and AI regulations, which helps legitimize these industries. Altman sees this regulatory progress as key to long-term growth and innovation. Even with the political and industry challenges, Altman is focused on ensuring that AI development follows democratic values and benefits society. His partnership with Trump’s administration is based on their shared goal of building the infrastructure and policies needed to keep America ahead in AI . Altm an said, “The United States and our allies need to lead this.” With Trump at the helm, Altman is betting on a vision of AI that strengthens America’s position as a global leader in technology.

Bitcoin Investors Holds Coin Long-term On the brighter side, this situation suggests increasing investor confidence in holding the cryptocurrency long-term. CryptoQuant claimed that more than 171,000 BTC have left major cryptocurrency exchanges since November 5, when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The trend indicates that investors are moving their holdings to cold storage. This could be part of a long-term strategy. The fall of exchange reserves began in 2021 and has since registered a gradual plunge. As of three years ago, Bitcoin reserves were at about 3.2 million but have now fallen to a multi-year low of 2.46 million coins. BTC Price Sees Slight Dip According to Glassnode data, its illiquid supply metric, BTC held by long-term investors not actively trading, has increased by 185,000 Bitcoin within the last 30 days. Based on this spike, it has reached an All-time-high (ATH) of 14.8 million coins. This covers 75% of the current circulating supply of around 19.79 million coins. Amid a supply crunch, the expected outcome is a price rally, but BTC price has plunged by about 2% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin is down by 1.12% and currently trading at $95,223.11. What Happens Next for Bitcoin? The sudden fluctuations have triggered some anti-BTC individuals to air their views about the future of the digital currency. A few days ago, renowned commodity trader Peter Brandt boldly stated that Bitcoin’s future growth trajectory might not make young investors rich . He based his statement on the fact that as Bitcoin matures, its growth potential may slow down. In under 24 hours, 219,647 traders have been liquidated, total liquidations at $628.32 million, per Coinglass data. Only Bitcoin accounts for $92.44 million of this liquidation, although the most significant outflow was from long positions overshooting their bet on the potential price of the coin.

With this purchase, the company now owns over 400,000 Bitcoins, purchased at an average price of $58,000 per Bitcoin. Saylor explained that MicroStrategy’s approach involves leveraging traditional financial instruments like equity issuance and convertible debt to fund Bitcoin purchases. “We are a Bitcoin treasury company,” Saylor said. “Our mission is to securitize Bitcoin and bridge the gap between traditional capital markets and the crypto economy.” “Bitcoin is the only commodity in human history that has been invented that is strictly capped,” Saylor said. “The fact that it outperforms the S&P 500 and is more volatile makes it an attractive asset for investors looking for high performance.” Related News: Here's the Top 10 AI Altcoins Developers Have Focused on in the Last Month Saylor also argued that Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a flaw, allowing traders and investors to take advantage of market fluctuations. Saylor likened volatility to fire, saying, “Henry Ford put fire in an engine and created an industry. Bitcoin’s volatility gives humanity wings in the financial markets.” He predicted that price volatility would continue, suggesting that Bitcoin could “peak and rise to $180,000” before experiencing significant corrections and falling to $140,000. *This is not investment advice.
