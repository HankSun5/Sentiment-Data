Proof of Shiba Inu's increasing power as its Shibarium recently blasted a new ATH in Total Value Locked (TVL). Pepe is also giving off breakthrough signals you would not want to miss. But here’s the twist: utility coins like Lunex Network are quietly gaining momentum. Lunex, a decentralized, non-custodial exchange, lets you trade directly while keeping full control of your assets. Plus, with exciting crypto presales heating up, now’s the perfect time to explore your next big move! Lunex shines in crypto presale with advanced utility and massive investor interest Have you noticed utility coins like Lunex taking the spotlight lately? It’s no surprise that Lunex is packed with features that make it stand out in the crypto world. Right now, the Lunex crypto presale is in full swing with tokens priced at just $0.0033. Over 1.78 billion tokens have already been sold, raising an impressive $3.7 million. It’s clear that investors are flocking to Lunex for good reasons. First, it’s all about the perks. Lunex offers advanced performance analytics, giving you real-time insights and predictive market tools to stay ahead of the curve. Plus, $LNEX token holders enjoy revenue redistribution through buybacks and staking rewards—a win-win for building your portfolio. This kind of utility is what’s drawing attention to Lunex during its crypto presale. But wait, there’s more! Lunex supports trading across 50,000 currency pairs on over 40 blockchains. That’s the flexibility you can’t ignore. If you’re looking for a strong utility coin to back, Lunex’s crypto presale might be your golden ticket! Shibarium strikes ATH: Shiba Inu's layer-2 increases independent of market upheaval Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 protocol has reached an interesting benchmark, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) achieving an ATH of $8.57 million. Despite SHIB’s current dip in TVL to $4.58 million, data shows Shiba-related activities dominate with $3.06 million, followed by WoofSwap and ChewySwap contributing $875,270 and $497,016, respectively. Shibarium's wallet activity is also on the rise, nearing 1.9 million addresses. This growth indicates strong engagement, with new wallets likely contributing to staking during the recent SHIB ATH. Even so, the community's unwavering participation continues to underscore Shibarium’s potential for long-term growth and innovation. Pepe’s bull flag signals a breakout on the horizon PEPE is showing exciting potential, with a bull flag pattern forming on its 4-hour chart, a classic signal of a possible breakout. This setup indicates that the meme coin could surpass $0.000025 and potentially reach as high as $0.000041. If this happens, all current holders could return to profitability, highlighting PEPE’s strong recovery prospects. Adding to the optimism is the Global In/Out of Money (GIOM) indicator, which reveals weak resistance at $0.000023 and solid support from PEPE holders. This means PEPE has room to grow, supported by a robust base of committed investors. However, as with any investment, it’s crucial to keep an eye on market conditions and make informed decisions. Why settle for less when Lunex could be your next big win? While Shiba and PEPE are making waves, Lunex stands out as the smarter choice. With itscrypto presale in full swing, Lunex offers advanced trading features, real-time analytics, and rewarding staking opportunities. Don't miss the chance to get in early—Lunex could be your best move toward achieving ATH gains!

While experts believe it will boost privacy-focused projects, many are unsure of its benefits to new cryptos like Lunex and established tokens like UNI and XLM. Regardless of its impact on DeFi, Lunex’s focus on security and enhanced privacy features already account for some of its massive attraction to investors and the explosion in its presale phase. Read more about why Lunex trump's XLM and UNI’s performance. Lunex Network attracts investors with privacy guarantee, sells 2 billion tokens With the rise of DeFi, users face growing security and privacy risks to their funds and data. Lunex Network (LNEX) addresses these challenges by offering innovative solutions, including a non-custodial wallet with access to over 50,000 assets across multiple blockchains. Users retain full control over their private keys, reducing risks of hacks or fund loss. Lunex further employs advanced encryption methods and regular smart contract audits, including by Solidproof, to add further protection layers, safeguard sensitive data, and prevent breaches. Lunex also prioritizes user privacy by minimizing data collection and eliminating reliance on centralized servers, reducing the risk of hacks or leaks. Its no-KYC policy allows users to trade, store, and manage assets anonymously. Making waves in its presale, this new crypto is closing in on 2 billion $LNEX tokens sold and almost $3.7 million in collected funds. It is currently available at an extremely low price of $0.0033, making now an excellent time to acquire LNEX tokens. Stellar (XLM) partners with Blockaid to upgrade security amid hacks Blockaid, a Web3 security platform, has partnered with XLM to enhance the protection of decentralized applications (dApps) by integrating its advanced Onchain Detection and Response (ODR) technology. The integration begins with XLM’s Freighter and Lobstr wallets, which will now benefit from Blockaid’s real-time threat monitoring and swift response capabilities. These security features aim to fortify the Stellar (XLM) blockchain against potential vulnerabilities. Ido Ben Natan, CEO of Blockaid, announced that the company’s latest round of security enhancements is designed to alert users about potentially risky transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), or tokens. Using Blockaid, XLM adds to its most recent security upgrade, which it partnered with Hypernative Labs. This partnership enabled Stellar to integrate advanced security features to prevent phishing attacks, fraud, and market manipulation. These improvements will likely drive greater adoption of the Stellar network, benefiting its native token, XLM. With increasing engagement from users and projects, XLM could see a surge in demand, potentially influencing its market price. Uniswap (UNI) upgrades security with a $15.5 million bounty Uniswap Labs (UNI) has offered $15.5 million to identify vulnerabilities in the core smart contracts of its v4 decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. This initiative bolsters UNI’ssecurity and protects users' funds from potential risks. UNI’s announcement coincided with a significant price surge for its native token. Over the past week, UNI saw a 15% increase, with experts crediting the price rally to renewed optimism in the DeFi, coupled with Uniswap's proactive security measures. Despite UNI’s projection for a 30% increase and XLM’s for a massive surge, Lunex’ssecurity measures and additional features ensure it’s gaining faster. Investors have locked on to the enormous potential of the project, and they’re now positioning themselves to take advantage of the huge gains fast-approaching on the horizon.

A picture of the first bull to be traded on Solana AgriDex , a Solana-based real-world assets (RWA) marketplace and winner of the Stand With Crypto UK’s ‘Best Use Case’ Awards , made history this week by facilitating the world’s first trade of a live bull on the blockchain from Aurox Meats . The transaction was seamlessly executed through the AgriDex platform and recorded on the Solana blockchain. The bull comes from Gatcombe Park, the Princess Royal's herd. The White Park bull, Dinefwr Wyn, carries a lineage steeped in royal heritage, traced back to some of the most renowned bloodlines in the breed's history. “This historic transaction isn’t just bullish for Solana, it’s bullish for the entire global livestock market. AgriDex demonstrates how blockchain can bring greater accountability to the livestock trade, empowering farmers and suppliers while ensuring animal welfare standards are maintained,” said Henry Duckworth , Co-Founder and CEO of AgriDex. The Future of Solana Depends on Utility Memecoins may be fun, but Solana needs substance. While the blockchain’s speed, low fees, and scalability have fueled an explosion of memecoins, capturing retail traders and driving community engagement, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on more than fleeting hype. Real-World Assets (RWA) present a transformative alternative and offer sustainable growth and real-world value. In early 2024, RWA emerged as the second most profitable crypto narrative , delivering an impressive 285.6% return. For a brief moment in February, it even surpassed memecoins. RWA has been gaining further popularity and is emerging as one of the main narratives of the upcoming bull run. AgriDex leverages the power of Solana’s blockchain to revolutionise livestock trading with transparency, efficiency, and fairness. By ensuring every transaction is fully trackable, the platform reduces fraud and price manipulation across global supply chains. Its near-instant settlements come with significantly lower fees—just 0.15% per trade side—compared to traditional methods that often charge several percentage points and take 4-6 days to settle transactions. The successful facilitation of the trade on the blockchain showcases AgriDex’s commitment to innovation and highlights its role as a platform driving the adoption of blockchain for agricultural and livestock trades globally. As illustrated in the graph below, the project is expected to generate 133 million in profit by the end of 2028. Source: AgriDex Revolutionalise the agricultural industry with blockchain Set to launch on December 4th , Agridex is revolutionising the $2.3 trillion global agricultural trade industry by tokenising the supply chain. AgriDex offers farmers instant settlements, drastically reduced transaction costs, and fraud-proof traceability using blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enshrine legal contracts. The AgriDex Token ($AGRI) is launching at a valuation of $65 million and anticipates generating $53.28 million in trading fees by the end of 2026, supported by an expected net buy pressure of $39.2 million within two years. Blockchain technology is undeniably redefining the tech paradigm, but many have jumped on the trend solely for profit, often not solving a real-world problem. AgriDex, however, stands apart by delivering genuine utility, leveraging blockchain to drive meaningful impact and innovation in the agricultural sector. For instance, food fraud cost the UK £1.96 billion in 2021 and globally accounts for $30-40 Billion dollars in lost revenue. Food fraud is notoriously hard to detect with only 20% of suspected cases being reported. In the UK, of the 610 that were reported in 2021 there were only 16 successful prosecutions, or under 4%. Poor traceability and certificate verification The fraud highlighted above is enabled by the opacity of crossing multiple jurisdictions using wet contracts and poor visibility of origin for consumers. Dozens of different standards and certifications make it challenging to assure quality, origin and sustainability credentials. Source: AgriDex AgriDex solves the problem by providing an inclusive marketplace for all participants in the supply chain. It is driven by the immutable ledger of blockchain - that delivers trust, transparency, and accountability. The RWA platform built on Solana lowers the cost of food traded through it, increases choice, and delivers transparency, reducing fraud and verifying quality and origin and sustainability credentials. It is focused on solving critical issues with trading agricultural products and services including inefficiency, fraud, access to finance and insurance. AgriDex will create a fair and transparent financial system. The graph below illustrates the significant cost and time savings that AgriDex offers • Cost Savings: While traditional systems incur a cost of $1,125 per tonne of cocoa, AgriDex slashes this to just $660, highlighting a stark reduction in trade expenses.• Time Efficiency: Traditionally, such a transaction takes 65 days to complete, but with AgriDex, it's cut down to 40 days. This accelerated timeline demonstrates AgriDex’sefficiency. Source: AgriDex AgriDex is redefining the global agricultural trade industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and fraud-resistant marketplace. By reducing costs, cutting transaction times, and providing traceable records of quality, origin, and sustainability, the RWA platform on Solana addresses critical inefficiencies in the $2.3 trillion agricultural sector. As the first platform to successfully trade a live bull on Solana, AgriDex showcases the transformative potential of RWAs and sets a new standard for using blockchain to solve real-world problems, driving meaningful innovation and sustainable growth in agriculture.

This decision follows months of recovery efforts that ultimately failed to restore the platform’s viability. DMM Bitcoin to Transfer All Assets to SBI VC Trade According to a report from Nikkei Asia, the exchange also plans to sell all its assets to SBI VC Trade, a trading company owned by the SBI Group. SBI VC Trade confirmed in a December 2 statement that an agreement had been reached to acquire all assets of DMM Bitcoin as part of its liquidation process. The transfer, expected to conclude by the end of Q1 2025, will include customer accounts and assets held by the exchange. Details on the specific transfer methods and dates will be disclosed in future announcements. As part of the transition, the company plans to expand its services by offering 14 crypto spot trading options currently available on DMM Bitcoin’s platform. The two firms will continue discussing the asset and account transfer process. DMM Bitcoin was hacked on May 31, 2024, resulting in the theft of 4,502.9 BTC, worth approximately $305 million at the time. The exchange confirmed the breach , announcing that it had taken steps to prevent further unauthorized withdrawals by suspending all spot purchase transactions. Further, it assured customers it would reimburse lost funds by acquiring an equivalent amount of Bitcoin with backing from its associated companies. To that end, DMM Bitcoin secured a 5 billion yen loan in June and outlined plans to raise an additional 50 billion yen to meet its obligations. Failed Recovery Efforts Despite the recovery efforts, ongoing service restrictions and increased challenges forced the exchange to abandon its plans and ultimately decide to shut down its operations. In July, the attackers, believed to be the infamous Lazarus Group, were tracked laundering more than $35 million in stolen funds through Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace that has reportedly become a hub for illicit activities. PeckShieldAlert also reported that an additional 500 BTC had been transferred across multiple wallets in August. However, all attempts to recover the stolen funds have been unsuccessful. The DMM Bitcoin hack ranks as Japan’s second-largest digital asset breach, following the $534 million Coincheck attack in 2018. Coincheck’s incident was mainly attributed to the exchange’s inadequate security practices. Most of the stolen tokens were stored in a single online hot wallet secured by just one private key rather than in offline cold storage or secure multi-signature wallets, as recommended by their issuer.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 22:42:00

The meme-based cryptocurrency has seen bullish momentum lately, grabbing the attention of investors and analysts alike. But is this rally sustainable, and could SHIB really soar to the heights some experts are predicting? Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks so. He just recently published insights suggesting SHIB may be targeting $0.000081, a massive 179% jump from where it is today. The market has been very unpredictable, but Marks said that this breakout is a sign of strength. Is this enough to keep SHIB in the spotlight? Bullish Signals Shine Bright Recent success by Shiba Inu in closing above important resistance levels has revived expectations for more gains. Technical successes along these lines are suggestive of good buy order accumulation. When SHIB continues on this trend, then reaching the $0.000081 target is not very far-fetched. $SHIB (Shiba Inu), after recently confirming another bull pattern, looks to be further joining the bull show as prices are now showing signs of MAJOR STRENGTH! With holding breakouts implying that $0.000081 target to still be in play, these prices can be subject to another… https://t.co/CKpxZb7CMh pic.twitter.com/lu2QT5FzEg — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.00003061, which is an increase of 13% in the last 24 hours. That is no small achievement in a volatile market. According to analysts, for SHIB to keep on moving upward, maintaining support levels will be of prime importance. It is not about breaking resistance; it is also about staying above it. Recent Setbacks And Market Volatility However, not all has been smooth sailing. SHIB saw a slight pullback recently, dropping to $0.000029 after losing 6% in a single day. This decline mirrors a broader market slump, with the total crypto market cap shrinking by 6%. Even against Bitcoin, SHIB stumbled, recording a 4% loss. With these fluctuations, one can see the risks that crypto trading poses. Investors should wait for clear breakout confirmations and keep an eye on broader market trends. Short-term price movements are always misleading, so patience is key. The Road Ahead For Shiba Inu Beyond price movements, there are strategic moves made on the part of Shiba Inu to evolve its ecosystem. Developers are working on advanced integration of blockchain technologies to boost utility. Smarter contract platforms can transition it from a mere meme coin to a valuable tool for decentralized applications (dApps). The whole shift might attract long-term investors to look for more than speculative gain. Meanwhile, as the memecoin’s journey to $0.000081 is ambitious, the short-term to medium-term performance of Shiba Inu is quite robust, showing a 109% increase in the last three months. If the bullish trend is sustained and it takes advantage of the technology involved, even the critics will be surprised. For now, it is all about watching the key price levels and navigating through the volatile crypto waters. As always, investing in SHIB – or any crypto for that matter – carries risks, but the potential rewards continue to captivate many.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , CoinShares says that institutional crypto investment products saw a surge in net inflows that brought yearly flows to $37.3 billion last week, a new record. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$270m last week, while the flows displayed an unusual dichotomy between assets within the asset class. Since the launch of options on US ETFs, despite their high initial volumes, we have not seen a commensurate rise in ETP volumes at US$22bn last week, compared to US$34bn the week prior. Total inflows this year so far are at a new record of US$37.3bn.” Source: CoinShares The US region led the world with $266 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong and Germany at $39 million and $12.3 million. “Minor outflows were seen in Switzerland and Canada of US$26m and US$10m respectively.” Following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) unsuccessful push for the key psychological price level of $100,000 last week, BTC saw outflows of $457 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) set a new record for yearly inflows. “In stark contrast, Ethereum saw inflows of US$634m, and has experienced a dramatic turnaround in sentiment which has seen year-to-date inflows hit US$2.2bn, finally beating its 2021 inflows record of US$2bn.” XRP products brought in $95 million, possibly due to possibility of an upcoming XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Although both cryptos have seen an outflow this week of $20 million, the month-to-date (MTD) flows have seen different results, with multi-crypto seeing an outflow of $25.3 million. In comparison, Solana records $40 million of inflow. Ripple’s XRP also records massive inflows, with $95 million this week and $141 million year-to-date (YTD).

After weeks of bitter standoffs, the National Assembly has finally agreed to vote in favor of a government-proposed bill that will see crypto tax launch in 2027 , rather than January 2025.

Hanwha Investment & Securities share prices over the past five days on the Korea Exchange. (Source: Yahoo Finance) However, most of these price gains proved ephemeral, rising in the early morning and falling back slightly later in the day. Hanwha Investment & Securities, which owns shares in Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit crypto exchange , saw prices spike upwards as soon as the Korean Exchange opened on December 2. Both Hanwha Investment & Securities and Hanwha Investment & Securities Preferred Stock prices rose by 8% and 11% respectively.

Is it the innovation it brings to blockchain, its potential to solve real-world problems, or the jaw-dropping returns it could offer? With the crypto space brimming with opportunities, finding the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 can feel like striking gold. While Arbitrum has been gaining traction with its Layer-2 scalability and EOS continues to innovate with its smart contract capabilities, Qubetics ($TICS) is redefining what’s possible in crypto payments and asset management. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve your consideration. Qubetics ($TICS) Redefines Crypto Payments And Asset Management Qubetics is making cryptocurrency more accessible with its multi-chain wallet, an advanced application designed for users to manage digital assets with ease. The wallet is not just a storage space; it’s an all-in-one platform for debit and virtual card integration, and compatibility with payment giants like Apple Pay and Google Pay. With a decentralised VPN service and a tokenised asset marketplace, the Qubetics wallet is turning heads for its practical applications. The multi-chain wallet’s real-world utility is unmatched. A small business owner, for example, could use Qubetics to manage payments without worrying about high transaction fees. Imagine a local café offering its customers a way to pay with $TICS using the wallet’s integration with Visa or Mastercard. The business owner can instantly convert the tokens into stablecoins like USDT or USDC, providing reliable fiat currency payouts while bypassing crypto volatility. For developers, Qubetics simplifies blockchain interaction with its innovative design. Whether creating decentralised marketplaces or managing NFT royalties, the wallet streamlines every process. Even for artists, the ability to tokenise artwork and earn royalties every time their piece is resold is groundbreaking. The marketplace within the wallet also allows users to explore tokenised real-world assets like real estate and commodities, providing diversification opportunities that were once limited to institutional investors. The wallet’s accessibility across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms ensures users can manage their $TICS tokens and other digital assets anywhere. For a closer look at its features, watch this informatve video . The Qubetics Presale Opportunity The Qubetics presale continues to attract attention with its 11th stage already underway. Over 259 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 5,700 holders, raising an impressive $4.1 million. At the current price of $0.0282 per token, investors have a chance to lock in before the price increases by 10% in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a return of 783%. Investing in $TICS now could lead to life-changing returns. A $4,000 investment today would be worth $35,460 if the token reaches $0.25. Analysts forecast $TICS climbing to $1 post-presale, turning that investment into $137,450. Long-term projections indicate the token could hit $5, translating to $702,835, and at $15 after the mainnet launch, an astounding $2.1 million. These potential returns showcase why Qubetics is being recognised as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Arbitrum Strengthens Its Lead In Layer-2 Solutions Arbitrum is setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability. Designed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, it handles transactions off-chain to reduce congestion and costs. This makes it ideal for decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and developers looking for a reliable ecosystem. Recent updates reveal that Arbitrum has processed over 1 billion transactions, highlighting its growing adoption among developers and businesses. The introduction of streamlined deployment tools for smart contracts has further solidified its reputation as a preferred platform for blockchain applications. Arbitrum’s real-world relevance lies in its ability to cut costs and speed up transactions. DeFi platforms using Arbitrum can now process trades at a fraction of the cost, which is a game-changer for investors looking for efficiency. NFT marketplaces have also benefited from the platform’s ability to handle large volumes of transactions without slowing down. Analysts believe that as more projects migrate to Layer-2 solutions, the value of Arbitrum’s token, ARB, is likely to grow. With its innovative technology and growing user base, Arbitrum is clearly one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024 , particularly for those eyeing long-term scalability. EOS Continues To Innovate With Smart Contracts EOS has long been a key player in blockchain development, and recent upgrades have brought it back into the spotlight. Known for its focus on high performance and user-friendly interfaces, EOS remains a go-to platform for developers building decentralised applications (dApps). The latest Antelope protocol upgrade has boosted EOS’s scalability and security, making it even more appealing to developers. Reports indicate that the daily user count on EOS has grown by 18% over the past month, thanks to partnerships with gaming and DeFi platforms. EOS’s low transaction fees and fast processing speeds make it a practical choice for both developers and users. Imagine a gaming company creating a decentralised in-game economy on EOS without worrying about lag or high network costs. Similarly, financial institutions using EOS for DeFi applications can process loans and trades with near-instantaneous speeds. With its ongoing focus on innovation, EOS is well-positioned to attract more developers and investors. Its continued evolution makes it one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, especially for those looking for a platform that combines performance with reliability. Conclusion Whether you’re looking for scalability, smart contract innovation, or real-world usability, Qubetics ($TICS), Arbitrum, and EOS each bring something unique to the table. Arbitrum leads the charge in Layer-2 solutions, while EOS continues to refine its developer-friendly ecosystem. However, Qubetics stands out for its multi-chain wallet, blending innovation and practicality with a user-focused design. Its presale offers unmatched potential, with the opportunity to turn modest investments into life-changing returns. If you’re searching for the best altcoin to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics should be at the top of your list.

During the dip, Dogecoin whales have transferred over $100 million worth of DOGE, signaling significant market interest in the asset. As the meme coin continues to show signs of recovery, analysts predict that DOGE could potentially experience a 400% price surge in the upcoming bull cycle. Whale Transactions Indicate Increased Market Activity Recent reports reveal that two large transactions have taken place involving Dogecoin , involving over 249 million DOGE worth around $102 million. The first transaction saw 131 million DOGE transferred from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, while the second involved 117 million DOGE moved from Binance to an undisclosed wallet. These large transfers could suggest that whales are positioning themselves for a possible price move, while also indicating heightened market interest. The increased activity by major holders often signals potential price shifts. As DOGE trades above $0.40, many market participants are closely watching these large transfers, which may precede a breakout or retracement in price. In particular, the recent surge in trading volume by 77% suggests a rise in demand for Dogecoin, potentially setting the stage for the next big move. Analyst Predicts 400% Dogecoin Price Surge Market analyst Javon Marks has speculated that Dogecoin’s price could rise by 400% based on historical trends and Fibonacci extension levels. According to Marks, the meme coin is in its third bull cycle, following similar patterns from previous cycles in 2017 and 2021. The analyst believes that DOGE price could target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which currently sits at $2.28, up from its current price of around $0.42. In his analysis, Marks points out that during the previous bull cycles, Dogecoin surged from its market bottom to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. In 2017, DOGE rose from $0.00009 to a peak of $0.8750, while in 2021, the asset moved from $0.00168 to its current all-time high of $0.73995. Marks anticipates that a similar trend could unfold this time, with DOGE rising from its current cycle bottom at $0.06004 to $2.28. This represents a potential upside of 457% from the current price. DOGE Bullish Pennant Formation Signal Breakout Technical indicators are also signaling a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. The chart pattern currently forming suggests a Bullish Pennant, a continuation formation that typically precedes an upward breakout. After a strong price increase, DOGE has entered a consolidation phase, where it is currently trading near the $0.42 level. This consolidation may indicate a cooling-off period before the price makes another significant move. The breakout from this pattern could propel Dogecoin to higher levels. If the price clears key resistance at $0.45 and $0.50, it could test the projected target level of $0.65. This would align with the bullish structure observed in previous cycles, where DOGE experienced substantial upward movements following similar consolidations. doge/usd price chart (source: TradingView) As Dogecoin continues to consolidate, traders and analysts are keeping an eye on key support and resistance levels. The immediate support for DOGE lies at $0.40, where the price has recently stabilized. If this level holds, DOGE may be able to push through the next resistance at $0.45. A breakout above this level could pave the way for further gains, potentially bringing DOGE closer to the $0.50 mark amid Dogecoin ETF anticipation. On the other hand, if the price fails to hold above $0.40, there could be a pullback to lower support levels at $0.35.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 23:53:20

These big investments across various sectors signal continued institutional interest in Bitcoin, even as market volatility persists. From software intelligence firms to educational platforms, the influx of capital into the Bitcoin market suggests a bullish sentiment despite the recent price dip. Bitcoin Price Fluctuations Attract Institutional Investors On December 2, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm known for its Bitcoin investments, disclosed another substantial purchase. According to a Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company acquired 15,400 BTC for roughly $1.5 billion in cash, paying an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. This acquisition adds to MicroStrategy’s already considerable Bitcoin holdings, underscoring the company’s continued confidence in the cryptocurrency. For the quarter, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin return reached 38.7%, while its year-to-date return sits at 63.3%. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,400 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$95,976 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 38.7% QTD and 63.3% YTD. As of 12/2/2024, we hodl 402,100 $BTC acquired for ~$23.4 billion at ~$58,263 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/K3TK4msGp0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 2, 2024 Simultaneously, MARA Holdings, a company operating in the digital asset and blockchain computing industry, revealed its plan to secure $805 million by issuing convertible senior notes due in 2031. This capital raise seeks to bolster the company’s Bitcoin reserves and address existing debt. MARA intends to allocate up to $199 million to buy back a portion of its convertible notes maturing in 2026, utilizing the remaining funds to increase its Bitcoin holdings and support general corporate activities. $100k Bitcoin Price: A December Dream? Further fueling the Bitcoin market, Genius Group Limited, an AI-driven education company embracing a “Bitcoin-first” approach, announced on Monday that it had added $1.8 million to its Bitcoin treasury. The latest purchase raises the company’s total Bitcoin reserves to 172 BTC, valued at $15.8 million, with an average net price of $92,006 per Bitcoin. This investment follows Genius Group’s recent commitment to hold at least 90% of its current and future reserves in Bitcoin, aiming to accumulate $120 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Adding to the wave of Bitcoin acquisitions, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled a shareholder reward program on Monday, offering Bitcoin prizes through a lottery system. Shareholders owning a minimum of 100 shares by December 31 are eligible for the program, which boasts a total prize pool of 30 million yen (approximately $199,500) in Bitcoin. Metaplanet has seen its stock soar by 1,000% in 2024, becoming Tokyo's top stock through its partnership with Sora Ventures and adopting Bitcoin as part of its treasury strategy, showcasing the potential advantages of integrating Bitcoin into corporate finance. #Metaplanet … — Vanquish Adept (@VanquishAdept) December 2, 2024 The rewards, distributed via lottery, will be allocated to 2,350 shareholders in varying amounts. In addition, new accounts opened with SBI VC Trade between November 18th and March 31st, 2025, can participate by registering through a dedicated website before the deadline. Bitcoin Price Predictions: Institutional Influence on the Horizon Bitcoin’s price has experienced substantial fluctuations recently, with a considerable increase of approximately 40% following Trump’s U.S. presidential victory in November. The question now is whether the investments by companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, MARA Holdings, and Genius Group, amid a Bitcoin price dip, can provide the necessary momentum to propel the Bitcoin price towards this ambitious target in December. The current market dynamics, driven by massive investments from established and emerging players, suggest a potential upward trajectory for the Bitcoin price. With the $100k target in sight, the influence of institutional buying on the future of Bitcoin remains a topic of keen observation. The combined efforts of these major players create a new wave of investment, potentially signaling a bullish trend for Bitcoin despite the recent price fluctuation.

RCO Finance Positioned to Deliver 10,000x Gains from Its Lowest Point",https://timestabloid.com/missed-cardano-at-0-30-rco-finance-positioned-to-deliver-10000x/,"Missed the boat on Cardano’s meteoric rise from $0.30? Don’t fret; there may be another chance to realize outsized gains. The emerging RCO Finance is poised to follow a similar trajectory, offering investors the potential for 10,000x returns from its lowest point. With its presale selling off fast, RCOF could be the next big thing in crypto. But what are the factors contributing to this bullish outlook? Find the details below! RCO Finance: AI-Powered Investing for the Next Cardano-like Surge As we look to the future, RCO Finance has the potential to mirror the impressive rally of Cardano, which began when it was trading at just $0.30. RCO Finance stands out for its profit potential and innovative offerings as a DeFi trading platform with unique features tailored for crypto traders. A key aspect of RCO Finance’s appeal is its emphasis on artificial intelligence, particularly in its robo-advisor service. Just think about having a financial advisor who recommends which digital assets to buy or not to buy, depending on your taste and level of risk tolerance. Unlike typical robo-advisors who make generic suggestions, RCO Finance’s AI tool analyzes current market trends and investor-specific data, making it relevant for seasoned traders and newcomers eager to enter the market. This personalized guidance can significantly enhance your trading experience. Additionally, RCO Finance is set to launch an exciting new debit card product, allowing users to access their digital assets practically.

Investors who missed Cardano’s price rally, which began at a modest price of $0.30 are being offered another chance as ADA aims to regain the $1.50 mark. Currently priced at $1, ADA has remained stable, not dropping below this threshold despite recent market fluctuations. Bitcoin, which significantly influences Cardano’s token price, is also experiencing volatility and has yet to reach the anticipated $100,000. Nevertheless, Cardano investors are optimistic, with some analysts predicting ADA could reach $2.45 based on the Fibonacci sequence. Investors are hopeful for ADA’s continued upward movement, especially with recent advancements like the launch of the first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on Cardano. This development is expected to increase interest and demand for ADA, potentially leading to a price surge. RCOF Presale Stage 4: Buy Now at $0.077 Before It’s Too Late With RCO Finance having successfully raised over $7 million in its ongoing presale, this is your chance to seize a lucrative opportunity reminiscent of investing in Cardano at just $0.30. RCOF presale tokens are priced at only $0.0777 each in stage 4. This pricing strategy positions investors for an exciting future, with an anticipated launch price of $0.60, offering the potential for gains exceeding 600%. You can also enjoy a generous 50% discount on the current token price using the code RCOF50. Adding to the excitement, many experts are drawing parallels between RCOF and the historic Bitcoin price rally in 2021, owing to its deflationary model. This sentiment suggests that the token value could surge by an impressive 10000x. Don’t let this incredible opportunity pass you by—consider joining the RCOF presale today!

However, despite the closure, the brand’s Ethereum tokens will remain accessible to the public. RFTKT will launch an updated website to maintain its legacy On Monday, Nike’s digital fashion brand, RTFKT, disclosed that it will cease operations by the end of January 2025. In an X post, the platform commented: Today, we’re announcing the plan to wind down RTFKT operations. Looking back, we’re incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved together. ~ RTFKT The platform reflected on its past achievements, including the Clone X project with Takashi Murakami, the development of the first digital sneakers, and the number of artists and creators it has inspired. Additionally, it hopes to maintain this legacy by releasing an updated website that showcases its many works and designs. The brand also believes its innovative ethos will “live on through” the many creators and artists it motivated, adding that it has not come to an end but materialized into what it was always meant to be —an artifact of cultural evolution. Moreover, RTFKT still plans to launch one more ingenuity before its closure- the MNLTH X featuring the BLADE DROP. While the launch may break new technical ground, some analysts believe it could be perceived as a desperate revenue grab before closure. However, Nike is yet to confirm RTFKT‘s operation wind down. RTFKT and Nike have collaborated on shoe designs since 2021 Nike’s acquisition of RTFKT in 2021, under former CEO John Donahoe, came at a time when multiple companies wanted to pursue NFTs and the metaverse. Since then, the two have released incredible designer shoes, becoming a cult favorite for sports players. Even towards the end of 2023, streetwear designer Jeff Staple imagined a future where customers’ feet are scanned in-store for on-the-spot, zero-waste shoe production using recycled materials. During the Paris Olympics, Nike even unveiled a robot-powered, spray-on sneaker built using LightSpray technology that takes just three minutes to produce. No one would have imagined the closure of RTFKT barely four months after its last big launch. Before then, Nike had even revealed 13 AI-generated sneakers co-created alongside athletes, including Kylian Mbappé, LeBron James, and Sha’Carri Richardson.

Key Indicator Hints at Major Price Movement,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-enter-final-bull-phase-key-indicator-hints-at-major-price-movement/,"Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, appears to be on the brink of a potential sharp rise. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Crypto Dan, the market could experience a significant upward trend within the next two months. This insight , shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, is based on a critical market indicator that has historically signaled major price rallies. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Sharp Rise Incoming In the post titled “Strong Rise in Bitcoin is Expected Within 1-2 Months”, Crypto Dan highlights the emergence of a “golden cross” in the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator. This occurrence, he notes, is a rare event that typically happens only once or twice during an entire bull market cycle. As part of the current bullish cycle that began in January 2023, its reappearance is being seen as a strong precursor to a substantial market move . For further context, the SOPR Ratio indicator measures realized profits and losses in the Bitcoin market, offering insight into investor sentiment. The “golden cross” identified by Crypto Dan signifies a pivotal moment in the bull cycle . Historically, this signal has been followed by strong price increases within two months of its appearance. Crypto Dan explained that the market is likely entering the final phase of the current upward cycle, a stage characterized by steeper price gains and shorter periods of consolidation . This means that while Bitcoin’s ascent might accelerate, the opportunities for investors to accumulate at lower prices could diminish rapidly. Furthermore, he projected that if the anticipated rise materializes by the end of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, it could draw significant new capital into the market. The inflow of additional funds is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum, potentially driving the market to its peak during this cycle. Dan wrote: As the market moves towards the later stages of the cycle, the magnitude of the rise tends to be larger, and the periods of decline/adjustment are shorter. If a steep rise occurs as implied by this indicator within the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, it can be expected that new inflows and additional funds will enter the market, bringing it to its peak. BTC Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to maintain stability above the $95,000 price mark. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades for $96,296, down by 1% in the past day but still up by nearly 40% in the past month. According to a renowned crypto analyst known as Ali on X, while some in the community expect a major retracement in Bitcoin’s price, BTC could do the opposite. The analyst projected BTC could surge to as high as $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction . Given the fact that #Bitcoin tends to do the opposite of what the crowd believes, there is potential for $BTC to go higher. If the current cycle behaves like the last two, #BTC could go to $120,000-$150,000 before the first 30% price correction. https://t.co/xTHJMITqJa — Ali (@ali_charts) December 2, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 00:30:14

The decision, issued by Judge Kathaleen McCormick, strikes down the compensation agreement despite shareholders’ attempt to “re-ratify” the deal. McCormick’s ruling follows a previous judgment in January, where the pay package was invalidated. The judge’s decision adds another layer to the ongoing legal battle, with Tesla expected to pursue an appeal. Elon Musk’s $56B Tesla Compensation Deal Invalidated: Court Ruling Details According to a Monday court filing , Judge Kathaleen McCormick has denied the tech company’s request to revise her earlier decision regarding Elon Musk’s pay package. The legal team for Tesla had argued that the recent shareholder vote to “re-ratify” the deal addressed the court’s concerns from the first ruling. However, McCormick rejected this argument, citing that despite the vote, the pay package remained problematic. The judge maintained that the CEO’s compensation deal was influenced by his power over the board of directors, leading to terms that were not “entirely fair.” In her opinion, Tesla had failed to ensure that investors were fully informed before agreeing to the pay package. McCormick reiterated that while the board could have chosen an appropriate amount of compensation, it capitulated to Elon Musk’s terms, which the court found to be excessive. The judge added, “There were undoubtedly a range of healthy amounts that the Board could have decided to pay Musk. Instead, the Board capitulated to Musk’s terms and then failed to prove that those terms were entirely fair.” Moreover, the legal setback also carries a financial penalty for Tesla. In addition to the ruling on the compensation package, the court awarded the plaintiff’s attorneys a $345 million fee, which the tech company must pay in cash or shares. In response, the Tech giant said, “This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners – the shareholders.” Tesla To Appeal Ruling At Delaware Supreme Court Following McCormick’s decision, the tech company will appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. The company had hoped that the re-ratification by shareholders would allow the deal to proceed, but McCormick’s decision has created additional legal hurdles. A Delaware judge just overruled a supermajority of shareholders who own Tesla and who voted twice to pay @elonmusk what he’s worth. The court’s decision is wrong, and we’re going to appeal. This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware… — Tesla (@Tesla) December 2, 2024 The decision also raises broader questions about corporate governance and executive compensation in the tech industry. The outcome of the appeal could set an important precedent for future cases involving large executive pay packages. In other legal developments, the tech giant CEO filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing the companies of engaging in anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model undermines competition in the AI sector. Elon Musk’s legal team argues that OpenAI, backed by a $13 billion investment from Microsoft, has been using its influence to suppress competitors, including xAI. Despite the ongoing legal challenges surrounding his pay package, Musk experienced a positive outcome in a separate legal battle. A U.S. District Court judge recently ruled in Musk’s favor in a case involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had sought to sanction Elon Musk over his handling of the X acquisition, but the court denied the request. The court noted that Elon Musk had already reimbursed the SEC for costs related to a missed meeting.

According to the Federal Government of Brazil’s document on Dec. 02, the central bank has opened the public consultation about the proposed idea of banning stablecoin withdraws to self-custody wallets. The central bank aims to amend several digital asset laws, including BCB Resolution No. 277 of 2022, which regulates the virtual asset service provider in the foreign exchange market. The growing trading volume and connections between digital assets and conventional financial instruments have led the government to regulate these withdrawals. “The topic has been widely discussed in international forums, which recommend the adoption of regulations and supervision compatible with the functionalities provided and the risks associated with such assets,” the proposal state. Another concern raised by the regulators is interconnected with traditional models, consumer and investor protections, prevention of illicit data purposes, and financial-macroeconomic stability. This proposal, with a due date of Feb. 02, 2025, would determine the regulatory body in which the activities of stablecoin would be included under the foreign exchange market or subject to Brazilian capital abroad and foreign capital in the country.

DTX Exchange, a smart new technology, is set to outpace Shiba Inu by leveraging its blockchain and massive growth potential. Table of Contents DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead Why now is the time to invest in DTX Exchange The future is hybrid As we are entering 2025 the altcoin market is starting to heat up. Drawing the attention of many investors is DTX Exchange (DTX), making headlines for its $9 million presale. As early backers have gained 400% already, many analysts are placing DTX Exchange ahead of Shina Inu (SHIB) as the most underrated altcoin ahead of 2025. DTX Exchange: Driving adoption for $9m crypto presale As traders set the trend away from speculative assets to coins with real-world applications, this creates opportunities for DTX Exchange to shine. While Shiba Inu continues to depend on community hype to run, DTX is building itself as a trustworthy and forward-looking platform. DTX Exchange is leading the first hybrid approach at addressing these critical challenges of trading including financial exclusion, inaccessibility to diverse markets, and lack of a holistic set of tools. DTX has a combined ecosystem of traditional and decentralized trading instruments that will appeal to both seasoned traders and crypto newcomers. Due to their growing reputation, DTX Exchange has had one of the most successful presales this year. DTX is a hot item amongst investors, with over $9,000,000 raised during early funding rounds. With DTX tokens trading for an attractive $0.10, early investors saw a 400% increase in their initial investment. DTX Exchange is making headlines for a limited-time offer, where investors who use the promo code SELLSTAGE get their deposit doubled. Shiba Inu’s challenges: The road ahead The recent rise of Shiba Inu as a top 15 cryptocurrency came through the support of the viral community and speculative trading. Although hype plays a role in the crypto world, a maturing market is evaluating assets such as SHIB on their input. Even after the expansion of SHIB’s ecosystem into projects such as Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and Shib.io, more was needed for Shiba Inu to reach its previous peaks. As one of the weakest performers this cycle, SHIB’s price only increased by 40%. When compared to similar altcoins who experienced 100% growth, Shiba Inu has a lot of ground to reclaim. You might also like: Analyst confident of a SHIB surge to $0.0002 as DTX is set to give the meme coin a run Why now is the time to invest in DTX Exchange Now that we’ve entered a new phase of growth with the crypto market, timing matters.

Some of the main reasons why DTX is one of the most underrated altcoins are: High growth potential: An analyst is predicting up to 5,000% gains post-launch for DTX, calling it the most lucrative investment in the current market. Comprehensive ecosystem: DTX bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi by addressing critical market gaps and providing mass adoption. Affordable entry point: Retail and institutional investors alike can see substantial upside potential with DTX at $0.1 per token during presale. The future is hybrid The crypto bull market is just the beginning for DTX Exchange, which sets the standard for trading that goes well beyond the bulls of the cryptocurrency market. DTX Exchange is the obvious choice for investors who want to add a token that brings the elements of innovation, accessibility, and growth potential to their portfolio.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 517,800 followers on the social media platform X that a bullish Ethereum ( ETH ) would be very favorable for the altcoin market. “An ETH breakout would lead the next wave of altcoin rallies.” Looking at Ethereum, the trader says ETH is very close to sparking a high timeframe breakout. “Ethereum is now pressing past the ~$3,700 resistance of its main pattern (light blue). A weekly close above the pattern top would kickstart a breakout and end the 2024 ETH downtrend.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum has closed the latest weekly candle above $3,700. At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,731. Late last month, Rekt said that Ethereum moving above $3,100 would trigger capital rotation from Bitcoin to ETH. He also shared a chart suggesting that capital would eventually move from ETH to mid-cap and subsequently lower-cap coins. “A weekly close above the blue diagonal resistance ($3,100) would likely set up another wave in the money flow cycle as ETH would take control of large-cap money flow.” Source: Rekt Capital/X As for Bitcoin, Rekt says the crypto king needs to rally above its immediate resistance to spark an upside burst toward the six-figure level. “Bitcoin is now trying to press beyond the bull flag top. A daily close above the bull flag resistance of ~$97,450 could kickstart additional trend continuation to get closer to challenging $100,000 once again.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,891.

Whether it’s Elon Musk’s tweets or the rise of meme culture, coins like Gigachad, Ponke, and BTFD Coin are adding flair to investing. They’ve gone from being jokes to genuine opportunities for some serious gains. Among these, BTFD Coin is rewriting the meme coin rulebook. From its viral presale to its jaw-dropping numbers, this token is rallying the community like no other. Wondering if it’s one of the best meme coins to join this week? Let’s dive in and break it down! BTFD Coin: The Underdog That’s Leading the Pack If you’re looking for meme coin royalty in the making, BTFD Coin is your ticket. Since its presale launched on November 26, 2024, it has smashed expectations, raising over $500,000 in just one week. With a current price of $0.000058 in Stage 6, early investors are already dreaming of moonshots. The kicker? The 16-stage presale is designed to reward early adopters, giving them an edge before its price skyrockets post-launch. Analysts are bullish, predicting a potential listing price of $0.0006, which could multiply your returns. Imagine this: Investing $4,000 in Stage 6 at $0.000058. That’s a whopping 68.9 million BTFD Coins in your wallet. When it hits $0.0006, your investment could balloon to over $41,000. Now that’s meme coin magic. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers. It’s community-driven with perks like staking rewards and a play-to-earn (P2E) game. The devs are focused on sustainability, so it’s not just another pump-and-dump. In the wild world of crypto, this coin’s roadmap stands out. Gigachad: Flexing Its Meme Muscles What’s more alpha than a Chad? A Gigachad. This coin has all the swagger of its internet namesake, but can it keep the hype alive? Launched with a meme-heavy marketing campaign, Gigachad gained traction quickly, especially among Gen Z investors. Its tagline? “Be the Chad, own the coin.” The beauty of Gigachad lies in its simplicity. The project focuses on community and decentralisation. With minimal utility but maximum meme appeal, it’s a crowd favourite for short-term gains. However, experts warn about its volatility. You’ve got to be ready to “buy the dip” (pun intended) to ride the waves. For investors who love fast-paced action, Gigachad is like riding a rollercoaster. Just don’t forget: It’s risky business. This meme coin thrives on trends, so if the hype fizzles, so might the profits. Ponke: The Wholesome Meme Coin Who knew a frog could be so relatable? Enter Ponke, a coin inspired by its charmingly innocent frog mascot. While its cuteness might seem like a gimmick, Ponke is carving out a niche in eco-friendly initiatives. Yep, this meme coin has a green side. Ponke’s creators have partnered with environmental groups, turning their coin into a movement. Every transaction contributes to reforestation projects, giving it a feel-good factor that’s rare in the meme coin space. Add in low transaction fees and an enthusiastic community, and you’ve got a contender with real staying power. But don’t mistake Ponke for a purely feel-good coin. Its market cap has been climbing steadily, and its user base is growing across the globe. The eco-friendly angle could make it a favourite among investors who value purpose over just profits. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin space is buzzing with opportunities. From Gigachad’s unapologetic boldness to Ponke’s eco-conscious heart, there’s no shortage of excitement. But one coin is leading the charge: BTFD Coin . Don’t miss your chance to join the presale while it’s still in Stage 6. With its impressive performance and strong community backing, BTFD Coin is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Join the presale today and ride the wave to crypto glory.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 01:18:00

Qubetics flips the script with decentralised, secure, and scalable solutions. But it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, providing access to decentralised applications (dApps) across multiple chains. Analysts are hyped. With a presale price of $0.0282, projections estimate $TICS hitting $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a mind-blowing 52,912% ROI. Think about it. An investment of $1,000 today could become $530,000. Still waiting? Every second counts as the presale journey takes the top flight. 2. Cardano ($ADA): The Sustainable Blockchain Pioneer Cardano has long been hailed as the “Ethereum killer.” Why? Because it focuses on scalability, sustainability, and energy efficiency. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano is constantly upgrading its ecosystem. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is not only eco-friendly but also incredibly secure. Cardano’s upcoming Hydra upgrade aims to process over a million transactions per second. That’s a massive leap forward in blockchain scalability. While its price movements have been steady, analysts predict substantial growth as adoption increases. If you’re into long-term stability with room for explosive growth, $ADA is a solid bet. 3. Solana ($SOL): The Speed Demon Solana is the Ferrari of blockchains—fast, flashy, and always stealing the spotlight. With transaction speeds reaching 65,000 per second, Solana leaves competitors in the dust. It’s already a favourite for NFT platforms and decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. But speed isn’t Solana’s only strength. Its low fees and growing ecosystem are attracting developers and investors alike. While some argue its centralisation is a drawback, others see it as a feature for scalability. With $SOL’s price currently undervalued, now might be the perfect time to grab some before the next bull run. 4. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Multiverse of Blockchains Avalanche is redefining how blockchains interact. Its subnet architecture allows for custom, scalable chains that still connect to the main Avalanche network. Think of it as a multiverse where every blockchain has its own rules but can still communicate seamlessly. This flexibility makes Avalanche a favourite for institutions and enterprises. Its ecosystem is booming, with projects ranging from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Analysts predict strong upward momentum for $AVAX, especially as its partnerships grow. Avalanche might not promise the astronomical gains of Qubetics, but it’s a solid pick for those who want a balance of innovation and reliability. 5. Polygon ($MATIC): Ethereum’s Best Friend Ethereum may be the king, but even kings need allies. Polygon acts as a scaling solution for Ethereum, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees. Its Layer-2 network has become the go-to choice for developers who want Ethereum’s security without the high gas fees. With high-profile collaborations, including partnerships with Disney and Reddit, Polygon is proving its value in the real world. Its upcoming zkEVM upgrade promises even faster transactions and greater scalability. Analysts believe $MATIC could see a significant price increase as Ethereum’s dominance continues. The Final Word Every crypto investor has a “what if” story. What if I’d bought Bitcoin at $100? What if I’d gotten in on Ethereum’s ICO? Here’s your chance to avoid another regret. Qubetics is the real deal, and its presale is your golden ticket. The best cryptos to buy now don’t wait for anyone. Get in on Qubetics before the next stage hits, and secure your slice of the future. The clock’s ticking.

Both projects are making headlines, each vying for dominance in a fiercely competitive market. But while these giants race forward, another name is quietly reshaping the narrative with its own groundbreaking innovations—Qubetics. Qubetics is shaking things up as it enters the 11th stage of its presale. With over $4.1 million raised and analysts forecasting $10–$15 for $TICS post-mainnet, it’s hard not to feel the FOMO. Beyond the numbers, Qubetics isn’t just another presale hype train; it’s offering a real solution to blockchain’s long-standing usability and scalability issues with its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE. In a sea of coins, Qubetics might just be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. Qubetics: A Presale Turning Heads Qubetics is officially in the 11th stage of its presale, and things are getting spicy. With over 259 million $TICS tokens sold, raising a jaw-dropping $4.1 million, investors are buzzing with excitement. And why wouldn’t they be? Analysts are throwing around predictions of $10 to $15 for $TICS after its mainnet launch, which could mean life-changing returns for early adopters. Just imagine turning an $85,000 investment into millions—are you in yet? Beyond the numbers, Qubetics isn’t just another coin on the block. It’s bringing something truly game-changing to the table: QubeQode IDE . This revolutionary toolkit aims to smooth over blockchain’s rough edges, finally making decentralised applications user-friendly and scalable. Ever struggled with clunky, unintuitive blockchain apps? QubeQode IDE is the answer, promising streamlined user experiences and robust transaction processing. With scalability and usability finally sorted, this could be a turning point for blockchain tech. Solana: Still the Speed King Solana’s making moves, and not just in its lightning-fast transaction speeds. The blockchain has been buzzing with ecosystem developments, keeping its community pumped. Did you catch the latest news about Solana’s dominance in NFT trading? It’s no wonder the coin remains a favourite for developers who value performance above all else. But here’s the catch: Solana isn’t immune to blockchain’s big dilemmas. Outages and centralisation concerns keep popping up in conversations. Still, its unmatched throughput continues to solidify its position as a leader in the space. If you’re a fan of efficiency, Solana’s showing no signs of slowing down. Cardano: Slow and Steady Wins the Race? Cardano’s price has been a rollercoaster, with recent rallies turning heads. Yet, even amid cooling markets, this blockchain giant is proving its staying power. Analysts are divided on whether ADA can sustain its growth, but let’s not ignore its solid fundamentals. With a strong focus on research and development, Cardano is often seen as the “academic blockchain” that plays the long game. Despite its reputation for taking things slow, Cardano’s scalability solutions and environmentally conscious approach give it an edge in this crowded market. Investors are watching closely, waiting to see if ADA’s cautious climb can outpace its flashier competitors like Solana and Qubetics. Conclusion Qubetics , Solana, and Cardano are rewriting the rules of crypto investing. Whether you’re in it for speed, sustainability, or revolutionary tools like QubeQode IDE, one thing’s for sure—there’s never been a better time to dive in. So, which one’s grabbing your cash?

Bitcoin SOPR Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Crossover As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out , the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has shown a golden crossover recently. The “ SOPR ” here refers to an indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold/transferred to see what price it was moved at last time. If this price is less than the current spot price for any token, its sale contributes to profit realization. Similarly, transactions involving coins of the opposite type imply loss realization is occurring. The SOPR sums up these profits and losses for the entire sell supply, and determines their ratio. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the average holder could be assumed to be selling their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, being under the mark implies that the overall market is realizing more losses than profits. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin SOPR over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin SOPR fell under the 365-day earlier in the year, but recently, it has reversed its direction and has broken past the level. This increase naturally corresponds to the return of notable profit-taking in the sector following the latest rally of the cryptocurrency. In the chart, the quant highlighted the previous instances of this crossover. It would appear that each of these led into bullish price action for the asset. “After the golden cross appears, the market usually starts a strong rise within 2 months at the latest,” notes the analyst. Thus, it’s possible that Bitcoin could be gearing up for another run shortly. This latest bullish crossover in the Bitcoin SOPR is the second time this cycle that the pattern has appeared, so it’s possible that the run now would lead the asset to its final peak of the cycle. It remains to be seen, though, whether the crossover between the monthly and yearly averages of the indicator would prove to be bullish for BTC or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $95,000, down almost 3% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin rally|Bitcoin Rise|Bitcoin SOPR|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-03 02:00:14

The S&P 500 has regained momentum after a November rally, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY ) is holding its ground near 106, and altcoins are stealing the spotlight with the Altcoin Season Index spiking to 84—a yearly high. Bitcoin ($BTC ), meanwhile, appears to be taking a breather, hovering near $95K after its breakout run from the $73K range. Source: coinmarketcap.com Historically, December following U.S. presidential elections is known for bullish tendencies, but this year brings mixed signals. While the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% ( link ), the dollar's strength poses a headwind for risk assets. At the same time, a full-force altcoin rally suggests traders are rotating capital, betting on high-risk assets during a speculative frenzy. As traders, whether short- or long-term, our mission is clear: stay prepared, plan our entries, and avoid chasing the first dip without a solid strategy (because let’s face it, the first dip can be a trick). In this analysis, we'll explore three likely correction scenarios for Bitcoin, identify actionable buy-the-dip levels, and highlight the technical reasoning and risks for each. Scenario 1: The Sideways Range Between $91K-$100K Key Technicals: Bitcoin's recent price action suggests the potential formation of a new range between $91K and $100K. The weekly candle’s inside-bar structure between $91000 & $98000 signals indecision, aligning with typical range-bound behavior (inside bars occur when the high and low of a candle are ""inside"" the range of the previous candle, often preceding continuation or reversal moves). On the daily timeframe, $91K is a temporary horizontal support level, while $100K serves as psychological resistance. Strategy: Wait for Confirmation: Monitor Bitcoin’s behavior near the $91K-$92K zone for strong support confirmation via bounce volume or bullish engulfing candles. Buy-the-Dip Level: Between $91K-$92K, aiming for $98K-$100K on the rebound. Stop Loss: Below $89.5K to avoid deeper downside risks. Monitor: Volume spikes and RSI divergence on the 4H/1D charts to confirm ranging activity. Why This Matters: Ranging price action is a hallmark of consolidation phases, often preparing for the next big move. By waiting for confirmation of $91K as a reliable floor, traders can exploit price oscillations between $91K and $100K for swing opportunities. Scenario 2: The Deeper Correction to $81K-$83K Key Technicals: The liquidation heatmap highlights a significant cluster of long liquidations between $83K-$85K, which could act as a liquidity magnet if Bitcoin loses $91K support. There’s a fair value gap (FVG) between $81.3K and $89.5K visible on higher timeframes. FVGs represent imbalances in price action, often revisited before a trend resumes. The Fibonacci retracement tool aligns the Golden Ratio (0.618) with this zone, adding a layer of confluence. Strategy: Set Alerts for Breakdown: If Bitcoin closes a daily candle below $91K with rising sell volume, prepare for entries near $81K-$83K. Buy-the-Dip Level: Between $81K-$83K, targeting $91K on the bounce. Stop Loss: Below $80K to account for false breakdowns. Monitor: Price action around the Golden Ratio (0.618) and the lower bound of the FVG for bullish reversals. Why This Matters: This scenario assumes a market maker-driven move to flush out over-leveraged longs, creating a prime re-entry point. A 15%-18% correction from the current price would still be modest compared to past cycles, presenting a realistic and lucrative buy zone. Scenario 3: A Full Breakdown to $70K-$73K Key Technicals: The 200-day SMA ($67.3K) and the top of the February-November accumulation range ($73K) act as key dynamic and horizontal supports, respectively. Below $80K, the next liquidity cluster lies between $70K-$73K, marking the ultimate ""stink order"" zone for longer-term entries. Historical cycles suggest that Bitcoin rarely retraces this deeply during December, but if it does, the opportunity could be significant. Strategy: Stagger Stink Orders: Place staggered bids between $70K-$73K to catch potential wicks during panic-driven sell-offs. Target: $85K-$90K for partial exits, holding moonbags for potential continuation to $98K+. Stop Loss: Below $67K, the 200-day SMA, as a hard floor. Monitor: Broad market conditions, including DXY strength and altcoin liquidity flow, to gauge overall risk appetite. Why This Matters: Though less likely, this scenario prepares traders for worst-case corrections while capitalizing on extreme fear-driven moves. Long-term buyers could use this zone to accumulate Bitcoin at significant discounts. Wider Context and December Outlook Bitcoin’s current setup reflects a tug-of-war between bullish seasonality (December is traditionally a strong month for risk assets) and macroeconomic headwinds like the dollar's strength. With the Altcoin Season Index at 84, suggesting speculative enthusiasm, Bitcoin could stay range-bound while altcoins dominate short-term performance. The Federal Reserve's likely decision to hold interest rates steady in two weeks adds to this mix, reducing near-term monetary uncertainty. Yet, until Bitcoin firmly establishes a new range or confirms $100K as a breakout point, traders must remain cautious. Summary: Navigating December with a Plan In conclusion: Scenario 1 ($91K-$100K): Likely range action, tradeable for swing traders. Scenario 2 ($81K-$83K): Deeper correction, ideal for mid-term positions. Scenario 3 ($70K-$73K): The ultimate crash zone, best for long-term accumulation. With a strategic approach, December can be both profitable and exciting. Remember, it’s Santa season—a time for optimism—but also for discipline. Invest wisely, stick to your plan, and let the market come to you. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Liquidity Gamechanger on the Horizon?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galachain-x-ton-bridge-liquidity-gamechanger-on-the-horizon/,"The GalaChain ecosystem has become notorious for innovative teams taking Web3 to new levels from what’s commonly known. Recent discussions show the people-powered AI solution is a major player in a planned move that could drive significant liquidity to and fro GalaChain and other significant players in Web3. If achieved, the bridge will further strengthen its standing as the most innovative in the ecosystem. In a recent tweet, the disclosure was made about a bridge between GalaChain and the TON ecosystem. According to the tweet, the decided bridge is part of a broader strategy to develop core technologies to support $TON. Interestingly, this is not just about TON and GalaChain. This move could see liquidity flow between high-potential ecosystems in Web3—something you don’t see often in the blockchain ecosystem. No surprises, as this has been the kind of innovative moves GalaChain has become synonymous with. A Bridge of Opportunity Blockchain bridges are not new. They are becoming increasingly critical as interoperability becomes the holy grail of decentralized finance. A possible GalaChain-TON bridge holds the potential to unlock vast amounts of liquidity. GalaChain has become popular for innovation within the Web3 ecosystem. It is a Layer 1 Blockchain developed by Gala, that serves as a core for its web3 entertainment ecosystem that includes games, music and film. With a strong community of thinker’s and builders driving the vision of blockchain technology, it has seen major dynamic Layer 1 solutions built in rapid fashion. Boasting a flexibility not seen on other chains, the actual design of GalaChain is to bring the next billion users on-chain. On the other hand TON has built a reputation as a powerhouse blockchain with a focus on speed and efficiency. The blockchain is also known for its scalability and growing adoption. Together, these two chains could create a liquidity superhighway, offering seamless asset transfer, reduced barriers to entry, and a more integrated user experience. The bridge’s impact on liquidity and trading volume will reflect the strength of both ecosystems. Liquidity providers and marketing participants could see significant benefits, with increased cross-chain activity and the possibility of new trading pairs enhancing market dynamics. Additionally, as decentralized finance continues to expand, the bridge could introduce new opportunities for yield farming, staking, and other financial instruments. This will further drive liquidity and utility for both chains. Stronger Implications for Other Stakeholders The tweet emphasized an effect that doesn’t just involve $GALA and $TON, but a significant innovation that will have a ripple effect on multiple blockchain protocols. According to the tweet, TON has already built a bridge that allows users to transfer assets between TON Blockchain and the Ethereum Blockchain, as well as between TON and the BNB Smart Chain. A GalaChain-TON bridge will enable massive liquidity flow to TON that would trickle down to other ecosystems linked to TON. Notably, GalaChain also has an ETH bridge , signalling how big players in the ecosystem are quick to collaborate with the chain. The GalaChain Ethereum bridge is a crucial component of the Gala Games ecosystem, enabling seamless transfer of GALA tokens between the Ethereum network and GalaChain. The bridge facilitates the transfer of GALA tokens in both directions: from Ethereum to GalaChain and vice versa. For users in the United States, the Galachain X Ton bridge could be a lifeline. $TON is difficult to acquire due to regional restrictions, but the bridge with GalaChain would provide an alternative. US-based users could potentially access TON’s ecosystem without the usual hurdles, enhancing both usability and adoption. A GalaChain-TON bridge could set new standards for how blockchains collaborate. Of course, all bridges come with obvious challenges. Security, scalability, and user adoption are all critical factors that will determine the success of any cross-chain initiatives. Despite the aforementioned concerns, the individual strength of both chains can navigate these hurdles and present immense rewards. The latest communication however, sends a wave of optimism for both ecosystems, especially those interested in seeing this collaboration drive more cutting edge innovations. There is a clear anticipation that underlines the need for more accessible, efficient, and interconnected systems.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain|TON,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|TON|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-03 02:31:07

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 02:36:00

Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently announced plans to delist stablecoins that do not comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) by December 30, 2024. This move is part of Coinbase’s commitment to adhere to evolving regulatory standards within the European Economic Area (EEA). The Impact of MiCA Regulations on Stablecoins MiCA, which came into effect on June 30, introduces stringent oversight of cryptocurrency companies operating within the EU. One of its key requirements is that all stablecoins available in the EEA must have an e-money license in at least one EU member state. This regulation directly impacts stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, which may face delisting from platforms like Coinbase unless they secure the necessary authorization. Tether has acknowledged the challenges posed by MiCA and is reportedly working on a technology-based solution tailored for the European market. However, until such solutions are implemented, investors may find limited options for trading and investing with USDT on certain platforms. Nordic Arbex: A Reliable Haven for USDT Investors Amid these regulatory shifts, Nordic Arbex remains a steadfast platform for investors looking to capitalize on USDT investments. Unlike some exchanges moving away from USDT, Nordic Arbex continues to support the stablecoin, offering investors up to 4% weekly returns on their USDT holdings. Why Choose Nordic Arbex? High Returns: With the potential to earn up to 4% weekly, investors can significantly grow their portfolios in a short period. Regulatory Compliance: Nordic Arbex operates with a keen understanding of global regulations, ensuring that all activities are compliant and in the best interest of its users. User-Friendly Platform: Designed for both novice and experienced investors, the platform offers intuitive navigation and robust customer support. Security: Employing cutting-edge security measures, Nordic Arbex protects user assets and data, providing peace of mind in a volatile market. The Future of Stablecoins in Europe The introduction of MiCA signifies a maturation of the crypto ecosystem in Europe. By enforcing stricter disclosure requirements, regular audits of crypto firms, and more robust capital reserve mandates, the EU aims to build trust and transparency across the marketplace. While some platforms may face challenges during this transition, others like Nordic Arbex are poised to thrive by aligning with regulatory requirements while still delivering value to their users. Conclusion The impending delisting of USDT by major exchanges such as Coinbase underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the critical importance of regulatory compliance. For investors seeking stability and high returns on their USDT investments, Nordic Arbex offers a compelling solution. By continuing to support USDT and providing attractive returns, Nordic Arbex stands out as a platform committed to its users’ success amidst industry changes. Invest in your future with Nordic Arbex.

While altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) are garnering attention with analysts indicating that prices may rise, there’s another coin entering the fray. 1FUEL’s one-click cross-chain transactions and blistering presale price projections could see it eclipse its rivals in commanding fashion. Simple, secure and user-friendly, 1FUEL’s revolutionary privacy-focused cryptocurrency could well go scorched earth on DOGE and BONK and leave both firmly in the shadows. Will DOGE fade in the face of uncertainty? While DOGE prices have risen in 2024 and did spike 150% in the aftermath of the U.S. election (helped along the way by public support from the self-titled ‘Dogefather’ Elon Musk) the memecoin has struggled to sustain its upward trajectory at times. It’s fair to say that DOGE ’ s ability to rally is still up for debate. Newer altcoins are striving to truly innovate and bring value to the space, while DOGE is heavily reliant on the influence of the controversial Tesla / X boss and now political advisor. Bonk prices remain highly unstable Like DOGE , BONK has struggled to remain consistent, with price rallies followed by dips. Achieving mass adoption and creating sustained, widespread market demand remains elusive, meaning BONK’s gains are likely to be very slow. Despite hype that it could hit $1, DigitalCoinPrice, Wallet Investor, Coincodex and Changeally are all in agreement that it won’t happen anytime soon and a huge leap in value remains very unlikely. 1FUEL has the potential to overshadow both DOGE and BONK 1FUEL is the new privacy-focused cryptocurrency on the block and is already garnering significant attention. Unlike DOGE and BONK which have thus far relied on meme hype and celebrity endorsement to create a buzz, 1FUEL has much more solid underpinnings which set it up for longer term success. Instead of relying on the cult of hype like BONK and DOGE, 1FUEL brings some credentials and innovations to the table. It couples unparalleled automation, with ease of use and robust security measures. It effortlessly handles cross-chain and peer-to-peer transactions with a game changing hassle-free trading style. 1FUEL also works in the background to identify the best exchange rate and minimize fees for users. No other wallet gives users the same degree of freedom and simplicity – but it hasn’t overlooked the importance of privacy and security either. Its privacy mixer, independently verified smart contracts, multi-layered security architecture, disposable wallets and data minimization policy keep assets secure while also safeguarding user privacy. Presale predictions confirm 1FUEL as the next breakout altcoin 1FUEL is focused heavily on making a strong case for user adoption with notably higher levels of utility than both DOGE and BONK. As a result, its presale predictions are staggering, with experts seeing massive growth potential and returns of at least 500%. Those expectations only grow after the presale period with analysts additionally forecasting that 1FUEL will surge by as much as 100x after its public launch. This, coupled with its commitment to removing the technical barriers to trading, mean that it is in line for wider levels of adoption, demand and support than its rivals, setting the stage for it to eclipse DOGE and BONK as the new altcoin on the market. Join the presale The 1FUEL presale is happening right now with early investors set to benefit from crypto staking rewards of 30% APR. Don’t miss your chance to secure 1FUEL tokens at the lowest price before the public launch. Join the presale right now to experience firsthand those projected returns of 500%!

However, the standout among the best crypto to buy now has been the new GambleFi brilliance of Rollblock. Rollblock is making waves in the GambleFi sector, integrating gaming and DeFi with a unique revenue-sharing model. So, sit tight as we explore the best crypto to buy now as another bull run nears. Why Rollblock’s GambleFi revolution makes RBLK the best crypto to buy now The global online gambling industry is worth over $500 billion annually, while DeFi boasts over $118 billion in total value locked. Rollblock sits at the powerful intersection of these two booming sectors. This iGaming ingenuity introduces a revolutionary GambleFi token that combines blockchain innovation with the appeal of online gaming. Unlike many blockchain projects that rely on promises, Rollblock has already delivered. Its Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino is live, offering more than 7,000 gaming titles. At the core of Rollblock’s success is its deflationary tokenomics. With a fixed supply of one billion tokens, RBLK is safeguarded against inflation, making it inherently more valuable over time. Beyond scarcity, RBLK holders can capitalize on lucrative opportunities like staking and a passive income stream that analysts predict is the best crypto to buy now. Over $6.7M raised during its presale and a price surge of 350% demonstrate the market’s confidence in this project. Stellar Lumens gains institutional interest. XLM price eyes further uptick Stellar Lumens has also been making waves as an excellent pick for the best crypto to buy now. The XLM price hasn’t failed to impress. After a 170% surge to a yearly high of $0.55, analysts are already eyeing a retest of its May 2021 ATH of $0.79. Stellar’s ecosystem expansion has also been impressive. Record-breaking DeFi TVL and real-world asset tokenization underpin the XLM price rally. Regulatory clarity in the U.S. and speculation about a spot XLM ETF in 2025 add further momentum. While overbought conditions on the RSI hint at potential corrections, a weekly close above $0.50 could validate a bullish engulfing pattern that could pave the way for more XLM price gains. Polkadot 2.0 and rising stablecoin adoption. Why DOT is another best crypto to buy now Polkadot is also stealing the spotlight as it delivers a double punch of rising stablecoin adoption and the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. Right now, the DOT price is breaking new highs, and it’s now experiencing a massive 132% MoM surge above $9. USDC and USDT adoption has surged, with their combined value exceeding $120 million—a testament to Polkadot’s scalability and low transaction costs. The real buzz surrounding the Polkadot 2.0 upgrade has been deafening, too. Key upgrades like Async Backing, Agile Coretime, and Elastic Scaling have promised to pave the way for a better DeFi on Polkadot. Conclusion The crypto market is heating up. Stellar, Polkadot, and Rollblock are proving themselves to be standout opportunities for savvy investors. However, Rollblock shines brightest among the trio, seamlessly merging the $500 billion online gambling industry with DeFi’s immense potential. So, don’t just watch the market evolve—be part of it. Rollblock is currently in presale and selling for just $0.037. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Analysts are predicting some major price moves after the latest developments in blockchain technology. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to jump into the altcoin market, this is it. Leading the pack is Qubetics ($TICS), a groundbreaking project with real-world utility that’s set to skyrocket after its mainnet launch. Joining it on this list are two crypto heavyweights—Ethereum and Solana. Let’s explore why these three altcoins are must-haves for your portfolio right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Real-World Asset Ownership Qubetics isn’t your average altcoin—it’s a revolution in blockchain. At the heart of Qubetics lies Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT), a game-changing application that allows individuals and businesses to tokenise assets like real estate, art, and even machinery. Picture this: A family inherits a house but needs cash. Instead of selling outright, they tokenise it on Qubetics, letting multiple investors buy fractions. Everyone wins—the family keeps part of the property, and investors get a piece of prime real estate. It’s modern finance, simplified. Right now, Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.0282. Over $4.1 million has already been raised, and excitement is growing as analysts predict a potential surge to $15 after the mainnet launch. To put that into perspective, investing $1,000 today could skyrocket to an incredible $530,000. Opportunities like this don’t come around often—don’t miss your chance! 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Unstoppable Smart Contract Giant Ethereum has been the backbone of blockchain innovation for years, and it’s not slowing down. With its smart contract functionality, Ethereum powers decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and thousands of decentralised apps (dApps). Ethereum’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 has made it faster, cheaper, and more scalable. That’s a win-win for developers and users. Whether you’re minting NFTs or trading on DeFi platforms, Ethereum is the go-to network. As we head into 2025, analysts predict Ethereum’s price could soar past $4,500, making it a solid long-term investment. The upcoming Danksharding upgrade promises even more scalability, ensuring Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto world. 3. Solana (SOL): The Speed Demon of Blockchain Solana is the Usain Bolt of cryptocurrencies. With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, it’s become a favourite for developers and traders alike. Solana’s blockchain can handle 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the game. This speed is why Solana is dominating sectors like gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Imagine a world where gaming rewards are instant, NFT trades are cheap, and DeFi doesn’t feel like pulling teeth. That’s Solana for you. Analysts predict Solana’s price could hit $300 in the next bull run. With its ever-expanding ecosystem, Solana is a must-watch for investors looking for high growth potential. If speed, efficiency, and innovation are your thing, Solana is your coin. Its tech is unmatched, and its ecosystem is booming. Don’t sleep on it. Conclusion: Who is the Star of the Show? While Ethereum and Solana bring innovation and speed, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate game-changer. Its ability to revolutionise real-world asset ownership puts it miles ahead of the competition. With its presale price increasing every weekend, the time to act is now. Secure your stake in the future of blockchain. Opportunities like this don’t come twice—don’t be the one left behind.

Sui (SUI) Sui is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed to support global adoption by offering a secure and scalable development environment. It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in existing blockchain architectures. Sui focuses on improving user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions, making applications more accessible and user-friendly. The platform introduces innovations like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks to enhance Web3 usability. These features contribute to its potential in the blockchain space. Whether Sui’s coin is attractive in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions and individual perspectives. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially deployed as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, TRX tokens moved to their own network in 2018. The platform was created to give full ownership rights to digital content creators, enabling them to receive direct rewards from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. By providing a platform for developers to create dApps and share content openly without significant transaction fees, TRON aims to build a decentralized internet. As an alternative to Ethereum, TRON offers opportunities for content creators and developers. In the current market cycle, TRON’s focus on decentralization and support for dApps may appeal to users seeking alternative blockchain platforms. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance integrates traditional finance with blockchain by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets. This method makes high-grade financial products more accessible, utilizing blockchain to enhance financial infrastructure. Ondo’s structure includes an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products and a technology arm that develops decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, improving the functionality and scalability of its offerings. To address trust and security challenges in the cryptocurrency market, Ondo partners with reputable firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for crypto asset custody. It emphasizes transparency and regulatory compliance. A notable product, USDY, offers stablecoin accessibility with yield, secured by US Treasuries and bank demand deposits. The potential of Ondo’s coin and technology lies in providing non-US investors with regulated and transparent financial products. The attractiveness of the coin in the current market cycle depends on market conditions and individual investment objectives. cat in a dogs world (MEW) MEW is a cryptocurrency that presents itself as a “cat in a dogs world,” setting it apart from the numerous dog-themed coins in the market. It seeks to offer an alternative by introducing unique features and a distinct branding approach. MEW aims to attract users who are looking for variety beyond the typical themes found in other coins. In terms of potential, MEW’s unique positioning might appeal to a niche audience interested in new and different concepts within the cryptocurrency space. Evaluating its attractiveness in the current market cycle involves considering market trends, the coin’s technology, and how it differentiates itself from others. MEW’s success may depend on its ability to offer value and innovation compared to existing options. Conclusion SUI, TRX, ONDO, and MEW are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth with a unique, community-driven blend of memes and sports.

The cryptocurrency is now heading toward its next major price targets. However, in the short term, XRP is experiencing resistance. XRP Breaks Above $2 and Faces Resistance Over the past day, XRP has experienced a significant price increase, surpassing $2. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, once XRP breaks above this level, it tends to make a swift move upwards. The next key level of resistance is $2.50, which XRP has already approached. If XRP can successfully push past $2.50, the next target will likely be $2.75, based on previous price action from January 2018, when XRP experienced key weekly closes in that range. However, at the time of writing, XRP is up by more than 11 percent and is trading at $2.73 levels. $3 Target: Psychological and Fibonacci Resistance Looking further ahead, the next significant price target for XRP is $3. This level represents both a psychological resistance and a key Fibonacci extension point, specifically the 1.618 level. The $3 mark is often viewed as a milestone for many traders, and it is highly likely that XRP will face resistance at this level. However, before reaching $3, XRP needs to break through the resistance zones at $2.50 and $2.75. These are critical levels that could determine whether the cryptocurrency will continue its upward trend or face a potential pullback. Support Levels in Case of Pullback In the event of a pullback, there are two major support levels that traders will be watching closely. The first is at $2, which has already shown some strength as a support level. If XRP were to experience a deeper correction, the next support level would be around $1.60, a level where previous resistance is likely to turn into support.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 03:24:43

ETH is showing bullish signs and might soon aim for a move above the $3,680 resistance zone. Ethereum started a downside correction and retested the $3,550 zone. The price is trading above $3,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could restart its increase if it clears the $3,650 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Upward Move Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,800 resistance zone and corrected some gains like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $3,650 and $3,600 support levels. It even retested the $3,550 support level. A low was formed at $3,557 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $3,600 and $3,620 levels. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,762 swing high to the $3,557 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,650 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,685 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,762 swing high to the $3,557 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,750. A clear move above the $3,750 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $3,920. Another Slide In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,600 level. The first major support sits near the $3,580 zone. A clear move below the $3,580 support might push the price toward the $3,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,440 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,350.

37159666,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656374,1733196607,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-continues-bitcoin-buying-streak-15400-btc-added-this-monday/,"As November concludes and December begins, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has significantly accelerated its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions , slightly surpassing the milestone of 400,000 BTC in its portfolio. This purchase surge comes just over a month after the company announced ambitious plans to raise $21 billion through stock sales to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. $1.5 Billion From Stock Sale Into Bitcoin In the past week alone, MicroStrategy sold 3.7 million MSTR shares , generating approximately $1.5 billion in proceeds, which were promptly reinvested into Bitcoin. This marks the fourth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases by the company. According to Bloomberg data , MicroStrategy has approximately $11.3 billion remaining in stock issuance under its at-the-market share program. This initiative is part of a broader goal to reach $21 billion in funding through fixed-income securities by 2027. The most recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), shows that the company acquired 15,400 Bitcoin from November 25 to December 1, at an average price of about $95,976 per token. Since November 11, the company has invested over $13.5 billion in BTC in three batches, bringing its total holdings to approximately $38 billion, or 402,100 BTC as of today, at an average purchase price of $56,658 per coin. Crypto Mining Firms Shift Strategies MicroStrategy’s aggressive purchasing strategy has attracted attention from other companies looking to replicate its success. For instance, MARA Holdings , a cryptocurrency mining company, announced on Monday that it had acquired $618 million worth of Bitcoin over the past two months. The company is also pursuing a $700 million convertible senior note offering, with plans to allocate some of the net proceeds towards further Bitcoin purchases. This trend is notable, particularly as crypto mining stocks have struggled this year, especially after the Halving of Bitcoin rewards in April. This event has prompted miners like MARA to adopt a treasury strategy focused on accumulating Bitcoin rather than selling it. Despite experiencing a 44% drop earlier this year, MARA’s shares have rebounded and are currently up 8% year-to-date. Similarly, Riot Platforms, another mining company , has announced plans to temporarily halt the sale of mined BTC in order to increase its holdings after seeing its share value drop 20% this year, following a significant 59% drop in September. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $95,180, down 1.6% in the 24-hour time frame. This has been a continuous pattern over the past 10 days, as the BTC price has been consolidating between $91,000 and $98,000, failing to retest its record high of $99,540 and the evasive $100,000 milestone.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 04:02:00
37160457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621705,1733198566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37160457.jpeg,OpenAI may be open to using advertising to raise revenue from its ChatGPT,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-open-to-advertising-revenue/,"OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT, is reportedly playing around with the potential of introducing advertising as a new revenue stream for its AI tool. If it went forward with this plan, it would be a complete reversal from its initial premise for one of the world’s most valuable AI companies. OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, confirmed that the company is open to exploring advertisement as a way to increase revenue in a recent interview with the Financial Times. According to her, OpenAI does not have any immediate plans to implement ads. She also added that the company is still committed to being “considerate” about when and where ads might appear. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October as the Microsoft-backed AI firm’s value went above $150 billion. The company has also found success with its popular ChatGPT. The AI chatbot reportedly has over 250 million active weekly users. Still, the company faces questions about profitability, which has brought on significant financial pressures for many other AI firms. Operating and scaling advanced AI models is expensive, with projected costs for 2024 expected to exceed $5 billion. This year, OpenAI has hired advertising specialists from major tech players like Meta and Google. Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s Chief Product Officer, has extensive experience in ad-supported platforms, having helped develop Instagram’s advertising model. Similarly, Shivakumar Venkataraman, a former leader of Google’s search advertising team, joined the firm earlier this year. OpenAI is exploring its options with advertisement plan For a long time, tech giants like Google and Meta have made money through advertising. However, OpenAI executives are still unsure how to add ads without hurting the user experience. CEO Sam Altman is said to be warming up to the idea, but Friar has pointed out that ad models can bring problems like economic sensitivity and a possible shift in focus from users to advertisers. OpenAI currently makes most of its money from enterprise licensing, paid ChatGPT tiers, and its API, which developers use to create apps based on OpenAI’s models. These revenue sources have been good for substantial amounts, but they may still not be sufficient to offset the company’s huge operational expenditures in the long term. If it eventually decides to move forward with its plan, the company risks upsetting a user base that appreciates ChatGPT’s no ad experience and simple design. It could offer insights into why the company is adding advertising stalwarts to its roster as it carefully balances profitability with innovation. What the future holds for AI With its success, OpenAI is certainly one of the trendsetters in the AI space. While Friar assured users that the company does not have any imminent plans to introduce ads, the suggestion was enough to let speculation linger. The move toward ads could put the company in competition with smaller AI companies like Perplexity , which is already testing ads in its products. If OpenAI eventually goes the ads route, it could radically change the revenue generation template for AI firms. If implemented, the ads may take innovative forms, such as AI-powered personalized suggestions, rather than traditional banner ads seen on legacy platforms. Still, the move won’t be straightforward. Targeted ads often rely on user data, which is a touchy subject for AI users and data privacy regulators, especially in Europe. OpenAI would have to address these worries if it moves forward with this model. If Friar is to be taken by her words, advertising for now remains an idea, not a commitment. However, hiring ad experts like Shivakumar Venkataraman and Kevin Weil may hint at the company giving it a considerable level of thought.

Data from Santiment reveals Ripple’s ( XRP ) active wallet addresses shot up over 116,000, helping XRP’s price rally by over 15% in 24 hours. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency’s market cap hit $155.69 billion, a record high on December 3. The trading volume of the token is up by 93.29% in 24 hours.

Yet, that’s exactly what happened in Turkey. Coinbase, which had big plans for the country just three months ago, suddenly called it quits. So, what went wrong? The answer lies in Turkey’s increasingly tough stance on crypto regulation, and Coinbase isn’t the only one feeling the heat. Turkey’s New Crypto Rules Are Shaking Things Up Turkey’s regulators recently tightened the rules for cryptocurrency firms, making life a lot harder for companies like Coinbase. The country’s Capital Markets Board listed Coinbase as one of 14 companies liquidating their operations. At the same time, some big names like Binance and KuCoin are still pushing through the process, though they’ve had to scale back. To comply, Binance and KuCoin removed Turkish language support and cut marketing to local users. That’s a pretty big deal when you think about it. Imagine running a global business but having to pull back in one of your key regions. It seems like the exchange decided it just wasn’t worth the hassle. Coinbase Has Other Problems to Tackle This isn’t the only challenge the exchange is dealing with right now. Over in Europe, they stopped offering USDC yield programs, blaming new EU regulations. On top of that, Coinbase plans to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) by December 19, 2024. That decision surprised a lot of people, considering their other token, cbBTC, is doing great in the DeFi world with a $1.44 billion market cap. Back in the U.S., Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is focusing on policy. He’s reportedly been chatting with politicians about appointing crypto-friendly leaders, including suggesting Hester Peirce as a replacement for SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Whether that will change anything is anyone’s guess, but it shows the exchange is playing the long game. What’s Next for Coinbase? Here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s rally is bringing retail investors back in droves. In November, Coinbase’s app ranking jumped to ninth place globally. That’s a big win for the exchange, even as they face regulatory challenges. For Coinbase, leaving Turkey might be more about focusing on easier markets. But will this strategy help them stay on top? Or will these constant hurdles take a toll?

Despite underperforming compared to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for most of 2024, Ethereum’s strong fundamentals may set the stage for a potential rally. Why Is Ethereum Struggling? Bernstein Analysts Explain Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap exceeding $430 billion, may be on the verge of significant positive price action. Bernstein analysts suggest that ETH’s fundamentals remain strong despite its underperformance , making it an appealing investment opportunity. To put Ethereum’s performance into perspective, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin and Solana have surged 125% and 122%, respectively, while ETH has only managed a 57% increase. In a client note shared today, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani highlighted several factors contributing to Ethereum’s struggles. One issue is that ETH has not established itself as a store of value to the same extent as BTC. Additionally, the leading smart contract platform faces increasing competition from low-latency Layer 1 blockchains such as Solana, Sui, and Aptos. The note also pointed out that Ethereum’s reliance on Layer 2 blockchains, including Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, often redirects users away from Ethereum’s main chain. This hampers user retention and limits transaction fee growth, creating a headwind for ETH’s price momentum. Is Now The Right Time To Buy ETH? Bernstein analysts argue that Ethereum’s outlook could improve substantially, particularly in light of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Following Trump’s win, the total cryptocurrency market cap has surged over 45%, surpassing $3.5 trillion. Ethereum has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this rally, gaining 46% since the election compared to Bitcoin’s 41% and Solana’s 36%. The analysts also noted key developments that could support Ethereum’s growth moving forward. They highlighted the increasing likelihood of staking yield approval in Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under a Trump-led, crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The analysts explained: We believe, under a new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly SEC, ETH staking yield will likely be approved. The analysts added that Ethereum’s current yield rate of 3% could increase to as high as 4% to 5%, which could be an attractive yield rate for investors in a declining interest rate environment. Further, the recently observed growth in Ethereum ETFs in the form of higher inflows could benefit ETH. Although ETH ETFs had a lukewarm launch, they have recently outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. For instance, on November 29, spot ETH ETFs in the US attracted $332.9 million in inflows, compared to $320 million for Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm in September 2023 and the protocol’s burn mechanism have stabilized ETH’s total supply around 120 million.

He has also taken a firm stand on law firms that hire individuals from the outgoing administration of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who were responsible for maintaining an unclear stand on crypto regulations. Coinbase CEO Lashes Out At Law Firms Hiring Ex-SEC Officials Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has released a public statement on the X platform while taking a firm stand against law firms hiring anti-crypto individuals. Brian Armstrong stated that the crypto exchange has informed that they would immediately terminate any professional relations with legal partners hiring such individuals. In the latest development, Milbank LLP has recently hired the SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal who had previously undertaken huge enforcement actions against the crypto industry. Armstrong criticized the firm for hiring former SEC official Gurbir Grewal, leading Coinbase to cease its association with the firm. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules,” he said. He further stressed that senior officials who were involved in shaping unclear regulatory policies should not claim they were merely “following orders”. Instead, Armstrong pointed out that several SEC members chose to leave during this period, reflecting their disagreement with the agency’s direction. However, he added that he doesn’t believe in permanently canceling people from employment. At the same time, he urged the crypto industry to avoid financially supporting firms that hire them. “Let your law firms know that hiring these folks means losing you as a client,” he wrote. Brian Armstrong Looking Ahead to Pro-Crypto Legislation On the other hand, Armstrong and his team have been looking forward to pro-crypto legislation in the US under President-elect Donald Trump. He and his team are confident that the regulatory landscape will improve ahead building a conducive environment for driving crypto innovation. Two key crypto bills are set to reach US Congress soon. The Republican-backed FIT 21 Crypto Bill , passed by the House earlier this year, aims to establish a legal framework for digital assets. The second, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, seeks to regulate and license stablecoin issuers, and is awaiting approval in a House vote. Moreover, crypto exchange Coinbase has continued to support new digital assets, the latest being the Solana-based MOODENG , leading to a massive 94% surge in its price. This rally has pushed the meme coin’s market cap above $600 million while the daily trading volume has surged by 700% to more than $1.1 billion.

This regulatory progression has intensified market speculation about the stablecoin’s potential mechanisms and strategic positioning within the cryptocurrency landscape. Market analysts and community commentators have proposed intriguing scenarios regarding the potential backing and deployment of RLUSD. Some prominent voices in the XRP community have suggested a novel approach involving Ripple’s substantial XRP escrow holdings as a financial instrument for the stablecoin’s initial reserve strategy. According to market commentator Del Crypto, one speculative scenario involves Ripple using its XRP escrow to establish initial reserves. 911 Alert: $XRP Rumors are swirling thru the cryptosphere that @Ripple might custody its entire $XRP escrow and use it to establish the initial reserve for $RLUSD . If true, this move would enable @Ripple to mint $RLUSD , sell it to ODL partners, and unlock substantial working… — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) December 2, 2024 Vincent Van Code, another prominent community figure, weighed in on this hypothetical strategy, noting that it could enable Ripple to mint RLUSD and distribute it to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners while generating substantial working capital for the company. Potential Ecosystem Implications The proposed strategy could potentially generate significant advantages for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Theoretically, the approach might introduce enhanced liquidity, manage XRP’s circulating supply, and create additional economic dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. The speculation has coincided with a notable price surge for XRP, which recently hit a peak of $2.8487, and is trading at $2.71, with a 40.05% increase over the past 24 hours. This price movement has pushed XRP to heights not seen since 2018, and positioned it as the third-largest cryptocurrency, surpassing competitors like Solana, BNB, and USDT. Van Code believes this strategy could help XRP climb, potentially reaching $1,000. Other experts have recently expressed confidence in this target, but there are some crucial considerations to this rumored strategy. Regulatory Considerations for this Approach Ripple initially promised a different approach to how RLUSD would be backed. Regulators may not like this approach proposed by Del Crypto. The company’s announcement explicitly stated that RLUSD would be backed exclusively by USD deposits, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and cash equivalents. This official stance contrasts with the more speculative community discussions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent XRP community member WrathofKahneman urged caution regarding unverified rumors, emphasizing the potential regulatory challenges of using XRP or any cryptocurrency as collateral for RLUSD. One community member noted that regulatory bodies traditionally prefer established, low-volatility assets for stablecoin reserves. This could potentially complicate the rumored backing strategies. Instead, he proposed a unique approach, suggesting potential frameworks, where traditional cash-backed tokenization could coexist with cryptocurrency-adjacent reserve mechanisms. Considering that regulatory approval is the only roadblock left for RLUSD’s launch, Ripple must navigate these complex backing issues to get the stablecoin through regulators.

However, analysts are still bullish on the token, seeing it as a buying opportunity. At the same time, Stellar and a new altcoin, Cutoshi , have seen huge growth. Solana Dip Provides Great Entry Point Solana (SOL) has been one of the top performers this cycle. However, a recent correction shook up the token, leading to a drop in its rankings. Solana is down 10% in the last seven days, from $253 to $227. The big news this week was that Ripple (XRP) surpassed Solana in market cap. After XRP reached $2, it overtook both Solana and Tether (USDT), reaching the third spot among all crypto assets. This came as a shock to Solana traders, as SOL struggled to overtake Tether. Source: Barchart Despite this setback, analysts are bullish on Solana. For instance, Rekt Capital suggests that Solana could reach $300 by 2025 if it confirms support at $250. With a relative strength index (RSI) at a comfortable 51, Solana is in a strong position to grow. However, other indicators are mixed, with an overall neutral outlook . Stellar Sees Huge Gains Stellar (XRM) has seen huge growth in recent weeks, being one of the best performers in that period. The token saw a 478.36% increase in the last 30 days, on news that institutions are looking into Stellar. The catalyst for the growth was, besides the crypto market rally, a recent filing by Grayscale Investments. The filing revealed that the company’s XLM trust recorded a 10% increase in net assets during the financial year. This indicates strong institutional interest in Stellar. Source: CMC The reaction to the news was strong, with traders bidding up the token to new highs. Jed McCaleb, a founder of Stellar, shared why he thinks the growth came. He pointed out that Stellar does 10x daily transactions compared to Ethereum and called it one of the most underrated projects so far. A lot of new people looking at Stellar so I thought I'd write down some quick thoughts about why Stellar is worth your time. IMHO Stellar is the most underrated and least understood crypto project. A lot of recent attention but people are still sleeping on this network. Stellar… — Jed McCaleb (@JedMcCaleb) November 23, 2024 Still, this huge growth can’t last forever and analysts now believe that Stellar will go into a retracement period . However, if it breaks the resistance at $0.60, the token could test $0.70 soon. On the other hand, if it falls below $0.40 support, it will likely decline to $0.28 or $0.22. Cutoshi Showcases Interest In DeFi Stellar’s huge growth indicates that investors are looking into projects with strong DeFi utility. The recent interest in the memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO) boosts this case. In under a month since its launch, the token raised more than a million in investments. By December 2nd, Cutoshi’s presale investments reached $1.221 million, showcasing the interest in DeFi projects. Notably, while Cutoshi has a cat mascot, it focuses on building a DeFi ecosystem run by its users. The project is building a multichain DEX, with the goal of breaking down barriers to trading. The blend of memes and DeFi aims to make DeFi accessible to more investors than ever. As the crypto market is in a bullish phase, this is an ideal time for traders to start using decentralized platforms like Cutoshi and keep custody over their coins. Stage 4 of the CUTO presale is now live with tokens available for $0.031. The Cyber Monday 20% Bonus is also live for 48 hours.

But what if there is an even bigger opportunity for profits? Now fast attracting interest in the presale stage is Lunex Network (LNEX) , a game-changing decentralized exchange (DEX). Lunex Network is positioned to provide investors not only a chance at strong returns but also a much better DeFi experience as it enhances asset management by smoothly merging cryptocurrencies, equities, bonds, and more. For investors trying to optimize their gains in the coming months, these three players Polygon (POL), VeChain (VET), and Lunex Network could be the next 100x opportunity. Lunex Network (LNEX): The Future of Asset Management Presenting itself as a complete platform simplifying asset administration and transactions, Lunex Network is revolutionizing the DEX sector. Lunex Network aggregates several assets—cryptocurrencies, equities, bonds, ETFs, and more—into one seamless interface, unlike traditional DEXs. By letting investors monitor and manage their whole portfolio from one point of contact, this creative solution simplifies asset management. Focusing on security, efficiency, and simplicity, Lunex Network gives investors the tools they need to focus on optimizing their earnings. With the LNEX token priced at just $0.0033 during its ongoing presale, Lunex Network offers investors an amazing prospect right now. Early adopters who bought LNEX at the initial $0.0012 price have already witnessed an amazing 210% return on investment, therefore demonstrating the platform’s capacity for notable expansion. Now is the ideal time to join the Lunex Network presale and seize this chance for significant rewards given the expected launch price of $0.0216. Moreover, investors are quickly grabbing their slots as more than 2.0 billion tokens have been sold in weeks and over $3.8 million has been raised in presale revenue. Polygon (POL) on the Rise: Can It Reclaim Its All-Time High? Recently, the Polygon price has seen a notable increase— more than 28% in only the past week. The Polygon price suffered negative pressure once it hit the $0.61 mark, which caused a retreat toward the $0.50 support level. But now that the bullish trend is starting to pick up, the Polygon price chart shows that the altcoin is heading into the $0.61 resistance zone. Polygon (POL) has shown a remarkable positive trend during the past month, increasing its price by 70%. This comeback has inspired traders and investors with hope for a possible near-term continuation of increasing momentum. Though trading almost 50% below its ATH of $1.29, attained in March of this year, analysts still see Polygon’s (POL) bright future. They propose that the altcoin might go back to its ATH by the end of 2024 with continuous optimistic momentum. Under this perspective, technical indicators such as the MACD and Moving Averages show positive signals on the Polygon price chart, therefore signifying a robust upward trend. VeChain’s (VET) Bullish Surge: Is a Return to ATH in Sight? With the VeChain price rising by around 30% in the previous week alone, the altcoin has been showing an amazing upward trend that excites investors expecting further gains. The altcoin has seen notable opposition, nevertheless, as the VeChain price moves toward the $0.045 threshold, therefore testing its capacity to keep momentum . VeChain (VET) has seen a notable surge over the past month, exceeding 83%, despite this resistance at $0.045. Though the VeChain price chart shows that the altcoin is still more than 80% below its all-time high (ATH) of $0.278, attained in 2021, this consistent gain has spurred hope in the prospects of VeChain (VET). With the community demonstrating great support for the future of the altcoin, investor sentiment toward VeChain (VET) remains generally positive. Positive momentum shown by technical indicators such as the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages on the VeChain price chart also supports ongoing optimism.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 05:25:00

Hedera Hashgraph, its chain, is considered an alternative to the traditional blockchains that aim to excel in speed, efficiency, and security. With this, the HBAR gains centre stage and remains the top altcoin according to Lunar Crush with the top market and social activity. Now that the HBAR price has erased 1000+ days of downtrend in just four weeks, where will the price find its peak in the ongoing bull run? The sluggish and weak performance of HBAR has irked the market participants, who often complained of poor participation on the governing council. Now that the price has undergone a 7x rally, a new ATH appears to be imminent. But the question arises whether the price rally will remain restricted at $1 or will continue beyond the range, finding new highs in 2025. The long-term price action of HBAR suggests the rally has gained huge momentum and is about to enter the bullish range. The price is about to enter the final resistance zone below the ATH at $0.5701 and also the 0.618 FIB. A rise from these levels does not only help the price form a new ATH but surpass the trend line and enter the bullish range. Besides, the OBV just rose from a prolonged, multi-year stagnant trend with a massive rise in volume. This suggests the price has just begun with the bull run, activating the higher price targets. The next levels to look out above the ATH could be around 1.2 FIB at $0.715 and later at 1.6 FIB at $0.910. These are the important levels to achieve, which may further push the price beyond $1. Meanwhile, the monthly RSI has entered the overbought range and marked the 2021 highs, suggesting a small pullback could sweep out the selling pressure if any. In such cases, 0.5 FIB, the current resistance level between $0.38 and $0.455, may act as a strong support zone, which may further trigger a healthy rebound. Therefore, the Hedera (HBAR) price rally appears to be primed to mark $1, probably in the early few weeks of 2025 and if the market sentiments remain bullish, an extended rally may assist the price to peak at $1.2 to $1.5.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 05:25:49

Projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started as jokes but quickly became serious contenders, proving the meme coin revolution is no laughing matter. Recently, Fartcoin and Turbo have joined the hype, and analysts are predicting big things for these quirky coins. But that’s not all. A new player has entered the game: BTFD Coin , a meme coin ready to set the market on fire with its innovative perks and lightning-fast growth. Let’s break it all down and see why BTFD Coin is the hottest thing in crypto right now. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is stealing the show in the meme coin universe. Since its presale launch on November 26, 2024, it’s made massive waves. With a presale starting at $0.000004 per coin and a listing price of $0.0006, BTFD Coin promises juicy returns. Currently, in Stage 6, the presale price is $0.000058, with over $500,000 raised in the first week and 15 billion coins sold. Why’s everyone jumping in? Three words: Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and an unrivalled community vibe. These features make BTFD Coin more than just a meme coin; it’s a serious investment opportunity. Analysts predict that as the presale journey progresses through its 16 stages, the price will surge further. If you’re still not convinced, here’s a quick math teaser. Suppose you invest $4,000 at Stage 6 at the price of $0.000058 per coin. You’ll snag 69,048,060 BTFD Coins. Once listed at $0.0006, those coins would be worth $41,428.83. That’s a return you don’t want to miss. Fartcoin: From Farts to Fortune? With a name like Fartcoin, you’d think it’s all a joke, but it’s far from that. Fartcoin has quietly been building a dedicated fanbase, thanks to its focus on transparency and community engagement. Trading at $0.000000001471, it’s got a long way to go to compete with the big boys, but its low entry price makes it tempting for those who love high-risk, high-reward plays. While Fartcoin isn’t breaking records like BTFD Coin, it’s carving out a niche with its quirky marketing and active social media buzz. That said, without features like staking or gaming incentives, it feels more like a hit-or-miss bet. Could it blow up? Maybe. But if you’re looking for a safer meme coin with strong ROI potential, BTFD Coin’s presale might be a better shot. Turbo: Speeding Through the Crypto Scene Turbo is the rebel of the meme coin gang. Unlike traditional meme coins, Turbo positions itself as a utility token with actual use cases in decentralised finance. This hybrid identity has made Turbo popular among investors who love memes but also want something tangible. According to a recent article on TechPoint Africa, Turbo’s ecosystem is designed for long-term growth. With solid backing and an active dev team, Turbo is more than just hype. However, it doesn’t have the instant thrill of a low-price entry like BTFD Coin, nor does it offer the same explosive presale momentum. Turbo is a great choice for those who like to play it cool, but if you’re here for the adrenaline, BTFD Coin takes the crown. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out The crypto market is crowded with meme coins, but BTFD Coin is doing things differently. With its unique blend of gaming, staking, and a powerful community, it’s redefining what a meme coin can be. In just over a week, it’s raised more than $500,000 and hit Stage 6 of its presale, selling over 15 billion coins. The buzz around BTFD Coin isn’t just hype. It’s backed by solid growth metrics, an innovative roadmap, and a community that’s in it to win it. If you’re looking for Top Trending Meme Coins This Month, BTFD Coin is the one you can’t afford to miss. Conclusion BTFD Coin is the standout winner among these meme coins. It’s got the growth, the features, and the FOMO factor to make it a top pick. Don’t let this presale slip through your fingers—join the BTFD Coin presale now and ride the wave to potential profits.

Shiba Inu’s price rallied last week but is now entering a short-term consolidation phase with an 8.74% intraday decline. Meanwhile, analysts are shifting their attention towards low-cap altcoins like Lunex Network (LNEX) amidst the ongoing altseason hype. Since Lunex Network is already poised for 1,800% gains within the next few months, traders are currently rushing to purchase LNEX tokens before the price rallies any further. Dogecoin (DOGE) Prepares to Retest $1 Resistance by Early 2025 Dogecoin’s long accounts have reached the 92 nd percentile over the last 3 months. Dogecoin’s price has also experienced its highest monthly close which is making analysts optimistic about Dogecoin surpassing the $1 milestone. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.4197 after an intraday crash worth 1.36%. Dogecoin’s RSI and Stochastic RSI are currently in the neutral zone which typically indicates that momentum is gearing up for the next rally. Dogecoin’s volume has also surged by 136.59% over the last 24 hours which suggests high buying pressure. If Dogecoin bulls can push the price towards the nearest resistance at $0.68696, Dogecoin is likely to test the $1 level by early 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Consolidates After Last Week’s Rally Shiba Inu recently reached a new peak at $0.00003 which was its highest level since April. This uptrend was fueled by Shiba Inu’s massive token burn strategy which surged past 7,400% over the last few months. Even whales have shown increased interest in Shiba Inu by accumulating $9.8 million worth of SHIB tokens in a span of two weeks. Alongside this increased investor confidence, Shiba Inu’s Shibarium network has also recorded 541 million transactions in record time. Despite this positive momentum, Shiba Inu’s price has entered a consolidation phase today with a 8.83% decline over the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu is currently trading for $0.0000292 with a minor 5.94% decline in its trading volume. Lunex Network (LNEX) Outshines Memecoin Market with 175% Price Jump Aside from these meme coins, another token that is gaining traction in the crypto DeFi space is Lunex Network (LNEX). By integrating the most attractive features of decentralized and centralized exchanges on a single network, Lunex Network is making it easier for traders to execute cross chain transfers. With the crypto market expected to grow exponentially in 2025, analysts are expecting Lunex Network’s price to skyrocket towards the $1 milestone in early January. The key driver behind Lunex Network’s rapid adoption is the platform’s strategy to integrate the latest Web3 technology on its noncustodial ecosystem. Since Lunex Network has strategically combined features of decentralized and centralized trading, the platform allows traders to make cross chain transfers without having to connect any third party wallets like MetaMask or PhantomWallet. Aside from making trading easier, Lunex Network is also giving investors a consistent source of passive income through its revenue sharing model. Every week, Lunex Network reinvests up to 18% of its exchange revenue into open market buybacks of the LNEX token that are all distributed as staking rewards. Since traders can start earning these rewards in as little as 30 days, both retail and institutional investors are flocking to Lunex Network to purchase tokens before the price skyrockets. Lunex Network’s price has already jumped by 175% from its initial price of $0.0012. Since LNEX tokens are still available for a low price of just $0.0033 each, now is the best time to invest in Lunex Network before the highly anticipated 20x rally before the end of Q4.

However, while the websites are blocked, their apps still work, leaving many questioning how effective this move is. Why the Crackdown? The Cambodian government is under pressure to address its reputation as a hotspot for cybercrime and crypto-related scams. Reports from the UN Office on Drugs & Crime revealed that criminal groups in Cambodia exploit cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering and dark web transactions Adding to this, a Chainalysis report highlighted over $49 billion in crypto transactions tied to Huione Guarantee, a key player within the Cambodian conglomerate Huione Group. Cambodia Gov Targeting Unlicensed Platforms The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) issued a directive on November 20, blocking 102 websites. While many targeted platforms were linked to online gambling, the inclusion of Binance and other major crypto platforms surprised many. The TRC explained that these platforms didn’t have proper licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator (SERC). Binance has partnerships in the country, including a 2022 agreement with SERC to assist in developing crypto regulations. Binance also provided training on crypto-related crime detection to Interior Ministry officials in mid-2023. Despite these actions, Cambodia’s relationship with Binance makes the situation more confusing. Limited Licensed Options Currently, only two companies are authorized to operate digital asset businesses under Cambodia’s “FinTech Regulatory Sandbox” program. Even these licensed companies can’t convert digital assets into local or foreign currencies, limiting their use. Crypto Demand Remains Strong Despite the crackdown, Cambodia remains a significant player in the global crypto landscape. It ranks among the top 20 countries for retail crypto usage per capita, with centralized exchanges handling 70% of transactions. Broad-based restrictions often fail where organic demand and practical applications exist,” noted Chengyi Ong, Chainalysis’s head of Asia-Pacific policy. This sentiment suggests that Cambodia’s crypto market may adapt and continue to thrive, even under tighter regulations.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 05:33:29

Following an astonishing return of 297% in November 2024, XRP has skyrocketed to its highest levels since 2017, igniting a wave of optimism among analysts who are now setting ambitious price targets for the altcoin. This surge in value is not just a fleeting moment; it suggests a broader trend of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency space. In addition, WisdomTree has recently joined the expanding roster of asset managers that are filing for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move is in response to the increasing demand for regulated investment products that are directly tied to XRP, indicating a shift in how institutional investors are approaching the cryptocurrency market. As interest continues to build, the landscape for XRP and similar assets is evolving rapidly, promising exciting opportunities ahead. XRP Soars in November, Achieving Record-Breaking Gains Since 2017 XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, has been the talk of the town in November 2024, registering a monumental 297% monthly return on investment (ROI), its highest since December 2017. The token's November close at $1.95 not only marks a seven-year high but also a decisive breakout above its 2021 peak, solidifying its bullish trajectory. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has surged an additional 14%, further fueling market speculation. Analysts now believe this altcoin has the potential to reach unprecedented levels. Jacob Canfield, an independent crypto trader, has set an ambitious target of $6.60 for XRP, citing Fibonacci extensions and historical performance relative to Bitcoin during previous market peaks. Highlighting Bitcoin’s current value—approximately five times its 2017 price when XRP reached its previous all-time high of $3.40—Canfield explained: “This would put the price around $6.60, exactly 2X the value of its previous high. I think this is probably the ideal FOMO target and would stop thinking double digits or higher and is very logical.” Similarly, Tony Edward, founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, has placed XRP’s potential target between $5 and $8, while recommending a more conservative profit-taking strategy. Neel, a crypto educator, pointed out that XRP's rally is a signal of increasing retail investor participation, driven by heightened media attention and its appeal to mainstream audiences. On-Chain Data Reveals Whale and Retail Accumulation XRP’s price surge has been mirrored by robust on-chain activity. Data from analytics platform Santiment reveals that XRP wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens have accumulated 679.1 million XRP—valued at $1.6 billion—over the past three weeks. Additionally, the number of non-empty XRP wallets has surpassed 5.5 million for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s eight-year history. This surge in wallet activity suggests a growing interest among both retail investors and whales, further supporting the bullish momentum. XRP’s futures market has also seen remarkable growth, with open interest (OI) reaching a new all-time high of $3.99 billion as of Dec. 2, 2024. This represents a staggering 100% increase from Nov. 28, when OI stood at $2.06 billion. The combination of rising spot accumulation, increased futures activity, and surging trading volumes paints a clear picture of the renewed interest in XRP among traders and investors alike. Ripple's ongoing legal victories and institutional partnerships have contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding XRP. With little resistance remaining on higher time frames, market experts predict a continued upward trend, particularly if XRP can maintain a close above $1.99 by the year’s end. Such a close would mark its highest yearly finish in history, further solidifying its bullish narrative. As XRP’s price and on-chain metrics continue to break records, the altcoin finds itself at a pivotal moment. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its trajectory, citing strong fundamentals, increasing adoption, and growing market momentum. Whether XRP can achieve the ambitious targets set by experts like Jacob Canfield and Tony Edward remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: XRP is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, captivating investors and traders worldwide. WisdomTree Files for a Spot XRP ETF, Joining Growing Industry Movement Meanwhile, WisdomTree, a prominent asset manager and one of the first companies to issue a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States earlier this year, has taken another major step in the cryptocurrency space. On Dec. 2, WisdomTree filed a Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot ETF backed by XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency. This move positions WisdomTree as the fourth company in the United States to file for a spot XRP ETF, reflecting a burgeoning interest in XRP-based investment products. The proposed fund, named the WisdomTree XRP Fund, is designed to give investors exposure to XRP’s price performance. Shares of the fund are expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. According to the filing, the fund will create and redeem shares using a cash-create method or in exchange for cash. WisdomTree may explore an in-kind model, which could allow for more efficient share transactions, pending additional approvals from regulatory authorities. In its filing, WisdomTree revealed that affiliates of Coinbase Global, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, will play a pivotal role in the fund's operations. Coinbase will serve as both the XRP custodian and the fund’s prime execution agent, ensuring seamless management of XRP transactions. The filing emphasized Coinbase's critical role in the US spot XRP exchange-traded product ecosystem. WisdomTree has a history of relying on Coinbase for cryptocurrency custody and execution, including its WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), which debuted alongside other Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, 2024. WisdomTree’s filing adds to the growing competition among asset managers vying to launch the first spot XRP ETF in the United States. Three other firms—Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares—have already submitted their own filings with the SEC. Bitwise: Bitwise was the first to file for a spot XRP ETF, submitting its Form S-1 on Oct. 2. The company is no stranger to the ETF market, having debuted its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) earlier this year. Canary Capital: Following Bitwise’s lead, Canary Capital filed for the Canary XRP ETF on Oct. 9. The firm has positioned itself as an emerging player in the cryptocurrency investment space. 21Shares: In partnership with ARK Invest, 21Shares filed its Form S-1 for the Core XRP Trust on Nov. 1. Unlike the other ETFs, this trust does not provide direct exposure to XRP but offers investors an opportunity to access the market indirectly. The flurry of XRP ETF filings comes at a pivotal time for Ripple and XRP. XRP recently reclaimed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, buoyed by its legal victory against the SEC and a series of bullish market developments. The interest in spot XRP ETFs indicates a growing demand for institutional-grade investment products tied to cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Analysts believe that a successful launch of a spot XRP ETF could further solidify XRP’s position in the market and attract a broader base of investors. Regulatory Hurdles Remain While the interest in spot XRP ETFs is mounting, the approval process remains uncertain. The SEC has historically been cautious with cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation, liquidity, and custody solutions. However, the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year suggests a shift in the SEC’s stance, raising optimism for XRP-focused products. If approved, WisdomTree’s XRP ETF and similar offerings could serve as a significant catalyst for XRP adoption. By providing investors with a regulated and accessible way to invest in XRP, these funds have the potential to drive liquidity, increase market participation, and bolster confidence in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. WisdomTree’s filing for a spot XRP ETF sheds some light on the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. With several firms now competing for SEC approval, the race to launch the first US spot XRP ETF is heating up. As regulatory developments unfold, the launch of such a product could mark another milestone for both XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Investors and industry observers will undoubtedly be watching closely as the SEC evaluates these groundbreaking proposals.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 05:34:01

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw $6.4 billion in November inflows, driven by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Marathon Digital invested $600 million in Bitcoin between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30, while MicroStrategy further solidified its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with a 15,400 BTC purchase last week. Silk Road Bitcoin Moved to Coinbase Prime Wallet The United States government moved approximately $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) that was seized from the Silk Road marketplace to a Coinbase Prime wallet, according to blockchain records and data from Arkham Intelligence . On Dec. 2, a wallet linked to the U.S. government transferred around 19,800 Bitcoin, valued at close to $1.9 billion at the time, to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. This Bitcoin was originally seized during a 2021 investigation into James Zhong, who was later convicted of wire fraud connected to the Silk Road. US Government transferring Bitcoin to Coinbase wallet (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) The Department of Justice announced in 2022 that more than 50,000 Bitcoin were confiscated from Zhong, including some that was stored on a single-board computer hidden under blankets in a popcorn tin. While the authorities have moved many of these coins across wallets, the U.S. government still holds about $18 billion worth of Bitcoin. It remains unclear whether this recent transfer is part of a broader strategy to sell or trade the funds. Discussions among lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Donald Trump, have raised the idea of establishing a ”strategic Bitcoin reserve” for the United States. The U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the seizure of cryptocurrencies and other criminal assets, announced a partnership with Coinbase Prime in July for the custody of such tokens. This happened despite Coinbase facing a civil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June of 2023. The Silk Road marketplace was once a hub for illicit transactions involving weapons, drugs, and stolen credit card information, and was dismantled after the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015, and has since received a lot of support from the crypto community for a commutation of his sentence. President-elect Donald Trump also pledged to commute Ulbricht’s sentence on the first day of his second term. Bitcoin ETFs See $6.4 Billion Inflows in November In November, United States investors channeled close to $6.4 billion into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). During this month, Bitcoin’s market price also surged by 45% to reach new highs. The month-long rally saw Bitcoin prices climb from $68,000 to $99,000, thanks to very strong bullish sentiment. Spot BTC ETFs collectively attracted $6.87 billion in investments , offset by outflows that totaled $411 million. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dominated the inflows by securing $5.6 billion and accounting for almost 87% of the monthly total. Other major contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with $962 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF with $211.5 million, and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF with $71.2 million. These figures proved just how much investor confidence in Bitcoin’s price trajectory is growing. Outflows were primarily driven by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, which saw $364 million withdrawn, followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF with $40.4 million and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund with $6.8 million. Despite these outflows, the market maintained its strong optimism. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index also hit a yearly high of 92 on Nov. 22. While the index dipped slightly in December, it still reflects overwhelmingly positive investor confidence. Marathon Digital Invests $600M in Bitcoin ETF investors were not the only ones who stocked up on Bitcoin recently. Marathon Digital invested more than $600 million in Bitcoin over the past two months, according to a filing with the United States SEC on Dec. 2. The company revealed the acquisition of 6,484 Bitcoin between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30 at an average price of $95,352 per BTC. This amounted to a total cost of $618.3 million. Marathon also announced plans to issue $700 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031 through a private offering. The proceeds will be used for additional Bitcoin purchases and repurchasing existing convertible notes due in 2026. Some public companies that own BTC (Source: BiTBO ) As the largest publicly traded crypto mining company by market cap, Marathon Digital is the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after MicroStrategy, according to BitcoinTreasuries. On Nov. 26, the company called for the United States to accelerate its Bitcoin accumulation strategy as it believes in the importance of securing Bitcoin reserves for economic and national security. Marathon compared the importance of holding Bitcoin to maintaining gold reserves, and argued that these assets provide stability in the event of declining confidence in the dollar. Despite advocating for Bitcoin accumulation, Marathon sold 63% of its mined Bitcoin in May of 2024, very shortly after Bitcoin’s fourth halving reduced the mining block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The sale involved 390 Bitcoin out of the 616 BTC that were mined that month. While President-elect Donald Trump promised to add Bitcoin to the U.S. Treasury reserve, some experts, like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, are skeptical about the likelihood of a Bitcoin strategic reserve being established during his term. MicroStrategy Bought 15,400 BTC in a Week MicroStrategy also boosted its position as a leading corporate Bitcoin holder by buying 15,400 BTC between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, funded through $1.5 billion raised from a stock sale under its at-the-market equity program. The purchase was completed at an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the United States SEC. During the same period, MicroStrategy sold 3.7 million shares of its Class A common stock, which generated $1.48 billion in net proceeds to fund the acquisition. As of Dec. 1, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries hold a total of 402,100 BTC, which is valued at close to $38.4 billion at current market prices. The firm spent $23.4 billion on Bitcoin purchases at an average price of $58,263 per coin, which is a 64% gain on its investments. This latest acquisition happened after an even larger purchase the week prior, when the company bought 55,000 BTC for $5.4 billion at an average price of $97,862. That transaction was funded through a combination of a private offering of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2029 and proceeds from the equity program. In addition to expanding MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor urged Microsoft to also adopt a similar Bitcoin-centric strategy. Saylor pitched the idea to Microsoft’s board, and claimed the tech giant could increase its market cap by almost $5 trillion by aggressively adopting Bitcoin. He suggested Microsoft convert its dividend payouts, stock buybacks, cash flows, and debt into Bitcoin, which he argued could add hundreds of dollars to the company’s stock price and create trillions of dollars in enterprise value.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 05:49:53

Peterson, who is known for developing a unique economic metric called the Secular Market Indicator, shared his concerns in a public statement that sparked controversy among investors. Peterson introduced his Secular Market Indicator six years ago in the Journal of Wealth Management. The metric is designed to gauge whether the economy is poised for long-term growth or stagnation, and the analyst claims it offers insights that go beyond traditional tools like the Shiller P/E ratio or the Buffett Indicator. Peterson criticized these older models, claiming they “went bankrupt in 2008” and can’t provide meaningful forecasts today. In contrast, Peterson’s model uses gold as a fundamental variable and treats it as a proxy for tangible assets such as commodities, as opposed to paper-based investments. Related News: XRP Price Nears the $3 Mark - What's Fueling the Mega Rally? Why is XRP Rising? Peterson announced that the Secular Market Indicator was “fully triggered” again for the first time since 2021. He claimed that stocks would not exceed an average annual return of 5% for the next decade and that a major market crash could occur within the next two years. Drawing parallels with past economic crises, Peterson draws attention to the bear markets in 2022, 2008 and 2000. Predicting that the first signs of a decline could appear as early as the summer of 2025, the author warns investors not to underestimate the speed at which such events will occur. Peterson’s bearish outlook also extends to the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. He recalled Bitcoin’s performance during previous market crashes, such as the one in 2022, warning that this cycle “may be no different.” *This is not investment advice.

This includes chip equipment maker, Naura Technology Group. According to a Reuters report , the United States launched its third such major sweep on Chinese chipmaking since 2018. The new plan imposes restrictions on Chinese chip toolmaking companies such as Piotech, ACM Research, and SiCarrier Technology. The package will limit China’s progress in developing AI-related technology by limiting the transfer of advanced memory chips and additional chip-making tools. The latest effort can decelerate China’s access to technologies that would reinforce its military or compromise U.S. security. The restrictions are especially concerned with chips made to use in artificial intelligence. This also includes other advanced chipmaking equipment that use high bandwidth memory. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says that this restrictive action would limit China’s semiconductor capability and therefore its military modernization. 20 semiconductor companies, two investment companies, and over 100 AI chip makers are included in the list U.S. companies including Lam Research, KLA, Applied Materials, and Dutch firm ASM International are likely to be impacted. More than 20 semiconductor companies, two investment companies, and over 100 chipmaking toolmakers are included in the list. One is Swaysure Technology, which is tied to Huawei and has already come under severe U.S. sanctions, and another is Shenzhen Pensun Technology. U.S. suppliers also now need special licenses to do business with those firms added to the Entity List. In a regular press briefing on Monday, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said these restrictions are against the norms of global trade. They will also disrupt the supply chains. He also added that China will protect the rights of its companies.

Expert Sets Timeline For 3 Digits,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-prepares-for-parabolic-surge-expert-sets-timeline-for-3-digits/,"XRP has been at the center of attention recently due to significant market movements and optimistic projections from analysts. The asset recently achieved a notable milestone by surpassing its 2021 peak of $1.96, a development that has sparked excitement among investors. XRP’s current price of $2.71 represents a 37.01% surge in the past 24 hours, with its peak reaching $2.8487. This surge has also pushed it above Solana, BNB, and USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency. JackTheRippler, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a detailed chart showcasing XRP’s potential for a parabolic surge. He predicts that the asset could achieve triple-digit values, signaling unprecedented growth for XRP. According to the chart, XRP has historically experienced significant upward trends following prolonged consolidation periods, and the current setup appears to mirror past patterns. #XRP prepares for a parabolic surge. We could see 3 digits next year! pic.twitter.com/7DCM7MtPxq — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 1, 2024 The Impending XRP Bull Run Renowned trader Peter Brandt recently noted the importance of XRP breaking through the $1.96 level , suggesting it was a key resistance point. Now that this milestone has been surpassed, the possibility of a major rally becomes increasingly likely. This sentiment aligns with JackTheRippler’s analysis, which suggests that XRP is on the verge of a significant upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation about the broader regulatory and political environment in 2025 is also boosting optimism. Over the years, XRP’s legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have shaped its trajectory. However, this could soon change as SEC Chair Gary Gensler leaves office on January 20. Experts believe the coming crypto-friendly SEC Chair will end Gensler’s long-running war against crypto. Gensler’s departure would create a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, speculation about policy changes under Donald Trump’s administration in 2025 fuels positive sentiment among investors. How High Can XRP Climb JackTheRippler is confident that XRP will triple digits in 2025. According to his chart, he expects the digital asset to reach $271.16, an astonishing 9,906% increase from its current price. JackTheRippler has previously shared extremely bullish expectations for XRP. In October, the analyst predicted that the digital asset would climb to $40 by the end of 2024, and at its current pace, it might achieve this on its way to $271.16.

The European Central Bank may drop offline digital euro payments if it can’t agree with smartphone makers on secure chip integration. In a digital euro progress report published on Dec. 2, the central bank has emphasized that secure elements — specialized hardware chips embedded in mobile devices — are essential to ensure offline transactions can be conducted safely and reliably. The ECB detailed ongoing discussions with device makers and technical service providers to overcome the complexities of deploying offline digital euro solutions. However, without consensus on implementation, the project might eventually face potential delays or a complete scale-back. “Due to its highly controlled environment, deploying an application remotely is complex and involves multiple stakeholders.” The European Central Bank You might also like: Russia’s central banker behind CBDC steps down While the ECB is exploring digital euro features, without agreement from tech partners its offline use could potentially be limited. Thus far, it remains unclear whether the offline feature will advance or stay as a conceptual idea given that the challenge isn’t unique to the eurozone. For instance, Sweden’s Riksbank, in its latest research report , also highlighted the technical and regulatory hurdles for enabling secure offline payments with the e-krona, the country’s proposed central bank digital currency. The Riksbank warned of liquidity risks stemming from unsynchronized balances between offline and online wallets, creating potential usability and security issues for recipients of offline transactions. To mitigate such risks, Riksbank suggested solutions like restricted offline usage or centralized liquidity pools but acknowledged these require further evaluation.

Struggling to pick up pace, the ETH price trend consolidates between 20 and 50 EMA lines in the 4-hour chart. Based on the current price action, a breakout of either EMA line will determine the upcoming trend. Let’s find out more in this Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, ETH price action reveals a rising channel pattern. The support trendline is in confluence with the 100 EMA line of the 4-hour chart. Despite the quick bullish movements in the rising channel, the ETH price failed to breach the critical resistance at $3,750. This has led to the ongoing bearish reversal characterized by a dome-shaped pattern. Tradingview The Ethereum Price had retraced to $3556 last night to test the 100 EMA line and the local support trendline. The price is currently preparing its bullish turnaround in the 4-hour chart. Further, the recovery run is now challenging the 20 EMA line. Technical Indicators: MACD: The MACD and signal lines are in a bearish alignment. However, the declining bearish histograms reflect the average line closing the gap and teasing a bullish crossover.

A bounce from this level could ignite a sharp V-shaped recovery, targeting the $3,759 resistance and reigniting bullish momentum. The U.S. trading session will play a pivotal role, with increased trading volumes and positive sentiment needed to fuel an uptrend. Conversely, failure to hold support could lower the Ethereum Price, potentially retesting $3,382 if sideways action persists. However, a market-wide recovery could see the Ethereum Price break above $3,750. This will set the stage for a rally toward $4,064. Will the bull run in ETH surpass $4,000 in 2024?

The ones that have experienced a huge rise during the 2021 bull run have again started to swell, hinting towards the return of pro-traders. After a magnificent run, the Bitcoin price has begun to remain stagnant a bit. This has enabled the other altcoins to swell, which have attracted massive gains. XRP & ADA prices, for instance, have surged beyond $1 after remaining stuck below $0.4 to $0.5 for quite a long time. Similarly, here are a few more tokens that may achieve the $1 milestone in a short while from now. Polygon (MATIC) The monthly chart of MATIC price suggests the price is about to experience a fine bullish push, which could initiate a 40% rally The conversion & baseline of Ichimoku Cloud are about to validate a bullish crossover, which could further flip the cloud to be bullish Besides, the monthly RSI is incremental and could reach the neckline of the parabolic curve at the upper threshold. Therefore, the Polygon price is expected to break the resistance at $0.75 anytime from now and secure $1 before the end of 2024 The Sandbox (SAND) The SAND price has broken from the multi-year descending pattern, the falling wedge and is accumulating strength for the next bullish wave The buying volume has dropped after a massive rise but the sellers are just restricting below the resistance zone between $0.79 and $0.88 while failing to drag the price lower Besides, the rally continues to remain within the accumulation phase, as suggested as the indicator just triggered a bullish divergence Secondly, the +Di displayed a bearish divergence but no specific movement was seen with the -Di while ADX remained elevated. This suggests the price is preparing for the next upswing beyond $1. Decentraland (MANA) The MANA price is testing one of the crucial resistances within the range of $0.74 and $0.81, which also collides with the 200-day MA. This range also collides with the neckline of the Adam and Eve chart pattern, which includes a v-shaped recovery followed by a parabolic curve. Besides, the RSI is about to re-enter the overbought zone, which may end up in a small pullback Therefore, the MANA price could rise beyond $1.1 and face a pullback to the zone, followed by a healthy rise towards the higher targets Algorand (ALGO) Algorand price has reached levels not seen since November 2022 and hence the token is expected to remain elevated as buying volume has increased heavily Besides, the RSI has entered the overbought zone and shows no signs of deviation, but after some point, the levels have to face rejection Therefore, the price is expected to reach $0.82, which may attract some bearish activity but the current support zone between $0.39 and $0.45 or a little higher, could offer a base to trigger a strong rebound With this, the price may remain elevated and mark $1; meanwhile, if the resistance at $0.66 holds the rally, the bearish narrative may fade off Other than these tokens, the two altcoins that are very close to reclaiming $1 are Mantle (MNT) & Ethena (ENA).

The upcoming US president promised to launch a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile, which will add to the existing BTC holdings. The creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States will kickstart a global movement, which will heighten the overall demand. Furthermore, more countries around the world have a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 100 percent, led by Japan and the United States, which is not sustainable in the long haul. US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve According to Denis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, there is a high chance that strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation will pass at the state level before the upcoming Trump administration gets to implement a similar policy. However, Porter noted that Trump could issue an executive order in the first week he gets into office, which could give the federal government a head start. I can now officially confirm and announce that 10 states will be introducing ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserves’ legislation here in the great United STATES of America. We are going to win with Bitcoin. We will lead the world. No one will come close. The word will follow our lead. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 3, 2024 Already, Porter confirmed that 10 different states in America have already laid out plans to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve. To facilitate the legislation process, Porter has requested the crypto community to donate to the Satoshi Action Fund. Meanwhile, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has cautioned crypto investors to keep their hopes low on the strategic BTC reserve. Furthermore, Schiff believes that the bill has no huge support other than Senator Cynthia Lummis and Ro Khanna. Impact on BTC Price I am more and more convinced that one day it will be virtually impossible to buy Bitcoin. We are painfully early. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 2, 2024 The imminent adoption of Bitcoin by nation-states, amid the ongoing mainstream adoption by institutional investors, will trigger a huge demand vs supply shock. As a result, Porter is of the opinion that it will be virtually impossible to purchase Bitcoin in the future.

According to a report by Nikkei Asia , these exchanges include industry leaders Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. The Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) implemented the restrictions due to the platforms’ lack of proper licensing from the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC). Cambodia blocks 102 domains The crackdown extends beyond cryptocurrency, with TRC acting chairman Srun Kimsann signing a directive that blocks 102 domains. They have primarily targeted online gambling operations. While website access has been restricted, mobile applications of these platforms remain accessible to users. The restrictions come as a surprise given Binance’s established presence in Cambodia. It also includes a 2022 memorandum of understanding with SERC focused on digital currency regulation development and a partnership with the Royal Group, a major Cambodian conglomerate. Binance spokesperson Lily Lee acknowledged the situation, noting that multiple platforms were affected and that they are “closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Cambodia maintains an important crypto position Despite the regulatory challenges, the Asian country maintains an important position in the global crypto landscape. It ranks among the top 20 countries for retail crypto adoption per capita, according to Chainalysis . Centralized exchanges facilitate 70% of the country’s cryptocurrency transactions, highlighting the potential impact of these restrictions. Currently, only two companies have received authorization under SERC’s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox program. These licensed entities can trade digital assets but face restrictions on exchanges involving the country’s legal tender – the riel and US dollars – or other fiat currencies. The regulatory action follows increased scrutiny over crypto-related criminal activities in Cambodia.

Under the partnership, Ethena will integrate Derive's basis trading, options, futures and vaults, leveraging Ethena's USDe stablecoin and staked USDE to boost liquidity and trading volume, the press release shared with CoinDesk said. Ethena will begin its basis trading on Derive’s perpetual markets, pending approval from the Ethena Risk Council. That's expected to boost volumes and liquidity on Derive, bolstering Derive users' ability to execute large orders at stable prices.In conjunction with this, the Lyra Foundation, which oversees the Derive protocol, will receive a multi-million dollar grant from the Ethena Foundation, and staked ENA (sENA) holders will be rewarded with 5% of the DRV tokens granted to the Ethena Foundation. The ENA token is a governance token for the Ethena ecosystem. “Integrating Ethena’s immense liquidity and strong user base with Derive.xyz’s unparalleled derivatives protocol not only unlocks significant opportunities for Derive.xyz users, but also positions it as the premier on-chain derivatives platform,"" Nick Forster, Founder of Derive.xyz, said.

CoinShares interpreted this figure as profit-taking after BTC tested the key psychological level of $100k. Short-Bitcoin products saw a modest inflow of $0.5 million during the past week. On the other hand, altcoins mostly attracted inflows, including Ripple’s XRP. According to the latest CoinShares report , Ethereum saw inflows totaling $634 million, reflecting a dramatic shift in sentiment that has driven its year-to-date inflows to $2.2 billion, surpassing its 2021 record of $2 billion. XRP experienced inflows of $95 million, the largest on record, likely due to the hype surrounding the possible launch of a US ETF. Closely following XRP were Cardano and Chainlink, with $0.9 million and $0.8 million in inflows, respectively. Litecoin, however, saw a modest $0.2 million in inflows during this period. Meanwhile, multi-asset products and Solana experienced outflows of $16.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Zooming out, digital asset investment products attracted a total of $270 million in inflows last week, revealing an unusual contrast in asset flows within the class. Although US ETFs began offering options, despite high initial volumes, ETP volumes have not seen a similar increase, with last week’s total at $22 billion compared to $34 billion the previous one. Inflows this year have reached a record-breaking $37.3 billion.

While big buyers like MicroStrategy are still active, other cryptocurrencies are seeing more attention. The U.S. government’s recent transfer of nearly 20,000 Bitcoin to Coinbase has raised eyebrows, with many experts calling it a bad move, especially as Bitcoin’s global importance grows. Why Are Experts Criticizing This? Jason Lowery, a US Space Force engineer, labeled the move a “huge strategic mistake,” arguing that Bitcoin’s value goes beyond price. He compared the sale to an act of ignorance, warning that the government might regret it later. Lowery even suggested a scenario where the government might reverse course, recalling historical decisions like Executive Order 6102, which forced Americans to sell their gold to the government in the 1930s. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined the critics, stating that selling Bitcoin makes little sense. Crypto educator Toby Cunningham called it short-sighted, adding, “If they sell, the market will absorb it instantly.” Was It Really a Sale? As of now, it’s not clear if it was an actual sale or not. According to Spot On Chain, a crypto analytics platform, the transfer could be related to managing or consolidating Bitcoin wallets rather than liquidating assets. Julio Moreno from CryptoQuant added that only 10,000 BTC might have been sold, while the rest—around 9,800 BTC—was sent to a new wallet. In contrast to earlier sales, which caused sharp price drops, this move only led to a minor dip in Bitcoin’s price to about $95,800. Despite the transfer, the U.S. government still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, approximately 183,850 BTC, worth $17.7 billion, largely seized from operations like the takedown of Silk Road Crypto Impact When the transfer was detected, Bitcoin prices briefly dipped by almost 3% to $94,500. However, the market quickly recovered, with Bitcoin trading around $96,000 at the time of writing. Analysts are closely monitoring whether Bitcoin can push past the important $100,000 mark or if the rally will be limited by profit-taking and investors spreading their capital into other assets. Is Crash on Horizon? With this sudden sell-off plan, there is also a rumor that President Joe Biden might sell off a large amount of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings before leaving office to make it harder for President-elect Donald Trump to create a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve, as he promised during his campaign. The U.S. holds a lot of Bitcoin because of its efforts to seize assets from illegal activities. If Biden sells this Bitcoin, it could limit Trump’s ability to use it for his reserve without needing extra funds. Some people believe Biden has used similar tactics in other areas, like foreign aid, to block Trump’s plans. Will this move break the current bull run?

An 89.5% growth in just one week? Unbelievable! But what if I say that something even more exciting is happening in the XRPL-based meme coin market? Excited to know more? Then, read on! XRP’s Rise and Meme Coin Gains Like I mentioned before, XRP has witnessed significant growth lately. In the last 30 days, with a surge of 441.5%, it has outperformed all the other top ten cryptocurrencies, triggering excitement among XRP enthusiasts. At the time when the crypto world is discussing excitedly about the enviable performance of XRP, a totally unexpected trend has emerged in the XRPL-based meme coin market. The trend has truly left most meme coin enthusiasts speechless with excitement. Some XRPL-based meme coins, including ARMY, BEAR and MAG, have shown impressive growth lately. ARMY’s Spectacular Growth Considering that the meme coin market has dropped by at least 4.2% in the last 24 hours, the general trend in the market appears ‘less bright’. However, the same is not the case when it comes to the XRPL-based meme coin market, implying that at this moment, this market is more tempted to follow the XRP trend than the general meme coin trend. In the last 24 hours, ARMY, one of the most prominent XRPL-based meme coins, has seen a rise of 50.2% – far higher than Dogecoin’s -2.4%, Shiba Inu -0.1%, Pepe’s +0.2%, Bonk’s +0.2%, and dogwifhat’s 2.35. Indicating a notable growth in market activity in the ARMY market, ARMY has experienced an excellent surge in trading volume of at least 48%. XRPL Meme Coins Gaining Momentum ARMY is not the only exceptional player in the XRPL-based meme coin market. If it were, the trend could have been ignored as a one-time wonder. The story of BEAR is not different. With a massive 30-day rise of 395.6%, it has expressed its solidarity with ARMY. Notably, in the last 14 days alone, the BEAR market has witnessed an increase of 224.4%. There is no wonder about reports citing an increase in users moving from Solana and Etheruem to XRP Ledger. Volume Comparison and Market Concerns Can this be interpreted as XRPL taking over the meme coin market? Well, that sounds like an exaggeration. Data indicates there is still a long way to go for the XRPL market if they really want to become a market leader. The volume analysis is enough to reveal this reality. The daily trading volumes of the top meme coins like Dogecoin ($11,929,910,703), Shiba Inu ($3,149,361,501), Pepe ($4,666,566,941) and Bonk ($754,672,721), are far higher than ARMY’s $74,388.56 and BEAR’s $2,085,276. XRP’s Market Achievement At this stage, it is important not to ignore the achievements the XRP market has recently made. The most important of which is its rise to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing Tether. It seems that speculations regarding the launch of XRP ETFs and reports regarding improving regulatory clarity are offering the necessary optimism that the market needs to grow higher and higher.",News|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 07:28:13

Why? Well, for starters, this isn’t just any routine appointment. Trump promised to kick out Gary Gensler , the current SEC Chair, on his first day back in office—and Gensler has already announced he’s stepping down. So, who’s going to take the reins? And what could this mean for crypto’s future? Gensler’s Era: Love It or Hate It Let’s talk about Gary Gensler for a sec. During his time at the SEC, he really went all-in on crypto regulation. Some people loved that he cracked down on fraud and made things like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs a reality. Others? Not so much. His “regulation-by-enforcement” style rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, especially those who think the U.S. should be leading in crypto innovation—not scaring companies away. With Gensler out of the picture, Trump has a big chance to shift gears. Pro-crypto voices are already buzzing about what comes next. Will the SEC finally focus on clarity and innovation? Or are we just trading one set of problems for another? Who’s Likely to Land the Job? Okay, here’s where it gets interesting. Prediction markets like Kalshi are pointing to Paul Atkins as the frontrunner. This guy is all about innovation and seems to be the polar opposite of Gensler. He’s pushing for clear, pro-business crypto rules, and honestly, that’s music to a lot of ears in the industry. But he’s not the only name being thrown around. There’s Dan Gallagher, Mark Uyeda, Robert Stebbins, and Heath Tarbert, too. Solid contenders, sure, but none have the same buzz as Atkins. Trump’s transition team is apparently in the final stages of picking someone, so we’ll know soon enough. What to Expect If Atkins—or someone like him—gets the job, we could see a huge shift in how the U.S. handles crypto. Instead of enforcement crackdowns, we might get clearer rules that help companies innovate without fear. That could attract more businesses and investors to the space, which is a win-win, right? But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Politics is messy, and big promises don’t always pan out. Still, for now, all eyes are on Trump’s announcement. Could this be the moment that changes everything for crypto?

XRP Whales Have Made Big Purchases In Last Few Weeks According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment , the XRP whales have been busy buying recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “ Supply Distribution ,” which tells us about the total amount of the cryptocurrency that a particular wallet group is holding. Addresses or investors are put into these cohorts based on the number of coins they carry in their balance. For instance, the 1 to 10 coins group includes the holders who own at least 1 and at most 10 tokens of the asset. In the context of the current discussion, the 1 million to 10 million coins group is of interest. The lower end of this range converts to around $2.39 million and the upper one to $23.9 million. Given this massive size, only the big-money investors would be able to become a part of this group. The range doesn’t cover the entire whale cohort, only the smallest of these humongous entities. Nonetheless, the investors part of this cohort still make up a key part of the market, so their behavior can be worth keeping an eye on. One such way to do so is through the trend in their Supply Distribution. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how this indicator’s value has changed for these whales over the last few months. As is visible, the XRP Supply Distribution for this whale cohort has registered a considerable increase recently, which implies these investors have been participating in net accumulation. More specifically, the group has added 679.1 million tokens of the asset to their holdings over the last three weeks. At the current exchange rate, this converts to about $1.65 billion. Given this steep buying, it’s not a surprise that the cryptocurrency’s price has been enjoying bullish momentum. Also, considering that the Supply Distribution of the whales has only been continuing to rise, the coin may also see a further increase. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another indicator: the Total Amount of Holders . This metric keeps track of the total number of XRP addresses that are carrying a non-zero balance. The Total Amount of Holders has gone up by 119,820 in the same period as the whale accumulation, so it’s not just been the big-money investors coming into the market; the retail investors have also been flooding in. Following this latest increase, the non-empty XRP addresses have broken the 5.5 million mark for the first time ever in XRP history.

US Government Moves 10,000 BTC To Coinbase",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-a-bitcoin-sell-off-coming-us-government-moves-10000-btc-to-coinbase/,"As the Bitcoin price consolidates just below its all-time high of $99,540, a significant move by the US government has raised concerns among investors. The government has transferred a substantial amount of its seized Bitcoin holdings to Coinbase, potentially signaling intentions to sell. This echoes similar actions that had previously impacted the market earlier this year. US Government’s Bitcoin Transfer According to market intelligence firm Arkham, the US government moved approximately 10,000 Bitcoin, worth around $1.92 billion at current market prices, to two separate wallets. One wallet contains Bitcoin valued at $969 million, while the other holds approximately $949 million. This strategic allocation has drawn attention, especially given the government’s history of selling seized Bitcoin, which can create notable selling pressure in the market. Data from crypto analytics firm Dune indicates that the US government currently holds a staggering 183,422 BTC, valued at over $17.6 billion. This accounts for roughly 0.93% of the total Bitcoin supply. Should the government decide to sell a portion of these holdings, it could exert significant downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, reminiscent of previous sell-offs that followed major transfers. A Halt To Government Sales In 2025? Historically, such actions have led to increased volatility. For instance, NewsBTC reported in April, when the Bitcoin price peaked at $73,700, that the government transferred over 30,000 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road marketplace. This followed a previous seizure of more than 50,000 BTC from James Zhong, who allegedly obtained these funds through illegal means related to the Silk Road in 2012. Following these transfers, Bitcoin experienced substantial price fluctuations and a downward trend over the subsequent months. In 2022, the government also sold 9,800 BTC, with plans to divest an additional 41,500 Bitcoin. This history raises concerns that the latest transfer could lead to a similar outcome, potentially jeopardizing Bitcoin’s recent upward price momentum. However, there are emerging hopes that such moves could be curtailed in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to assume office on January 20, and he has proposed a strategy that includes making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the US. This approach would involve the government purchasing nearly 1 million BTC rather than selling its current holdings, with plans to use these assets to help reduce the nation’s $36 trillion national debt. This proposal has been introduced in Congress by US Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis under “the Bitcoin Act,” which has garnered bipartisan support . With the recent shift in leadership from Democrats to Republicans securing a majority in the House, there is optimism that this bill could come into effect in the second or third quarter of 2025. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,000, down 0.7% over the past 24 hours.

This affects both cross and isolated-margin trading options, reducing available pairs for users. The exchange has cautioned users to close positions and transfer affected assets from Margin Wallets to Spot Wallets to avoid potential losses. However, despite the delisting news, coins like Highstreet and Perpetual Protocol have surged by 6% to 12% in price, while AVA, Gitcoin, BAND, and STP recorded modest gains of 1% to 2%. This mixed market response highlights varying investor sentiment across the affected assets. Binance To Delist These Tokens On December 3, Binance informed users about upcoming changes to its margin trading offerings. Several BTC trading pairs, including Band Protocol, Gitcoin, and Highstreet, will no longer be available for cross or isolated-margin trading. According to the announcement, BAND/BTC and GTC/BTC cross-margin pairs, along with isolated margin pairs like AVA/BTC, HIGH/BTC, PERP/BTC, and STPT/BTC, will be removed. The delisting process begins on December 4, 2024, with the suspension of isolated margin borrowing. Full removal, including automatic closure of positions and cancellation of pending orders, will occur on December 11, 2024, at 06:00 UTC. Binance, one of the top crypto exchanges , advises users to act proactively by closing positions and transferring funds to Spot Wallets ahead of these deadlines. While these pairs are being phased out, the underlying assets will still be tradable on other available pairs within the platform. These changes aim to streamline Binance’s offerings and better align with market demands. Price Movements Of The Crypto Amid Delisting November saw a bullish trend in the crypto market, with approximately $1 trillion added in just one month. This surge in market momentum has positively impacted several of the affected assets, despite Binance’s delisting announcement. Band Protocol (BAND) price traded at $1.90, up 4% in the last 24 hours and 22% over the past week. GTC price surged 40% in the past week, reaching $1.20, and has gained 100% over the last month.

In the past month specifically, XRP has appreciated in value by more than 400% making it third largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. With such an unprecedented heightening, Ripple is, however, keen to warn that it has registered a steep rise in cases of fraudulent scams. Ripple’s Stance Against Fraud As a courtesy of social media platform X, Ripple assures its customers that neither they nor founder nor CEO Brad Garlinghouse will ever ask users to send XRP. The message from the firm said , “Ripple will never ask you to send XRP, and neither will Brad, David, Monica, Stu, or anyone else from Ripple.” Stay vigilant!” Ripple has also described its strategy for addressing scams, which involves partnering with law enforcement agencies like the FBI, monitoring fraud-related activities with other experts, and guiding users to report any scam. XRP’s Latest Success Lead To Scammers Targeting Investors The recent upsurge of XRP due to hope in Ripple’s cases against the American SEC and rising institutional adoption also make the token a favourite of fraudsters. The partnerships in cross-border payment solutions and overtures to an XRP-supported exchange-traded fund or ETF have added to the lift of Ripple across the market. However, this surge has also attracted poor-minded people who are aiming to make profits using the increased investment juice such as deep fake, phishing emails and fake giveaway schemes.

Conversely, large outflows from exchanges might indicate accumulation by whales, which could be bullish.

In an effort to regulate the crypto market, Cambodia has blocked access to sixteen major crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX and Coinbase. Nikkei Asia reported that the exchanges failed to secure licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator, which is necessary for operating in the country. The ban is placed across 102 domains, among which most are related to online gambling tied to crypto exchanges by the Telecommunications Regulator of Cambodia on Nov. 20. These exchanges are reported to be operating without the proper licenses and authorizations required by Cambodian law. While the websites are placed under the ban, mobile applications are still functional. This ban might be put in place to cater to the growing population of digital asset users in the country, which is expected to rake around $8 million in 2024, according to Statista . The Digital Assets market in Cambodia will reach $8,031,000 in revenue in the next year, although growth is anticipated to taper off through 2025.

Additionally, the company partnered with the Royal Group, a significant business conglomerate in Cambodia, to add force to blockchain adoption and also trained the country’s Interior Ministry officials in Jun. 2023 on detecting crypto-related crimes.

The Bitcoin price soared close to $100K and the older altcoins, which remained silent for quite a while, became active. This was followed by a huge rise in market sentiments and a massive influx of volume. Now that both appear to have halted for a while, the question arises whether the bulls are about to experience extreme fatigue in the coming days. If so, what’s next for the ongoing bull run? Apart from many things in common, the current bull run is showing some dissimilarities too. The traders have become more vigilant now as they are extracting profits after a brief rally followed by some relaxation phase. The BTC price is the best example, which is stuck within a range after experiencing a 65% to 70% drop in the trading volume. Currently, popular altcoins like XRP & ADA are attracting huge volume, which has kept the price elevated, but this Santiment data shows the trend could fade soon. The above chart shows the ratio between the positive and negative sentiments of BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, & XLM. Soon after Donald Trump’s victory, the ratio of Bitcoin spiked heavily, close to 60%, while the average range was around 20%. Besides, the sentiments of altcoins also surged to some extent but quickly faded out. This suggests the euphoria from a week ago is showing trader fatigue. Despite the massive growth in XRP, XLM, or ADA prices, the traders have gone quieter a bit after taking profits in late November. The markets now appear to have been moving in the opposite direction of the expectations. Therefore, as per Santiment, the silence towards the top caps should be considered an encouraging sign that FOMO won’t be interfering with any further upswing in the coming days. Hence, the markets may witness a calculated approach for the upcoming bullish action, excluding the euphoric sentiments.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 07:56:13

Analysts Warn of Sharp Correction,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-crash-to-0-60-analysts-warn-of-sharp-correction/,"The post XRP Price Crash to $0.60? Analysts Warn of Sharp Correction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has once again drawn attention from the crypto community, not just for its recent price surge but also for concerns about its centralized token supply. According to Crypto analyst IncomeSharks, over 43% of XRP tokens remain locked and are not in circulation, raising fears of a sharp drop back to $0.60 soon. 43% XRP Held By Ripple In a recent tweet post, IncomeSharks pointed out that nearly half of XRP’s total supply remains locked away. Ripple, the company behind XRP, controls 38.9 billion tokens in its escrow accounts . This level of centralization has raised worries among investors about the potential for manipulation. https://twitter.com/IncomeSharks/status/1863717475168424230 “Imagine if you were on Pump Fun and saw the developer owned 43% of supply,” the analyst remarked, drawing parallels to tokens with high centralization, which often trigger concerns about manipulation. XRP Price To Plunge To $0.60 To support his critique, IncomeSharks shared a chart showcasing XRP’s historical price trends. The chart reveals a familiar pattern, sharp price spikes followed by steep corrections. In April 2021, XRP soared to nearly $2 but lost 75% of its value within two months. Similarly, after hitting $3.40 in 2018, the token plunged by 92% shortly after, suggesting its price is heavily influenced by speculative trading. Recently, XRP surged to $2.74 , marking an impressive 410% rise in just one month. Meanwhile, the chart hints at another possible correction to $0.60 a drop of almost 4x from its current price level, following past patterns. Pump-and-Dump Allegations IncomeSharks pointed out that XRP is often criticized for its frequent price jumps followed by steep drops, known as pump-and-dump cycles. A big reason for this concern is that Ripple still holds a large amount of XRP tokens, which gives them significant control over its supply. There’s a reason why many in the crypto space don’t trust this token,” IncomeSharks added, reflecting the general skepticism in the community",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 07:57:49

Analyst Jason Pizzino tells his 121,100 followers on the social media platform X that peak cycle highs may still be a ways off for assets like stocks and crypto. “When we take a broad look at the market there are still a lot of investors that are thinking the stock market, real estate and crypto gains so far are ‘too good to be true’ and this time they’re going to get out before the crash. This is NOT how macro, end of cycle tops are formed. The 18-year cycle ‘Everything Bubble’ peak still has more time to develop and bring major FOMO (fear of missing out) unlike what we have seen.” The analyst predicts that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other assets are gearing up for additional rallies in the bullish market cycle. “Bitcoin, real estate, stock markets and altcoins are setting up for the biggest pump in history. I think it has already started, but there are still plenty of investors asking, ‘When will it start?’ Look around, the markets have been up for years and don’t look like they will stop any time soon. Especially not now that we have a perfect ‘This time is different’ scenario brewing within US politics.” He also says that Bitcoin may now be on the verge of entering an explosive phase of the market cycle based on historic precedence. “The Bitcoin four-year cycle has officially entered the right side of the cycle, which means this is a strong market. Three out of the current four cycles have fooled the majority of people into thinking the cycle would end early, aka a left-translated cycle like in 2011, 2019, and most recently 2024. Each time, Bitcoin has gone on to make a new all-time high in the second half of the four-year cycle, the ‘right’ side. This now means we enter what I’m calling ‘The Final Boss,’ or ‘Grand Final.'” Source: Jason Pizzino/X Bitcoin is trading for $95,799 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 08:12:00

In a recent X post , Armstrong warned that the Coinbase team will immediately cut ties with law firms that hire people who have committed “bad deeds” against the crypto industry while under the Biden Administration . He believed that law firms are still unaware of the crypto industry’s stance on the previous administration His declaration followed a recent case where Milbank, a law firm based in New York that Coinbase worked with, hired ex- SEC chief Gurbir Grewal as a partner in its New York office. Gurbir was head of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement for three years before stepping down on Oct. 11. Armstrong stated that Coinbase has terminated its partnership with Milbank and refuses to work with the law firm for as long as Gurbir is still a partner at their office. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules. If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders,” Armstrong wrote in his post. We've let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs.

He believed that officials who were responsible for trying to destroy the crypto industry should be held accountable for their actions. “We as an industry should not be putting money in their pocket after the abuse. Let your law firms know that hiring these folks means losing you as a client,” he said, adding that these figures should find work in other fields, as he does not believe in “permanently cancelling people.” Throughout his tenure at the SEC, Grewal has led the government agency to more than $20 billion in civil penalties and over 2,400 lawsuits. On the day of Grewal’s departure, the SEC announced that he authorized more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms, digital asset operators, and virtual currency purveyors for allegedly breaking federal securities laws. Coinbase amidst the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ The SEC under Biden’s Administration has been accused of being fiercely anti-crypto, going so far as waging a “war on crypto.” Up until October 2024, there have been eight lawsuits with settlements valued at $19.45 billion aimed at crypto firms under the Biden Administration. Compared to last year, the value has increased by 78.9% compared to the previous year. In March 2023, the SEC sent a notice to Coinbase, informing the exchange that it planned to take enforcement action, alleging the exchange of violating several securities laws. The exchange fired back at the regulator by filing a lawsuit to compel the commission to respond to a request for new rules for the cryptocurrencies. However, the SEC asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, citing a lack of obligation. In June 2023, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and its related entities, but did not name Armstrong or other executives.

This represents a notable 31.1% increase in its circulating market cap quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) compared to Q2. The XRP price also experienced a significant increase of 28.5% during the same period. However, with the recent victory of President-elect Donald Trump and a clearer horizon on the regulatory front in the US, these metrics have fallen short, with the last three weeks’ rally being the largest in nearly 7 years. XRP Sees 94% Surge In Daily Transactions Research firm Messari and its Q3 report show that the recent momentum can be attributed to several key developments. Most notably, asset management firm Grayscale launched its XRP Trust in September, giving accredited investors a new way to gain exposure to XRP. This development, along with S-1 filings by exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares and WisdomTree to launch XRP ETFs in recent months, underscores the growing institutional interest in the token. In Q3, several key network metrics reversed previous declines. Average daily transactions soared by 94% QoQ to reach 1.7 million, while new addresses increased by 10% to 105,000. However, the increase was largely driven by microtransactions (transactions involving less than 1 XRP), which Ripple’s report noted were associated with a spam messaging campaign. Notably, this increase in new addresses contrasts with a 34% year-over-year decline in quarterly new addresses from Q3 2023 to Q2 2024. Despite the uptick in certain metrics, total active addresses fell by 3% QoQ, driven by a 20% decrease in active sending addresses, while unique receiving addresses rose by 7%. Price Nears 2018 Record High Payment transactions also displayed remarkable growth, increasing by 110% QoQ after experiencing declines in the previous two quarters. This surge followed a significant spike related to inscription activities that began at the end of 2023. In addition to payment transactions , NFT-related activities on the XRPL also saw notable changes. NFT minting and burning transactions increased by 93% and 148%, respectively, while NFT creation and offer acceptance transactions saw slight declines. Despite this, if going deeper into the Q4 data, XRP has seen its most notable uptrend in years, with its market capitalization soaring by nearly $130 billion in just three weeks, making it the third largest digital asset on the market, just behind Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Its price has clearly followed suit, with a colossal 432% uptrend in the past few weeks to a current trading price of $2,71 per token, close to the record high of $3,040 reached during the 2018 bull run, and now with only a 20% gap between the current price and the all-time high. Overall, the data from Q3 and part of Q4 paints a picture of a growing and evolving XRP ecosystem characterized by increased transaction activity, institutional interest, and a commitment to improving XRP’s value proposition.

Cardano breaks $1 for the first time since 2022 amid bullish momentum, while memeFi token Cutoshi emerges as a high-upside alternative. Table of Contents Cardano sees huge gains Can Cutoshi reach $1 from its current $0.0259 level? With the crypto market riding the bullish wave, Cardano is seeing some major gains. The token has reached multi-year highs, breaking $1 for the first time since 2022. However, there’s a new token, Cutoshi , that is seen as a promising alternative with significant upside. Cardano sees huge gains Cardano (ADA) has been one of the strongest performers this cycle. Currently in 8th place among crypto assets, the token saw a 239.59% increase in the last 30 days. Cardano is currently a multi-year of $1.20, boosted by major developments in the markets. The crypto bull rally has been one of the main contributors to Cardano’s rise. However, what was even more impactful was what was driving the bull rally. Notably, Cardano is one of the tokens that stands to benefit the most from the coming major shifts in US regulations. Source: CMC Most recently, traders are bracing for potential Cardano spot ETFs in the United States. So far, the SEC’s Gary Gensler was a major roadblock for that development. The SEC Chair was reluctant to approve spot altcoin ETFs, citing high risks and potential for manipulation. However, with his resignation, the agency is likely to take a new course. What is more, the incoming US administration will likely be much more favorable to crypto regulation. As an established project, Cardano stands to benefit a lot from the regulatory change. With regulatory clarity, institutions are likely to pour new capital into credible projects like Cardano. This is also reflected in the technical analysis of the token. Momentum indicators all suggest a strong buy, with moving averages trading far below Cardano’s current price . This suggests a strong outlook for Cardano in the near future. Can Cutoshi reach $1 from its current $0.0259 level? Cardano is a strong contender in the crypto space. However, investors who are opting for high-risk, high-reward plays are looking at Cutoshi (CUTO) as an alternative. This memeFi token is attracting attention from traders who value a strong technical foundation and utility. This combination is proving strong, as Cutoshi reached $1.2 million in presale investments in December. Cutoshi is a token that combines memecoins with DeFi. Its mascot is the Chinese Lucky Cat, a symbol that is recognized throughout the world. At the same time, its inspiration is Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary Bitcoin creator. Like Satoshi, Cutoshi is focused on decentralization and digital freedom. At the heart of its mission is creating a decentralized ecosystem run by its users. Its multichain DEX wants to make DeFi more accessible than ever, offering a secure way for investors to handle their crypto. Security is key, as DEXs enable traders to retain the custody of their coins, securing them from misuse. If Cutoshi succeeds in its mission, it has the potential to join the top 200, or even 100, crypto projects. At current prices, this would mean it has a real shot at $1. Currently trading at $0.031, the bullish case for the token would mean a significant upside. To learn more about Cutoshi, visit the official website.

The popular meme coin recently surged by 20%, reaching new price highs and fueling investor optimism. With the crypto market experiencing a December rally, SHIB appears poised for further gains. This breakout could begin a significant price rally, with the potential for the token to double in value soon. Could Shiba Inu Price Double Soon? The Shiba Inu price is gaining attention as it approaches a crucial resistance level that could determine its next major move. Currently facing a stiff resistance level near $0.00003250, SHIB has shown steady consolidation, building momentum for a potential breakout. If it successfully surpasses this resistance, analysts predict the price could rally by 83%, doubling its current value. This potential move comes as SHIB mirrors historical patterns of sharp upward trends following prolonged accumulation periods. Shiba Inu price is attracting attention as trading volumes rise and its community continues to lend strong support. The broader cryptocurrency market rally, marked by Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing $95,000 and Ethereum (ETH) climbing past $3,600, is expected to amplify SHIB’s upward momentum. TradingView SHIB’s price action may see double-digit gains as market conditions remain favorable. The significant burn activity within the SHIB ecosystem is also contributing to its optimistic outlook. According to Shibburn data, over the past 24 hours, SHIB recorded a staggering burn rate increase of 3,162.%, with 2,022,950,833 tokens burned. This reduction in circulating supply could play a vital role in boosting the token’s value. The surge in SHIB coincides with gains in other popular meme coins , such as Dogecoin price , Pepe (PEPE), and WIF. Their upward trajectories indicate growing investor confidence in meme-based digital assets. Shiba Inu Price Eyes For A Break Out The recent SHIB price hovered at $0.0000295, reflecting the growing optimism across the broader cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu is targeting a critical resistance level at $0.00003. If this resistance is successfully flipped, the SHIB price prediction could surge to $0.00004 within the week. Conversely, failure to overcome the $0.00003 resistance could result in a pullback to $0.0000295. Such a retracement would erase recent gains and test SHIB’s investor confidence. The MACD indicator signals minimal momentum, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line, hinting at a potential upward bias. The Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 44.43, indicating strong trend strength. This suggests that if a breakout occurs, it could lead to a decisive movement in either direction. SHIB Price Chart By TradingView To sum up, the Shiba Inu price momentum, coupled with favorable market conditions and increased token burns, positions it for potential exponential growth. With key resistance levels in sight, a breakout could trigger significant gains, doubling its value and rewarding optimistic investors.

Between the high-end steak and well-aged wine, Trump reportedly suggested that Canada should consider becoming the 51st state of the United States if it can’t manage its economy under his looming 25% tariffs. “If your country can’t survive unless it’s ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion, maybe it should become a state.” – Donald Trump With three-fourths of Canada’s exports dependent on the U.S. market, Trump’s threat was a potential death knell for Canada’s economy, forcing the Canadian leader to start scrambling for solutions. Tariffs: Economic warfare or a dealbreaker? Trump has never hidden his disdain for trade deficits or what he calls “unfair trade practices.” So of course he wants protectionist trade policies. That’s the America First agenda. His latest salvo—a proposed 25% tariff on Canadian goods—was positioned as a response to perceived failures by Canada to control drug smuggling and illegal migration across their shared border. Roughly 75% of Canada’s exports head south of the border, making the U.S. its lifeline. Economists estimate that these tariffs could slash Canada’s GDP by 2.4% within two years and eliminate up to 1.5 million jobs. The Canadian economy could spiral, with effects likely hitting industries ranging from lumber to automotive manufacturing. Trudeau , caught between a rock and a hard place, argued that such tariffs would backfire, hurting U.S. consumers as much as Canadian producers. “These tariffs would kill our industries,” Trudeau reportedly said, emphasizing that costs for American citizens would inevitably rise. Essential goods like timber, steel, and even groceries could see price hikes, making Trump’s tariff plan a political gamble on both sides of the border. Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s Public Safety Minister, labeled Trump’s strategy as “reckless” in Canadian Parliament. “This isn’t just about Canada,” he said. “The U.S. would face supply chain disruptions, higher prices, and industrial slowdowns.” Trump says Trudeau could be Governor Trump’s latest comments, though humorous on the surface, carried a chilling undertone. For a nation as proud of its sovereignty as Canada, the remark was nothing short of incendiary. The US president went even further, offering Trudeau a hypothetical deal: retain his title as prime minister but also take on the role of governor if Canada were absorbed into the U.S. The statement reeked of provocation, which Trudeau countered with a pointed response. While refraining from escalating the rhetoric, he made it clear that Canada wouldn’t entertain such notions. “Canada is a sovereign nation,” Trudeau reportedly said, maintaining a calm but firm tone. Yet behind closed doors, Canadian officials are undoubtedly calculating the potential fallout of a prolonged economic standoff. Implications on the global economy If Trump’s tariffs become a reality, the consequences will stretch far beyond Canada, or even China and Mexico. Economists warn that global financial markets will be caught in the crossfire too. The World Bank estimates that tariffs on this scale could knock global GDP growth down by at least 0.5%, dragging major economies into slower recovery trajectories after years of pandemic-driven uncertainty. Meanwhile, with its own trade relationship with the U.S. already strained, China could be affected as North American tariffs disrupt global commodity flows. At the same time, Canada is exploring diversification strategies, seeking to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market. Trade agreements with the European Union and Pacific nations are back on the table as potential lifelines, though economists warn such shifts will take years to materialize.

Despite massive rallies across the market, the report from Santiment spotlights a surprising level of neutrality in market sentiment, which could allow continued growth as the uptrend matures. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1863843202886672675 Notably, over the past 30 days, major altcoins like Stellar ( XLM ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ) have experienced record-breaking gains. Stellar surged by an impressive 512%, XRP rose 444%, and Cardano increased by 280% over the last month, respectively. Market participants have observed these dramatic price movements, yet euphoria has noticeably cooled after a wave of profit-taking in late November. For context, this profit-taking wave dominated the scene after Bitcoin ( BTC ), the industry’s firstborn, attempted to breach the $100,000 mark. The bearish trend led to a retracement for BTC and the rest of the market, but a recovery has since ensued. You might also like: Over $9m lost in November phishing scams affecting 9.2k victims, data shows Despite the recovery, Santiment’s findings show that the hype surrounding these assets has not transitioned into widespread FOMO. Retail traders appear to have stepped back after capitalizing on earlier gains, leading to a quieter atmosphere. Historically, market trends often move contrary to prevailing trader sentiment. Santiment suggests that the current lack of retail enthusiasm is a positive indicator for further market climbs. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju confirmed this trend last month. The reduced noise surrounding top-performing assets implies that the market could experience sustained upward momentum without the volatility often driven by FOMO-induced buying. This period of neutrality in trader sentiment syncs with historical patterns in which quieter periods have preceded bullish moves. Interestingly, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes BTC could still witness further growth to $500,000, possibly benefiting the rest of the market. Market veteran Michaël van de Poppe holds this sentiment, stressing in a recent analysis that the ongoing bull run is not yet over. A great chart. This bull market is far from over.

IOTA ( IOTA ) rose 46% in the last 24 hours to a six-month high of $0.504, bringing its market cap past $1.7 billion at press time. The gains extended its monthly gains to over 350% while its daily trading volume jumped 83,% hovering over $705 million at the time of writing. The altcoin’s recent price rally was supported by a jump in futures open interest. According to CoinGlass , open interest in the futures market hit a record high of $87.89 million, up over three times from last week’s low of $26.27 million. Why is IOTA rising? IOTA rallied after developers opened the voting process to upgrade the IOTA L1 mainnet to the new Rebased protocol . https://twitter.com/iota/status/1863583910510092773 Rebased is IOTA’s largest upgrade to date, introducing multiple features such as the ability to earn IOTA staking rewards, an initial target inflation rate between 6% and 7%, support for deploying Move-based smart contracts, and full decentralization of the IOTA ledger. IOTA rebased upgrade is expected to reduce transaction costs, introduce an adaptive fee-burning mechanism, and implement sponsored transactions to abstract transaction fees. The voting process for the Rebased upgrade will last for seven days, concluding on Dec. 9, while the counting process will take an additional seven days, ending on Dec. 16. IOTA’s rally comes as the altcoin market is gaining momentum, as evidenced by the Altcoin Season Index at 81, indicating that many altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This surge aligns with heightened optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reaching 76, signaling strong bullish sentiment prevailing in the market.

They predict the altcoin could surge to $0.70 in the short term, followed by a rally to $1 , with a much more bullish mid-term target of $2.60—which would represent a 430% hike from the current price level. Meanwhile, another market commentator observed that IOTA has broken out after two years of accumulation. He anticipates further gains for the altcoin as whales start rotating recent profits from other altcoins into IOTA. Sharing a three-day price chart, he predicted that IOTA could rise to $3.50, provided it successfully breaches the $1 level in the short term. IOTA could pullback before its next move IOTA price, 50-day and 200-day EMA — Dec. 3 | Source: crypto.news On the daily chart, IOTA has moved above both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at $0.1914 and $0.1710, respectively, which have recently formed a golden cross, which can mean a major upside for the altcoin in the near future. IOTA RSI and Stochastic Oscillator chart — Dec. 3 | Source: crypto.news However, the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have reached overbought levels, suggesting that a pullback is likely. Therefore, the altcoin could retreat to retest the support at $0.30 before resuming its upward rally.

A breakout above this resistance could propel the altcoin to retest $1.49, its peak from December 2021.

Ripple’s XRP led the altcoin rally by soaring to a yearly high of $2.80. Other altcoins like DOGE, XLM, ENS, and HBAR also saw impressive gains. This increased activity coincided with South Korea’s decision to delay crypto taxation until 2027. Meanwhile, DWF Labs announced its relocation to Abu Dhabi to expand its Web3 footprint, and Coinbase withdrew its application to enter Turkey’s growing crypto market. South Korean Investors Dive Into Altcoins South Korea's crypto market experienced a remarkable surge after retail trading volumes reached $18 billion in 24 hours. This allowed the crypto market to outpace the nation’s entire stock market by 22%, according to a Dec. 2 report by 10x Research. Markus Thielen, the founder of 10x Research, shared that this was the second-highest trading volume of the year for South Korean retail investors, driven largely by high-momentum altcoins. Among the standout performers, Ripple’s XRP accounted for about $6.3 billion of the trading volume, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) at $1.6 billion, Stellar (XLM) at $1.3 billion, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at $900 million, and Hedera (HBAR) at $800 million. Thielen noticed that these tokens, which are often referred to as “dino coins” by crypto natives because of their longstanding presence in the market, saw big gains over the past week. XRP, ENS , and HBAR surged by about 89%, 74%, and 152%, respectively. BTC funding rate vs Korea crypto trading volumes (Source: 10xResearch ) The report also shed some light on a divergence between Bitcoin's relatively mild funding rate, sitting at 15% annualized, and the explosive trading activity in altcoins. Thielen interpreted this as a strong indicator that the crypto market entered an ”alt season,” where momentum-driven trends dominate trading. Ripple’s XRP has been at the forefront of this rally after it climbed from $0.50 to a new yearly high of $2.80 in just a month. This growth propelled XRP to become the third-largest crypto asset by market cap after it jumped past both Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT). XRP’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) South Korea Delays Crypto Tax to 2027 The rise in altcoin trading may be related to the news that South Korea's crypto tax launch was delayed yet again, and is now set to take effect in January of 2027. The decision was announced after lawmakers reached an agreement to postpone the measure for an additional two years. The ruling People’s Power Party (PPP) secured the delay despite opposition from the Democratic Party (DP), which wanted to amend the tax plan. The DP's proposal to raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders to 50 million won (or approximately $36,000) failed to gain traction, and left the government’s original amendment intact. DP floor leader Park Chan-dae announced the agreement at a Dec. 1 press conference , and mentioned that there is a need for more institutional preparation before taxing crypto traders. Park’s comments agreed with earlier statements from DP leader Lee Jae-myung, who argued that crypto taxation was not yet systematically feasible. The decision now allows the DP to redirect its focus to other legislative battles, including the taxation of dividend income and inheritance tax reforms. Park Chan-dae speaking at the Dec.1 press conference This latest delay was the third time South Korea’s crypto tax was postponed since lawmakers initially approved it in December of 2020. It was originally set to launch in January of 2021, but the tax’s implementation was first pushed back to January 2023, then to January 2025, and now to 2027. The DP recently tried to adhere to the 2025 timeline while raising the tax threshold to align with stock market trading rules, claiming that the majority of investors would avoid taxation under their proposal. However, the PPP resisted these efforts and prevented the rival bill from moving forward. The repeated delays caused a lot of frustration among South Korean crypto traders. One investor even called the situation a “complete mess” and blamed both the government and opposition for poor handling of the issue. However, many crypto investors still welcome the tax postponement. Abu Dhabi Becomes DWF Labs' New Home Crypto is making headlines in other countries as well. Well known Web3 venture capitalist and crypto market maker, DWF Labs, announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Abu Dhabi, UAE. The move was confirmed by founder and CEO Andrei Grachev on X, and its main goal will be to improve the firm's involvement in real-world assets (RWA) and to expand financial services across the Middle East. The company's structure already includes regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, and Switzerland. Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which are both part of the UAE, have been competing to attract businesses by offering unique regulatory frameworks and economic zones. DWF Labs is currently listed as an ecosystem partner of Dubai’s Crypto Centre in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), which houses a number of major crypto companies like Bybit, Solana, and Binance. Ripple also operates in the UAE from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Here it benefits from tailored digital asset regulations introduced earlier this year. Abu Dhabi’s virtual asset ecosystem is concentrated in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), which is a financial hub known for its independent legal framework based on English law and its progressive crypto regulations. It was first introduced in 2018. The ADGM also recently adopted comprehensive DLT Foundations Regulations in 2023. Companies like Blockdaemon, M2, Laser Digital, and even traditional financial giants like BlackRock have established operations there. DWF Labs emerged in 2022 as an offshoot of a high-frequency trading firm, and boasts an impressive portfolio that is valued between $72 billion and $77 billion. It also consists of over 700 projects. Coinbase Abandons Turkish Crypto Expansion Plans Meanwhile, Coinbase withdrew its pre-application to enter the Turkish crypto market, according to documents released by the Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB). The company initially joined more than 90 other enterprises seeking entry into Turkey’s growing crypto market but now requested a liquidation of its application. The reasons behind Coinbase’s decision have not been revealed yet. A Coinbase spokesperson stated that the company routinely evaluates markets for expansion, and mentioned that its strategy is guided by market conditions, regulatory environments, and internal priorities. This aligns with Coinbase’s mission to deliver accessible and secure crypto services globally. Coinbase applied for entry into the Turkish market in August, and joined other well known crypto firms like KuCoin and Gate.io. However, by the end of November, at least 14 companies, including Coinbase and Bitget, withdrew their applications. Despite these withdrawals, Turkey is still a major player in the crypto space. It ranks as the fourth-largest market globally by trading volume and holds the 11th spot on Chainalysis’s 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index .",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-03 09:43:45

SEC drops a bombshell by appointing Jorge Tenreiro to Chief Litigation Counsel, a move that signals the agency’s commitment to strict crypto oversight. Recently Tenreiro has updated his profile as SEC’s Chief Litigation Officer. Tenreiro is widely recognized for his aggressive enforcement tactics in the crypto space, and this promotion comes at a critical moment as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. After the US selling Bitcoins, this major change in the SEC’s front is a sign that Trump’s presidential tenure to make crypto a leading investment asset in the US will not be easy. Here’s what it means for you! A Tough Enforcer for Crypto Tenreiro’s track record with the SEC underscores his approach to crypto regulation. Previously, he led the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, where he oversaw some of the SEC’s most contentious cases. His role in the Ripple lawsuit, where the SEC alleged XRP was an unregistered security, solidified his reputation as a key figure in shaping crypto enforcement. He also supervised cases that resulted in a $30 million settlement with Kraken and initiated legal action against Coinbase, two of the most significant crypto exchanges in the U.S. What Tenreiro’s Promotion Means for Crypto Notably, this promotion gives Tenreiro even more authority, making him a central figure in deciding how the SEC handles upcoming crypto cases. Despite hopes for more favorable regulations under Trump’s administration, Tenreiro’s appointment suggests the SEC won’t ease up on its hardline approach. His focus will likely remain on enforcing securities laws, targeting token offerings, ICOs, and market manipulation, and ensuring compliance across the board. Community Reaction Prominent crypto lawyer John E. Deaton has voiced strong criticism of Jorge Tenreiro, the newly appointed Chief Litigation Counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Responding to a post by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, Deaton labeled Tenreiro as the prime example of a lawyer crypto firms should avoid hiring. Alderoty had earlier urged the crypto community to distance itself from attorneys involved in SEC lawsuits against crypto firms or those who supported such legal actions. The remarks highlight growing tensions between the SEC and the crypto industry as debates over regulatory approaches and enforcement actions intensify. Ripple Case Sets the Tone In this regard, the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit remains a landmark case, not just for Ripple but for the entire industry. If the SEC wins, it could set a precedent for treating many cryptocurrencies as securities, subjecting them to stricter regulations. On the other hand, a Ripple victory could force the SEC to rethink its strategy. Tenreiro’s leadership in this case and others like it will be crucial in defining how crypto will be sustained in the U.S. For the crypto industry, this new chapter is a mixed bag. While regulatory clarity under Trump could boost innovation, Tenreiro’s leadership shows that companies can still expect a watchful eye from the SEC.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 09:43:47

The filing adds to the bullish sentiment XRP has enjoyed in recent weeks. XRP ETF Fillings Pile Up On Dec. 2, WisdomTree submitted a Form S-1 filing for its WisdomTree XRP fund which seeks to provide investors exposure to the price of XRP by issuing shares that will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. As the filing detailed, Coinbase will act as the fund’s prime execution agent and XRP custodian. “Coinbase serves as the XRP custodian and prime execution agent for several competing exchange-traded XRP products and … plays a critical role in supporting the U.S. spot XPR exchange-traded product ecosystem,” the filing reads. Moreover, Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the administrator for the proposed trust.

XRP ETF filing #4… https://t.co/pekqC0Vcs6 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 2, 2024 Hopes Surge For U.S. XRP ETFs Under Trump Regime The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC could delay XRP ETF applications from hitting Wall Street fast enough. In October, the SEC unleashed a last-minute appeal , challenging a July 2023 court ruling that found that XRP sales on secondary markets to investors did not qualify as securities transactions. Ripple filed its cross-appeal soon afterward in response to the SEC’s legal move. With SEC chair Gary Gensler on the way out as pro-crypto President-elect Trump assumes office, XRP backers believe that regulatory clarity is coming, and that will set the stage for a spot XRP ETF despite the ongoing appeal. And investor optimism is showing: WisdomTree’s filing comes as XRP’s price rockets. The asset hit a seven-year high price of $2.81 per coin on Monday. It’s now trading for $2.70, according to CoinGecko data, a 24-hour jump of over 32%.

The surge has not only boosted XRP’s market cap but also its network growth as seen with its increasing wallet count. XRP Network Growth Soars According to Santiment’s latest analysis , XRP has seen an impressive increase in network growth, with 22,357 new wallets created on Sunday alone, marking a notable milestone for the XRP Ledger. This uptick highlighted strong crowd engagement and growing utility amidst recent political shifts, stablecoin approval rumors, and ETF interest that appears to have pushed its market cap above $154 billion. While the influx of retail activity may lead to short-term price fluctuations, the long-term implications of such network expansion are promising for XRP’s adoption and sustainability. XRP has attracted fresh gains of more than 10% in the past 24 hours that briefly pushed its price above $2.60, but experts predict that a new peak is unlikely to transpire this year. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BINPAY, said, “XRP was in an accumulation phase for nearly three years – around 900 days. The duration of such a phase often determines the strength of the subsequent rally, so it’s no surprise that from November 4, XRP has surged around 404%. It remains uncertain if it will be enough to push XRP to a new all-time high; an update to its ATH could potentially occur in the coming year.” Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju highlighted the critical role of Coinbase whales in driving XRP’s ongoing rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium for XRP has ranged between 3% and 13%, highlighting significant buying activity by large investors on the platform. This contrasts sharply with Upbit, a major Korean exchange known for its strong XRP trading volumes, which has shown no significant premium during this surge. The disparity suggests that while Korean retail investors maintain steady interest, institutional players on Coinbase are likely the primary catalysts behind XRP’s recent momentum, shaping its price trajectory in the current market. SHIB, BAND Trails Behind XRP in Network Growth Several altcoins have followed XRP’s suit. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Band Protocol (BAND) recorded notable network growth over the weekend. SHIB recorded 7,548 new wallets, while BAND saw 35 new wallets, a remarkable increase relative to its usual activity levels. These surges in wallet creation reflect heightened interest and participation in their respective ecosystems. However, as with XRP, such network growth is accompanied by potential volatility.

XRP price nears $3 after soaring 425% in a month,https://finbold.com/not-a-typo-xrp-price-nears-3-after-soaring-425-in-a-month/,"Once trading at a modest $0.50 on November 3 with a market cap of $28.56 billion, XRP has skyrocketed to $2.66 as of December 3, a jaw-dropping 429% surge in just one month, with its market cap swelling to an extraordinary $151.4 billion, as per Finbold market cap data . XRP 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold This meteoric ascent has catapulted XRP to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It’s not just climbing—it’s dominating. Over the past week alone, XRP has gained an eye-popping 88.87%, with a 12.31% increase in the last 24 hours. The token’s trading volume has also exploded, reaching $42.61 billion in the past 24 hours, up 30.37%. Outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP is comfortably trading above its 200-day simple moving average and has recorded 20 green days in the last 30—a 67% success rate. XRP whale activity The driving force behind XRP’s incredible rally is a confluence of factors, starting with unprecedented whale activity. On-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that XRP whale transactions have hit record levels, indicating that major investors are making significant bets on the token’s future. $XRP Whale Activity Hits All-Time High! “ #XRP whale activity is at an all-time high, indicating that XRP has now been embraced as a valuable asset by whales.” – By @theKriptolik More details 👇 https://t.co/OfKdPLUkn0 pic.twitter.com/bsukMB4vFP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 2, 2024 When whales move, the market listens—and this time, the message is loud and clear: XRP is being embraced as a core asset in the portfolios of high-net-worth investors. Adding to the bullish sentiment, institutional interest has hit new highs. The $100 billion asset manager WisdomTree recently filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF, a move that could open the floodgates for even more institutional capital. Such developments are fueling speculation that XRP’s utility is no longer just theoretical but a core component of the crypto industry’s future. With XRP breaking past critical support at $2.37, the psychological $3.00 resistance level is now in sight. Analysts agree that clearing this milestone could trigger even more explosive gains, particularly as investor enthusiasm continues to swell. You've got to admit, $XRP is a good looking chart. Last time it broke a long wedge pattern it rose another 5,600%!

Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo has suggested that the SEC may soon abandon its lawsuit against Ripple, marking what could be a pivotal moment for XRP. Giancarlo’s comments align with broader optimism surrounding SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s impending resignation in January, a development that has emboldened the crypto market as a whole. The Ripple case has long cast a shadow over XRP, but the tide appears to be turning. If the lawsuit is indeed dropped, it would not only clear the path for Ripple but also signal a potentially more accommodative regulatory environment for crypto in the United States.

Digital asset institutional flows have moved upward in the last two months. These investors rallied in the positive sentiment around the market after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs. ETH funds saw inflows of $634 million, marking a turnaround as investors increased their appetites. The asset remains a top choice for firms due to its staking feature and the approval of its spot ETF products. At the moment, investors are setting sights on a bullish drive on the heels of ETF inflows. Although the ETH price failed to break multiple resistance levels like Bitcoin, an uptick is still within the grasp of bulls. Several analysts opine that Ethereum will eventually notch its bull run , similar to Bitcoin, which is leading the altcoin season. Decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers mark another positive attraction for investors. ETH monthly inflows stand at $1.4 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) move to $16.2 billion. Crypto Products Record Weekly Inflows A new CoinShares Weekly Fund Flows report shows total market gains totaling $270 million, a drop from previous weeks after the United States elections. This figure has pushed yearly numbers to $37.3 billion while total AUM soars above $152 billion. “ while the flows displayed an unusual dichotomy between assets within the asset class. Since the launch of options on US ETFs, despite their high initial volumes, we have not seen a commensurate rise in ETP volumes at US$22bn last week, compared to US$34bn the week prior. Total inflows this year so far are at a new record of US$37.3bn,” CoinShares explained. Bitcoin Posts Outflows After several weeks of positive movements, Bitcoin saw $457 million outflows, reducing gains in the last 30 days to $6.2 billion. The market leader recorded massive entrants in the market as bulls project possible crypto regulations in the United States. Bitcoin price soared to multiple all-time highs trading above $99K before a price retracement. Altcoins generally moved sideways, although Ethereum and XRP led inflows. XRP posted $95 million in inflows, while monthly growth stood at $115 million. Litecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink pulled in slight $0.2 million, $0.9 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.

According to an exclusive Reuters report, crypto firms are included among the companies listed in the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund subject to an investigation by the fund’s ethics council. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, with $1.8 trillion in investments. It owns 1.5% of listed shares in 8,700 companies across the globe. This year, the fund has increased its holdings in crypto exchange, including Coinbase , Block Inc., and Marathon Digital . With Coinbase in particular, the fund owns a 0.83% stake, which is worth around $453 million. “The Council on Ethics in 2025 will take a closer look at companies involved in cryptocurrencies and gambling/casino, where there is a significant risk of money laundering,” said the council in a drafted document filed to the country’s finance ministry. Gambling firms that the fund has invested in are also under scrutiny for their high risks for money-laundering. You might also like: Norway Central Bank to decide on digital currency recommendation next year Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s Council of Ethics is tasked with probing companies the fund has invested in to ensure that they operate respectably from a business standpoint. If they do not, the council will recommend the fund to divest from those companies or place them on a public watch list. So far, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has excluded 189 companies due to ethical violations, including aircraft manufacturing companies Airbus and Boeing for creating nuclear weapons as well as Glencore and RWE for producing coal or coal-based energy. Other reasons why the fund might decide to divest from companies include violations related to human rights, environmental damage, corruption and production of tobacco and canabis. The council is also going to investigate shoe manufacturers such as Nike, Adidas, Asics and Puma for potential violations regarding inhumane working conditions, ranging from long hours and low salaries to the workers’ inability to form unions. Even if the crypto firms listed in the fund aren’t found to have violated any money-laundering standards, those firms could very well be tried on the grounds of environmental damage. In April, Norwegian regulators introduced a new framework that would crack down on crypto mining in an attempt to limit or altogether eliminate crypto mining in the nation. Norway’s ministers have voiced their concerns in regards to the environmental impact of crypto mining, citing its greenhouse gas emissions as incompatible with Norway’s sustainability goals.

This also marks a trend-reversal rally, gaining momentum as it surpasses the $0.050 psychological mark. With the new bullish rally at play, will the VET prices reclaim the $0.10 psychological mark? Let’s find out in our recent VET price action analysis. VET Price Analysis In the weekly chart, the VET price action showcases a long-coming resistance trendline, keeping the bullish growth under check. This resistance trendline started as the 2021 bull market started to lose momentum. Tradingview During this, the VET price fell to a low of $0.01317 in June 2023. However, since then, the VET price action has started to form a higher low formation, resulting in a support trendline. Therefore, the VET price movement has given rise to a symmetrical triangle pattern. In the recent bullish turnaround, the price surge from Nov. 5 resulted in a 256% rally. Starting from $0.018, the VET price has reached the current market price of $0.066. This has resulted in five consecutive bullish candles and surpassed the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.045. Further, it results in a new 52-week high at $0.070 and increases the chances of an uptrend continuation. VeChain Technicals and Price Targets The bullish turnaround has resulted in a merger between the 50- and 200-week EMA lines, which increases the possibility of a golden crossover. Furthermore, the MACD and signal lines have regained a positive alignment with the bullish histograms resurfacing. Hence, the technical indicators project a bullish extension of the VET rally. Based on the trend-based Fibonacci levels, the upside price target for VeChain stands at $0.1846, which could result in a new all-time high beyond $0.2823. On the flip side, the $0.050 will likely remain a strong support. Read More: VeChain Price Prediction: Will VET Price Hit $0.50? FAQs 1. What is the next target for VeChain (VET)?

According to a leak reported by Fox Business , Ripple is anticipated to launch RLUSD in the American digital finance market in the coming days after months of testing. The forthcoming stablecoin will bolster Ripple’s position in the U.S. digital market and the wider stablecoin ecosystem. RLUSD To Reportedly Go Live On Dec. 4 The New York Department of Financial Services is reportedly set to approve Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Sources revealed to Fox Business that the company expects to roll out the new offering as early as December 4. Unlike XRP, which has suffered regulatory setbacks in the U.S. and price instabilities, the RLUSD stablecoin seeks to maintain a steady value tied to the U.S. dollar. This stability makes it much more attractive to individuals and institutions looking for a safe and reliable digital asset for transactions. Winning approval from the NYDFS, one of the strictest financial regulators, would strengthen RLUSD’s credibility. According to @EleanorTerrett 's recent article, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is close to approving RLUSD. This approval highlights Ripple’s dedication to operating within a strict regulatory framework. 2/11 https://t.co/NyQDaMMc1d — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) November 29, 2024 If the NYDFS indeed gives its blessing, the RLUSD stablecoin could revolutionize Ripple’s position in digital finance. This would enhance its competitiveness with other stablecoin issuers and fortify its standing in the U.S. market. Ripple’s Grand Foray Into The Stablecoin Market As you may recall, Ripple initially announced RLUSD in April 2024. The asset, the company said at the time, would be fully backed by U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and “other cash equivalents.” Then in August, the blockchain payments firm kicked off testing of the stablecoin on its own XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the second biggest crypto network, Ethereum. Ripple eased investors’ fears by revealing that it would use both the RLUSD stablecoin and XRP in its near-instant international payments solution to serve its customers worldwide and significantly improve their experience. Notably, Ripple is teaming up with Uphold, Moonpay, and Bitstamp to introduce the stablecoin. These strategic collaborations will promote the asset’s adoption by customers by leveraging the top exchanges’ huge user bases and expertise in digital payments. The price of XRP has been climbing since Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6 as investors anticipate a more lenient regulatory environment under his pro-crypto administration. Further gains were fueled by the revelation that crypto foe Gary Gensler will step down from his role as the Securities and Exchange Commission chair in January, which could signal that a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund is now a matter of when not if. Moreover, the forthcoming RLUSD approval could help propel XRP above the longstanding all-time peak of $3.40. The asset recently hit yet another multi-year high of $2.81.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-03 10:02:05

In contrast, numerous altcoins have outperformed, charting mindblowing surges, such as ADA, AVAX, TRX, LINK, HBAR, and many others. BTC Stalls at $95K It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency slumped hard and fell below $91,000, which became its most violent correction since the Trump-induced rally started in early November. However, the asset didn’t stay there for long and started to recover ground in the following days. The weekly peak came on Friday as BTC neared $99,000. Nevertheless, the bears managed to defend that level and pushed bitcoin down to approximately $96,500 during the weekend. Monday morning started with a surge to $98,000 but that was short-lived as BTC plunged to $95,000 almost immediately. Another rollercoaster followed suit with bitcoin jumping to $97,500 before it was driven south once again to $94,500. Despite its recovery attempts since then, BTC now trades just inches above $95,000. This decline means that BTC’s market cap has remained below $1.9 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has been pushed south hard. The metric is down to just 52% after peaking at nearly 60% weeks ago, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 3.12.2024. Source: TradingView These Alts Do Good The past few days belonged to XRP and yesterday was no exception as the asset skyrocketed by another 25% at one point and neared $3 for the first time in almost seven years. Although it has retraced since then to $2.6, its market cap of $150 billion still places it as the third-largest cryptocurrency by that metric. Other massive gainers over the past 24 hours include ADA, which has soared by 17%, AVAX (11%), TRX (14%), DOT (16%), LINK (27%), SUI (15%), HBAR (42%), and quite a few others. The total crypto market cap has gained $70 billion since yesterday as it has all gone to the alts. The metric is above $3.6 trillion once again. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

It sounds pessimistic, doesn’t it? Considering the optimistic nature of the current cryptocurrency market scenario, there seems to be no reason for the analyst to express a pessimistic view. Yet, the analyst sticks to his ‘not-so-welcoming’ view. Should altcoin enthusiasts be worried? A New Kind of Altcoin Season One thing that everyone agrees on right now is that the crypto market is going to witness an altcoin season soon. The thing that triggers disagreement is: will all the altcoins benefit from this season? Many, like Ki Young Ju, hold the depressing opinion that only a select few altcoins will benefit from this alt season. Bitcoin’s Separation From Altcoins Until recently, the correlation between bitcoin and altcoin was strong. To prove that the Bitcoin market no longer shares this tight connection with the rest of the crypto market, the prime argument that Young Ju puts forth is the one highlighting the creation of its own paper-based Layer 2 ecosystem by Bitcoin using ETFs, funds and similar tools. Breaking the Altcoin-Bitcoin Correlation The general belief is that altcoins move together with bitcoin. In the scenario of a weaker correlation, the belief is simply irrelevant. Anyway, the best thing about this new trend of altcoins breaking this correlation is that a few altcoins are showing the capacity to exhibit independent trends. The crypto expert also acknowledges this new trend in the altcoin market. In the last 30 days, XRP has surged by 423%, Dogecoin by 174.6%, Cardano by 272.9%, Avalanche by 115.2%, Stellar by 485.6%, Chainlink by 128.9%, Polkadot by 158.7%, Hedera by 689.4%, Pepe by 143.9%, and Cronos by 182.45. Survival Strategies for Altcoins There is a way out of this trap for the altcoin market. Young Ju presents two options: Either develop paper-wrapped products, like Bitcoin ETFs, or build a real internet money system using stablecoins or Bitcoin. The funniest part is that both these options look equally tough. Anyway, there is no option. The altcoin market has to make a choice.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|CRO,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-03 10:05:20
