This notable price performance, followed by the recent price dip, has sparked discussions about the state of the market, particularly the profit-taking behaviour observed among investors. An analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost sheds light on these dynamics, focusing on realized profits and investor behaviour linked to Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Dip Triggers Alert On NVT Golden Cross—Here’s What To Watch For Are Investors Actively Taking Profits Now? According to Darkfost, tracking the profits realized by investors transferring Bitcoin to Binance can provide “valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and behaviour, especially considering Binance consistently handles higher volumes than any other exchange.” He notes that following Bitcoin’s breakthrough to a new high, there has been a noticeable increase in realized profits among the Binance cohort. This trend reflects a significant level of investor engagement, where users are capitalizing on the price surge to secure gains. However, Darkfost emphasizes that the scale and pace of profit-taking—whether aggressive or steady—could help determine the trajectory the market is headed to next. The analyst highlights that profit-taking activity on Binance has recently subsided after an initial surge. This pause in selling behaviour may suggest growing confidence among investors in Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. However, Darkfost stresses the importance of monitoring these metrics, particularly the realized profits exceeding $10 million. Significant profit-taking could indicate a cooling-off period or even a reversal in an upward trend, while a steady approach may reinforce the strength of the ongoing rally. Bitcoin Sees Rebound After recording a notable correction following its latest achieved all-time high, Bitcoin is finally now seeing a noticeable rebound in its price. Over the past few days, since the week started, Bitcoin has experienced consistent dip which dropped its price to as low as $90,000 levels yesterday for the first time in recent weeks. Related Reading: The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why However, so far, the asset is now gradually regaining its recently shedded gains. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has surged by 2.3% in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $94,656 which bring BTC’s price to a mere 5.1% decrease away from its all-time high. Along with its price, BTC’s market cap valuation has also seen a surge. Over the past day alone nearly $80 billion has been added to the crypto’s market cap which rose from $1.8 trillion on November 26 to $74 trillion as of today.

According to his detailed price chart, Dogecoin is currently in wave 3 of the Elliott Wave Theory and set for a significant price surge. Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Macro Target Hov, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has discussed Dogecoin‘s future price movements based on the Elliott Wave Theory and its current price action. The analyst noted that the meme coin has received a remarkable 690% rally since recently reaching a critical macro entry level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over? Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible According to Hov’s chart analysis, the Dogecoin price action is currently in the midst of its third Elliott Wave, a phase often characterized by solid price growth. The third wave is typically seen as the strongest of all five wave motive sequences of the Elliott Wave theory and is also considered bullish. The price chart shows that Dogecoin is entering its third wave after recently breaking out of a prolonged consolidation period within a critical support zone around $0.27. While Hov has forecasted a rise to the macro targets at $2.2 – $3.46, the analyst has also revealed that the Dogecoin price could reach an ultimate target of $4.2 if it maintains a strong bullish momentum. This substantial price increase would require Dogecoin surging by 976% from its current value. Analyst Reveals Next Dogecoin Local Tops While the DOGE price steadily approaches the $1 mark, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has released the upcoming local tops for the number one meme coin. The analyst disclosed that Dogecoin had successfully recorded multiple local market tops in the last year following a substantial price rally. He also revealed that each local top had a 2X relationship, where the Dogecoin price had doubled in the previous three local tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Above Bull Channel, Crypto Analyst Reveals What’s Next Following the analyst’s chart, Dogecoin reached a local top of $0.11 in October 2023, jumping 2X to hit another top of around $0.22 in April 2024. Interestingly, the same bullish pattern occurred again around October this year, with the meme coin doubling its previous price high to reach a local price peak of around $0.44 this month. Based on this bullish pattern, where the Dogecoin price has historically multiplied by 2X with each local top, Trader Tardigrade predicts that the meme coin will continue this trend until it reaches an all-time high of $5. The analyst has projected that Dogecoin could see its next local top at $0.88 by April 2025. Additionally, around July 2025, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin will double again and surpass the $1 milestone to hit $1.76. Extending towards October 2025, the analyst has also projected that the Dogecoin price is expected to rally to $3.52.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At ‘Greed’ Again The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This metric uses a scale from zero to a hundred to represent its value. All values greater than 53 imply the presence of greed among the traders, while those under 47 suggest fear in the market. The index reflects a net-neutral mentality in the region between these two cutoffs. Related Reading: Current Bitcoin Hashrate Can Sustain $4.9 Trillion Cap, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Besides these three main sentiments, the indicator can also signal two special sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occupies the region below 25 and the latter above 75. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is saying regarding the current market sentiment: As is visible above, the index has a value of 75, which means that the investors share a sentiment of greed right now. This mentality is also particularly strong, as the indicator’s value is right on the boundary of the extreme greed zone. Historically, the extreme mentalities have proven to be quite significant for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as it’s when the index is in these zones, the prices tend to hit major points of reversal. However, the relationship between the two is inverse, meaning bottoms are likely to happen when the market is the most fearful, while tops occur in times of immense greed. Followers of a trading technique called contrarian investing leverage this fact to make their trades; they buy in extreme fear and sell during extreme greed. Warren Buffet’s famous quote also sums up this idea, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” While the current value of the index is high, it was much higher during the last few days, as the below chart shows. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was firmly inside the extreme greed territory as the rally in the asset took place, with a peak of 94 occurring alongside the cryptocurrency’s top above the $99,000 level. Thus, it appears Bitcoin has once again moved contrary to the crowd’s expectations, as its price has registered a notable drawdown since this extreme greed high. Ideally, the sentiment would cool off into the fear region for a reversal in the asset. Still, during bull runs, where demand is extraordinarily high, a refresh into the neutral or normal greed zone is often enough for the rally to regain steam.

Coinbase, Robinhood, And MicroStrategy All Post Gains In the 24-hour time frame, Bitcoin recorded gains of nearly 5%, regaining the $96,100 level as a key to reach a new record high in the last days of the month. This bullish price action was expected by experts and analysts throughout the year as a normal upward behavior during Halving cycles, further boosted by Trump’s crypto agenda, which notably include making BTC a strategic reserve for the US. Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Below Crucial Resistance – Analyst Sets $1.60 Target This week marked a notable divergence, as Bitcoin decoupled from the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which fell by 1%. According to CNBC data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also experienced declines, yet Bitcoin managed to maintain its upward trajectory. This strength was reflected in the performance of crypto-related stocks, with US-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) up more than 5%, Robinhood (HOOD) up 4%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR) up 10%. Bitcoin Enters ‘Uncharted Territory’ In addition to the bullish outlook provided by the data and figures recorded over the past three weeks in crypto prices, market analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, with Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, claiming that “the Bitcoin bull market has legs.” Thorn acknowledges the possibility of corrections and “regulatory jitters” stemming from the outgoing Biden administration but believes that increasing adoption from institutional, corporate, and potentially nation-state entities will drive Bitcoin’s price higher in the near to medium term. Related Reading: BNB Eyes Recovery: $605 Support Sets The Stage For A New Rally Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies also highlighted that Bitcoin investors are currently in “uncharted territory” regarding resistance levels, meaning there are few historical price points to indicate potential pullbacks. Support is identified around $74,000, suggesting a solid foundation for future growth. Stockton further claimed: Bitcoin does tend to stair step both to the downside and to the upside, meaning that it sees these very sharp runups and then consolidates. People should … be willing to give Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrencies in general, more room because of the volatility there and also because of the long-term potential. With a year-to-date gain of 124%, Bitcoin remains on track to cross the $100,000 threshold before the end of the year. By comparison, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, has also performed well since the election but lags behind BTC with a year-to-date gain of 55%.

The price is now trading above $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $1.4580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might gain momentum if it clears the $1.500 resistance. XRP Price Holds Gains Above $1.40 XRP price remained supported near the $1.30 zone. It formed a base and recently started an upward move like Bitcoin and like Ethereum. There was a move above the $1.3550 and $1.3750 resistance levels. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $1.4580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair was able to clear the $1.50 level.

The first major resistance is near the $1.5250 level. The next key resistance could be $1.550. A clear move above the $1.550 resistance might send the price toward the $1.5850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.600 resistance or even $1.620 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.650 or $1.6550. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $1.500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.4300 level. The next major support is near the $1.40 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.2828 swing low to the $1.5238 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.3750 support. The next major support sits near the $1.350 zone.

When writing, the memecoin leader trades at $0.404, up 5.6% in the past 24 hours. Analysts suggest this price marks a critical juncture that could significantly influence Dogecoin’s trajectory in the coming days. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Gearing Up: Can It Overcome Resistance and Climb? Dogecoin Hit Key Resistance Point The recent rally has garnered significant attention from analysts. Renowned crypto analyst Ali recently shared his technical cryptocurrency analysis via his X account. In the post, the analyst marked out a descending channel on DOGE’s price chart. According to Ali, Dogecoin is currently testing a critical resistance level. He stated that a “sustained” break above the $0.40 price mark could increase the price to $0.43 levels. However, should DOGE fail to breach the $0.40 level, the asset is prone to face another notable dip that would drop its price to $0.36 or even $0.34. #Dogecoin $DOGE is at a very critical resistance point. A sustained break above $0.40 will send it to $0.43, but failing to clear the $0.40 resistance will trigger another dip to $0.36 or even $0.34! pic.twitter.com/fTqpftq3tS — Ali (@ali_charts) November 27, 2024 Key Developments Strengthen DOGE’s Bullish Position Beyond its price movements, Dogecoin has recently benefited from several positive developments that have reinforced investor confidence. One notable instance is the establishment of a new government agency named the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the United States. This acronym is the same as the ticker for Dogecoin.

A press release uploaded earlier today read: DeFi Technologies’ subsidiary Valour Inc. has introduced the Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market, marking the first Dogecoin ETP available in the Nordics. This launch expands Valour’s suite of digital asset products, offering investors exposure to Dogecoin, which currently holds a market capitalization of approximately $59.5 billion, ranking it as the 7th largest digital asset globally. Notably, these milestones highlights the increasing institutional and mainstream recognition of DOGE, contributing to its ongoing price rally. In addition to Ali’s technical insights, another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, shared a long-term perspective on Dogecoin. The analyst pointed out that DOGE maintains a recognizable wave pattern on its macro chart, predicting a potential blow-off top that could see the cryptocurrency reaching as high as $20. # Dogecoin maintains a wave pattern on the macro chart 🔥 Next blow-off top predicted at $20 🚀 pic.twitter.com/8U9DvuBLCm — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) November 27, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from tradingview",Dogecoin|altcoin|crypto|crypto market|doge|DOGE price analysis|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|SPONSORED|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-28 05:00:17

This surge coincides with Bitcoin nearing an all-time high of $100,000, fueled by the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who positions himself as a pro-crypto leader. However, Bloomberg reports that the uncertainty stemming from the 2021 crypto collapse remains palpable among investors, as many altcoins experienced dramatic price fluctuations during past market cycles. Expert Voices Skepticism On Altcoins Rally Altcoins have shown impressive gains, with tokens like Solana (SOL) reaching new all-time highs, while many others have more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year. Historically, altcoins tend to outperform Bitcoin during market rallies but can also experience sharper declines during downturns due to their higher volatility and lower trading volumes. Related Reading: $15 Trillion Market Cap For Bitcoin? Crypto Firm CEO Predicts Explosive Growth The crypto market has been cautious since major players like FTX and crypto lender Celsius collapsed, which contributed to a significant bear market. Despite this, recent activity indicates a resurgence, with increased trading volumes and price rises among altcoins throughout November. Interestingly, James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, expressed skepticism about a massive altcoin rally, particularly in light of potential regulatory changes, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act, which seeks to allocate funds from the Federal Reserve’s gold reserves to acquire a strategic stockpile of 1 million Bitcoin. Butterfill told Bloomberg that the political implications of such legislation could significantly affect market dynamics, potentially increasing Bitcoin’s dominance over its peers. ETF Approval Hopes Could Boost Crypto Interest Under Trump While Solana stands out as the only major altcoin to surpass its previous highs this year, experts like Nikolay Karpenko from crypto trading firm B2C2 believe this rally could differ from the 2021 experience. The expert highlighted the industry’s maturity over the past few years, which has seen improvements in risk management and the entry of “more strategic” and institutional investors into the crypto space. As altcoins continue to gain traction, data shows that trading volume has become increasingly concentrated among the five most traded altcoins, rising from less than 50% earlier this year to over 60% this month. This shift can be attributed to unique factors affecting individual cryptocurrencies, such as Solana’s rise fueled by excitement over potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals and Dogecoin’s gains related to its payment capabilities and support from figures like Elon Musk and his new position at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Below Crucial Resistance – Analyst Sets $1.60 Target The expert noted that the possibility of more altcoins receiving approval for ETFs under Trump’s administration could further enhance institutional interest. However, Butterfill cautioned that the market may begin to differentiate between assets, focusing more on fundamentals rather than riding the wave of speculative trading. Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding altcoins, they still trade at significantly lower prices than Bitcoin, with Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, priced at only about 4% of Bitcoin’s value. After hitting a new record high of $263 during last week’s rally, Solana has since fallen back to the $240 level, echoing the current correction Bitcoin is experiencing after hitting its new all-time high of $99,500. At the time of writing, SOL is up nearly 6% in the 24-hour time frame, while BTC is up 4% in the same period.
