This notable price performance, followed by the recent price dip, has sparked discussions about the state of the market, particularly the profit-taking behaviour observed among investors. An analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost sheds light on these dynamics, focusing on realized profits and investor behaviour linked to Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Dip Triggers Alert On NVT Golden Cross—Here’s What To Watch For Are Investors Actively Taking Profits Now? According to Darkfost, tracking the profits realized by investors transferring Bitcoin to Binance can provide “valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and behaviour, especially considering Binance consistently handles higher volumes than any other exchange.” He notes that following Bitcoin’s breakthrough to a new high, there has been a noticeable increase in realized profits among the Binance cohort. This trend reflects a significant level of investor engagement, where users are capitalizing on the price surge to secure gains. However, Darkfost emphasizes that the scale and pace of profit-taking—whether aggressive or steady—could help determine the trajectory the market is headed to next. The analyst highlights that profit-taking activity on Binance has recently subsided after an initial surge. This pause in selling behaviour may suggest growing confidence among investors in Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. However, Darkfost stresses the importance of monitoring these metrics, particularly the realized profits exceeding $10 million. Significant profit-taking could indicate a cooling-off period or even a reversal in an upward trend, while a steady approach may reinforce the strength of the ongoing rally. Bitcoin Sees Rebound After recording a notable correction following its latest achieved all-time high, Bitcoin is finally now seeing a noticeable rebound in its price. Over the past few days, since the week started, Bitcoin has experienced consistent dip which dropped its price to as low as $90,000 levels yesterday for the first time in recent weeks. Related Reading: The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why However, so far, the asset is now gradually regaining its recently shedded gains. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has surged by 2.3% in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $94,656 which bring BTC’s price to a mere 5.1% decrease away from its all-time high. Along with its price, BTC’s market cap valuation has also seen a surge. Over the past day alone nearly $80 billion has been added to the crypto’s market cap which rose from $1.8 trillion on November 26 to $74 trillion as of today.

According to his detailed price chart, Dogecoin is currently in wave 3 of the Elliott Wave Theory and set for a significant price surge. Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Macro Target Hov, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has discussed Dogecoin‘s future price movements based on the Elliott Wave Theory and its current price action. The analyst noted that the meme coin has received a remarkable 690% rally since recently reaching a critical macro entry level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over? Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible According to Hov’s chart analysis, the Dogecoin price action is currently in the midst of its third Elliott Wave, a phase often characterized by solid price growth. The third wave is typically seen as the strongest of all five wave motive sequences of the Elliott Wave theory and is also considered bullish. The price chart shows that Dogecoin is entering its third wave after recently breaking out of a prolonged consolidation period within a critical support zone around $0.27. While Hov has forecasted a rise to the macro targets at $2.2 – $3.46, the analyst has also revealed that the Dogecoin price could reach an ultimate target of $4.2 if it maintains a strong bullish momentum. This substantial price increase would require Dogecoin surging by 976% from its current value. Analyst Reveals Next Dogecoin Local Tops While the DOGE price steadily approaches the $1 mark, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has released the upcoming local tops for the number one meme coin. The analyst disclosed that Dogecoin had successfully recorded multiple local market tops in the last year following a substantial price rally. He also revealed that each local top had a 2X relationship, where the Dogecoin price had doubled in the previous three local tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Above Bull Channel, Crypto Analyst Reveals What’s Next Following the analyst’s chart, Dogecoin reached a local top of $0.11 in October 2023, jumping 2X to hit another top of around $0.22 in April 2024. Interestingly, the same bullish pattern occurred again around October this year, with the meme coin doubling its previous price high to reach a local price peak of around $0.44 this month. Based on this bullish pattern, where the Dogecoin price has historically multiplied by 2X with each local top, Trader Tardigrade predicts that the meme coin will continue this trend until it reaches an all-time high of $5. The analyst has projected that Dogecoin could see its next local top at $0.88 by April 2025. Additionally, around July 2025, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin will double again and surpass the $1 milestone to hit $1.76. Extending towards October 2025, the analyst has also projected that the Dogecoin price is expected to rally to $3.52.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At ‘Greed’ Again The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This metric uses a scale from zero to a hundred to represent its value. All values greater than 53 imply the presence of greed among the traders, while those under 47 suggest fear in the market. The index reflects a net-neutral mentality in the region between these two cutoffs. Related Reading: Current Bitcoin Hashrate Can Sustain $4.9 Trillion Cap, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Besides these three main sentiments, the indicator can also signal two special sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occupies the region below 25 and the latter above 75. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is saying regarding the current market sentiment: As is visible above, the index has a value of 75, which means that the investors share a sentiment of greed right now. This mentality is also particularly strong, as the indicator’s value is right on the boundary of the extreme greed zone. Historically, the extreme mentalities have proven to be quite significant for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as it’s when the index is in these zones, the prices tend to hit major points of reversal. However, the relationship between the two is inverse, meaning bottoms are likely to happen when the market is the most fearful, while tops occur in times of immense greed. Followers of a trading technique called contrarian investing leverage this fact to make their trades; they buy in extreme fear and sell during extreme greed. Warren Buffet’s famous quote also sums up this idea, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” While the current value of the index is high, it was much higher during the last few days, as the below chart shows. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was firmly inside the extreme greed territory as the rally in the asset took place, with a peak of 94 occurring alongside the cryptocurrency’s top above the $99,000 level. Thus, it appears Bitcoin has once again moved contrary to the crowd’s expectations, as its price has registered a notable drawdown since this extreme greed high. Ideally, the sentiment would cool off into the fear region for a reversal in the asset. Still, during bull runs, where demand is extraordinarily high, a refresh into the neutral or normal greed zone is often enough for the rally to regain steam.

Coinbase, Robinhood, And MicroStrategy All Post Gains In the 24-hour time frame, Bitcoin recorded gains of nearly 5%, regaining the $96,100 level as a key to reach a new record high in the last days of the month. This bullish price action was expected by experts and analysts throughout the year as a normal upward behavior during Halving cycles, further boosted by Trump’s crypto agenda, which notably include making BTC a strategic reserve for the US. Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Below Crucial Resistance – Analyst Sets $1.60 Target This week marked a notable divergence, as Bitcoin decoupled from the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which fell by 1%. According to CNBC data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also experienced declines, yet Bitcoin managed to maintain its upward trajectory. This strength was reflected in the performance of crypto-related stocks, with US-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) up more than 5%, Robinhood (HOOD) up 4%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR) up 10%. Bitcoin Enters ‘Uncharted Territory’ In addition to the bullish outlook provided by the data and figures recorded over the past three weeks in crypto prices, market analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, with Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, claiming that “the Bitcoin bull market has legs.” Thorn acknowledges the possibility of corrections and “regulatory jitters” stemming from the outgoing Biden administration but believes that increasing adoption from institutional, corporate, and potentially nation-state entities will drive Bitcoin’s price higher in the near to medium term. Related Reading: BNB Eyes Recovery: $605 Support Sets The Stage For A New Rally Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies also highlighted that Bitcoin investors are currently in “uncharted territory” regarding resistance levels, meaning there are few historical price points to indicate potential pullbacks. Support is identified around $74,000, suggesting a solid foundation for future growth. Stockton further claimed: Bitcoin does tend to stair step both to the downside and to the upside, meaning that it sees these very sharp runups and then consolidates. People should … be willing to give Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrencies in general, more room because of the volatility there and also because of the long-term potential. With a year-to-date gain of 124%, Bitcoin remains on track to cross the $100,000 threshold before the end of the year. By comparison, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, has also performed well since the election but lags behind BTC with a year-to-date gain of 55%.

The next major support is near the $1.40 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.2828 swing low to the $1.5238 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.3750 support. The next major support sits near the $1.350 zone.
