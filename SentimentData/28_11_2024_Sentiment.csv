This notable price performance, followed by the recent price dip, has sparked discussions about the state of the market, particularly the profit-taking behaviour observed among investors. An analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost sheds light on these dynamics, focusing on realized profits and investor behaviour linked to Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Dip Triggers Alert On NVT Golden Cross—Here’s What To Watch For Are Investors Actively Taking Profits Now? According to Darkfost, tracking the profits realized by investors transferring Bitcoin to Binance can provide “valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and behaviour, especially considering Binance consistently handles higher volumes than any other exchange.” He notes that following Bitcoin’s breakthrough to a new high, there has been a noticeable increase in realized profits among the Binance cohort. This trend reflects a significant level of investor engagement, where users are capitalizing on the price surge to secure gains. However, Darkfost emphasizes that the scale and pace of profit-taking—whether aggressive or steady—could help determine the trajectory the market is headed to next. The analyst highlights that profit-taking activity on Binance has recently subsided after an initial surge. This pause in selling behaviour may suggest growing confidence among investors in Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. However, Darkfost stresses the importance of monitoring these metrics, particularly the realized profits exceeding $10 million. Significant profit-taking could indicate a cooling-off period or even a reversal in an upward trend, while a steady approach may reinforce the strength of the ongoing rally. Bitcoin Sees Rebound After recording a notable correction following its latest achieved all-time high, Bitcoin is finally now seeing a noticeable rebound in its price. Over the past few days, since the week started, Bitcoin has experienced consistent dip which dropped its price to as low as $90,000 levels yesterday for the first time in recent weeks. Related Reading: The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why However, so far, the asset is now gradually regaining its recently shedded gains. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has surged by 2.3% in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $94,656 which bring BTC’s price to a mere 5.1% decrease away from its all-time high. Along with its price, BTC’s market cap valuation has also seen a surge. Over the past day alone nearly $80 billion has been added to the crypto’s market cap which rose from $1.8 trillion on November 26 to $74 trillion as of today.

According to his detailed price chart, Dogecoin is currently in wave 3 of the Elliott Wave Theory and set for a significant price surge. Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Macro Target Hov, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has discussed Dogecoin‘s future price movements based on the Elliott Wave Theory and its current price action. The analyst noted that the meme coin has received a remarkable 690% rally since recently reaching a critical macro entry level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over? Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible According to Hov’s chart analysis, the Dogecoin price action is currently in the midst of its third Elliott Wave, a phase often characterized by solid price growth. The third wave is typically seen as the strongest of all five wave motive sequences of the Elliott Wave theory and is also considered bullish. The price chart shows that Dogecoin is entering its third wave after recently breaking out of a prolonged consolidation period within a critical support zone around $0.27. While Hov has forecasted a rise to the macro targets at $2.2 – $3.46, the analyst has also revealed that the Dogecoin price could reach an ultimate target of $4.2 if it maintains a strong bullish momentum. This substantial price increase would require Dogecoin surging by 976% from its current value. Analyst Reveals Next Dogecoin Local Tops While the DOGE price steadily approaches the $1 mark, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has released the upcoming local tops for the number one meme coin. The analyst disclosed that Dogecoin had successfully recorded multiple local market tops in the last year following a substantial price rally. He also revealed that each local top had a 2X relationship, where the Dogecoin price had doubled in the previous three local tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Above Bull Channel, Crypto Analyst Reveals What’s Next Following the analyst’s chart, Dogecoin reached a local top of $0.11 in October 2023, jumping 2X to hit another top of around $0.22 in April 2024. Interestingly, the same bullish pattern occurred again around October this year, with the meme coin doubling its previous price high to reach a local price peak of around $0.44 this month. Based on this bullish pattern, where the Dogecoin price has historically multiplied by 2X with each local top, Trader Tardigrade predicts that the meme coin will continue this trend until it reaches an all-time high of $5. The analyst has projected that Dogecoin could see its next local top at $0.88 by April 2025. Additionally, around July 2025, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin will double again and surpass the $1 milestone to hit $1.76. Extending towards October 2025, the analyst has also projected that the Dogecoin price is expected to rally to $3.52.
