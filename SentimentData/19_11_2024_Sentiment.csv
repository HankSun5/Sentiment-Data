Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike S≈Çawomir Mentzen, a Polish politician and chair of the New Hope Party, has recently announced a campaign promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for Poland. Mentzen unveiled his proposal via Twitter/X, adding that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reason to wait,‚Äù referring to his country‚Äôs potential Bitcoin cache. According to some reports, Mentzen is also invested in Bitcoin, with a holding of 33.7 BTC, or roughly $3 million, based on the current market price. üáµüá± Poland‚Äôs presidential candidate recently vowed to create a strategic #Bitcoin reserve if he wins the election, following Donald Trump‚Äôs lead. The move could be a huge change in crypto adoption for Poland.#Crypto adoption is growing rapidly‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss this opportunity.

The Polish presidential candidate answered in the affirmative, saying it was about time the country adopted this policy. He added that there‚Äôs a bill for a strategic reserve for the top asset, and there‚Äôs no time to wait. Mentzen further argued that a strategic stockpile must be passed instead of other ordinary crypto laws. The social media user is referring to the ‚ÄúSatoshi Action Fund,‚Äù a bill filed by a non-profit organization. The same lobby organization headed by Dennis Porter also helped draft a similar bill for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Can Poland Follow The US Bitcoin Experience? Although Bitcoin has become an election issue, whether Poland will join the Bitcoin bandwagon remains to be seen. Poland is not part of the European Union and uses a separate currency, the zloty. Also, Mentzen‚Äôs party boasts far-right policies but has limited influence in Polish politics. The Konfederacja party alliance nominated Mentzen for next year‚Äôs presidential elections, but it‚Äôs unlikely that he‚Äôll win with limited support from a small party. However, as a presidential candidate and a member of the Polish Sejma, one of the two chambers in the country‚Äôs parliament, many believe the Bitcoin proposal will get some attention.

Today, election observers and market analysts are examining the possible role of Bitcoin in Mentzen‚Äôs campaign.

Bitcoin's price surge is driven by reduced supply, increased demand, plus potential government adoption, giving it continued long-term upside. Dogecoin's recent rise is speculative and driven by memes and internet buzz about Elon Musk, but its fundamentals don't match Bitcoin's for stability and value. MicroStrategy's stock is overvalued due to irrational investor behavior‚Äìit's far wiser to invest directly in Bitcoin through ETFs like IBIT. A friend of mine put some Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on a hard drive sometime in the 2010s. He soon forgot the password, but Bitcoin skyrocketed in price, turning a few-thousand-dollar hobby investment into lost treasure. He called me late last week with ecstatic news‚Äì the long-lost password came to him in a dream. Suddenly, he had found the keys to $200,000 in lost crypto. These crazy ups and downs are hardly unique to the crypto world. This same friend (and others) took heavy losses to fraud at FTX and Celsius. Another happily traded his crypto for a house. Some acquaintances got money and blew it all in Miami at E11even, Club Space, and rented yachts. Other crypto people who I've met had stories that simply didn't add up, and I figured that they'd someday be minor characters in government indictments (later, they were, though I would have no idea how deeply the webs would be tangled). Bitcoin was intended for people who wanted to store value outside the traditional banking system, but the first thing the crypto world did after it started to gain popularity was essentially make an unregulated banking-type system. That broke rule #1, and many of the shady people marketing crypto immediately started doing what they do. But it wasn't Bitcoin's fault. Bitcoin is not the same thing as the crypto world. If the premise of Bitcoin is that inflation is a tax on savings and that government banking systems are simply designed to make the rich richer, then Bitcoin has a ton of value. The only thing standing in between that value, and you are the middlemen in between. You can see on the graph here how Bitcoin has gone parabolic over the past few years. But not if you invested it with Sam Bankman-Fried. Bitcoin has been my best investment, and I've been able to realize it because I believe in BTC's future, but I'm healthily skeptical of middlemen and was willing to quickly pull money away from trouble. I think that there's a lot to believe in with Bitcoin, but I'm seeing a couple of potential traps with how people are currently investing their money. More on these later. Data by YCharts Why Is Bitcoin Up? I would argue that Bitcoin is up mainly because it's delivering on its original value proposition. BTC is doing exactly what it was designed to do, with inflation now well under the rate of the US dollar and other major currencies. Even gold has some inflation caused by new supply being mined out of the earth, and Bitcoin's new supply is now below gold's historical inflation of 1-2% annually as well. With Trump winning the US presidential election and key proponents of crypto in positions of power, it's not inconceivable that the US Treasury could start to own some Bitcoin as well (for example, they've talked about holding the Bitcoin they seize from criminals rather than selling it). Another idea could be for the government to mine Bitcoin with excess solar or hydroelectric electricity that would otherwise be wasted. It sounds kind of crazy, but the US government has about $350 billion in gold at Ft. Knox, so there is some precedent. I don't know to what extent this will happen, but investors are certainly excited about a crypto-friendly administration coming in. El Salvador president Nayib Bukele was mocked by the media for investing some of his country's money in Bitcoin, but he's sitting on a healthy profit now. Supply is down this year, demand is up, and the price of BTC is following. The supply side is pretty easy to figure out‚Äì Bitcoin had a halving event earlier this year that reduced inflation by 1/2 to roughly 0.8% per year . On the demand side, Bitcoin ETFs being approved earlier this year led to increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. And now you have increased interest from sovereign buyers, as the US government discussions and El Salvador's continued buying. In economics, there's a saying that the cure for high prices is high prices. For example, when the price of silver shoots up, people see the ads on TV and dig through their houses to find their old silverware, jewelry, etc., and sell it back into the market. And when the price of gold or silver rises, there's more incentive to mine. There's no way to increase Bitcoin mining, so the question for Bitcoin here is, will a higher price incentivize existing holders to sell? Higher prices always incentivize some people to sell‚Äì I wrote above that a friend bought a house and some acquaintances blew their crypto riches. But higher prices can also cause some FOMO. I think it's impossible to make highly accurate predictions on short-term price movement, but Bitcoin and other assets tend to have momentum, meaning that they tend to keep going up when they're rising and vice versa. Dollar-cost averaging on the way in and out is my best recommendation for investors looking to move in or out of crypto. Bitcoin Copycat #1: Dogecoin There is only one Bitcoin. However, there are something like 20,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. Some of them are redundant, some of them are scams, and well over 99% of them are useless. Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) is kind of a unique case as it was originally created as a joke but immediately got flooded with buyers. Dogecoin is surging again because of its proximity to Tesla ( TSLA ) founder Elon Musk. Musk likes jokes and frequently has tweeted about Dogecoin. Most recently, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were appointed by Donald Trump to the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, to which someone cleverly attached the backronym of DOGE. When people found out about this, the internet went wild, and a new speculative frenzy in DOGE began. Dogecoin has more than doubled in price in the last 3 weeks, and you can buy it with the click of a couple of buttons on Robinhood ( HOOD ). If you think it's funny, and you want to put some money into it, feel free. But the last time people piled into DOGE was in 2021 before Elon went on Saturday Night Live, and as usual, retail investor interest peaked near the top. I wrote a piece on Dogecoin at the time that surprisingly became one of my most-read articles on Seeking Alpha. In the piece, I demonstrated that the biggest winners in most speculative bubbles are stock brokerages and the IRS , while market participants are playing a negative-sum game on an after-tax basis. Dogecoin never quite hit $1 like the TikTok prophets said it would, but hope springs eternal this time around. I assume most of the early holders cashed out‚Äì I mean, why wouldn't you trade a bunch of Dogecoin for a house if you could? Dogecoin's fundamentals don't match up with Bitcoin. The rate of inflation in Doge is currently around 3.5%, which is significantly higher than Bitcoin's rate of less than 1%. Moreover, transaction costs are significantly higher for DOGE than for Bitcoin, which can be easily traded with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). Trade DOGE for your entertainment, and if it brings you joy, then feel free. But even though Robinhood puts them side by side, Dogecoin is not in the same ballpark as Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin if you want to buy crypto and simply ignore the frenzy in Doge. Bitcoin Copycat #2: MicroStrategy MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) is probably the clearest current example of a Bitcoin copycat. For those of you who don't know, MicroStrategy is a software company that went public during the dot-com boom in 1998. MicroStrategy gained fame for skyrocketing during the dot-com boom, and later gained infamy for crashing after being forced to massively restate its previous years' earnings in 2000. Unlike many dot-com businesses, MicroStrategy managed to stay in business, and in the 2010s the company was turning modest profits . The business started to sour later in the decade, and the company took the unusual step of investing its corporate reserves into Bitcoin in 2020. The timing was great, and Bitcoin started to ramp up later in 2020 into 2021, and MSTR ended up buying a lot more BTC after. While it's unusual, there's nothing necessarily wrong with investing corporate money in Bitcoin. MicroStrategy even borrowed money to buy more crypto, and while this is pretty risky, I've seen much crazier things for small companies to do to try to bail out their business. However, over time, MSTR has become somewhat of a crypto closed-end fund of sorts, with their Bitcoin pile hitting an estimated $26 billion. However, if you look at MicroStrategy's market cap, it's ballooned to nearly $75 billion. Their core business loses money, and they're essentially a Bitcoin hedge fund at this point, though they market themselves as an AI business. Investors buying this are betting on financial alchemy. You can't turn lead into gold, and simply buying Bitcoin shouldn't increase your company's market cap by multiples of the amount of Bitcoin you amass. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and his lieutenants are not dumb‚Äì far from it. However, I believe their interests are not aligned with the retail investors who are piling into MSTR, and the transfer of wealth is going to flow from the retail investors to the company over time. We're talking about potentially seeing a $40+ billion wealth transfer that could happen here in the next 12-24 months from retail investors in MSTR and MSTR itself. Financial markets create these sorts of products because there's money to be made. Heck, in South Korea they're even planning a triple leveraged Berkshire Hathaway fund . You have to know how to do some serious due diligence to invest in this sort of stuff, though. Data by YCharts Here you can see that while Bitcoin is up 146% over the last year, MSTR is up 600%. That's not rational, considering MSTR's only real moneymaker is investing in Bitcoin. On a back-of-the-envelope calculation, for every dollar you put into MSTR, you're getting less than 35 cents in NAV. Put another way, the fair value of MSTR is roughly $127 per share. The underlying value of MSTR has risen as investors pile money into the stock and the company issues shares on the open market at crazy high prices. Eventually, these two numbers will converge. However, it's not likely to be favorable for retail investors in MSTR. You can buy IBIT and get 100 cents of Bitcoin for each dollar you invest, and fees of somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.15% annually. Or you can buy MSTR and get less than 35 cents of value for each dollar you buy. This is a bubble that is all but guaranteed to burst. Bitcoin is going to outperform MSTR, and that's why MSTR is selling its stock to the public and buying Bitcoin with it. It's genius for them, but not so much for everyone piling in. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) illustrates how these types of market inefficiencies can work. Data by YCharts At first, GBTC traded for huge premiums to NAV. There was a game here. Institutional investors could buy GBTC at fair market value, hold for 6 months, and then sell to the public for 1.5 to 2x the value of the actual Bitcoin because there was so much demand. When people started to figure out that they were buying into a closed-end fund with high fees and no way out, the fund traded for a discount. That's when I started buying, knowing that they intended to convert the fund to an ETF to unlock the frozen value. A legal battle with the SEC ensued, but Grayscale won in the end, and it ended up being a great trade and outperforming Bitcoin itself. The discount eventually equalized. Today, MSTR trades for a higher premium to NAV than GBTC ever did, and most of the premium has appeared in a matter of weeks. Moreover, the company is actively unloading as much as $21 billion in stock at a premium to try to capture as much of this spread as possible. If you own MSTR, you should run, not walk to the exit. Simply sell and move your money into IBIT, and you avoid this whole accident waiting to happen. Bottom Line While I continue to be a long-term believer in Bitcoin, glaring market inefficiencies in copycat products underscore just how much misinformation and craziness there is in the crypto market. If you want to buy Bitcoin, I recommend dollar-cost averaging into IBIT and avoiding the swamp of crazy crypto products and funds out there.",GBTC|HOOD|IBIT|MSTR|BTC-USD|DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-19 00:12:04

Its price recently touched new highs and attracted unparalleled public interest. According to Google Trends, search interest for XRP surged on November 16 up to a perfect score of 100. Related Reading: XRP Breaks $1 ‚Äî Is The Garlinghouse-Trump Connection Fueling The Rise? This significant increase occurred mere days after interest had been stagnant at a measly 8, illustrating the rapidity with which sentiment can fluctuate in the cryptocurrency sector. A Remarkable Increase In Price The increase in search interest is in ideal harmony with the price performance of the coin. The altcoin was trading at approximately $0.77 on November 15, but it had risen to $1.27 by the following day, a remarkable 64% increase in just 24 hours. The current price of XRP is the highest it has been in three years, and many investors are enthusiastic about its potential to attain even greater heights. The most recent instance of a significant increase in interest in the crypto occurred in April 2021, when it reached a high of $1.96. Given the tumultuous history of XRP over the past few years, this recent rally is of particular importance. Now that it has regained its traction, the stagnation period and challenges it experienced have come to an end, and the price levels of the coin are hovering around the $0.40 dollar levels. Analysts are upbeat about its future, noting that the cryptocurrency remains well below its all-time high of $3.84, leaving ample room for potential growth. Factors Contributing To The Increase Newfound enthusiasm for XRP is being driven by a variety of factors. One significant factor is the accumulation of the digital asset by large investors, who are frequently referred to as ‚Äúwhales.‚Äù According to reports, these investors have recently invested more than $526 million in XRP, indicating their strong confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs future potential. Additionally, the recent increase in open interest for XRP futures indicates that traders are anticipating additional volatility and price fluctuations. The demand for XRP is on the rise as more retail investors become involved in the coin‚Äôs promise, motivated by the fear of missing out (FOMO). XRP: Regional Trends And Global Interest Interest in XRP is a worldwide phenomena, not limited in any one area at once. According to the statistics, searches for XRP point the charge towards the Netherlands, Australia, Ireland, Finland, and Slovenia. This general curiosity reflects a more general trend of revived interest in cryptocurrencies as they gather traction among regular investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike XRP currently trades at around $1.18. It has been able to maintain its price above $1, while even undergoing minor drawdowns.

Although there is a wide range of predictions, from conservative estimates of $5 to more ambitious forecasts that imply potential highs of $300, one thing is certain: XRP is once again on the radar and could be on the brink of an exciting future in the crypto market.

Over the last 24 hours, there has been a notable increase in the number of large DOGE transactions being moved across Dogecoin wallets. These large Dogecoin transactions, typically involving amounts greater than $100,000, are often regarded as an important indicator of a whale or institutional involvement in the market. Although the Dogecoin large transactions could as much be selloffs as they were accumulations, the sheer surge in activity shows a positive trend for the meme coin. Dogecoin Large Transaction Activity Intensifies The recent Dogecoin rally appears to be losing steam following an impressive surge that pushed its price above $0.42 for the first time since the 2021 bull market. A seeming profit-taking trend among traders that rode through the price rally has led to a pullback, bringing the Dogecoin price back below the $0.40 threshold. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is currently trading below $0.40, having corrected to a $0.346 low in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: XRP Price Rockets Past $1: On-Chain Data Unveils Key Holder Cohort Behind Breakout The correction has brought about the idea that maybe the Dogecoin price has finally expanded its sentiment among crypto investors. However, on-chain data suggests this might not be the case. Despite the price correction, the Dogecoin blockchain continued to witness a surge in activity. According to data from analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin recorded $23.35 billion in Dogecoin‚Äôs large transaction volume over the past 24 hours, representing a notable 41.12% increase compared to the previous day. In addition, the blockchain registered 157,190 active addresses during the same period, marking a 34.91% rise. What Does This Mean For DOGE Price? These metrics highlight sustained interest in Dogecoin, even amid its price correction. The sharp increase in Dogecoin‚Äôs large transaction volume and active addresses suggests that traders, particularly large holders, remain engaged with the meme coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Multiplier Ratio: Analyst Says The Party Is Just Getting Started This renewed interest appears to have translated into increased buying pressure, as evidenced by a concurrent price uptick in the past 24 hours. DOGE has risen by approximately 4% during the past 24 hours and is now up 7.4% from its weekend low. Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Captain Faibik has pointed out that the Dogecoin price is on the verge of breaking above the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern. This falling wedge formation has been developing since DOGE‚Äôs price peaked at a three-year high of $0.4265 on November 14 and began consolidating.

This Model Says So",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/135000-bitcoin-current-ceiling-model-says-so/,"The CryptoQuant founder has shared a model for Bitcoin that suggests the cryptocurrency‚Äôs maximum price could lie around $135,000 right now. Bitcoin Model Established On Realized Cap Could Reveal Price Ceiling & Floor In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about a BTC pricing model that‚Äôs based on the Realized Cap. The ‚ÄúRealized Cap‚Äù here refers to an on-chain valuation model for Bitcoin that assumes the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Down 7%, But Whales Continue To Buy For any token, its last transfer is likely to represent the last instance of it changing hands, so the price at its time could be considered as the token‚Äôs current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a sum of the cost basis of all coins on the network. Put another way, the Realized Cap measures the total amount of capital that the holders of the cryptocurrency as a whole have invested into it. A new metric can be derived from this indicator by dividing it by the total circulating supply, representing the cost basis for the average token or investor on the chain. This indicator is known as the Realized Price. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price itself isn‚Äôt of interest, but its two multipliers are: 3.9x and 0.75x. Below is the chart shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in these two multipliers of the Realized Price over the history of Bitcoin. In the graph, the CryptoQuant founder has marked the 3.9x multiplier of the Realized Price as BTC‚Äôs ‚Äúceiling price.‚Äù Similarly, the 0.75x multiplier represents the ‚Äúfloor price.‚Äù An inspection of the trend in the indicator during the past cycles reveals why the analyst has chosen to do so. It turns out that the asset has generally topped at or slightly above the 3.9x multiplier, while it has reached bottoms at or slightly under the 0.75x multiplier. At present, the ceiling price for the asset is sitting at a value of around $135,741, while the floor price at $26,104. Bitcoin is much higher than the latter right now, but there is also an appreciable distance to the former. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Is Finally Back: These Metrics Point To An Explosion In Interest This means that at the current amount of capital invested into the cryptocurrency, it still has room for growth, at least going by the pattern observed throughout history. Naturally, the ceiling price isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs certain to remain where it is now for the rest of the bull run, since any further fresh capital inflows into the asset would raise it. But for now, under $136,000 is looking like Bitcoin‚Äôs upper limit. BTC Price The Bitcoin rally has hit a pause button recently as the coin‚Äôs value is still trading around $90,000 right now.

ETH is slowly moving higher and might aim for a fresh surge above $3,220. Ethereum is consolidating and facing hurdles near $3,220. The price is trading above $3,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $3,220 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price remained supported above the $3,000 level like Bitcoin. ETH formed a base and recently moved above the $3,120 and $3,150 resistance levels. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even cleared the $3,200 level and tested $3,220. A high was formed at $3,224 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,051 swing low to the $3,224 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,200 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,220 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,250. A clear move above the $3,250 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,140 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,051 swing low to the $3,224 high. The first major support sits near the $3,050 zone. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward $3,000.

The price is now trading above $1.0850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $1.100 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could soon gain bullish momentum if it stays above the $1.00 support zone. XRP Price Aims Higher XRP price formed a base above the $1.00 level and recently started a fresh increase. It outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum with a move above the $1.050 and $1.080 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2745 swing high to the $0.9988 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1.150 resistance level before the bears appeared. It seems like the price faced resistance near $1.170. The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2745 swing high to the $0.9988 low is acting as a hurdle. However, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $1.100 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $1.080 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.1680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.200 level. The next key resistance could be $1.2740. A clear move above the $1.2740 resistance might send the price toward the $1.3220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.3500 resistance or even $1.3620 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $1.450. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $1.1680 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction.

Optimistic Bitcoin Price Outlook In a recent appearance on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box, Lee discussed the implications of the political landscape following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election, suggesting that Bitcoin could play a pivotal role in the upcoming administration. Lee articulated that Bitcoin could serve as a solution to some of the United States‚Äô fiscal challenges, particularly if it is designated as a national reserve asset‚Äîa promise made by Trump earlier this year at the National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. Related Reading: Trump Social Media Firm In Talks To Expand Into Crypto With Bakkt Acquisition The Fundstrat executive also highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs robust security features and its underlying blockchain technology, arguing that these elements position it as a viable alternative to some existing financial structures. Lee believes that Bitcoin‚Äôs attributes could address several issues inherent in the current economic framework, further boosting its appeal among investors. When discussing his price forecast, Lee expressed confidence, stating, ‚ÄúI think comfortably over $100,000 makes sense before the end of the year.‚Äù Lee noted that the current Bitcoin price trajectory is consistent with historical patterns observed during previous Halving cycles, events that typically reduce the rate at which new BTC are created and ultimately have a positive impact on price action. Key Support Levels Identified Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also provided insights into the current Bitcoin price price dynamics, but drawing parallels with historical market behavior. He noted that during the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin surged by 156% beyond its previous all-time high before experiencing a significant correction of -39%. Similarly, in 2020, Bitcoin rose 121% prior to a -32% pullback. Based on these patterns, Martinez suggests that Bitcoin could potentially reach at least $138,000 before facing its first major correction. Further analyzing past trends, Martinez pointed out that after Bitcoin broke its previous all-time high of $19,700 in 2020, it initially surged by 26%, consolidated for about a week, and then jumped to $40,000. Currently, Bitcoin has increased by 28% after surpassing its previous all-time high and has been consolidating for the past six days, leading Martinez to speculate that history might be repeating itself. However, he also cautioned that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a steep correction. He highlighted a growing sense of greed among crypto enthusiasts as evidenced by a notable spike in Google search interest for Bitcoin, reflected in the profits realized by investors, who have collectively taken home over $5.42 billion. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Makes Record $4.6 Billion Bitcoin Purchase, Largest Yet From a technical analysis standpoint, Martinez flagged the TD Sequential indicator, which has presented a sell signal on Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Bitcoin is currently in overbought territory, signaling potential for a price pullback. In the event of a correction, Martinez identified key support levels to monitor, specifically between $85,800 and $83,250, as well as further down at $75,520 to $72,880. The analyst emphasized that for a bullish outlook to remain intact, the Bitcoin price needs to maintain a sustained daily close above $91,900. Such a close could invalidate the bearish sentiment and potentially trigger a breakout toward a target of $100,680. As of this writing, the leading digital asset is trading at $90,970, up nearly 2% in the 24-hour time frame.

Metaplanet To Increase BTC Holdings Through Bond Issuance The Tokyo-listed company announced on November 18 that its Board of Directors had approved a debt sale with a guarantee worth 1.75 billion yen, or approximately $11.5 million. The bonds will have a one-year maturity period, maturing on November 17, 2025, and will carry an interest rate of 0.36% per annum.

Since April, the early-stage investment firm has steadily expanded its Bitcoin portfolio. For instance, the company¬†acquired an additional 20.195 BTC in June, worth roughly $1.2 million. It¬†added another 38.464 BTC in September, valued at approximately $2 million. Most recently, in October, the firm announced it had purchased 156.78 BTC, bringing its total holdings to over 1,000 BTC. Despite the announcement of the bond issuance, Metaplanet‚Äôs share price saw little movement. The firm‚Äôs share closed the day with a modest 0.81% increase on Monday. However, since the company began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, its stock has experienced explosive growth. On April 4, 2024, Metaplanet‚Äôs shares traded at 190 yen ($1.23). Today, they trade at 1,994 yen ($12.86), reflecting gains of nearly 950% in just over seven months. Bitcoin Supply Scarcity To Further Propel Price? With increasing retail, institutional, and even sovereign demand, Bitcoin‚Äôs limited supply could lead to a supply shock, potentially driving the digital asset‚Äôs price to unprecedented levels. As a reminder, BTC‚Äôs total supply is capped at 21 million by design. Related Reading: Bitcoin Continues To Exit Exchanges As Supply Drops To New 2024 Low According to a recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, BTC reserves on cryptocurrency trading platforms have fallen to a five-year low. The analyst also noted that more investors hold Bitcoin long-term as a hedge against rising inflation and currency debasement. Similarly, a recent report suggests that BTC demand vastly exceeds its supply. This growing supply-demand imbalance may set the stage for Bitcoin‚Äôs next major price breakout. BTC trades at $90,909 at press time, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from Yahoo!

The flagship cryptocurrency just started its ‚Äúparabolic phase,‚Äù sitting 3.4% below its all-time high (ATH), which could bring ‚Äúmassive moves‚Äù for BTC this week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike Bitcoin ‚ÄòParabolic Phase‚Äô Just Started Bitcoin has seen a massive surge in the last two weeks, jumping 32% to the $89,000-$90,000 price range. BTC‚Äôs remarkable performance saw it soar 11% last Monday, preparing the ground for its eventual surge toward its latest ATH of $93,400 two days later. Since then, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has hovered between the $89,000-$92,000 range, briefly falling to $87,000 last Friday. Over the weekend, the flagship crypto continued to move within this rage, registering its largest weekly close in Bitcoin history. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that BTC is barely starting its ‚Äúparabolic phase,‚Äù noting that week three of the cycle‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst price discovery uptrend‚Äù started today. The analyst explained that, historically, BTC has seen around 300 days of parabolic run each cycle, with the first major pullback coming over a month after entering price discovery mode. Per the post, it took six weeks before the flagship crypto‚Äôs first major pullback in 2013. In 2017, BTC rallied for eight weeks before registering a deeper pullback. Meanwhile, it soared for four weeks before experiencing a major retrace in the 2020-2021 cycle. Based on this, the analyst considers that ‚Äúhistory suggests there‚Äôs more upside to come and that the first Price Discovery Correction is still weeks away.‚Äù Is A Move Massive Move Coming This Week? Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin seems to be repeating 2020‚Äôs pattern. In 2020, after breaking its previous ATH of $19,700, BTC rose 26% and consolidated for a week. Following its consolidation, BTC jumped 66% toward $40,000 in the next two weeks. Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin has risen 28% since surpassing its March ATH and has been consolidating for nearly a week. This suggests that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price could be getting ready for a substantial surge in the following days, potentially hitting the $100,000 mark this week. Crypto Yapper, another market watcher, stated that Bitcoin will likely make a ‚Äúmassive move‚Äù soon. The analyst highlighted the flagship crypto‚Äôs consolidation, noting the significant price action around the $89,000-$90,000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Aren‚Äôt Backing Down: Rally Continues? This horizontal level acted as a key resistance zone earlier last week but has been confirmed as support throughout the past five days. As Bitcoin retested the $91,000 earlier today, the analyst also pointed out its price could continue the bullish trajectory and aim for a new ATH around $95,000. Additionally, BTC started the week breaking out of a one-week symmetrical triangle pattern. To Crypto Yapper, this is a ‚Äútypical continuation pattern‚Äù for the cryptocurrency, which suggests that Bitcoin is set to continue its climb if the breakout is confirmed throughout the day. The analyst stated that BTC‚Äôs continuation of its uptrend could hit $100,000 by Sunday. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,260, a 10% increase in the weekly timeframe.
