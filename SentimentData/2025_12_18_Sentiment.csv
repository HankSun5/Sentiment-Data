This pivotal approval from India’s Competition Commission (CCI) signals a major step forward for institutional crypto adoption in one of the world’s most crucial markets. But what does this strategic Coinbase stake in CoinDCX truly mean for the future of digital assets in India? Let’s dive into the details. What Does the Coinbase and CoinDCX Partnership Entail? First, it’s crucial to clarify the nature of this deal. Reports initially swirled about a potential full acquisition. However, both companies have firmly denied these claims. The reality is a strategic equity investment—a Coinbase stake in CoinDCX . This distinction is important. It represents a partnership rather than a takeover, allowing CoinDCX to leverage Coinbase’s global expertise while maintaining its operational independence and deep understanding of the local Indian market. The approval from the CCI was the final regulatory hurdle. This body ensures fair competition and prevents monopolies. Its clearance confirms that this partnership is viewed as beneficial for market health and consumer choice, not a threat to it. Why is This Approval a Game-Changer for India’s Crypto Scene? India represents a massive, tech-savvy population with immense potential for cryptocurrency adoption. However, the regulatory environment has been complex. This move by a giant like Coinbase, following proper channels, adds a layer of legitimacy and confidence to the entire ecosystem. The benefits of this Coinbase stake in CoinDCX are multifaceted: Enhanced Liquidity and Access: Collaboration could lead to better liquidity pools and more trading pairs for Indian users. Advanced Security Protocols: Coinbase’s renowned security infrastructure can help bolster safety standards locally. Product Innovation: Expect to see more sophisticated trading tools and investment products tailored for Indian investors. Regulatory Dialogue: This partnership strengthens the voice of the industry in ongoing discussions with Indian policymakers. Coinbase’s Direct Plans: Rupee On-Ramps by 2026 Parallel to this investment, Coinbase has resumed new user registrations in India through its own app. More importantly, the company has announced plans to support direct cryptocurrency purchases using the Indian Rupee (INR) starting in 2026. This is a critical development. Currently, many Indian users face hurdles converting local currency into crypto. Direct INR support would simplify the onboarding process dramatically, removing a significant barrier to entry. It shows Coinbase’s dual-track strategy: investing in a local champion (CoinDCX) while also preparing its own direct service offering for the future. Navigating Challenges and Future Outlook Despite the optimism, challenges remain. India’s tax treatment of crypto assets is still a point of discussion for the broader community. Furthermore, educating a vast new user base and ensuring robust consumer protection will be ongoing priorities for both exchanges. However, the final approval for a Coinbase stake in CoinDCX is undeniably a watershed moment. It demonstrates that major global players see long-term value in the Indian market and are willing to engage with its regulatory framework. This vote of confidence can accelerate institutional interest and pave the way for more structured growth. Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point The final nod for Coinbase’s strategic stake in CoinDCX is more than just a business transaction. It’s a powerful signal of maturation for India’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. This partnership blends global scale with local expertise, aiming to build a more secure, accessible, and innovative digital asset environment for millions of users. As Coinbase also lays the groundwork for direct rupee transactions, the period leading to 2026 is poised to be a transformative chapter for crypto in India. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did Coinbase fully acquire CoinDCX? A: No. Both companies have denied reports of a full acquisition. The deal is a strategic equity investment, meaning Coinbase has taken a significant stake in CoinDCX as a partner and investor. Q2: What does CCI approval mean? A: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) ensures fair market competition. Its final approval means the regulatory body does not see this partnership as creating a monopoly or harming consumer choice, clearing the last major hurdle for the deal. Q3: Can I use Coinbase in India now? A: Coinbase has resumed new user registrations in India through its app. However, full support for direct deposits and purchases in Indian Rupees (INR) is planned for 2026. Q4: How will this partnership benefit Indian crypto users? A: Users can expect potential benefits like enhanced platform security, greater liquidity, more trading options, and innovative products developed from the combined expertise of both exchanges. Q5: Does this make cryptocurrency legal in India? A: Cryptocurrency is not illegal in India, but it exists in a regulatory gray area with specific tax implications. This high-profile, approved investment is a positive step toward greater regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance. Q6: What is the strategic importance of this stake? A: The Coinbase stake in CoinDCX allows Coinbase to tap into the Indian market through a trusted local leader while providing CoinDCX with global resources, creating a powerful synergy.

Related Reading: Here Are The Meme Coins With Over 100% Rallies While Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Struggle After more than a year trading within a broad range, recent price action suggests that the long-standing balance between buyers and sellers is under strain. At the same time, macroeconomic uncertainty and technical upgrades are reshaping how investors assess risk around the asset. SOL has spent much of 2024 and 2025 oscillating between major support and resistance zones, but recent attempts to rebound have been increasingly shallow. Price is now hovering just above key demand areas, with traders closely watching whether these levels can continue to absorb selling pressure. Solana Price Near Key Support as Bearish Signals Build From a technical perspective, Solana has slipped toward the lower end of its multi-month range, from $145 to $120. Momentum indicators remain weak, with relative strength measures remaining below neutral levels and trend indicators indicating continued downside pressure. Repeated failures to reclaim former support zones have shifted attention to the $120–$125 area, which has acted as a floor several times in recent months. A decisive break below this band could expose SOL to a move toward the $100 region, where historical demand clusters sit. Some analysts warn that if selling accelerates and liquidity thins, the price could overshoot that level before stabilizing. Others note that volume has declined alongside price, suggesting hesitation rather than panic, which leaves room for a short-term bounce if buyers step in. Macro Signals Add to Uncertainty Broader economic conditions are adding another layer of complexity. Rising U.S. unemployment and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts have kept markets divided. Lower rates have historically supported crypto assets by improving liquidity, but mixed signals from policymakers have limited risk appetite so far. For Solana, this means macro optimism has yet to translate into sustained inflows. Traders appear reluctant to commit heavily until there is clearer guidance from the Fed. A dovish shift could support a relief rally, while a pause in easing may reinforce downside risks and keep SOL pinned near current levels. Network Resilience Meets Long-Term Transition While price struggles, Solana’s network continues to evolve. The blockchain recently withstood one of the largest DDoS attacks recorded, maintaining transaction speeds with minimal disruption. Separately, the Solana Foundation has begun testing post-quantum cryptographic signatures, signaling preparation for long-term security challenges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculative Activity Cooling Fast: IFP Shows Steep Slide These developments underline improving infrastructure resilience, but they have not yet offset near-term market pressure. For now, SOL’s outlook hinges on whether buyers can defend key support as macro conditions and technical signals converge. A clear break or rebound near $100 is likely to define sentiment into early 2026.

Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/best-xrp-buy-zone-analyst-key-levels/,"Will Taylor, founder of CryptoinsightUK, frames XRP’s “best buy area” as a risk-to-reward question, not a certainty call. In his latest YouTube video from Dec. 17, he argues that XRP is trading back in the lower portion of a well-defined range, which is typically where entries make the most sense for range traders—because invalidation levels are clearer and upside targets are structurally defined. “We’re at the bottom of the range this area, the bottom of the range, and the bottom of the range has been quite wide,” Taylor said. “So, I’d say between like $2.01, then all the way down to about $1.60. This has been the best area to enter […] for the last […] basically year and a bit.” And his emphasis is that it’s attractive because the trade is measurable, not because it’s guaranteed. “Does this mean we can’t break down further? Does this mean we can’t lose support? No, that’s not what I’m saying at all,” he added. “But what I am saying is if you use range trading, if you want to know the best areas for risk-to-reward, we’re at them now.” Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M On lower timeframes, Taylor said XRP has already swept much of the downside liquidity, leaving a smaller pocket below that could still get tagged. He pointed to ~$1.83 as the remaining area of interest. “XRP has taken most of this red liquidity to the downside. There’s a small pocket of liquidity below us still at $1.83,” he said. And crucially, that level is not academic for him — it’s tied to his own stop placement and whether the market is likely to wick lower before any sustained move up. “This is something that I’m considering […] as to whether to move my stop loss below this liquidity down at like say $1.79,” Taylor said. “My stop loss [is] $1.834 at the minute. Do I take it to say like $1.79 […] give us […] the bottom of this wick as potential support and that liquidity. That’s a potential discussion.” The Upside Trigger For XRP Taylor’s near-term bullish trigger is a reclaim of ~$2.07. His reasoning is positioning-driven: he thinks the market has built a meaningful amount of short exposure during the drawdown, and a move back above that level could force covering. Related Reading: XRP Falls Below $2 As $721 Million Profit-Take Hits Market “When you start to get a buildup of […] lower highs like this, all it takes is a bit of momentum to break us above,” he said. “So, say for XRP, if we start to get back above $2.07, you probably should see price squeeze to $2.58-$2.60 quite quickly […] as we squeeze out all of this […] open interest that’s been adding in as price has been coming down.” Taylor’s XRP view is nested inside a broader “crypto is mispriced” thesis. When comparing crypto’s market cap performance against a basket of traditional assets, he argues that crypto has decoupled sharply since the Oct. 10 crash, while sentiment has deteriorated. “Crypto has like decoupled from every other asset class […] crypto is about the only asset that has decoupled this hard,” he said. “I personally believe this is a deep value zone […] we’re clearly mispriced versus other assets.” He also repeatedly leaned on the idea that positioning is skewed: rising open interest into downside, negative premium, and funding flipping between positive and negative — conditions that can set up a squeeze if price starts reclaiming levels. “I think a lot of the market generally is setting up for a bit of a short squeeze to the upside,” Taylor said. “And I think that people are overly negative and […] the sentiment’s overly bearish compared to where the price is.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.92.

This critical action comes as a direct response to an emergency network upgrade, following a concerning halt in block production. For traders holding assets like POL and GMT, this news is a pivotal development that requires immediate understanding. Why Did Upbit Suspend the Polygon Network? The core reason behind this suspension is an urgent technical issue. The Polygon network itself initiated an emergency upgrade after its block production unexpectedly stopped. When a blockchain halts block production, new transactions cannot be confirmed or added to the ledger. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must proactively suspend related services to protect user funds and prevent transactions from being lost or stuck in limbo during the network instability. This is a standard security protocol in the cryptocurrency industry. However, it highlights the inherent challenges of operating within decentralized ecosystems where third-party network performance directly impacts exchange operations. The suspension is a precaution, not necessarily an indication of a problem with Upbit’s own platform. Which Assets Are Affected by This Suspension? The temporary halt specifically impacts any digital asset that utilizes the Polygon network for transfers on Upbit. The exchange has named two major tokens in its announcement: POL (Polygon Ecosystem Token): The native token of the revamped Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. GMT (STEPN): The governance token of the move-to-earn fitness application. It is crucial for users to note that trading of these assets may still be available on Upbit’s internal order books. The suspension applies only to moving tokens on or off the exchange via the Polygon network. Always check the official Upbit announcement page for the most current and complete list of affected assets. What Should Upbit Users Do Now? If you are an Upbit user, do not panic. This is a temporary, protective measure. Here are your actionable steps: Do Not Initiate Deposits: Any attempt to deposit POL, GMT, or other Polygon-based assets to your Upbit wallet during the suspension will likely fail or be significantly delayed. Withdrawals Are On Hold: You cannot withdraw these assets to an external Polygon wallet until Upbit resumes services. Monitor Official Channels: For updates, rely solely on official Upbit announcements via their website or verified social media. Avoid speculation from unverified sources. Consider the Network: Remember, this is a Polygon network issue. Other exchanges may implement similar suspensions, so check the status if you plan to use other platforms. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? While disruptive for direct users, this event serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnected nature of cryptocurrency infrastructure. An issue on a major Layer-2 network like Polygon can ripple through to top-tier exchanges, affecting liquidity and user activity. It underscores the importance of: Network Reliability: The need for robust, fault-tolerant blockchain systems. Exchange Risk Management: How leading exchanges like Upbit implement safeguards. User Education: The critical need for traders to understand the underlying technology of their assets. Historically, such suspensions are resolved within hours or a few days once the underlying network is stable and the exchange has completed its safety checks. Conclusion: A Temporary Hiccup in a Maturing Ecosystem The decision by Upbit to suspend Polygon network services is a prudent and expected response to unforeseen blockchain turbulence. It prioritizes the security of user assets above all else. For the crypto community, it’s a moment to reflect on the growing pains of a rapidly evolving industry. As networks and exchanges coordinate to resolve these issues, the overall system demonstrates its resilience. The key takeaway is that such events, while inconvenient, are part of the process that leads to more robust and reliable infrastructure for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade POL and GMT on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Possibly. The suspension is for deposits and withdrawals via the Polygon network. Internal trading on Upbit’s platform may remain active, but you should verify this on the exchange’s trading interface. Q2: How long will Upbit suspend Polygon network deposits and withdrawals? A2: The duration is not specified but is directly tied to the completion of the Polygon network upgrade and subsequent security verifications by Upbit. Monitor their official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my funds safe on Upbit during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a security measure designed specifically to keep your funds safe. Assets held in your Upbit account are not at risk due to this network-level action. Q4: Does this affect other exchanges besides Upbit? A4: It might. Since the issue originated on the Polygon network, other exchanges that support Polygon-based assets may enact similar temporary suspensions as a precaution. Always check the status with your specific exchange. Q5: What is an emergency network upgrade? A5: It is a critical software update deployed by a blockchain development team to fix a severe bug, vulnerability, or performance issue (like halted block production) that cannot wait for a scheduled upgrade. Q6: Will this suspension affect the price of POL or GMT? A6: It could cause short-term volatility due to reduced liquidity from halted deposits/withdrawals on a major exchange like Upbit. However, the long-term price depends on broader market factors and the swift resolution of the network issue. Found this breakdown of why Upbit suspended Polygon network services helpful?

Bitcoin price prediction metrics suggest that the price must reclaim the $100,000 psychological threshold to prevent a deep bear market decline. Fear Index Hits Extreme Territory as Year-End Approaches Bitcoin’s Fear & Greed Index has plummeted to 11, signaling Extreme Fear. Crypto Markets Enter a Slowdown Phase “The number of active Bitcoin wallets has fallen to its lowest level in the past year, indicating that even when prices move, fewer participants are actually transacting.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/pt9RAEwx0M — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 17, 2025 According to a Japanese analyst at XWIN Research , fresh capital inflows into Bitcoin are beginning to diminish, and as year-end nears, both participation and capital typically become less active, further reducing market liquidity. “In such an environment, price action tends to become more volatile due to thin liquidity. At the same time, reduced noise allows the underlying supply and demand dynamics to become clearer,” the analysts explained. Crypto analyst Moreno also observed that Bitcoin sits at a level carrying more significance than appearances suggest. The current $86,000 price rests above the True Market Mean Price (TMMP), which represents the average on-chain acquisition price of investors, excluding miners. Moreno projects that if Bitcoin maintains above the TMMP ($81,500), the bull trend would be well alive. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Critical $81K Defense Zone Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays a clear transition from expansion to correction following repeated failures above the $100,000 psychological resistance. Price has definitively lost the $100,000 level and now trades below key moving averages, which have begun rolling over and functioning as dynamic resistance around the $103,000–$108,000 zone. The most crucial structural level on the downside sits at $81,000, marked as the average cost basis support. Source: TradingView Price currently hovers just above this zone, making it a critical inflection point for the broader market. The MACD remains firmly bearish with expanding negative histogram bars, signaling downside momentum still dominates despite the recent slowdown in selling pressure. Moreover, a sustained weekly close below $81,000 would expose the final bull-market defense near $74,000, where stronger long-term buyers are expected to emerge. Conversely, reclaiming $100,000 and maintaining above it would be necessary to invalidate bearish momentum and reopen pathways for advancement back toward the $105,000–$110,000 range. Pepenode Raises $2.3M Ahead of Bitcoin Post-Breakout Rally If Bitcoin finally breaks the $100,000 resistance and initiates the 2026 bull run, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) would experience increased demand. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite the crypto market losing over 30% of its value since October. It’s a game where you can mine coins without needing expensive hardware setups. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining rigs , and upgrade your facilities to earn PEPENODE tokens. Now that more people are investing in Pepenode’s mining rigs, the presale price is advancing rapidly. To join the presale before the ongoing round sells out, go to the official Pepenode website , and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet. You can then buy PEPENODE tokens for $0.0012016 and pay with crypto using ETH or USDT, or use a bank card for fast payment.

55950998,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92622,1766014252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Rich List: Can Long-Term Holders Realistically Retire on Crypto Gains?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-rich-list-can-long-term-holders-realistically-retire-on-crypto-gains/,"Many long-term XRP holders view their investment as a potential path to financial independence. Within this context, the XRP Rich List has become a frequent reference point for investors assessing their chances of retiring on crypto gains alone. However, whether reaching one of these tiers can realistically support retirement within the next ten years requires a careful review of both distribution data and price assumptions. XRP has maintained relevance in the digital asset market for more than twelve years, consistently ranking among the most liquid cryptocurrencies. Historical performance data shows that early adopters who accumulated XRP near launch achieved exceptional returns. While those outcomes are well documented, current investors face a very different market environment, prompting renewed debate over whether comparable gains remain achievable. Growth of the XRP Holder Base Recent on-chain data indicates that the number of XRP wallets has expanded meaningfully. At present, approximately 7.41 million addresses are holding XRP, reflecting an increase of more than 1.5 million wallets within the year. This growth suggests renewed participation in the network and a broadening investor base, even as price volatility persists. Despite this expansion, XRP ownership remains unevenly distributed. A relatively small percentage of wallets control a significant share of total supply, which is where the Rich List becomes relevant for long-term financial projections. XRP Rich List Thresholds Explained Current distribution metrics show that entry into the top 10% of XRP holders requires a balance of at least 2,316 XRP. The bar rises sharply for higher tiers, with the top 5% holding no less than 8,010 XRP. Meanwhile, wallets in the top 1% each control 48,895 XRP or more. These thresholds provide a framework for estimating potential outcomes under different price scenarios. Larger balances naturally offer greater leverage if XRP experiences sustained appreciation, but they also highlight how difficult it can be for newer investors to reach upper tiers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Retirement Targets and Regional Differences Retirement goals vary significantly depending on geographic location. In higher-cost economies such as the United States, surveys often cite $1 million as a minimum target for retirement. In contrast, individuals in lower-cost regions may require substantially less capital to achieve similar lifestyle outcomes. Using a $1 million benchmark, investors in the top 10% tier would need XRP to exceed $430 per token to meet that target. For those in the top 5%, a price near $125 would suffice. Investors within the top 1% would reach the same threshold at approximately $20 per XRP. Can XRP Reach These Levels in Ten Years? Whether these price levels are attainable within a decade remains uncertain. According to projections from Google Gemini, XRP could reach a maximum hypothetical price of $100 over the next ten years under highly favorable conditions. At that level, top 1% holders would control multimillion-dollar portfolios, while those in the top 5% could approach or surpass retirement benchmarks in many regions. However, such forecasts remain speculative. Market cycles, regulatory developments, adoption rates, and broader economic conditions will ultimately determine XRP’s long-term valuation. While placement on the XRP Rich List may improve the probability of achieving financial independence, it does not eliminate risk or guarantee retirement within a defined timeframe.

The comparison gained momentum after Kalshi’s head of crypto, John Wang, described prediction markets as “the meme coins of 2023,” arguing that both capture attention during periods when traders are searching for asymmetric opportunities. JUST IN: Head of crypto at Kalshi John Wang says “prediction markets are the memecoins of 2023.” pic.twitter.com/ZtGGHBSaht — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) December 15, 2025 The remark landed as meme coin activity cooled sharply following a volatile run that defined much of the last two years. Meme Coins Had Their Moment — Is This the Collapse Phase? Meme coins surged in 2023, driven by new token launches and heavy social media exposure. The sector’s total market capitalization reached nearly $22 billion by the end of that year, while trading activity expanded dramatically. Source: Coinmarketcap Data from the period shows average trading volume rising more than ninefold over the first eleven months. Two intense rallies defined the year, particularly an April–May burst fueled by highly speculative launches. That speculative energy carried into 2024, when meme coins climbed to an estimated peak market cap of around $150 billion in December, helped by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and a wave of political-themed tokens. The reversal was equally sharp. By late 2025, the sector’s total value had fallen below $42 billion, with daily volumes shrinking and individual tokens losing most of their prior gains. Source: Coinmarketcap Market data now shows memecoin trading volumes down roughly 85% from their highs, reflecting a broad pullback in risk appetite. Are Traders Done With Meme Coins? Prediction Markets Are Quietly Taking Over As meme coins faded, prediction markets moved in the opposite direction. Platforms such as Kalshi, Polymarket, and Limitless recorded a combined $44 billion in trading volume this year, with Kalshi alone reaching $1 billion in weekly volume, driven largely by sports and political contracts. Source: dune/datadashboards On-chain prediction markets have expanded even faster. Monthly volume has jumped from under $100 million in early 2024 to more than $13 billion today, a 130-fold increase, according to joint research from Keyrock and Dune Analytics. Non-sports markets, including economics, politics, and technology-related events, accounted for most of the growth in 2025. The structure of prediction markets differs sharply from memecoins, a point repeatedly raised by industry participants.

Supporters argue this creates clearer pricing and limits some of the manipulation risks that have plagued low-liquidity token markets. Honestly makes sense why people are just moving over to Polymarket and all these other prediction market platforms. You don’t have to worry about 12 year olds bundling coins, you don’t have worry about your “favorite” kol shilling a coin then full clipping soon after, you don’t… — GH0STEE (@gh0stee) December 15, 2025 Critics counter that returns are capped by design, making it harder for smaller traders to achieve outsized gains compared with early-stage memecoin trades. Can Prediction Markets Kill Meme Coins? Framing the trend as “prediction markets killing memecoins” misses the point. Memecoins are not dead. Liquidity has simply receded, and that contraction is affecting many other crypto sectors as well. History shows that meme-driven markets tend to hibernate, not disappear. When volatility returns and risk appetite expands, memecoins can resurface quickly. At the same time, prediction markets are clearly earning a durable user base. Their growth isn’t purely cyclical hype; it’s being driven by real-world events, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and demand for structured speculation. That gives them a resilience memecoins often lack during downturns. The more likely outcome is coexistence, not replacement . Memecoins will continue to dominate during speculative surges and attention-driven cycles. Prediction markets will attract traders seeking clarity, probability-based pricing, and event-driven exposure. They serve different psychological and financial needs. If anything, the current shift shows a maturing crypto market, one where capital rotates rather than evaporates and where speculation takes multiple forms instead of clustering around a single narrative.

Investors who deposited fiat “into an FTX- or Alameda-related account” between 2019 and 2022 are encouraged to submit claims for a $10 million settlement filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California The lawsuit indicates that Investors have until Jan. 30 to opt out or file a claim as part of a settlement that “resolves a lawsuit over whether Silvergate Bank, Silvergate Capital Corporation, and Alan J. Lane aided and abetted tortious conduct on the part of FTX, Alameda, and Sam Bankman-Fried. “The Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate ,” said a Dec. 8 court filing asking for approval. “It marks a significant recovery from the bankrupt Silvergate and will provide additional relief, beyond that obtained in the FTX Bankruptcy, for those affected by the multi-billion-dollar collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.” Court sets final hearing as FTX-linked investors eye recovery Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro will hold a final hearing to consider the settlement on Feb. 9, giving any investors tied to FTX and Alameda over 30 days to file claims. According to court filings, the FTX bankruptcy case has achieved over 46,000 potential claimants via mail, which could result in proportional payments from the $10 million settlement. Silvergate voluntarily wound down operations in March 2023. It was initially one of the few crypto-friendly banks in the US that had ties to the FTX exchange at the time of its collapse in November 2022. While most criminal cases against former FTX and Alameda executives have been resolved over the past three years, some civil cases remain, as well as a potential prosecution of another individual linked to the exchange. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame are serving federal prison sentences for their roles in the collapse. At the same time, executives Nishad Singh and Gary Wang received time served. Additionally, Michelle Bond, wife of Salame, faces campaign finance charges linked to FTX funds in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Her legal team says that prosecutors induced a guilty plea from Salame on the promise that they would not pursue a case against Bond. The next evidentiary hearing for Bond’s case is scheduled for March 4. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison moves to a community confinement program On related developments, former cryptocurrency executive Caroline Ellison, who was once Sam Bankman-Fried’s girlfriend, has been quietly transferred out of federal prison after serving approximately 11 months of her two-year sentence, according to Business Insider. The 31-year-old was moved on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to a community confinement program, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed. That indicates Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, will still be in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso noted. “For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual’s specific location while in community confinement,” Giamusso said. Data from prison records list Ellison’s projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. When reached out by reporters, her attorneys declined to comment for this story. In early November 2024, Ellison reported to the low-security Danbury prison to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s business empire. She had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme. Ellison served as the main witness in Bankman-Fried’s 2023 criminal trial , testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars’ worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.

In a recent commentary, Claver outlined how inefficiencies embedded in legacy banking frameworks continue to lock trillions of dollars out of productive use, creating conditions that favor neutral, real-time settlement assets. Legacy Banking and the $27 Trillion Liquidity Constraint Claver pointed to the continued reliance on correspondent banking structures, particularly the use of nostro and vostro accounts, as a major source of inefficiency. According to his assessment, banks worldwide must collectively immobilize roughly $27 trillion to facilitate cross-border payments. This capital remains parked to ensure transaction completion, rather than circulating through lending, investment, or economic activity. While the recent global adoption of ISO 20022 has improved data standards and communication between institutions, Claver emphasized that it does not resolve the underlying settlement delays. In his view, the standard serves as an upgrade to messaging infrastructure, not a solution to liquidity fragmentation or pre-funding requirements. Why Stablecoins Do Not Solve Institutional Settlement Claver also challenged the notion that stablecoins alone can address these issues. He argued that most stablecoins function as liabilities tied to specific issuers, making them unsuitable as neutral settlement tools between competing institutions. From a balance-sheet perspective, banks remain reluctant to hold digital liabilities issued by other entities, particularly at scale. He further noted that widespread institutional reliance on stablecoins could recreate existing inefficiencies. Managing multiple issuer-specific digital assets would fragment liquidity and increase operational complexity, undermining the efficiency gains the technology aims to deliver. XRP as a Neutral Settlement Layer Against this backdrop, Claver positioned XRP as a settlement asset designed to operate independently of institutional balance sheets. He highlighted XRP’s ability to facilitate value transfer without pre-funded accounts, while settling transactions in seconds at low cost. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Claver, this neutrality allows XRP to function as a bridge between financial infrastructures without introducing counterparty exposure. He also referenced the XRP Ledger’s operational history, noting its long-term stability and extensive testing by financial institutions for backend settlement use cases rather than consumer-facing payments. Tokenized Deposits, AMMs, and Market Structure Shifts Claver suggested that banks are more likely to adopt tokenized deposits and on-chain financial products than to rely on public stablecoins. These instruments allow institutions to maintain yield from treasury holdings while enabling real-time settlement and programmability. He also addressed the growing role of automated market makers on networks like the XRP Ledger, arguing that they can reduce liquidity gaps, tighten spreads, and improve price efficiency through continuous rebalancing. Finally, Claver warned that high leverage, rising debt levels, and prolonged restrictive monetary policy could trigger a broad market repricing across asset classes. However, he framed this as a transition rather than a collapse. In such an environment, governments and institutions would require real-time settlement systems, shared ledgers, and programmable financial infrastructure to manage liquidity and policy execution effectively. Within that framework, Claver believes XRP could benefit as financial markets shift toward more automated, efficient, and interoperable settlement mechanisms.

55954238,646168,1766016033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55954238.jpeg,Grayscale Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Hit A New All-Time High,https://bitcoinist.com/when-bitcoin-price-all-time-high/,"Grayscale, one of the world’s largest digital asset managers, outlined its 2026 Digital Asset Outlook, projecting that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. The forecast is based on structural changes in market design, expanding institutional participation, and broader macroeconomic forces . These developments form the foundation of Grayscale’s view that capital structure and demand dynamics will define Bitcoin’s next market phase. Institutional Capital Redefines The Bitcoin Price Growth Curve A central pillar of Grayscale’s outlook is the transition of Bitcoin from a retail-led asset to an institutionally supported financial instrument . The firm argues that the market is entering a phase where large allocators, including asset managers, advisory platforms, and long-term capital pools, are no longer evaluating Bitcoin as an experiment but as a portfolio component. This shift fundamentally alters demand behavior, replacing short-term trading flows with measured, strategic allocations. Grayscale highlights that regulatory progress and clearer market rules are reducing friction for institutions that previously remained sidelined. As operational and compliance barriers fall, capital that once avoided digital assets due to uncertainty can now enter with greater confidence. This gradual but persistent inflow model creates sustained upward pressure on price rather than sharp, unstable spikes. Crucially, Grayscale notes that institutional exposure to Bitcoin remains relatively small compared to traditional asset classes. From a portfolio construction perspective, this leaves significant room for expansion. Even modest increases in allocation percentages can translate into meaningful demand, especially given Bitcoin’s fixed supply. The firm views this imbalance between potential demand and limited issuance as a key reason price discovery is expected to continue upward into 2026. Macro Pressures And Supply Dynamics Set The Stage For New Highs Beyond institutional adoption , Grayscale’s outlook identifies macroeconomic conditions as a key driver shaping Bitcoin’s next phase of price expansion. Elevated sovereign debt, currency dilution, and persistent inflation risks are directing capital toward assets with transparent and finite supply. In this context, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance schedule reinforces its role as a macro-aligned asset. This macro framing also underpins Grayscale’s reassessment of Bitcoin’s traditional four-year market cycles . As the asset integrates further into mainstream finance, the firm argues that historical, halving-centered models are losing relevance. In their place, Bitcoin’s valuation is increasingly influenced by liquidity conditions, market access, and investor behavior aligned with other macro-sensitive assets. This transition signals a market responding to structural inputs rather than repeating legacy patterns. Supply dynamics further strengthen this view . As issuance slows and long-term Bitcoin holders retain more coins, market liquidity tightens. Combined with expanding demand channels, this creates an environment where price appreciation is supported by structural fundamentals rather than episodic surges. Grayscale’s analysis indicates that these factors could drive Bitcoin to a new all-time high in early 2026.

What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. Related Reading: Who Really Sold The Dip? On-Chain Data Exposes Bitcoin’s True Sellers However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. The New Fundamentals Behind Bitcoin’s Supercycle Thesis According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory.

Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies.

A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

The Board said the financial system changed enough to make the earlier rule useless. The new move applies to both insured and uninsured banks under the Fed’s watch and brings direct consequences for crypto-linked firms that want stable access to payment rails. Fed changes federal access for crypto companies in America “New technologies offer efficiencies to banks and improved products and services to bank customers,” Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said . “By creating a pathway for responsible, innovative products and services, the Board is helping ensure that the banking sector remains safe and sound while also modern, efficient, and effective.” The 2023 policy forced state member banks to follow the same activity rules that other federal regulators used. It also tried to lay out how banks should handle new tools. After it came out, the Board said the financial system shifted and its own understanding grew, so it cleared the rule and replaced it. The new policy lets banks under the Fed take part in certain innovative activities, which matters for firms like Circle, Paxos, Tether, and BitGo. These companies will now place customer reserves directly at the Fed instead of routing everything through commercial banks. That lowers costs and cuts counterparty risk while giving them more control over flows. Some companies tried other ways to reach the Fed’s payment system.The big one was specialty banking charters. One example is Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institution setup, built for crypto companies. Custodia Bank, one of the first to use it, sued the Federal Reserve Board and the Kansas City Fed for what it called “a patently unlawful delay.” A court dismissed the case, and Custodia appealed.

She will now work with MoonPay as its Chief Legal and Administrative Officer. With Caroline Pham’s exit from the CFTC to join the crypto payment company, MoonPay, Mike Selig, a crypto lawyer will fill her role. She follows a path walked by Bo Hines , former White House Crypto Council executive director, who joined Tether, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Hines reportedly now leads the firm’s US expansion activity, while tasked with maintaining compliance with the new requirements of the GENIUS bill. Caroline Pham leaves the CFTC Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is moving to the crypto payments company called MoonPay after working at the commission for nearly four years. “I’m excited to join MoonPay at a pivotal moment,” Pham said in a statement . Pham’s new role involves overseeing all global legal and administrative functions while also leading the company’s policy and regulatory strategy in Washington. Pham’s role at CFTC will be filled by crypto lawyer, Mike Selig, who is now preparing for Senate confirmation. The final vote on his appointment is expected early next week. Pham spent seven years at Citigroup, one of Wall Street’s largest banks before being confirmed as a Republican commissioner starting in 2022. She went on to be unanimously elected as acting chairman in January 2025. During her tenure, Pham encouraged modernization efforts at the CFTC through what she called the “Crypto Sprint,” a series of initiatives designed to bring regulatory clarity to digital asset markets. On December 4, she announced that listed spot crypto products would trade for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets through CFTC-registered futures exchanges. She also launched a pilot program that allowed Bitcoin, Ether, and stablecoin USDC to be used as collateral in U.S. derivatives markets. Tokenized assets such as Treasuries and money market funds were also explored for the same purpose. Last week, Pham said the agency would be withdrawing guidance focused on the “actual delivery” of digital assets, calling it “outdated and overly complex”. She also established the CFTC CEO Innovation Council, naming twelve CEOs to the forum and the Digital Asset Markets Pilot Program, launched on December 8, 2025. Her partnership with SEC Chair Paul Atkins resulted in improved collaboration between the two agencies, despite previous clashes over digital asset oversight. Why did MoonPay hire Pham? MoonPay, founded by Ivan Soto-Wright, Victor Faramond and Maximilian Crown in 2019, is a Miami-based company that provides payment infrastructure for users to purchase cryptocurrencies and digital assets using traditional payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers, and mobile payment options. The company reportedly has more than 30 million customers across 180 countries and supports more than 500 enterprise customers in both crypto and fintech industries. MoonPay raised $555 million in November 2021 in an investment round led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. The deal valued MoonPay at $3.4 billion. In March 2025, the company acquired the crypto checkout startup, Helio, for $175 million and announced the acquisition of the stablecoin platform, Iron. In the second half of 2025, MoonPay secured both its New York BitLicense and New York Limited Purpose Trust Charter. The company’s CEO, Ivan Soto-Wright, called Pham “one of the most influential leaders in U.S. financial regulation” and said her experience in regulatory expertise and traditional finance, as well as her deep understanding of market structure makes her “the perfect leader to guide MoonPay through our next chapter of growth and compliance excellence.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The latest reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 17, firmly entrenched in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This powerful sentiment gauge is flashing red, but savvy investors know that extreme fear often precedes significant market moves. Let’s decode what this critical number really means for Bitcoin, altcoins, and your investment strategy. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial tool that quantifies the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. It scores sentiment on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A reading of 17, as we see now, indicates that fear is the dominant force driving investor behavior. This index isn’t just a guess; it’s calculated using a specific, weighted formula analyzing real market data: Volatility (25%): Measures how wildly prices are swinging. Market Volume (25%): Tracks the momentum of trading activity. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of conversations online. Surveys (15%): Gathers direct sentiment from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Watches if money is flowing into or out of Bitcoin relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Monitors search interest for cryptocurrency terms. Therefore, when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reads 17, it’s a composite signal from all these areas screaming caution. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear? Market sentiment is a powerful, self-fulfilling force. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear, it often leads to panic selling, where investors offload assets at a loss simply to exit the market. This can create exaggerated price drops that may not reflect long-term fundamentals. Historically, however, periods of extreme fear have frequently presented contrarian buying opportunities for patient investors. The key question becomes: is this fear justified by underlying issues, or is it an emotional overreaction? Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a market governed by a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a disciplined approach. First, avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotion. Instead, use this time for research and review your portfolio’s risk tolerance. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This strategy involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, which can be highly effective in volatile, fearful markets as it removes the stress of timing the bottom. Finally, this is an ideal moment to rebalance. You might find high-quality projects are undervalued, presenting a strategic entry point. The Contrarian Perspective: Is This the Time to Buy? Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 epitomizes the latter. For long-term believers in blockchain technology, these fearful periods can be windows of opportunity. However, it’s vital to distinguish between a healthy market correction and a fundamental breakdown. Conduct thorough due diligence on any asset before committing capital, ensuring your moves are strategic, not reactive. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 17 is a clear snapshot of a nervous market. While it signals high risk and potential for further downside, it also hints at the possibility of future reward for those with conviction and a clear plan. Use this metric not as a standalone buy/sell signal, but as a crucial piece of context in your broader investment framework. By understanding the crowd’s emotion, you can better manage your own. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 mean? A: A score of 17 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-25). It indicates that negative sentiment and panic are currently dominating the cryptocurrency market, often driven by price drops and negative news. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: It is a reliable indicator of current market sentiment, not a direct price predictor. However, extreme readings (like 17) have often coincided with market bottoms or tops, making it a valuable contrarian tool. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is typically updated once per day, providing a daily snapshot of market emotion. Q: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? A> It can be a potential opportunity, but never base a decision solely on this index. Always combine sentiment analysis with fundamental and technical research appropriate for your risk profile. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major crypto news platforms also feature it in their market analysis sections. Q: Has the index ever been lower than 17? A: Yes. During major market crashes like the COVID-19 sell-off in March 2020, the index has briefly dipped into single digits, indicating even more severe panic.

A startling drop in network activity to a one-year low signals a major shift: a significant Ethereum retail investor exodus . This departure of everyday participants, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain, creates a critical hurdle for ETH’s price recovery. Let’s explore why this trend is so consequential for the market’s short-term trajectory. What Does the Ethereum Retail Investor Exodus Actually Mean? Recent on-chain data paints a clear picture. The number of active Ethereum sending addresses has plummeted to roughly 170,000. This metric is a direct proxy for retail participation. Simply put, fewer unique addresses conducting transactions means fewer small-scale investors are trading or interacting with the network. This trend isn’t entirely unexpected. Historically, retail activity dwindles after extended periods of market volatility and price declines. The current Ethereum retail investor exodus reflects a natural, if concerning, market phase: weakened short-term confidence and a ‘wait-and-see’ approach from the crowd that often fuels bullish momentum. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Network Activity From an on-chain perspective, such depressed activity presents a paradox. On one hand, it often indicates that intense selling pressure has exhausted itself. The weak hands have likely left, suggesting the immediate downward push may be over. However, the other edge of this sword is far sharper. The absence of retail traders also means a stark lack of new buying demand. Analysts point out that retail investors are typically the primary catalyst for the initial surge in a rebound. Their collective, albeit smaller, purchases help build the momentum that attracts larger players. Therefore, without this group, the path for a sustained ETH rebound becomes much steeper. The market loses a key layer of foundational demand. Why Is Retail Participation So Crucial for an ETH Rebound? Think of the market as a pyramid. Institutional and whale activity sits at the top, but the broad base is built by retail. Their role is multifaceted: Liquidity Providers: They add depth to the market, making it easier to buy and sell. Momentum Starters: A wave of small buys can signal a shift in sentiment, encouraging others. Network Users: Their transactions validate utility beyond pure speculation, supporting ecosystem health. The current Ethereum retail investor exodus weakens all these functions. While institutional interest remains vital, history shows that robust recoveries often need a ‘retail-first’ spark to ignite broader rallies. What’s the Path Forward for Ethereum? This analysis doesn’t spell doom for Ethereum, but it does highlight a challenging transition. The network’s fate in the near term may depend on other factors stepping in to fill the void left by retail. Key aspects to watch include: Institutional Adoption: Continued growth in ETF flows or enterprise usage. Protocol Upgrades: Successful implementation of future improvements that boost efficiency and appeal. Macro Environment: Broader financial conditions becoming more favorable for risk assets. Until then, the limited upside potential remains a reality. The market is in a state of equilibrium at a low activity level, waiting for a new catalyst to either bring retail back or unlock a different source of demand. Conclusion: A Market in Waiting The Ethereum retail investor exodus is a powerful signal the market is sending. It tells us that short-term speculative enthusiasm has cooled significantly. While this may stabilize prices temporarily, it severely limits the potential for a vigorous, short-term ETH rebound . The road to recovery now likely requires patience, fundamental development, or a major external catalyst to rebuild the confidence of the everyday investor. For now, Ethereum’s network awaits its next wave of users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does low retail activity mean the Ethereum price will definitely fall further? A: Not necessarily. It primarily indicates a lack of buying pressure for a strong rebound. The price could stabilize or move sideways until new demand emerges from retail or other sources like institutions. Q: How long do these retail exodus phases typically last? A> There’s no fixed timeline. It can last for weeks or months, often ending when market sentiment improves, volatility decreases, or a positive news catalyst attracts attention back to the asset. Q: Are institutional investors also leaving Ethereum? A> The data discussed specifically highlights retail metrics. Institutional flows can be separate; they may even be accumulating during quiet retail periods, which is a scenario some analysts watch for. Q: What metric is used to measure ‘active addresses’? A> ‘Active sending addresses’ typically counts the number of unique addresses that were the initiator (sender) of a successful transaction on the network over a given period, like daily. It’s a key gauge of unique user activity. Q: As a retail investor, should I avoid Ethereum right now? A> This is not financial advice. However, understanding market phases is crucial. Periods of low activity can be used for research and planning. Many investors see them as times to cautiously build positions based on long-term belief, not short-term momentum.

For crypto enthusiasts and financial professionals alike, this shift could accelerate the merger of old-world finance with new-world technology. What Was the Fed’s Restrictive Guideline? The withdrawn guideline primarily affected banks that operate without FDIC deposit insurance. It created a high barrier to entry, effectively limiting their ability to offer crypto-related services. The rule’s impact was starkly illustrated when the Fed cited it as grounds to deny a master account application from Custodia Bank, a financial institution built specifically for the digital asset space. This denial highlighted the tension between innovative fintech models and established regulatory frameworks. Why Did the Federal Reserve Make This Change? The decision reflects a growing acknowledgment within the Fed that the financial landscape is evolving. In a statement, Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman framed the move as forward-thinking. She emphasized that new technologies, including those underpinning the cryptocurrency business , can enhance bank efficiency and allow them to provide better products to customers. Key reasons behind the shift include: Promoting Responsible Innovation: The Fed aims to create a clear path for banks to explore digital assets safely. Enhancing Competitiveness: Allowing banks to adapt ensures the U.S. banking system remains efficient and competitive globally. Managing Risk: By bringing crypto activities under the banking umbrella, regulators can better oversee associated risks. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Banking? This regulatory shift is more than a procedural update; it’s a signal. It suggests that federal regulators are beginning to view the cryptocurrency business not as a fringe activity, but as a potential component of mainstream finance. For traditional banks, this opens a new frontier. They can now more seriously explore: Custody services for digital assets. Facilitating crypto payments and transfers. Developing hybrid financial products that blend traditional and digital finance. For companies like Custodia Bank, the door for reconsideration may now be open. However, challenges remain. Banks must still navigate a complex web of state and federal regulations, and they must prove they have robust risk management systems in place for handling volatile digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Toward Financial Synthesis The Federal Reserve’s decision to withdraw its restrictive guideline is a cautiously optimistic development. It represents a move away from blanket prohibition and toward a framework of supervised integration. While it doesn’t equate to a free pass, it establishes a crucial precedent: innovation in the cryptocurrency business can have a place within the regulated banking sector. This alignment is essential for building a more inclusive, efficient, and modern financial system that serves the needs of a digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean any bank can now start a cryptocurrency business? A: Not exactly. The withdrawal removes one specific barrier, but banks must still comply with all other applicable banking laws, secure necessary approvals, and demonstrate they can manage the unique risks of digital assets. Q: What is a “master account” and why was it important for Custodia Bank? A: A master account at the Federal Reserve allows a bank to directly access crucial payment systems and services. Without it, a bank like Custodia faces significant operational hurdles, making the previous denial a major setback. Q: Will this lead to lower fees for crypto trading and services? A: Potentially. Increased competition from traditional banks entering the cryptocurrency business could drive innovation and lower costs for consumers over time, but this is not an immediate guarantee. Q: How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A: In the long run, it could mean more secure and familiar avenues to buy, sell, and hold crypto through established banks, potentially increasing mainstream trust and adoption. Q: Is the FDIC insurance rule no longer important? A> FDIC insurance remains a critical consumer protection for traditional deposits. This change specifically addresses access for non-FDIC insured banks to engage in crypto, not the insurance rule itself. Q: What should I watch for next? A> Watch for announcements from regional or smaller banks about pilot crypto programs, and see if the Fed approves new master account applications from crypto-focused institutions.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now taken a significant step to clear the air. The commission has issued new, interim guidance specifically addressing the custody of digital asset securities by registered broker-dealers. This move aims to resolve a critical compliance hurdle and provide much-needed direction for firms operating at the intersection of legacy finance and blockchain technology. What Are the New SEC Custody Guidelines? The core of the SEC’s announcement revolves around Rule 15c3-3, the longstanding regulation governing how broker-dealers must safeguard customer assets. The commission stated that if a broker-dealer meets specific requirements, digital asset securities held for customers can be considered in the firm’s “physical possession” for compliance purposes. This interpretation is crucial because it bridges a gap between the digital nature of these assets and the physical possession concepts in traditional rules. This guidance acts as an interim measure. The SEC explicitly noted it is still reviewing broader issues related to broker-dealer custody of crypto assets. However, by providing this clarity now, the commission is responding directly to requests from market participants who have been navigating a regulatory gray area. Why Does This Guidance Matter for the Crypto Industry? The lack of clear rules has been a major barrier for institutional adoption. Traditional financial firms have been hesitant to offer custodial services for digital asset securities due to compliance risks. This new guidance provides a potential pathway. Here are the key implications: Reduced Uncertainty: Firms now have an official SEC stance to reference when structuring their custody solutions, reducing legal and regulatory risk. Institutional Gateway: Clearer rules could encourage more broker-dealers to safely hold digital asset securities , paving the way for greater institutional investment. Compliance Roadmap: The guidance outlines the SEC’s current thinking, allowing companies to align their operations proactively rather than guessing. What Challenges and Questions Remain? While this is a positive step, it is not a final resolution. The guidance is interim, meaning the rules could evolve. Furthermore, the SEC has not yet detailed all the “certain requirements” a broker-dealer must meet. Key questions for the market include: What specific technological and operational safeguards will satisfy the SEC? How does this guidance interact with state-level money transmitter licenses? Will the requirements differ for various types of digital asset securities ? Therefore, while the path is brighter, firms must proceed with caution and likely engage in further dialogue with regulators to ensure full compliance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses and Investors For broker-dealers and crypto-native firms seeking legitimacy, this is a call to action. Engaging with legal counsel to interpret the guidance in the context of your specific business model is essential. For investors, this development signals a maturing market where established regulatory frameworks are beginning to formally encompass digital assets, potentially leading to more secure and mainstream investment products. Conclusion: A Step Toward Regulatory Integration The SEC’s new custody guidelines for digital asset securities represent a meaningful, though incremental, move toward integrating cryptocurrency into the existing financial regulatory system. By addressing the custody question under Rule 15c3-3, the commission has provided a foundational piece of clarity that the industry has urgently needed. This action fosters a more secure environment for institutional participation and underscores the ongoing process of defining the future of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Rule 15c3-3? A: It’s a key SEC rule, often called the “Customer Protection Rule,” that requires broker-dealers to safeguard customer cash and securities, keeping them separate from the firm’s own assets. Q: Does this mean all cryptocurrencies are now considered securities? A: No. This guidance specifically applies to assets already classified as digital asset securities . The broader debate over what constitutes a security in crypto continues. Q: Is this guidance final law? A: No, it is interim guidance and a statement of the SEC’s current interpretive position. It provides a compliance framework but may be subject to change as the commission continues its review. Q: How does this affect individual crypto investors? A> In the long term, it could lead to more regulated and insured custody options from established financial institutions, potentially increasing safety for investors holding digital asset securities . Q: What should a crypto company do next? A> Firms acting as broker-dealers should consult with securities lawyers to understand how the guidance applies to their operations and what specific controls they need to implement.

A token starts to gain traction in a steady, not a hyped manner, but due to the fact that progress and involvement are moving in the same direction. And that is what is shaping around a new DeFi Crypto being sold at a price under $0.04. Having registered a 250% growth since its initial phase, investor interest is gathering as more now evaluate the cryptocurrency to purchase against the market at large which is still picky. Presale Progress and What MUTM is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale was launched at the beginning of 2025 starting with a price of $0.01 and advanced through a planned phase model, reaching a point of $0.035 within its existing price range. That shift is 250% of growth, which was not caused by volatility but intended stage development. Involvement has increased with the growth. The project has received greater attention in terms of raised funds bringing together over 18,400 holders and exceeding $19.30M in raised funds. Out of a total supply of 4B tokens, 45.5 or 1.82B tokens are distributed to early distribution with 820M tokens already sold. Phase 6 is currently more than 99% allocated and this implies that there is very limited remaining at the present level. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform based on practical usage at a protocol level. Assets are provided by the users to gain yield on the borrowing demand. Liquidity is availed to borrowers whereby collateral is posted at stipulated rules that regulate rates and levels of risk. Creation of value is associated with action as opposed to attention, and that explains why MUTM can rightfully be described as a DeFi crypto designed to engage in action on a longer-term basis. V1 and Growth Features The second significant milestone is execution. The official X announcement says that in Q4 2025, V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet. With the initial assets being ETH and USDT, this release introduces the Liquidity Pool,mtToken framework, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot. One attribute of the protocol is mtTokens. Users provide assets, the increase in redeemable value of the mtTokens happens when borrowers pay off interests. This promotes possession of behavior that is associated with actual usage. It also has a buy and distribute mechanism. On the open market, MUTM is bought and redistributed to those who are willing to place a stake on the safety module in the form of mtTokens. This is a system level demand as the level of borrowing activity increases. Some prognosticators in a temperate tone of voice think that in the case V1 execution and first-mover adoption are in constant motion, MUTM could be selling in the $0.20 to $0.25 range. That would be in the range of 6x-7x up from the current price of $0.035, and run by a usage and not a hype-cycle. Long-term Scenarios Other than the launch, Mutuum Finance intends to roll out a protocol-native stablecoin that is pegged on the interest earned in the system. Stablecoins based on in-house activity tend to enhance the liquidity and maintain value within the ecosystem. The roadmap also includes layer-2 expansion. The participation can be expanded as a result of lower transaction expenditure and rates of execution particularly when it comes to lending protocols that have recurring interactions. The ChainLink-supported fallback and aggregated feeds based on Oracle infrastructure form the basis of precise pricing of collateral valuation and liquidations. Security preparation is a plus of the project approaching V1. Mutuum Finance passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan mark. Simultaneously, Halborn Security is going through the finalized smart contracts and a bug bounty exists of $50,000 USD to find vulnerabilities in advance. The advertising to the community is still obvious with the 24-hour leaderboard rewarding the daily best player with $500 in MUTM. These characteristics have been beneficial in keeping it going on Phase 6 in its concluding phase.

After months of declining prices and heightened volatility across crypto markets, attention has shifted from short-term price action to structural changes that could improve HYPE’s supply dynamics and investor expectations. At the center of the debate is a governance proposal by the Hyper Foundation to formally treat all HYPE held in the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund as permanently burned. While these tokens are already locked in an address without a private key, the vote seeks to codify their removal from performance. If approved, the decision would mark one of the most significant supply reductions in the protocol’s history, removing more than 37 million HYPE, over 10% of circulating supply, through a validator-backed consensus. Governance Vote Puts Hyperliquid Supply Structure in Focus The Assistance Fund accumulates HYPE through an automated mechanism that converts trading fees generated on Hyperliquid’s perpetuals exchange into the native token. These tokens sit in a system address that has never been controlled by a private key, making them inaccessible unless a protocol-level upgrade is authorized. Under the current proposal, validators are being asked to establish a binding social consensus that no such upgrade will ever occur. Voting is stake-weighted, with validators signaling their positions by December 21, and final results are expected on December 24. Approval would effectively lock in a more restrictive supply model, preventing the Assistance Fund from being used for grants, liquidity support, or emergency measures in the future. The proposal follows earlier, unadopted discussions around broader supply cuts in 2025, suggesting a renewed effort to clarify HYPE’s long-term monetary framework rather than pursue incremental adjustments. Market Reaction and Longer-Term Outlook Hyperliquid ( HYPE) has stabilized near the $26 level after several days of losses, with market data suggesting the proposed burn is not yet fully priced in. Futures open interest has climbed above $1.5 billion, and funding rates have turned positive, pointing to growing bullish positioning ahead of the validator vote. In contrast, spot market activity remains muted, as trading volumes have edged lower and technical indicators continue to reflect lingering bearish momentum. Beyond short-term price action, analysts are increasingly focused on Hyperliquid’s longer-term valuation framework. Cantor Fitzgerald has cited the protocol’s fee-driven and deflationary design as a potential driver of sustained growth, projecting billions in annual fees if adoption expands. From this perspective, the Assistance Fund burn is seen as a test of whether stricter supply discipline can help rebuild confidence, with the vote outcome likely shaping how Hyperliquid’s economic model is evaluated into 2026.

Despite holding above a major confluence zone, repeated rejections overhead suggest buyers are losing control. With macro pressure building and liquidity levels still untested, the next move from here could define whether BTC stabilizes or slides into a deeper reset. Lower-Timeframe Rejection Keeps The Downtrend In Control Crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe revealed in a recent post that Bitcoin has faced a clear rejection at a key resistance level. This failure signals that the short-term downtrend remains intact on lower timeframes, confirming that selling pressure currently outweighs buying momentum in the immediate term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details To flip this short-term bias, Van de Poppe expects a clear breakout above the $88,000 level. A successful move above this mark would serve as a strong, unequivocal signal to the markets that the corrective phase is over and that upward momentum is likely to take hold from that point forward. If buyers fail to achieve this necessary breakout, it remains highly probable that the price will pursue liquidity targets below, specifically targeting a test at $83,000 for liquidity. Should that fail, a further descent to the $80,000 level will trigger stop-losses. Finally, Van De Poppe connected the technical outlook to the broader economic environment. Given the high volume of macroeconomic events scheduled to take place over the course of the week, such as FOMC, Poppe believes that the market could experience significant volatility and end up reaching one of the predicted downside liquidity tests. $93,000 Rejection Stalls Momentum, but Weekly Structure Still Intact According to a weekly chart update by Crypto Damus, Bitcoin recently faced a firm rejection at the $93,000 resistance level. Despite that setback, price action remains constructive for now, with BTC holding above the crucial $86,000 weekly support zone. This area is reinforced with the key 100-week moving average confluence, making it an important level to watch in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ That said, the broader structure still leaves room for deeper downside. Crypto Damus notes that a full retracement toward the rising wedge breakdown target cannot be ruled out, which aligns closely with the April low around the $78,000 region. A move into that zone would represent a more pronounced corrective phase within the larger cycle. Looking further ahead, a deeper bear-market-style retest may ultimately present a more attractive long-term opportunity. A revisit of the $70,000 level is highlighted as a potential high-conviction buying area, should the market extend its pullback.

The latest data delivers a sobering reality check. CoinMarketCap’s crucial Altcoin Season Index has held firm at a lowly 18, unchanged from the previous day. This persistent reading signals that Bitcoin continues to command the crypto market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Let’s decode what this stagnant index truly means for your portfolio. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index acts as the crypto market’s primary gauge for investor sentiment and capital rotation. It meticulously measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The rule is simple yet powerful: if 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that period, an official ‘altcoin season’ is declared. A score nearing 100 screams a raging altcoin bull market, while a low score like 18 confirms we are firmly in a ‘Bitcoin season’. This metric is essential for timing your market entries and exits. Why Is the Index Stuck at Such a Low Level? The index’s stagnation at 18 is not a random fluctuation; it reflects deep-seated market dynamics. Currently, Bitcoin is absorbing the majority of institutional and safe-haven capital, especially with the excitement around Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This creates a significant challenge for altcoins, which often struggle to gain traction when Bitcoin dominates headlines and liquidity. Furthermore, the higher risk profile of altcoins makes them less attractive during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or when market sentiment is cautious. Therefore, this low Altcoin Season Index reading is a clear signal that broad, risk-on appetite for smaller cryptocurrencies is currently muted. How Can Traders Use This Information Strategically? Instead of viewing a low index as bad news, savvy traders use it to formulate a strategic plan. Here are actionable insights based on the current Altcoin Season Index of 18: Practice Patience with Altcoin Accumulation: A low index can be an opportunity to research and slowly accumulate high-quality altcoin projects at relatively lower prices, building a position before a potential season shift. Focus on Bitcoin-Centric Strategies: While the index is low, consider that trends favor Bitcoin. Allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to BTC or Bitcoin-related investments aligns with the dominant trend. Set Alert Levels for the Index: Monitor for a sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index above key levels (like 25 or 50). A consistent climb can serve as an early warning signal that capital is beginning to rotate, prompting you to re-evaluate your altcoin holdings. When Should We Expect the Altcoin Season Index to Rise? Predicting the exact turn is difficult, but history shows catalysts exist. A sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index typically follows a period of Bitcoin consolidation or stability, where investors seek higher returns elsewhere. Other potential triggers include breakthrough developments in major altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum upgrades), a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, or a wave of positive regulatory clarity for specific altcoin sectors. The key is to watch for a combination of Bitcoin strength plateauing and altcoins beginning to show independent, positive momentum on their charts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin-Dominant Landscape The Altcoin Season Index holding at 18 is a powerful piece of market intelligence. It tells a story of caution, dominance, and waiting. For now, Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of the crypto hill. However, understanding this index equips you not with despair, but with patience and preparedness. Use this time to conduct thorough research, strengthen your core Bitcoin position, and prepare a watchlist for when the index finally begins its inevitable climb, signaling the next chapter of altcoin opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 18 mean? A: A score of 18 indicates that very few altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the measured 90-day period. It strongly suggests the market is in a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where BTC is the primary asset attracting gains and investor interest. Q2: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: The index is published by CoinMarketCap. You can typically find it on their website or by searching for ‘Altcoin Season Index’ on crypto data aggregators. Q3: Is it a bad time to buy altcoins when the index is low? A> Not necessarily. A low index can signal lower prices and accumulation opportunities for long-term believers in specific projects. However, it generally advises against expecting broad, short-term altcoin rallies until the index trends upward. Q4: What index score signals the start of an altcoin season? A: The threshold is 75. The index must cross and sustain above 75 to indicate that 75% of top altcoins are beating Bitcoin, officially marking an altcoin season. Q5: Does the index include meme coins like Dogecoin? A> Yes, if a meme coin is ranked within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap (and is not a stablecoin), its performance is factored into the Altcoin Season Index calculation. Q6: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoin market performance.

55954805,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=880431,1766020065,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55954805.jpeg,India’s competition regulator approves Coinbase minority stake in CoinDCX,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/india-approves-coinbase-stake-in-coindcx/,"The Competition Commission of India, which oversees and promotes fair competition in the country, has cleared Coinbase’s acquisition of a minority stake in cryptocurrency platform CoinDCX. In a notice released, the regulator confirmed its approval of Coinbase Global’s investment in DCX Global Limited, the parent company of CoinDCX. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal shared the update on X Wednesday, stating that the move strengthens the exchange’s “long-term partnership with one of India’s most established and trusted digital asset platforms.” Both the regulator’s announcement and Grewal’s post omitted the exact percentage of Coinbase’s stake in the crypto exchange. Reporters contacted a Coinbase spokesperson for comment, but had not received a response by the time of publication. The approval follows an October notice that Coinbase was planning to invest in CoinDCX with a post-money valuation of approximately $2.4 billion. At that time, Coinbase reported that CoinDCX had about $141 million in annual revenue as of July; however, it denied earlier reports that it was planning to purchase the company outright for $1 billion. Coinbase returns to Indian crypto market After a pause of more than two years, Coinbase has opened its app for registration in India. Currently, users can make crypto-to-crypto trades. However, speaking at India Blockchain Week (IBW), Coinbase’s APAC director, John O’Loghlen, stated that the company plans to introduce a fiat on-ramp in 2026, enabling users in the country to load money and purchase crypto. Coinbase opened its services in India in 2022, but within days, it had to shut down support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment network. This move followed the UPI operator National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI) refusal to acknowledge Coinbase’s presence in the country. Later in 2023, Coinbase ceased all operations for Indian users and requested that they close their accounts. “We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated. Because we wanted to kind of burn the boats [sic], have a clean slate here. As a commercial business person wanting to make money and active users, that’s like the worst thing you can do, and so you know it wasn’t without some hesitation,” O’Loghlen said. Coinbase navigates regulations and tax challenges while expanding in India The company began engaging with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency responsible for overseeing transactions and combating fraud, and eventually registered with them this year. In October, the app began onboarding users through early access, and it is now open to all users. Many internet companies have established their bases in India, aiming to tap into the world’s second-largest online user base. While social platforms and AI companies like OpenAI have experienced rapid growth in the market, it has been challenging for crypto companies to follow the same path due to the strict regulations and taxation surrounding cryptocurrencies. The South Asian country imposes a 30% tax on crypto income without any loss offset, and also charges a 1% deduction on each transaction, which may deter users from trading frequently. O’Loghlen said that the company hopes that the government will relax the taxation to make it less burdensome for people to hold digital assets. Despite these hurdles, Coinbase remains optimistic about the Indian market. Its venture arm recently increased its investment in local exchange CoinDCX, which has a post-money valuation of $2.45 billion. The company plans to expand its employee base of over 500 in the country by hiring for multiple roles serving both domestic and global markets. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The move positions the exchange among the first major centralized venues to adopt a permanent zero‑fee structure, reshaping the competitive landscape for crypto trading. Sources close to the situation indicated that this new policy will be made available to all significant trading products currently listed on the exchange. These products include: regular crypto spot gains, margin trading, perpetual derivatives contracts, tokenized securities, and over-the-counter (OTC) trades. In a statement, a representative from the cryptocurrency exchange mentioned that the fees will be eliminated for both takers and market makers across the board. With this strategic approach of eliminating trading costs, Bitfinex highlighted that the company aims to establish a new standard for key trading platforms and promote financial inclusion. It also expressed its belief that this new strategy will significantly enhance overall market liquidity and streamline the trading process, particularly for new users who are new to trading. Several analysts weighed in on the exchange’s new policy . They acknowledged that this decision will play a crucial role in expanding the company’s services and positioning it as one of the most budget-friendly options available for trading BTC , other virtual currencies, and tokenized securities. Bitfinex’s new policy sparks excitement in the crypto industry In a press release, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bitfinex, Paolo Ardoino, noted that the exchange believes in the existence of a high probability that it might successfully reward its current clients and greatly attract new customers to the platform. He also revealed that Bitfinex was excited to implement this strategy, thanks to the crypto exchange’s long history of generating profits and the superiority of its technology. Meanwhile, Ardoino claimed that they will closely observe the effects this new policy will have on the rest of the industry. His remarks followed Bitfinex’s recent comment about market behaviors encountered in the past. In this comment, the platform outlined a comparison that was released in a public message, declaring that the current period of reduced trading volume resembles the previous market cycles. Concerning this discovery, reports highlighted that such persistent reductions in spot trading have frequently occurred in the past just before major price fluctuations in the market, either going up or down. On the other hand, data from CoinMarketCap indicated that the total spot trading volume over the last month drastically decreased across all leading exchanges. This trading volume declined from more than $500 billion recorded at the start of November to about $250 billion this week. It was also confirmed that daily trading activity faced difficulties in maintaining the level above the $300 to $350 billion range in late November and early December. At times, volumes decreased to as low as $200 billion, representing the lowest level ever recorded in several months. Analysts attempted to explain that this ongoing drop followed a swift but sharp increase above $550 billion encountered in mid-November. Afterwards, trading volumes fell back at a faster rate. Phantom introduces a new feature in the market Meanwhile, Phantom , a popular Solana-based, non-custodial Web3 wallet, has introduced a new feature called Phantom Prediction Markets. This feature is powered by Kalshi, a prediction market platform that is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Notably, Bitfinex and Phantom have a functional relationship. To illustrate this claim, sources noted that Phantom’s support website recommends Bitfinex as a famous exchange that its clients can utilize to fund their Phantom wallets. In the meantime, reports have admitted that Phantom and Kalshi’s integration will enable users to explore trending events, stay updated on live odds, and trade tokenized positions based on real-life outcomes directly within the Phantom app. According to sources with knowledge on the matter, this outcome could include sectors such as politics, cryptocurrency prices, sports, culture, and economics. In a tweet, Phantom stated, “Prediction markets in Phantom are not available everywhere. They may come with risks such as changing prices, limited availability of assets, and possible regulatory changes. Trading in prediction markets might have transaction fees and other costs. If your guess is wrong, you could lose all the money you put into an event.

This initiative represents a potential turning point for how digital assets interact with traditional financial infrastructure, signaling a more collaborative approach to regulation that balances innovation with investor protection. What Does the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Trading Inquiry Mean for Markets? Commissioner Peirce’s announcement focuses specifically on how cryptocurrencies might trade on National Securities Exchanges (NSEs) and Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs). The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets recently published guidance addressing how platforms should handle trading pairs that mix security and non-security cryptocurrencies. This creates a framework that could finally bring clarity to a long-standing regulatory gray area. The commission emphasizes its willingness to support platforms that list legitimate trading pairs. This represents a significant shift from previous enforcement-heavy approaches. The goal is to establish regulations that protect investors while maintaining fair markets, without unnecessarily stifling the innovation that has characterized the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. Why Is This Feedback Process So Crucial Right Now? The timing of this inquiry couldn’t be more important. As cryptocurrency trading volumes continue to grow globally, U.S. markets risk falling behind without clear regulatory pathways. Commissioner Peirce, often called “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance, recognizes that thoughtful regulation requires industry input. Key aspects the SEC wants market participants to address include: Practical challenges of listing cryptocurrency trading pairs on regulated exchanges Risk management considerations for mixed security/non-security pairs Investor protection mechanisms specific to digital assets Technical requirements for clearing and settlement How Could This Change Cryptocurrency Trading Infrastructure? If implemented thoughtfully, this regulatory framework could transform cryptocurrency trading in several fundamental ways. First, it could bring greater legitimacy and institutional participation to digital asset markets. Second, it might establish clearer custody and security standards that protect investors. Third, it could create more efficient price discovery through regulated venues. However, challenges remain. The SEC must balance several competing priorities: Maintaining market integrity without over-regulating Protecting retail investors while allowing innovation Creating rules flexible enough for rapidly evolving technology Ensuring U.S. competitiveness in global crypto markets What Are the Immediate Next Steps for Market Participants? Industry stakeholders now have a valuable opportunity to shape the future of cryptocurrency trading regulation. The feedback process allows exchanges, trading platforms, investors, and technology providers to share their practical experiences and concerns. This collaborative approach could result in more workable regulations that actually address real-world challenges. The SEC’s willingness to consider cryptocurrency trading on national exchanges represents a potential breakthrough. It acknowledges that digital assets are here to stay and need appropriate regulatory homes rather than constant enforcement actions. This could lead to more stable markets and greater investor confidence in cryptocurrency trading platforms. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for Crypto Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s initiative marks a potentially transformative moment for cryptocurrency trading in the United States. By seeking market input before finalizing rules, the SEC demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of digital assets’ unique characteristics. This approach could finally provide the regulatory clarity that has been missing since Bitcoin’s inception, potentially unlocking trillions in institutional investment while better protecting everyday investors. The success of this initiative will depend on robust participation from all market segments. The resulting framework could either propel U.S. cryptocurrency trading to global leadership or constrain it with impractical rules. The coming months of feedback and response will likely determine which path American digital asset markets take. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is Commissioner Peirce asking for? She’s seeking public feedback on how cryptocurrencies should be traded on regulated national exchanges and alternative trading systems, particularly regarding mixed security/non-security trading pairs. How does this differ from previous SEC approaches to crypto? This represents a more collaborative, forward-looking approach that seeks industry input before establishing rules, rather than relying primarily on enforcement actions after the fact. What types of cryptocurrency trading pairs are being considered? The SEC is particularly interested in frameworks for trading pairs that mix cryptocurrencies deemed securities with those considered non-securities, which has been a regulatory gray area. How can industry participants provide feedback? While specific submission guidelines will be published, typically the SEC accepts comments through its official website, with opportunities for both written submissions and potentially public hearings. What’s the timeline for this regulatory process? Regulatory processes typically take several months to a year, depending on the complexity of issues and volume of feedback received. How might this affect existing cryptocurrency exchanges? Existing exchanges might need to adjust their operations to comply with new standards, but they could also gain access to broader investor bases through integration with traditional financial infrastructure.

The software giant, known for its creative tools, now faces a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging it used pirated books to train its AI models. This case represents yet another battle in the ongoing war between content creators and tech companies over who owns the data that powers our AI future. What Exactly Is Adobe Accused Of in This AI Training Data Lawsuit? The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Oregon author Elizabeth Lyon, claims Adobe used unauthorized copies of copyrighted books to train its SlimLM program. SlimLM is described by Adobe as a small language model series optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. According to court documents, the company allegedly trained this model on the SlimPajama-627B dataset, which contains the controversial Books3 collection of 191,000 books. Elizabeth Lyon, who has written several guidebooks for non-fiction writing, discovered her works were included in the pretraining dataset without her permission. Her lawsuit states: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3). Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.” Why Is This Adobe AI Lawsuit Different From Other Tech Legal Battles? This case stands out for several reasons. First, Adobe has positioned itself as a company that respects creator rights, making these allegations particularly damaging to its reputation. Second, the lawsuit specifically targets the company’s use of the Books3 dataset, which has become a focal point in multiple legal actions against tech companies. Consider these key aspects of the case: Scale of Alleged Infringement: Books3 contains 191,000 books, potentially affecting thousands of authors Precedent Setting: Similar cases against Apple and Salesforce have cited the same dataset Industry Impact: The outcome could force AI companies to completely rethink their training data strategies Financial Stakes: The Anthropic settlement of $1.5 billion shows the potential cost of these cases How Common Are These AI Training Data Lawsuits Becoming? Unfortunately for the tech industry, lawsuits over AI training data have become increasingly common. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has outpaced the development of clear legal frameworks, creating a perfect storm of litigation. Here’s a comparison of recent notable cases: Company Allegation Status Potential Impact Adobe Using pirated books via SlimPajama dataset Proposed class-action filed Could affect all Adobe AI products Apple Using copyrighted material for Apple Intelligence Ongoing litigation May delay AI feature releases Salesforce Using RedPajama for training Similar lawsuit filed Could impact enterprise AI tools Anthropic Using pirated work for Claude training Settled for $1.5 billion Sets financial precedent What Does This Mean for Copyright Infringement in the AI Era? The Adobe case highlights a fundamental tension in the AI industry. Companies need massive amounts of data to train effective models, but obtaining proper licensing for all that content is expensive and complex. This has led some companies to use datasets like Books3 and RedPajama, which contain copyrighted material obtained through questionable means. The legal landscape is evolving rapidly, with several key developments: Increased Scrutiny: Courts are becoming more familiar with AI technology and its data requirements Author Organization: Writers and creators are forming coalitions to protect their rights Regulatory Attention: Governments worldwide are considering new AI regulations Industry Standards: Some companies are developing ethical data sourcing guidelines What Are the Potential Consequences for Adobe’s SlimLM Program? If the lawsuit succeeds, Adobe could face significant consequences. The company might need to: Retrain its SlimLM model using properly licensed data Pay substantial damages to affected authors Implement new data verification processes Potentially remove or limit certain AI features Face increased regulatory scrutiny for future AI developments How Can Companies Avoid Similar AI Training Data Issues? Based on the growing number of lawsuits, companies developing AI systems should consider these proactive measures: Transparent Data Sourcing: Clearly document where training data comes from Proper Licensing: Obtain explicit permission for copyrighted materials Ethical Guidelines: Develop and follow ethical AI development principles Legal Review: Involve legal teams early in AI development processes Creator Compensation: Consider fair compensation models for content creators Frequently Asked Questions What is the Books3 dataset mentioned in the lawsuit? Books3 is a collection of approximately 191,000 books that has been widely used to train generative AI systems. It has become controversial because it contains copyrighted material that was allegedly obtained without proper authorization from authors and publishers. Who is Elizabeth Lyon? Elizabeth Lyon is an author from Oregon who specializes in writing guidebooks for non-fiction writing. She is the lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit against Adobe , alleging that her copyrighted works were used without permission to train the company’s AI models. What is SlimLM? SlimLM is Adobe’s small language model series designed for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. According to the company, it was pre-trained on the SlimPajama-627B dataset, which is at the center of the current legal dispute. How does this case relate to other AI lawsuits? This case is part of a growing trend of legal actions against tech companies using copyrighted material for AI training. Similar lawsuits have been filed against Apple and Salesforce , while Anthropic recently settled a similar case for $1.5 billion. What could be the outcome of this lawsuit? Potential outcomes include financial damages for affected authors, requirements for Adobe to retrain its models with properly licensed data, and the establishment of legal precedents that could shape how all companies approach AI training data in the future. Conclusion The Adobe lawsuit represents a critical moment in the ongoing struggle to balance AI innovation with copyright protection. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives and business operations, the rules governing how these systems are trained must evolve. This case, along with others like it, will help define the boundaries of acceptable AI development and establish important precedents for how creators are compensated in the age of artificial intelligence. The outcome could force the entire tech industry to reconsider its approach to training data, potentially leading to more ethical and sustainable AI development practices.

That’s exactly what’s happening right now, creating one of the most significant dormant BTC movements in cryptocurrency history. According to Wu Blockchain and K33 Research, long-term holders are selling at rates not seen in five years, fundamentally changing Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. What Does This Massive Dormant BTC Movement Mean? The term ‘ dormant BTC ‘ refers to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from wallets for extended periods, often years. When this cryptocurrency suddenly becomes active, it signals major holder behavior shifts. This year’s unprecedented $300 billion movement represents a fundamental change in how early investors view their Bitcoin holdings. Previously, spot Bitcoin ETF demand and institutional buying absorbed much of this selling pressure. However, the current situation reveals a worrying imbalance. With ETF inflows declining and retail participation dropping, the market faces direct exposure to this massive dormant BTC sell-off without its usual buffers. Why Are Long-Term Holders Selling Now? Understanding this sell-off requires examining several key factors: Profit-taking opportunities after Bitcoin’s significant price appreciation Macroeconomic concerns influencing investment decisions Changing risk appetite among early cryptocurrency adopters Portfolio rebalancing as investors diversify their crypto holdings The K33 Research report highlights that selling pressure over the past 30 days has been the strongest in five years. This suggests a coordinated or sentiment-driven movement among long-term holders rather than isolated decisions. How Does This Impact Bitcoin’s Market Stability? When dormant BTC enters circulation, it increases available supply. Normally, healthy markets absorb this additional supply through new demand. However, current conditions present challenges: First, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have declined recently, reducing institutional buying pressure. Second, derivatives trading volume has decreased, indicating lower speculative activity. Third, retail investor participation remains subdued compared to previous bull markets. This combination creates what analysts call an ‘unstable market’ scenario. The substantial dormant BTC sell-off meets reduced buying interest, potentially leading to increased price volatility and downward pressure. What Can Investors Learn From This Situation? This massive movement of previously inactive Bitcoin offers valuable insights for cryptocurrency investors: Monitor holder behavior metrics alongside price movements Understand supply dynamics beyond simple circulating supply figures Watch for correlation changes between different market participant groups Consider time horizons when evaluating market sentiment indicators The movement of dormant BTC serves as a crucial indicator of market health. When long-term holders who have weathered previous cycles begin selling en masse, it warrants attention from all market participants. What’s Next for Bitcoin Markets? The critical question remains: Can new demand sources emerge to absorb this dormant BTC supply? Several potential developments could change the current dynamic: Increased institutional adoption through new financial products might revive ETF inflows. Regulatory clarity could bring traditional investors into cryptocurrency markets. Technological developments might create new use cases driving Bitcoin demand. However, in the immediate term, markets must navigate this unprecedented supply increase. The $300 billion in previously inactive Bitcoin now seeking buyers represents both a challenge and an opportunity for market structure evolution. Conclusion: Navigating the New Bitcoin Landscape The $300 billion dormant BTC movement marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency markets. Long-term holder behavior has shifted dramatically, exposing underlying market fragility previously masked by institutional demand. While concerning in the short term, this development ultimately reflects Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class. Successful navigation of this new landscape requires understanding supply dynamics beyond surface-level metrics. The movement of previously inactive Bitcoin tells a deeper story about holder psychology, market structure, and cryptocurrency’s evolving role in global finance. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is dormant BTC? Dormant BTC refers to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from its wallet address for an extended period, typically one year or more. These coins represent long-term holder positions that suddenly becoming active signals significant market changes. Why does dormant BTC selling affect prices? When dormant BTC enters the market, it increases available supply. If this additional supply meets reduced demand, it creates selling pressure that can push prices downward, especially in already volatile conditions. How unusual is this $300 billion movement? Extremely unusual. The K33 Research report indicates this represents the strongest selling pressure from long-term holders in five years, making it a historically significant event in Bitcoin markets. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this news? Not necessarily. While the dormant BTC movement indicates increased selling pressure, investment decisions should consider your individual strategy, time horizon, and risk tolerance rather than reacting to single data points. Will this affect Bitcoin’s long-term value? Short-term price movements don’t necessarily impact long-term value. Bitcoin has weathered similar supply events throughout its history, though the scale of this particular movement warrants close monitoring. How can I track dormant BTC movements? Several blockchain analytics platforms track holder behavior metrics, including Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and specialized research firms like K33 Research that published the original report.

Danal, the operator behind the popular Paycoin (PCI) payment system, has officially joined the Circle Alliance Program . This strategic move makes Danal the first South Korean payment company to enter this exclusive global initiative led by USDC issuer Circle. For crypto enthusiasts and industry watchers, this signals a major step toward mainstream stablecoin adoption in one of Asia’s most dynamic digital economies. What Does Joining the Circle Alliance Program Mean? Circle launched its Circle Alliance Program in November 2023 with a clear vision: to build a more open, inclusive, and internet-native financial system. The program connects traditional financial institutions, fintech innovators, and blockchain developers. Therefore, Danal’s entry is not just a membership; it’s a commitment to co-developing the infrastructure for the future of money. This partnership focuses on exploring stablecoin services specifically tailored for the South Korean market, which has shown immense appetite for digital assets but operates under strict regulatory frameworks. Why is This Partnership a Game-Changer for South Korea? The collaboration between a domestic payment giant and a global stablecoin leader addresses several key challenges in the Korean market. First, it bridges the gap between local payment networks and global dollar-denominated digital assets like USDC. Second, it provides a regulated pathway for innovation. The companies held informal talks earlier this year, laying the groundwork for this formal alliance. Their cooperation could lead to: Enhanced Cross-Border Payments: Faster and cheaper remittances using USDC. New Merchant Solutions: Integrating stablecoin payments into Danal’s existing Paycoin ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: Working within Korea’s evolving digital asset framework to set industry standards. How Will the Circle Alliance Program Shape Fintech’s Future? This alliance is a powerful example of how traditional finance and crypto-native companies can collaborate. For users, the benefits are tangible: increased financial access, reduced transaction costs, and exposure to global markets. For the industry, it demonstrates that compliance and innovation can go hand-in-hand. Moreover, Danal’s pioneering role may encourage other Korean financial institutions to explore similar blockchain integrations, accelerating the region’s digital transformation. What Are the Immediate Next Steps for Danal and Circle? While the announcement is formal, the real work begins now. The focus will likely be on pilot programs and regulatory dialogue. Key areas to watch include how they navigate Korea’s specific rules on foreign-currency-linked stablecoins and how they integrate USDC into a market dominated by local payment methods. The success of this Circle Alliance Program partnership could serve as a blueprint for other markets in Asia and beyond. In conclusion, Danal’s entry into the Circle Alliance Program is more than a corporate announcement. It is a strategic leap that merges South Korea’s advanced payment infrastructure with the borderless potential of stablecoins. This partnership promises to enhance financial inclusion, streamline cross-border commerce, and set a new standard for regulated crypto innovation. The eyes of the global fintech world are now on Seoul, watching this alliance unfold and redefine the future of digital payments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Circle Alliance Program? The Circle Alliance Program is an initiative launched by Circle, the issuer of USDC, to partner with financial institutions and fintech companies worldwide to build an internet-based financial system using stablecoin technology. Why is Danal’s membership significant? Danal is the first South Korean payment company to join the program. This gives Circle a major foothold in Korea’s large and tech-savvy market and allows Danal to pioneer new stablecoin services for its users. What is Paycoin (PCI)? Paycoin is a South Korean digital payment platform and cryptocurrency operated by Danal. It is widely used for everyday transactions, similar to how one might use a digital wallet or a domestic payment app. How could this affect USDC adoption in Asia? A successful partnership in a major market like South Korea could encourage adoption in neighboring countries and demonstrate a working model for integrating global stablecoins with local payment rails. What are the regulatory challenges? South Korea has strict regulations for crypto assets. A key challenge will be ensuring that any USDC-based services comply with local laws regarding foreign exchange and anti-money laundering (AML). Will this make crypto payments easier in Korea? Potentially, yes. By integrating a stable, widely accepted asset like USDC into a familiar payment system like Danal’s, it could simplify crypto payments for both consumers and merchants.

According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s ongoing retracement and key support levels could trigger a stronger correction for XRP. However, this projected downtrend is expected to pave the way for a reversal to higher target levels. XRP Price Outlook Tied To Bitcoin Retracement While the broader crypto market continued to trend lower, crypto market expert Tara shared a fresh technical analysis on XRP. On Tuesday, she stated in an X post that the current XRP price structure shows it is completing a deeper pullback compared to Bitcoin, which is still progressing through its corrective phase. According to her, this mismatch is likely to create irregular price behavior for XRP in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing Tara noted that XRP recently touched the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level near $1.95 after crashing below $2 last week. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price is only halfway to a similar Fibonacci level. She notes that Bitcoin’s gradual retracement could slightly disrupt XRP’s price movements. However, if BTC pushes for its 0.382 retracement near $88,800, the analyst believes that it could eventually serve as a major catalyst for renewed strength in XRP. In her analysis report, Tara highlighted key downside levels for XRP traders to watch closely. She disclosed that a breakdown below $1.916 could open the door for a short-term move toward $1.90, where the Lower Time Frame (LTF) support sits. She further added that another test near $1.88 remains possible as long as XRP continues to trade under $2.0. Notably, Tara has marked $2 as a key resistance zone that could cap any recovery attempt from XRP. She notes that a move back to this level would likely depend on Bitcoin pushing higher during its retracement. The accompanying chart clearly shows XRP trading in a downtrend on the 4-hour timeframe with price remaining below short-term Moving Averages (MA). Fibonacci levels also highlight $1.95 as a complete retracement area, while deeper support zones cluster between $1.90 and $1.88. The RSI indicator at the bottom of the chart is hovering in the lower range, suggesting weakening momentum but also the potential for a relief bounce if support holds. XRP Short-Term Rally Stays Under $2.30 Responding to questions under her X post, Tara provided insights into XRP’s price outlook, focusing on both short- and long-term expectations. She noted that the $2 level only represents the LTF resistance for XRP, while the real barrier lies much higher at $9. Currently trading around $1.91, a move to $9 would reflect a more than 374% price increase. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why Given XRP’s downtrend and broader market uncertainty, Tara has indicated that a rally to $9 is unlikely in the near term. She also dismissed claims that the cryptocurrency could crash to $1 this December. Instead, she shared her bullish expectations, suggesting that XRP could reach no higher than $2.30 before the year runs out.

After weeks of choppy price action and repeated failures to sustain upside momentum, sentiment across the market has shifted sharply. Fear and apathy are increasingly dominant, with a growing number of analysts and participants beginning to call for a broader bear market. For many investors, the narrative has changed from buying dips to questioning whether the cycle has already peaked. This deterioration in confidence is occurring alongside renewed selling pressure from large, well-capitalized players. According to data from Arkham, two wallets linked to Matrixport deposited a combined 4,000 BTC, worth approximately $347.56 million, into Binance today. Matrixport is a large digital-asset financial services platform founded by former Bitmain executives, offering products including crypto lending, structured products, asset management, and custody solutions. Such large inflows to exchanges are closely watched by the market, as they often precede distribution or hedging activity, particularly during periods of heightened uncertainty. While not every deposit translates directly into spot selling, the timing of these transfers adds to the growing sense of caution. Whether current demand can absorb this supply and stabilize price will likely determine if this phase becomes a deeper correction—or the start of a more prolonged bearish regime. Exchange Inflows And What They Mean For Bitcoin Large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges are almost always interpreted by the market as a bearish signal, since they increase the immediate supply available for sale. In most historical cases, sharp spikes in exchange inflows have preceded periods of downside volatility, reinforcing the perception that whales are preparing to distribute into liquidity. However, some investors urge caution when reading this data in isolation, as not every exchange transfer results in spot selling. In certain scenarios, large inflows can be linked to internal treasury management, collateral rotation, or the opening of hedged derivatives positions rather than outright liquidation. Institutions may move Bitcoin to centralized venues to post margin for futures or options, allowing them to hedge downside risk without selling their underlying holdings. In other cases, funds prepare liquidity for over-the-counter settlements or cross-exchange arbitrage, activities that do not necessarily translate into sustained selling pressure on the spot market. Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s price action over the coming months will likely depend on whether these inflows are followed by a clear increase in realized selling volume. If demand continues to absorb supply near the $85K–$86K zone, the market could transition into a prolonged consolidation phase, allowing sentiment to reset. However, if exchange balances continue to rise alongside weakening spot demand, downside risks remain elevated. In that scenario, Bitcoin may revisit lower support levels before any durable recovery can begin. Price Tests Critical Long-Term Support Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure shows a clear loss of momentum after failing to hold above prior highs. On the weekly chart, BTC is now consolidating around the $86,000–$87,000 zone after a sharp rejection from the $110,000–$120,000 region. This area has become a critical demand zone, as price is currently hovering near the rising 200-day moving average, which historically acts as a key trend filter during cycle transitions. The short-term structure remains fragile. Bitcoin is trading below the 50-week moving average, which has started to roll over, signaling weakening upside momentum. Meanwhile, the 100-week moving average is still trending higher and sits below the current price, suggesting that the broader macro trend has not fully broken but is clearly under stress. From a price-action perspective, BTC is forming a lower high relative to the previous cycle peak, while volatility remains compressed. This often precedes a larger directional move. If bulls fail to defend the $85,000 support decisively, the next downside targets sit near the $78,000–$80,000 region, where previous consolidation occurred. Conversely, any structural recovery would require a reclaim and weekly close above $90,000, followed by sustained acceptance above the 50-week average.

Coinbase said it is rolling out a full set of new features that push the platform into stocks, advanced trading tools, and a full prediction-market setup, as well as adding on-chain products for businesses, developers, and users who want automated financial guidance. The company said these features have been in the pipeline for months but are now finished and ready for customers. CEO Brian Armstrong said he wants the platform to become the place where people trade every major asset. Coinbase expands trading lineup with stocks, futures, and prediction markets Brian said the plan includes stocks, a simpler futures and perpetuals layout, and prediction markets built through Kalshi. Coinbase is also building a tokenization roadmap that aims to bring more traditional assets on-chain, including equities. He said this push is meant to take the first step toward a world where stock trading and tokenized assets sit in the same app. The prediction-market space is getting crowded fast. DraftKings is buying its own exchange. FanDuel is teaming up with CME. Polymarket is entering the U.S. through a new approved venue. Good morning. We’re going to announce a lot of cool stuff today. If you have notifications on, sorry in advance. See you on the livestream. — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) December 17, 2025 Robinhood is putting LedgerX at the center of its regulated derivatives plan. The main rivalry remains Kalshi versus Polymarket, which Brian described as regulated rails against crypto-native liquidity. He said prediction markets are not only for trading but for reading what people expect to happen next. “If you look at things like economic indicators … or elections, people are using prediction markets to try to figure out what is going to happen next month,” Brian told CNBC. He added that only a small group use them for trading, while most use them to check sentiment, saying it can feel like an alternative to traditional media or even entertainment. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October, Brian joked about how prediction markets can be influenced. “I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call,” he said. “And I just want to add here the words bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, staking and Web3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call.” Robinhood expanded its own prediction-market push this week with parlays and prop-style contracts.It also said the category is now its fastest-growing business by revenue. Coinbase is adding the same kind of outcome trading to its ecosystem as part of a bigger model where one app holds traditional assets, derivatives, and on-chain activity. Moving assets on-chain and building tools for businesses and developers Coinbase tied this expansion to its tokenization plans.It is launching Coinbase Tokenize, a stack for institutions that want support for real-world asset tokenization. Brian said stock trading is “a good first step,” but the real goal is tokenized equities. Brian said tokenized equity could “democratize access for people over the world,” and open the door for new market structures in the U.S., including stronger futures markets tied to equities. “So this is the starting point,” he said. The rollout also widens Coinbase’s on-chain liquidity role. The company said it wants to be more than a place where tokens are listed. It wants to be a core provider of liquidity across markets. For businesses and developers, the company is expanding its reach beyond retail users. Coinbase Business is opening to eligible customers in the U.S. and Singapore. Coinbase is also releasing a larger API suite that spans custody, payments, trading, and stablecoins. Brian said, “Crypto is updating all financial services,” predicting that every major asset class will move on-chain, from equities and prediction markets to commodities and real-world assets like real estate. Coinbase is also introducing “custom stablecoins” for businesses that want their own branded payment rails. It is promoting x402, a payments standard designed to attach stablecoin payments to web requests, including automated commerce and agent-driven transactions. Coinbase said the long-term goal behind all of this is to keep users on the platform across every market cycle. It already owns a large crypto-native base and wants those users to stay and trade other asset classes even when volumes fall and spot-trade revenue dips.

Approximately 50% of Robinhood users expressed plans to allocate new capital specifically to prediction market trading. In contrast, only 37% of Coinbase users shared the same intention. This gap is more than just a percentage point. It signals a stronger user appetite and a higher potential for prediction market revenue growth on the Robinhood platform. Consequently, Mizuho has raised its financial forecast for Robinhood based on this projected demand. Why Is Robinhood’s User Base More Engaged? Understanding this divergence requires looking at each platform’s core identity. Robinhood built its reputation on democratizing stock and ETF trading for everyday investors. Its interface is famously simple and geared towards accessibility. Familiarity with Event-Based Trading: Robinhood users are already accustomed to trading based on company earnings, economic data, and other events. Prediction markets, which allow betting on real-world outcomes, are a natural extension. Broader Demographic Appeal: The platform’s design attracts users interested in various asset classes, making them more likely to explore a new product like prediction markets. Therefore, the survey suggests Robinhood’s community sees prediction markets as a new, exciting addition to their portfolio. Could Prediction Markets Hurt Coinbase’s Core Business? Mizuho’s report carries a warning for Coinbase. The bank didn’t just raise its outlook for Robinhood; it also lowered its price target for Coinbase . The primary concern is cannibalization. Coinbase’s main revenue driver is cryptocurrency trading fees. The bank worries that if Coinbase users shift their attention and capital from buying Bitcoin or Ethereum to trading on prediction markets, it could eat into their established, lucrative business. This potential internal competition makes analysts cautious about Coinbase’s near-term growth from this new venture. What Are the Real-World Implications for Traders? This shift isn’t just about Wall Street forecasts. It has tangible effects for anyone using these apps. A platform generating higher prediction market revenue will likely invest more back into that product. Better Features & Markets: Expect Robinhood to potentially offer more prediction events, improved interfaces, and competitive incentives to solidify its lead. Strategic Divergence: Coinbase may take a more measured approach, carefully balancing its new prediction market against its core crypto trading to avoid self-cannibalization. This competition ultimately benefits users through innovation, but it also clarifies the strategic paths these two giants are taking. The Final Verdict on the Prediction Market Race Mizuho’s analysis provides a compelling snapshot of a market in flux. While both Robinhood and Coinbase have launched prediction markets, user readiness appears starkly different. Robinhood’s integrated, multi-asset approach seems to give it an early edge in capturing user interest and, by extension, prediction market revenue . For Coinbase, the challenge is unique. It must prove that prediction markets can be a true growth engine without undermining the cryptocurrency trading empire it has built. The coming quarters will reveal which strategy wins, reshaping how we interact with financial markets online. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are prediction markets in this context? A: They are platforms where users can trade shares based on the predicted outcome of real-world events (like elections or sports), turning opinions into tradable assets. Q: Why did Mizuho lower Coinbase’s price target? A: Due to concerns that Coinbase’s new prediction market service might draw users and funds away from its primary business of cryptocurrency trading, potentially reducing overall revenue. Q: How many users did Mizuho survey? A: The analysis was based on a survey of 230 users across both the Robinhood and Coinbase platforms. Q: Does this mean Coinbase’s prediction market will fail? A: Not necessarily. It means analysts see more immediate growth potential for Robinhood in this area. Coinbase’s success will depend on how it integrates the service without hurting its core crypto trading. Q: Should I switch platforms based on this news? A: Your choice should depend on your primary investment goals. If exploring prediction markets is a priority, Robinhood’s user data suggests stronger engagement. For focused crypto trading, both platforms remain major players. Found this analysis of the shifting prediction market revenue landscape insightful?

In a move that highlights the evolving nature of blockchain technology, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a temporary Binance INJ suspension . Starting at 1:00 p.m. UTC on December 18th, deposits and withdrawals for INJ will be paused. This proactive step is to ensure a smooth and secure network upgrade and hard fork for the Injective protocol. If you’re trading or holding INJ, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief intermission confidently. Why is Binance Suspending INJ Transactions? The core reason for the Binance INJ suspension is straightforward: to support the Injective network’s own scheduled upgrade. Think of it like a scheduled power outage in your neighborhood so the utility company can install a new, more powerful transformer. Binance is halting the flow of INJ tokens on and off its platform to prevent any potential issues, such as lost transactions or funds being sent to incorrect addresses, during the blockchain’s transition period. This is a standard, safety-first practice in the crypto industry during major network events. What Does This Mean for Your INJ Holdings? First and foremost, don’t panic. This suspension is temporary and planned. Here’s a clear breakdown of what is and isn’t affected: Trading is NOT suspended: You can still buy, sell, and trade INJ against other cryptocurrencies on Binance’s spot and futures markets during this period. Deposits and Withdrawals ARE suspended: You cannot send INJ from an external wallet to your Binance account, or from your Binance account to an external wallet. Your assets are safe: The INJ tokens already in your Binance wallet remain secure and under your control. The key takeaway is that while the movement of INJ is paused, your ability to manage your position within the exchange continues uninterrupted. How to Prepare for the Binance INJ Network Upgrade A little preparation goes a long way. To ensure you’re not caught off guard by the Binance INJ suspension , consider these simple steps: Complete pending transfers early: If you need to move INJ, do so well before the 1:00 p.m. UTC deadline on December 18th. Monitor official channels: Follow Binance’s official announcements and the Injective project’s social media for the “all-clear” notice when services resume. Understand the upgrade’s purpose: Network upgrades often bring enhancements like improved speed, lower fees, or new features. This pause is a sign of progress for the Injective ecosystem. The Bigger Picture: Why Network Upgrades Matter While a temporary Binance INJ suspension might seem like a minor inconvenience, it underscores a critical strength of leading blockchain projects: their capacity for improvement. Hard forks and upgrades are essential for: Enhancing Security: Patching vulnerabilities and strengthening the network against threats. Boosting Scalability: Enabling the network to handle more transactions faster and cheaper. Introducing New Features: Unlocking new functionalities for developers and users. Therefore, this brief operational pause by Binance is a collaborative step towards a more robust and capable Injective network for all users. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain The temporary Binance INJ suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a routine and responsible action. It reflects the exchange’s commitment to user asset safety during significant blockchain events. For traders and holders, it’s a short-term operational note, not a cause for concern. By understanding the reasons and planning accordingly, you can view this moment not as a disruption, but as a necessary step in the ongoing evolution and maturation of the Injective protocol. The resumption of services will mark the successful completion of an upgrade, paving the way for a better network experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When will Binance resume INJ deposits and withdrawals? Binance will resume services once the Injective network upgrade is confirmed to be stable. They will make a separate announcement. There is no pre-announced end time, so users should monitor official channels. Can I still trade INJ on Binance during the suspension? Yes. The suspension only applies to depositing INJ into your Binance account and withdrawing INJ out of it. All spot and futures trading for INJ will continue as normal. Are my INJ tokens safe on Binance during this time? Yes. Your existing INJ balance in your Binance wallet is not affected and remains secure. The suspension is a preventive measure for transaction processing, not a security issue. What happens if I try to send INJ to Binance during the suspension? Any INJ deposits sent to Binance after the suspension begins will not be credited to your account. The transactions may be lost. It is crucial to wait until Binance officially announces that deposit services have reopened. What is a “hard fork” in this context? A hard fork is a permanent divergence in a blockchain’s protocol, creating a new set of rules. It often requires all nodes and users to upgrade to the latest version. Exchanges like Binance pause services to safely manage this transition for their users. Will other exchanges also suspend INJ services? It is likely. Other major exchanges that support INJ often announce similar temporary suspensions to facilitate the same network upgrade. Always check the announcements page of your specific exchange.

The entrepreneur revealed that he lost approximately $14,189 (100,000 yuan) in cryptocurrency that he had accumulated over the course of eight years. Koh detailed his encounter on Monday on LinkedIn, which was later reported by the Lianhe Zaobao Newspaper. The digital asset investor confirmed that he didn’t lose his portfolio due to a crypto rug pull or from linking to a malicious dApp. He added that he hasn’t left his wallet open since his involvement in Web3 in 2017. Koh regrets keeping his virtual assets on-chain The early Polygon investor said he believed in crypto and helped build the DeFi ecosystem on Polygon and BSC. Koh revealed that his belief in keeping virtual assets on-chain instead of on centralized exchanges cost him everything. The angel investor said he found a beta testing campaign for a gaming project called MetaJoy in a Telegram group. He confirmed that the campaign had a professional website, active Discord, and GitBook documentation. A local newspaper revealed that Koh met a team member named Shanni, who claimed to be the co-founder of the Meta team. He saw that Shanni had listed some of his professional credentials, including from Persistence One and Bitunix Official. The entrepreneur added that he was also convinced since the team replied to his questions thoughtfully and didn’t rush him. Koh argued that his numerous evaluations of Web3 projects gave him an edge in spotting scams. However, he acknowledged that the fatal mistake he made was downloading the MetaJoy game launcher, which is intended for testing beta versions. He noted that the malware in the game embedded itself in his system the moment he ran the installer. The crypto entrepreneur said he was shocked by the sophistication of the attack, as he had never connected his wallet to anything. Koh added that his Norton antivirus, which he’s on 360 deluxe, immediately flagged suspicious activity. He said he thought he was safe after deleting every suspicious file he could find in his registry entries. He added that he was even more confident about his safety after enabling TPM 2.0, memory isolation, and reinstalling Windows 11. Koh found that all wallets connected to his Rabby and Phantom browser extensions had been completely drained just 24 hours after the incident. He also acknowledged that not just his main wallet, but all of them. “The malware had already exfiltrated my encrypted wallet data before I even knew anything was wrong. All my cleanup efforts were already too late. The attacker waited patiently, decoded what they needed, and executed the theft when I thought the danger had passed.” – Mark Koh , Co-Founder of RektSurvivor. Koh filed a police report at 21:52 hours on December 12 under Report number F/20251212/7113. He said he has been waiting for someone from the Singapore Police Force to contact him for the last three days. Attacker offramps stolen funds through CEXs Koh said his involvement in the project stemmed from his belief in TPRO Network, SBP Game, and NeverLetGo. He added that he planned to support those projects by holding their crypto assets. The angel investor believes the incident was credential theft at the operating system level. He also said his belief in self-custody over centralized exchanges, which he had advocated for years, backfired immediately. The co-founder of RektSurvivor said his firm helps people who’ve lost funds in crypto, but he’s now one of the victims. The entrepreneur believes that the attacker may have sent the funds to other exchanges, including Cryptomus, Binance, and WhiteBIT.

But there’s one factor players underestimate: volatility. The price of LTC moves constantly, and those fluctuations directly influence your bankroll, your bet sizing and even your cash-out timing. If you ignore it, you’ll make weak decisions. If you understand it, volatility becomes part of your edge. Why Volatility Matters More in Crypto Gambling Traditional casino currency is stable. Ten euros today is ten euros tomorrow. With LTC, your bankroll shifts even when you’re not touching it. A winning streak can be worth less the next morning, and a mediocre session can suddenly look great after a market pump. In other words: you’re playing two games at once. 1. The casino game itself2. The market value of the coin you’re using Your strategy must account for both. Bankroll Strategy: Fixed LTC vs Fixed Fiat Value Most LTC gamblers choose one of two approaches. Fixed LTC Bankroll You decide: “My bankroll is 5 LTC. That’s it.” This is simple and crypto-native, but it exposes you fully to volatility. If LTC drops 15 percent overnight, your bankroll effectively shrinks even if you didn't lose a bet. When to use: • You believe LTC will go up long term• You don’t mind variance• Your casino sessions are short Fixed Fiat Value Bankroll You treat your bankroll as if you’re playing with a stable value. Example: you want a 300 dollar bankroll, so you convert that into LTC at the moment of play. This reduces volatility risk during play, but you still face volatility before and after each session. When to use: • You play strategically and compare results across sessions• You want consistent risk exposure• You prefer predictable bet sizing Bet Sizing: Avoid Static Bets in a Moving Market Crypto beginners often lock in static bets like “I’ll bet 0.01 LTC each round.”This breaks quickly when the LTC price moves 10, 20 or even 30 percent. Better practice: parallel sizing. • Define a base unit in fiat terms (for example 2 dollars per bet)• Convert that to LTC each session• Adjust if the market moves significantly mid-session This prevents your bet sizing from becoming accidentally high-risk during market drops or too conservative when LTC pumps. Volatility Windows: When to Play, When to Pause Not every part of the day is equally favourable for LTC gambling . Market conditions matter. High-volatility periods • Major announcements• Halving cycles• FOMC or macro news• Large LTC whale movements Effect on strategy: • Play shorter sessions• Stick to smaller stakes• Cash out faster if you’re ahead Reason: You’re carrying exposure both in the casino game and the market swing. Low-volatility periods Price movement is slow and predictable. Effect on strategy: • Normal or extended sessions• Stable bet sizing• You can hold your winnings longer Low volatility reduces external risk, making this the safest environment for LTC players. Winning and Cash-Out Strategy: Know When to Hold LTC When you win in LTC, you face a choice: 1. Cash out into stable value2. Hold your LTC and ride the market The decision depends on two factors: • Expected LTC trend• Your risk appetite If you expect LTC to rise Holding your winnings makes sense. A modest session can grow significantly if the market pumps. Many advanced players accept small casino gains because their real upside sits in the LTC price move. If you expect a drop Convert part of your winnings to stable value or withdraw. There’s no point winning 0.5 LTC and losing that value overnight. Hybrid approach This is what experienced gamblers use: Cash out 50 percent to lock profit and keep 50 percent as LTC exposure It’s risk-managed, simple and works across market cycles. Game Selection: Volatility Influences Your Risk Profile If LTC is highly volatile, your overall exposure increases. That means you should avoid additional high-variance games when the market is already unpredictable. In high LTC volatility Choose: • Blackjack• Baccarat• Low-volatility slots• Live roulette with steady RTP Avoid: • Crash• Plinko with wide multipliers• High-variance slots Reason: You don’t stack multiple layers of volatility. In low LTC volatility Your risk budget is bigger.High-volatility games become more acceptable. Long-Term Impact: Variance Becomes Part of Your Profit Curve Litecoin gamblers who think long-term treat LTC volatility as part of their expected return. You might lose a bit in the casino but win on the LTC price move. Or you win in the casino but LTC drops and erases half the gain. Your goal is to make volatility work for you, not against you. That means: • Track results in both LTC and fiat• Use consistent bet sizing• Avoid emotional decisions during price spikes• Understand that your bankroll is dynamic Volatility Is Not Your Enemy Volatility is only dangerous if you ignore it. Handled well, it can amplify your winnings and sharpen your strategy. Litecoins.com readers who adapt to volatility think in two layers: the casino layer and the market layer. Once you master both, you play smarter than 90 percent of crypto casino users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This vision is moving closer to reality. In a significant blockchain development, Creditcoin (CTC) has announced a powerful partnership with the privacy-focused network, Midnight. Their mission? To construct a revolutionary decentralized identity infrastructure that can stand firm against the rising tide of AI-powered deepfakes and fraud. What Does This Decentralized Identity Partnership Aim to Achieve? At its core, this collaboration is about merging two powerful forces. Creditcoin brings a unique asset to the table: verifiable, on-chain credit history. Meanwhile, Midnight, a project led by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, contributes its advanced privacy-preserving technology. The goal is to create a new model for human authentication. This model wouldn’t rely on easily stolen documents but on a person’s proven financial behavior, all while keeping their sensitive data completely private. Why Is a New Decentralized Identity System Urgently Needed? The digital landscape is becoming increasingly hazardous. Sophisticated AI tools can now generate convincing fake videos, audio, and documents, making traditional verification methods obsolete. This partnership directly addresses that threat. The proposed decentralized identity framework aims to: Verify Economic Activity: Confirm a user’s real-world financial behavior without exposing transaction details. Combat Deepfakes: Create a verification layer that AI-generated forgeries cannot easily bypass. Preserve Privacy: Use zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy tech to share only the proof of legitimacy, not the underlying data. How Will Creditcoin and Midnight’s Technologies Work Together? Think of it as building a trustworthy digital resume that you control. Creditcoin’s blockchain acts as a secure, tamper-proof ledger of creditworthy interactions. Midnight’s platform provides the “privacy cloak,” allowing you to present proof of your good history without revealing the specifics. For example, you could prove you have a reliable repayment history to a lender without showing every loan you’ve ever taken. This synergy could unlock secure access to global financial services for millions. What Are the Potential Challenges for This Decentralized Identity Vision? While the potential is transformative, the path has hurdles. Widespread adoption requires convincing institutions and users to trust a new, unfamiliar system. Furthermore, designing a decentralized identity protocol that is both globally interoperable and compliant with diverse regional regulations is a complex task. The technical challenge of making the system seamless for everyday users cannot be underestimated. The Transformative Impact of a Successful Decentralized Identity System Success here would be a watershed moment. It would shift power from centralized data hoarders back to individuals. You would own and control your digital self. This could revolutionize everything from KYC processes and secure voting to streamlined job applications and trusted social media interactions. The partnership between Creditcoin and Midnight isn’t just building a tool; it’s laying the groundwork for a more secure and private internet. In conclusion, the alliance between Creditcoin and Midnight marks a proactive step toward solving one of the web’s most pressing issues: proving you are you in the age of AI. By leveraging on-chain credit data and cutting-edge privacy technology, they are pioneering a decentralized identity solution that promises enhanced security, user sovereignty, and resilience against digital forgery. This collaboration could very well define the standard for how we establish trust online in the coming decade. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is decentralized identity (DID)? Decentralized identity is a model where individuals own and control their digital identifiers (like a digital driver’s license) without relying on a central authority like a government or corporation. How can blockchain verify my identity without my data? Using privacy technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, a blockchain can verify that your data meets certain criteria (e.g., “credit score > 700”) without ever seeing the actual score or your personal details. What role does Creditcoin play in this partnership? Creditcoin provides the foundational layer of verifiable, on-chain financial history and credit data that can be used as a proof point for authentication. Who is behind the Midnight blockchain? Midnight is a privacy-focused blockchain project developed by Input Output Global (IOG) and led by Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano. Can this technology really stop AI deepfakes? It aims to create a verification layer that is separate from easily forged media. While not a “silver bullet,” it makes identity theft and synthetic fraud significantly harder by anchoring identity to immutable, private behavioral proof. When will this decentralized identity system be available? The announcement is for a research and development collaboration. A functional, mainstream product will likely take considerable time for development, testing, and adoption. Found this deep dive into the future of digital identity fascinating?

Rumors suggest that the initiative is part of Google’s ambitious plan to advance its Tensor Processing ​Units as a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s industry-leading GPUs. Alphabet Inc., a multinational conglomerate and parent company that owns Google, is reportedly working with the U.S.-based Social Media conglomerate Meta to advance artificial intelligence and challenge Nvidia’s monopoly in the sector. NVIDIA’s stock drops by 6.21% as Google and Meta join efforts to weaken its AI dominance According to people familiar with the matter, Google and Meta are reportedly working on the development of TorchTPU, which aims to make Google’s TPU chips fully compatible with PyTorch, the leading AI software framework. The initiative aims to streamline the adoption of TPU chips, favoring customers who already have PyTorch software infrastructure. TPU adoption was heavily inhibited by its poor compatibility with PyTorch. NVIDIA’s stock price has plummeted by 6.21% in the last 24 hours, and the stock is currently trading at $171.46. The stock is down 8.12% in the last month but has surged by 27.84% YTD, according to data from real-time stock price tracking platform Google Finance. The sources also revealed that Google has devoted more resources and organizational focus to the development of TorchTPUs due to the growing demand for TPU chips among tech companies. The company is also opting to open-source parts of the software to accelerate adoption among customers, according to the anonymous tips. AI developers utilize PyTorch to develop AI models, and Meta provides significant support for its development. The partnership aims to challenge Nvidia’s dominance and monopoly over the AI sector. The chip maker currently dominates the AI processor industry through its CUDA software ecosystem. CUDA is Nvidia’s strongest shield against rising competition, according to some Wall Street analysts. The CUDA software is deeply integrated into PyTorch and has become the default method for training and running large AI models. The rumors also revealed that Meta has a strategic interest in developing software compatible with TPUs. Meta reportedly aims to diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s monopoly and lower inference costs. The partnership aligns with Google’s objective to make its TPUs a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, which have gained a monopoly in the sector. TPU revenue has significantly boosted the company’s cloud revenue, as Google seeks to demonstrate to investors that its AI investments are profitable. Google begins commissioning TPUs for commercial supply For the longest time, Google had reserved a majority of its TPU supply for internal use only. However, the company switched policies in 2022 when Google’s cloud computing unit gained control over the group that sells TPUs. The reforms took place amid the ongoing AI race, which has increased global chip demand and AI infrastructure. Google’s chips are specifically designed to run on the Jax software frameworks. Therefore, companies that have already installed PyTorch frameworks would need to reengineer their infrastructure to accommodate the Jax frameworks, a costly process that would require significant time and resources to achieve. Once Google’s initiative to make its chips PyTorch compatible is successful, the companies will incur significantly reduced costs to modify their infrastructure to house the chips. Google requires solutions to supply Google Cloud customers, such as Anthropic, who purchase TPUs and run its products, including Google AI-powered search and the Gemini chatbot. Google’s ties to Meta in AI technology advancement were previously uncovered by a recent Cryptopolitan report , which revealed that the two tech giants were discussing a multi-billion-dollar deal to supply Meta with Google’s AI chips. Google’s recent moves have revealed the company’s obsession with AI technology. According to another report by Cryptopolitan, the company backed a multi-year contract deal worth $7 billion that Hut 8 signed to lease a data center in Louisiana. A press release revealed that Google will provide financial support to cover the lease payments and related pass-through obligations.

Bitcoin Could Trade At A Discount If No Quantum Fix Is Deployed As Quantum Computing continues to advance, many in the Bitcoin community have been raising concerns about what a breakthrough could mean for the cryptocurrency. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has been one of those voices. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Top Whales Reverse Course, Quietly Scoop Up $263M In LINK Last week, Edwards gave a presentation on the Quantum threat to Bitcoin at the Global Blockchain Show in Abu Dhabi. The analyst has also shared some insights on X. According to Edwards, there’s a 34% chance that Quantum will undermine BTC’s cryptography in the next three years. Based on this, the Capriole founder has assigned a 34% discount to BTC today. “Given a 2-3 yr timeline to deploy fix, this is the current discount rate,” noted Edwards. “And it is growing. Every. Single. Day.” The probability has been estimated using seven different sources providing timelines for Quantum Computing breakthroughs. If Capriole’s calculations are to go by, the Quantum threat has a chance of more than 50% to affect blockchain technology by 2030. What will happen in the scenario that Quantum Computing does end up unlocking Bitcoin’s cryptography? Even if wallets today are secured properly, there are still old wallets that can be vulnerable. A chunk of the BTC supply has been dormant for years, and with a Quantum breakthrough, it could potentially find its way back into circulation. The most popular example of dormant holdings is, of course, the ones attributed to the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi’s wallets hold a total of 1,096,354 BTC, worth a whopping $95 billion at current prices. All these coins possibly being dumped on the market would naturally have a negative effect on the Bitcoin price. Not just because of the scale involved, but also because of the loss of confidence that such an event would result in. Considering the threat, Capriole has repeatedly stressed that a fix needs to be implemented as soon as possible. So far, the community hasn’t reached a consensus on when or what the solution should be. In an X post, Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has also chimed in on the topic. “Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it,” wrote Saylor. “The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen.” In this scenario, the coins attached to Satoshi and other early miners will forever become inaccessible. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush Edwards has warned that if a solution isn’t implemented in time, the coin may face its biggest bear market in history. “If we haven’t deployed a fix by 2028, I expect Bitcoin will be sub $50K and continue to fall until it’s fixed,” said the Capriole founder. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,500, down 5.7% over the last week.

Intersect, which coordinates parts of Cardano’s governance process, said on X: “On the 7th day of GA… We hit the Epoch’s end. DReps at 80%. Stake pools supporting- It looks like we have a new CC. Ratified. Thank you to everyone who reviewed, voted, and wrote rationales,Santa has been notified.” Why The Cardano Governance Was Stuck Cardano’s governance model is tripartite: delegate representatives (DReps), stake pool operators (SPOs), and the Constitutional Committee . The CC plays a gatekeeping role: it judges whether on-chain actions are constitutional and ratifies decisions needed for the network to adapt. That mechanism stalled after an unexpected mid-term departure left the CC below its minimum operational size. The Cardano Atlantic Council retired mid-term in epoch 597, opening a seat and reducing the committee below quorum. The consequence was that the Cardano CC could not ratify key actions, even as the chain continued to operate normally at the protocol level. The vote asked DReps and SPOs to ratify a newly elected CC member and restore the committee to full capacity. The candidate, Cardano Curia, was selected off-chain through a DRep vote using the Ekklesia tool, with on-chain ratification required to formalize the result. The governance materials described the restoration as bringing the CC back to seven members and activating a clarified alternate-member process to handle future vacancies with less disruption. Approval thresholds were set at 67% from DReps and 51% support from SPOs. Intersect’s update indicates those thresholds were met as the epoch ended. Why This Was Treated As Urgent The vote was framed as more than housekeeping because an undersized CC effectively blocks major governance flows. Without quorum: Treasury withdrawals couldn’t proceed, the Critical Integrations Budget could not pass, hard forks could not be ratified, delaying network upgrades and several categories of governance actions were blocked, leaving only a limited subset able to move forward. There was also a timing element: delays risk actions expiring, which would force a repeat of the voting process and extend the governance backlog. With the restoration ratified, Cardano’s governance process can resume normal throughput — reopening the path for upgrades, budget approvals, and protocol changes that depend on a functioning Constitutional Committee.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $14.03. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $22.81. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.90 Market Cap $1.57B Trading Volume $75.65M Circulating Supply 543.71M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.11 24-h Low $2.87 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 15.09% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 35.53 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.51 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30 %) 200-Day SMA $4.97 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish below $3.10. The key support zone for ICP is between $2.85 and $2.80. Only a reclaim of $3.05–$3.20 would hint at trend relief. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for December 18, ICP is trading around $2.90–$2.91 after a prolonged sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a firmly bearish structure. The price remains well below the mid and upper Bollinger Bands, with the 20-day basis near $3.43 acting as dynamic resistance, and the upper band around $4.05 far out of reach. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Currently, the RSI is hovering near 36, showing mild oversold conditions but no bullish divergence yet. The MACD stays negative and flat, signaling weak downside momentum rather than a reversal. As long as ICP fails to reclaim $3.10–$3.20, downside risk persists toward the $2.75–$2.80 zone. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP is attempting to stabilize just above $2.90 after a sharp selloff, but it remains capped below the Alligator averages, which are clustered between $2.98 and $3.08. This alignment confirms bearish trend control, with any bounce likely corrective. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD shows shallow negative momentum with no decisive bullish crossover, suggesting sellers are still dominant despite slowing pressure. A clean break above $3.05 would be needed to shift short-term bias, while failure risks another sweep toward $2.85. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.69 SELL SMA 5 $3.56 SELL SMA 10 $3.57 SELL SMA 21 $3.71 SELL SMA 50 $4.51 SELL SMA 100 $4.29 SELL SMA 200 $4.97 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $3.81 SELL EMA 5 $4.04 SELL EMA 10 $4.28 SELL EMA 21 $4.57 SELL EMA 50 $4.91 SELL EMA 100 $5.15 SELL EMA 200 $5.74 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis Overall, ICP is still in a corrective downtrend with only tentative signs of stabilization. Without a reclaim of $3.10 and above, rallies look vulnerable to rejection, while holding $2.85 is critical to avoid deeper continuation losses. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects.

The pressure built overnight as investors cut exposure to high-multiple technology names and the broader AI trade, a shift that usually spills into crypto when momentum fades. In early Asia, shares in Japan and Australia fell and Hong Kong shares pointed lower. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $86,575, down 1.1% Ether : $2,832, down 4.2% XRP : $1.86, down 3.7% Total crypto market cap: $3 trillion, down 1.5% Tech Rout Deepens As AI Valuation Fears Grip Wall Street In the US, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.9% on Wednesday. Nvidia slid 3.8% to its lowest since September, and the S&P 500 fell 1.2% to a three-week low, slipping under its 50-day moving average. Final S&P 500 $SPX Wednesday Heat Map Not quite the Santa Rally I expected.. pic.twitter.com/8Snp9mhHq4 — Jesse Cohen (@JesseCohenInv) December 17, 2025 The selling gathered pace as investors questioned whether the companies at the center of the AI boom can continue to justify their lofty valuations and heavy spending. Concerns around the cost and viability of data centre expansion added to the unease, with traders watching how big-ticket financing plans ripple through the sector. Oracle fell 5.4% after a report said its largest data centre partner, Blue Owl Capital, will not back a $10B deal for its next facility. Amazon slipped 0.6% after a report said it is in talks to invest about $10B in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and Alphabet dropped 3.2% after a Reuters report said Google is working on an effort, alongside Meta, to erode Nvidia’s software advantage. The chip complex took a broader hit. Broadcom fell 4.5% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.9%, reinforcing a market mood that has turned more sensitive to any sign that the AI buildout may deliver profits slower than hoped. Crypto Awaits CPI As Bitcoin Hovers Without Clear Support For Bitcoin, that backdrop kept the move heavy and the bounce restrained. Mike Marshall, head of research at Amberdata, said the key is that the “support bid” has not shown up in size. “We are seeing weak market structure beneath price and relatively light ETF inflows, which reduces the market’s ability to stabilize quickly when momentum flips. Broader macro worries around rates, growth uncertainty, and cautious risk sentiment are compounding it.” “In this environment, the market tends to probe until it finds a level where buyers have conviction. Based on our ETF cost-basis analysis, the first meaningful floor is near $80K, and if we see sustained outflows or tighter financial conditions, $60K becomes the next major reference,” he said. Rate markets reflected the same caution. Comments from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, often viewed as dovish, supported demand for two- and five-year Treasuries, and longer-dated bonds lagged, nudging the 10-year yield about one basis point higher to roughly 4.15%.

The comments come as the Avalanche ecosystem gains traction with institutional partners and enterprise developers heading into 2025. In an interview with TheStreet Roundtable, John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, emphasized the company’s long-term vision of creating customized blockchain environments tailored to specific use cases — from finance to global brands and enterprise deployments. Rather than following short‑lived trends that dominate social media, Nahas said Avalanche is focused on durable, real‑world blockchain solutions. “We don’t need more block space. We don’t need more blockchains,” Nahas said. “But we do need more blockchains that are purpose‑built, because that’s how the real world works.” Projects that dwell too heavily on buzzy crypto narratives also struggle to gain traction, says Nahas, as trends typically last only a few months before losing steam. He noted that Avalanche, by contrast, has emphasized fundamentals. Nahas said that this patience was now being rewarded, as adoption extended well beyond crypto-native users into traditional finance, international brands, and enterprise operators. He said valuable infrastructure takes time to build and that success in crypto today is increasingly a function of medium- to long-term thinking. Avalanche builds blockchains for real-world use Avalanche’s core technology enables developers to launch sovereign Layer‑1 blockchains — sometimes referred to as subnets — that operate independently with unique governance, performance parameters, and economic models . According to Nahas, this architecture positions Avalanche to cater to a broad spectrum of use cases that existing monolithic networks cannot serve effectively. For a long time, Nahas has said that the industry nonetheless follows an outdated model predicated on the idea that all applications eventually run on a single, dominant blockchain. He dismissed the notion, adding that the world doesn’t require endless generic block space. Instead, blockchains must be carefully tailored to the specific needs of their users. Sectors such as finance, supply chains, digital identity, and enterprise operations all have unique requirements, and Avalanche’s architecture is designed to meet them. Companies can establish their own separate networks, with their own rules and governance, within the network. These chains can be private, public, or hybrid and remain interoperable, but with separate sets of rules and governance. Nahas pointed out that this method emulates the operation of real-world systems, where independent but interrelated infrastructures connect. Enterprise adoption accelerates worldwide Avalanche’s model is already attracting major institutions. Nahas explained banks want regulated and compliant environments, asset managers want custom-made infrastructure, and the enterprise also needs systems that fit its internal operations, he said. Avalanche, he added, offers solutions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Toyota, for instance, is constructing four different Avalanche chains designed to work in tandem with varying business processes. Additionally, FIFA and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Japan are building independent environments on the network. These projects demonstrate how Avalanche is extending into new frontiers of crypto-native use cases. Nahas emphasized these enterprise chains as not separate silos. Avalanche promotes interoperability (utilizing both private and public networks) and thus maintains control over the same infrastructure while simultaneously retaining the benefits of shared infrastructure. He said this balance will be a key to long-term adoption. There is expanding growth on the network. Nahas stated that nearly 80 Avalanche layer-one chains are already live, with more than 100 others in test networks. By next year, he anticipates that roughly 200 institutional and enterprise chains will be operating in finance, digital identity, artificial intelligence, and government services. As crypto enters its next phase, Avalanche’s leadership thinks these are the clearer prospects for the industry. The future will be developed on purpose-built blockchains rather than hype, Nahas said. Get seen where it counts.

This wave of forced selling, primarily in perpetual futures contracts, highlights the extreme volatility and risks inherent in leveraged trading. For traders and investors, understanding what triggered this event is crucial for navigating future market turbulence. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto futures liquidations mean. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because they no longer have enough funds to keep it open. This happens when the market moves against their bet. A cascade of these events can amplify price swings, creating a feedback loop of selling pressure. Therefore, monitoring crypto futures liquidations is a key gauge of market stress and trader sentiment. Breaking Down the $370M Liquidation Carnage The past 24 hours saw forced closures across major cryptocurrencies. Here is a breakdown of the top assets affected: Ethereum (ETH): Led the pack with $167 million in liquidations. A crushing 80.25% of these were long positions, meaning most traders betting on a price increase were wiped out. Bitcoin (BTC): Followed closely with $160 million. Interestingly, over half (53.58%) were short positions, indicating many who bet on a price drop also got caught in the volatility. Other Assets (like HYPE): Showed even more extreme skews, with one asset seeing over 99% of its $42.37 million in liquidations come from long positions. This data paints a picture of a market where aggressive leverage met sudden, opposing price action, resulting in a broad cleanup of positions. What Triggered This Wave of Crypto Futures Liquidations? While the specific catalyst can vary, large-scale crypto futures liquidations are often triggered by a sharp, unexpected price movement. This could be due to a major news event, a large whale selling, or simply the unwinding of over-leveraged positions in a thin market. The key takeaway is that high leverage multiplies both gains and losses. When the market turns, it turns quickly, and those using excessive leverage are the first to be liquidated. How Can Traders Navigate and Survive Liquidation Events? Surviving these market storms requires discipline and risk management. Here are actionable insights: Use Lower Leverage: High leverage is the fastest path to a liquidation. Using 2x or 5x instead of 10x or 25x dramatically increases your survival odds. Set Stop-Losses: A stop-loss order automatically exits your position at a predetermined price, helping you control losses before a forced liquidation. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive or negative funding rates in perpetual futures can signal overcrowded trades, which are prone to sudden reversals. Keep Adequate Margin: Always maintain a healthy cushion of collateral (margin) in your account to withstand normal price fluctuations. The Bottom Line on Market Volatility The $370 million in crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder: the crypto market is inherently volatile. While futures trading offers significant profit potential, it comes with equally significant risk. Events like this periodically reset over-leveraged markets and can create new opportunities for disciplined investors. The goal is not to avoid volatility but to manage your exposure to it wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a ‘liquidation’ in crypto futures? A: It’s when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their losses have nearly or completely depleted their initial collateral, ensuring the exchange doesn’t lose money. Q: Why did Ethereum have more long liquidations than Bitcoin? A: It suggests that leading up to the price drop, more traders were using leverage to bet on ETH rising compared to BTC, making those positions more vulnerable when the market fell. Q: Are liquidations always bad for the market? A: Not necessarily. While painful for those liquidated, they can remove excessive leverage and overconfidence, potentially leading to a healthier market foundation afterward. Q: Can I avoid getting liquidated? A> Absolutely. By using sensible leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and constantly monitoring your margin ratio, you can greatly reduce the risk of a forced liquidation. Q: Where can I track crypto futures liquidations in real-time? A> Several data websites like Coinglass provide real-time liquidation dashboards across all major exchanges. Q: Do large liquidations signal a market bottom or top? A> They can sometimes signal a local extreme. A massive long liquidation event might indicate capitulation and a potential short-term bottom, but it’s not a guaranteed indicator.

A tiny float and nonstop social hype kept RRP’s stock locked at its daily limit-up for 149 sessions, and both its exchange and the company warned buyers while the rally kept going. The story flipped when regulators stepped in. The Securities and Exchange Board of India opened a review into the surge, so the stock now trades only once a week under new exchange rules and has slipped 6% from its Nov. 7 high. Tracking the cracks as regulators act India has few listed chipmakers, and that gap turned RRP into a proxy for traders chasing the AI boom that lifted names like Nvidia. Sonam Srivastava of Wryght Research & Capital Pvt. said “ semiconductors have been really hot,” adding that traders jump at any local name tied to the space. The rush came even as exchanges across Asia pushed alerts. Moore Threads in Shanghai fell 13% on Dec. 12 after flagging risk. SK Hynix dropped after the Korean exchange raised a warning on Dec. 11. BSE, the exchange where RRP trades, said its surveillance steps went out through market circulars. RRP Electronics, owned by RRP Group founder Rajendra Chodankar, declined comment because of a legal appeal. His ties to RRP and a batch of related firms added more heat to the mystery around the stock. RRP’s shift started in early 2024 when Chodankar took control of G D Trading and Agencies by clearing an 80 million-rupee loan owed by its founders. On April 23, the board approved selling him and others shares at 12 rupees each, which was well below market price. The deal gave Chodankar 74.5% ownership and cut the founders to under 2%. The company later changed its name to RRP Semiconductor. Two months before that, Chodankar set up RRP Electronics Pvt. to build a chip assembly and testing plant in Maharashtra, a detail that fed traders’ belief that the listed company was part of the same semiconductor push. At an event in Navi Mumbai in September, he said, “India is going to be a superhuman, it’s established beyond doubt.” Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar were present at the launch, according to RRP’s videos. Showing the links behind the rally Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chip plan, a 760 billion-rupee program, attracted $18 billion from Micron, Tata, Foxconn and HCL Technologies. RRP listed RRP Electronics as a related party since Chodankar owns both, though the listed firm does not have a stake in the private one. About 98% of RRP’s shares sit with Chodankar and a small group tied to several RRP-linked companies, filings show. The exchange withdrew approval for a share sale in April and placed the stock under strict surveillance a year ago. SEBI had already said in 2024 that the firm fell under a group barred from the market after Shree Vindhya Paper Mills was delisted in 2017. A person at BSE said the exchange had an “internal lapse” when reviewing RRP’s offering and may ask SEBI if the lock-in should be extended. BSE said RRP stated in its application that it and its directors were not barred. As the stock exploded from 20 rupees in April 2024, Chodankar left the board. The CFO quit, then returned as company secretary. RRP filed a police report against a social-media influencer for spreading claims about ties to Tendulkar and state land. In a Nov. 3 filing, the firm said it had not started chipmaking work, had not applied for government programs, and denied celebrity links. Financials showed negative revenue of 68.2 million rupees and a net loss of 71.5 million rupees in the September quarter. The negative revenue came after RRP reversed sales from a 4.4-billion-rupee deal with Telecrown Infratech that fell apart over “contractual disagreements.” It also canceled 80 million rupees of revenue earlier in the year.

This peak was fueled by post-election optimism in the crypto market and renewed institutional interest. However, the year saw a sharp correction, with SOL dropping over 55% during Q4 amid broader market pressures, including macroeconomic uncertainties and reduced liquidity. By mid-December 2025, SOL traded around $130–$135, reflecting a bearish short-term sentiment but strong underlying fundamentals.

DeFi activity remained robust, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing $4.5–$13 billion at points, driven by high-throughput applications. Major Events Impacting Price Several pivotal events shaped SOL’s trajectory: January ATH Surge. SOL hit $294 amid crypto-friendly policy expectations following the U.S. election outcomes, boosting overall market sentiment. Network Upgrades. Key advancements included the rollout of Firedancer (a new validator client for improved reliability and performance) and progress on Alpenglow consensus upgrade, reducing finality to ~150ms and enhancing scalability. These mitigated past outage concerns and attracted high-frequency trading firms. Breakpoint 2025 Conference. Held in Abu Dhabi (or alternative locations per reports), it featured announcements on tokenization, stablecoins (e.g., Circle minting $500M USDC on Solana), and real-world assets (RWAs), reinforcing institutional adoption. Q4 Correction. A 55% drawdown from the ATH was influenced by global risk-off sentiment, though fundamentals like revenue and activity diverged positively from price action. Meme coin frenzy and DeFi volumes also played roles, with spikes in activity from tokens like BONK and new launches driving temporary pumps followed by corrections. Trends and Developments Solana solidified its position as a high-performance Layer-1 in 2025: DeFi and Meme Coin Dominance. Solana led in DEX volumes and meme coin launches, with vibrant ecosystems in NFTs, gaming, and RWAs. TVL growth and developer activity outpaced competitors. Institutional Momentum. Partnerships, stablecoin integrations, and potential ETF speculation increased inflows, positioning Solana for tokenized securities and payments. Technical Resilience. Upgrades like Firedancer and Alpenglow addressed scalability and reliability, enabling 65,000+ TPS and sub-150ms latency. Despite challenges like regulatory uncertainty, Solana’s low fees and speed continued attracting builders, with events like Accelerate and community conferences fostering growth. Forecast for 2026 Looking to 2026, experts are predominantly bullish on SOL, citing continued upgrades, ecosystem expansion, and potential bull market recovery. Predictions vary: CoinCodex and similar platforms forecast $140–$150 early in 2026, with upside to $200+ if adoption accelerates. More optimistic views (e.g., InvestingHaven, CryptoNews) see averages around $300–$400, with highs up to $644 in bullish scenarios. Analysts like Miles Deutscher and panels from Changelly emphasize $300–$500 potential, driven by DeFi dominance and institutional capital. Risks include macro downturns or delays in upgrades, but Solana’s flywheel of activity and innovation positions it for strong recovery and growth in 2026.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BONK|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 03:37:27

This launch marks a pivotal moment for the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization space, directly tackling one of its biggest hurdles—fragmented liquidity. Built in collaboration with interoperability protocol LayerZero, the bridge empowers users to move over 100 different RWA tokens seamlessly between the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks. Let’s explore what this means for the future of finance. What Exactly is the Ondo Bridge and Why Does It Matter? The Ondo Bridge is a specialized cross-chain communication protocol. Think of it as a secure highway built specifically for tokenized real-world assets. Before its launch, an RWA token issued on Ethereum was largely confined to that ecosystem. This created silos, limiting user access and fragmenting market liquidity. The new Ondo Bridge smashes these barriers, enabling trustless transfers of assets like tokenized treasury bills, bonds, and commodities between two of the largest blockchains. This development is crucial because it enhances capital efficiency and broadens investor choice. A user on BNB Chain can now easily access yield-bearing RWA opportunities originally launched on Ethereum, and vice-versa. Therefore, the bridge doesn’t just move tokens; it connects economies and unlocks unprecedented flexibility for decentralized finance (DeFi). How Does the Ondo Bridge Work with LayerZero? The technical backbone of this operation is LayerZero, a leading omnichain interoperability protocol. Ondo Finance didn’t build the communication layer from scratch; instead, it leveraged LayerZero’s proven, secure messaging system. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process: Initiation: A user locks their RWA tokens in a smart contract on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum). Message Relaying: LayerZero’s ultra-light nodes (Oracles and Relayers) securely transmit proof of this lock to the destination chain (e.g., BNB Chain). Minting: Upon verification, an equivalent amount of the same RWA token is minted on the destination chain for the user. Security First: This design ensures assets are never custodied by a central party; the system uses cryptographic proofs for security. This collaboration means the Ondo Bridge inherits the security and reliability of the robust LayerZero network, which is already trusted by hundreds of applications. What Are the Immediate Benefits of Using the Ondo Bridge? The launch delivers tangible advantages for various market participants right now. For investors and DeFi users, it’s a game-changer. Expanded Access: Instantly tap into a wider array of RWA yields and products without being chain-restricted. Improved Liquidity: By pooling liquidity from two major chains, trading depth improves, potentially leading to better prices and lower slippage. Enhanced Composability: RWA tokens can now be more easily integrated into multi-chain DeFi strategies, lending protocols, and yield aggregators. Reduced Friction: Eliminates the need for complex, multi-step processes involving centralized exchanges to move between chains. Moreover, for the broader RWA ecosystem, this is a significant step towards maturity. It signals that infrastructure is evolving to support the scalable, cross-chain future that institutional adoption requires. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Cross-Chain RWA Transfers? While the Ondo Bridge is a powerful solution, it operates within a landscape of inherent challenges. Security remains the paramount concern for any cross-chain activity; users must trust the underlying smart contracts and the LayerZero protocol’s security assumptions. Additionally, bridging activities introduce new variables like gas fees on two networks and potential latency during the message-passing process. Another consideration is regulatory clarity. As real-world assets are by nature tied to traditional finance, their cross-chain movement may attract scrutiny from regulators watching how compliance (like KYC/AML) travels across decentralized networks. Ondo Finance and similar projects must navigate this evolving space carefully. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Accessible Real-World Assets The launch of the Ondo Bridge is more than a product update; it’s a strategic infrastructure upgrade for the entire tokenized assets space. By seamlessly connecting Ethereum and BNB Chain, Ondo Finance is removing critical friction points, empowering users, and setting a new standard for RWA accessibility. This move accelerates the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance, making sophisticated investment strategies more democratic. The bridge is now live, inviting users to experience a more connected and efficient future for finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What tokens can I transfer using the Ondo Bridge? A: Initially, the Ondo Bridge supports over 100 real-world asset (RWA) tokens native to the Ondo ecosystem, including their flagship products like OUSG (tokenized U.S. Treasuries), moving between Ethereum and BNB Chain. Q: Is using the Ondo Bridge safe? A: The bridge is built using LayerZero’s audited and widely-used cross-chain messaging protocol. However, as with any DeFi protocol, users should conduct their own research, understand the smart contract risks, and start with small amounts. Q: Are there any fees for bridging? A: Yes, you will need to pay network gas fees on both the source and destination blockchain to execute the transaction. There may also be a small protocol fee. Q: How long does a cross-chain transfer take? A: Transfer times can vary based on network congestion, but using LayerZero’s infrastructure, transactions are typically confirmed within a few minutes. Q: Can I bridge tokens to chains other than Ethereum or BNB Chain? A: The initial launch supports Ethereum and BNB Chain. However, given the collaboration with LayerZero, future expansions to other compatible chains like Arbitrum, Polygon, or Avalanche are a logical possibility. Q: Do I need to complete KYC to use the Ondo Bridge? A: The bridge itself is a permissionless protocol. However, accessing the underlying RWA tokens (like OUSG) on Ondo Finance’s platform may require KYC, depending on the product and your jurisdiction.

In a significant development for institutional adoption, global asset manager Invesco has partnered with Galaxy Asset Management to launch the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETP (QSOL). This new product provides a regulated, exchange-traded pathway for investors to gain exposure to the spot price of Solana, marking a pivotal moment for the blockchain network. But what exactly is a Solana ETP , and why does this launch matter for the broader market? What is the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETP? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a security that tracks the price of an underlying asset and trades on a traditional stock exchange. The newly launched Solana ETP , tickered QSOL, is designed to mirror the performance of Solana’s spot price. This partnership leverages Invesco’s massive scale in traditional finance and Galaxy’s deep expertise in digital assets. Therefore, it creates a bridge for conventional investors who seek crypto exposure without the complexities of direct ownership, like managing private keys or using crypto exchanges. Why is This Solana ETP Launch a Big Deal? This announcement is more than just another financial product. It represents a powerful validation signal from the traditional finance world. Here are the key implications: Institutional Gateway: It provides a familiar, regulated vehicle for pensions, hedge funds, and other large institutions to allocate capital to Solana. Enhanced Legitimacy: Backing from established names like Invesco and Galaxy boosts Solana’s credibility as a core crypto asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Simplified Access: Investors can now buy and sell exposure to Solana through their existing brokerage accounts, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry. Moreover, this move follows the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, suggesting a clear pattern of institutional acceptance for major digital assets. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? Like any financial innovation, the Solana ETP comes with its own set of opportunities and considerations for investors. Key Benefits for Investors Regulatory Clarity: Trading occurs within a well-defined regulatory framework, offering peace of mind. Security and Convenience: Custody is handled by the institutions, removing technical hurdles. Portfolio Integration: Easily fits into a diversified traditional investment portfolio. Important Considerations However, investors should be aware of certain factors. ETPs typically carry management fees, which can slightly erode returns over time. Furthermore, while the ETP tracks the spot price, it does not grant direct ownership of SOL tokens, meaning holders cannot participate in network activities like staking. Finally, the product’s success is tied to Solana’s own network performance and market adoption. The Future of Crypto ETPs and Market Impact The launch of a Solana ETP is a clear indicator of where the market is heading. It signals that asset managers view Solana as a foundational layer-1 blockchain with lasting value. This institutional endorsement could lead to increased liquidity and stability for SOL. Consequently, we may see other major altcoins follow suit, seeking similar structured products to attract institutional capital. Conclusion: A Milestone for Mainstream Crypto Adoption The collaboration between Invesco and Galaxy to launch a Solana ETP is a transformative step. It powerfully bridges the gap between the innovative world of decentralized blockchain and the established realm of global finance. For Solana, it provides a robust channel for sustained capital inflow. For the average investor, it offers a streamlined, secure door into the crypto ecosystem. This move underscores a broader trend: digital assets are becoming an indispensable part of the modern financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ticker symbol for the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETP? The product trades under the ticker symbol QSOL . Where can I buy the Solana ETP? The Solana ETP (QSOL) will be available for trading on traditional stock exchanges in jurisdictions where it is approved, accessible through standard brokerage accounts. Does holding the Solana ETP mean I own SOL tokens? No. When you invest in the ETP, you own shares of the product that tracks Solana’s price. You do not directly own or have control over the underlying SOL tokens held in custody by the product issuer. Can I stake my Solana through this ETP? Typically, no. ETPs of this nature are designed for price exposure and do not pass on staking rewards to shareholders. The custodian may choose to stake the underlying assets, but any rewards are usually reinvested into the fund or used to offset fees. How does this differ from a Bitcoin ETF? The structure is conceptually similar—both are exchange-traded products providing exposure to a cryptocurrency. The primary difference is the underlying asset (Solana vs. Bitcoin). Regulatory approval processes and specific structures (ETP vs. ETF) can also vary by region. Is this product available to U.S. investors? Initial reports suggest the product is launching in Europe. Availability for U.S. investors depends on future regulatory approvals from bodies like the SEC. Found this insight into the new Solana ETP valuable?

That’s exactly what’s happening with USDT payments . Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has processed a staggering $156 billion in small-value transactions under $1,000 so far this year. This isn’t just a big number—it’s a revolution in how people move money globally. Why Are Small USDT Payments Exploding in Popularity? According to data from Chainalysis and Artemis, the average daily volume for these small USDT payments now exceeds $500 million. This massive flow of capital highlights a fundamental shift. People aren’t just holding USDT as a digital asset; they’re actively using it to pay for goods and services. The market clearly views Tether’s stablecoin as a reliable global payment rail for U.S. dollar transactions. This trend is most powerful in regions with limited access to traditional banking. For millions, opening a dollar-denominated bank account is impossible. However, with a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can access USDT payments . This bridges a critical gap in the global financial system. How USDT is Becoming the World’s Digital Dollar Highway Think of USDT as a new financial infrastructure. Traditional cross-border payments are often slow, expensive, and opaque. In contrast, USDT payments on blockchains like Tron and Ethereum are near-instant and have transparent fees. This efficiency is driving adoption for everyday use cases. Remittances: Migrant workers can send money home faster and cheaper than through services like Western Union. Freelance Payments: International freelancers receive payments in a stable currency without worrying about bank delays. Commerce: Small businesses can accept dollar payments from anywhere in the world, bypassing complex merchant accounts. This utility transforms USDT from a trading tool into an essential financial service. The $156 billion volume proves that demand for efficient, borderless dollars is not just theoretical—it’s here and growing exponentially. What Challenges Does This Growth Present? However, this rapid adoption doesn’t come without hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny remains intense. Authorities worldwide are concerned about the potential for USDT payments to be used for illicit activities due to their pseudonymous nature. Tether must continue to work with regulators and enhance its compliance measures. Furthermore, the user experience still needs refinement. While sending USDT is technically simple, the process of onboarding fiat currency (real-world money) onto a crypto platform can be confusing for newcomers. Simplifying this journey is crucial for mainstream adoption. Despite these challenges, the trajectory is clear. The sheer volume of transactions indicates that the benefits—speed, low cost, and accessibility—far outweigh the current friction points for a vast global user base. The Future of Global Finance Runs on Stablecoins The data tells a compelling story: USDT is no longer just a crypto trading pair. It has matured into a foundational layer for a new, more inclusive global economy. The $156 billion in small-value USDT payments is a powerful signal that people are voting with their wallets for a better financial system. This growth will likely push further innovation in wallets, point-of-sale systems, and regulatory frameworks designed specifically for stablecoin payments. As these tools improve, we can expect the daily volume of USDT payments to climb even higher, solidifying its role as the digital dollar for the internet age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are “small-value” USDT payments? The report defines them as individual transactions worth less than $1,000. This typically includes everyday payments like remittances, online purchases, and peer-to-peer transfers, rather than large institutional trades. Why is USDT preferred over other stablecoins for payments? USDT has the largest market capitalization and the deepest liquidity across the most blockchain networks (like Tron and Ethereum). This makes it the most widely accepted and easiest stablecoin to send and receive globally. Is it safe to use USDT for everyday payments? The technology (blockchain) is secure, but users must practice good security. This includes using reputable wallets, safeguarding private keys, and double-checking recipient addresses, as transactions are irreversible. How does this impact traditional banks? It presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Banks face competition for cross-border payment services. However, many are now exploring how to integrate stablecoins like USDT into their own offerings to modernize their services. What does this mean for the future of cash? In regions with high inflation or poor banking, digital dollars like USDT could become a more common store of value and medium of exchange than physical cash, driving financial inclusion. Are there fees for sending USDT? Yes, but they are typically much lower than traditional wire transfers or remittance services. The fee is a small network transaction fee paid in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain (e.g., TRX for the Tron network) used to process the USDT payment .

Halving Narrative Is Evolving Beyond Fixed Timelines,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-era-loading/,"The idea that Bitcoin’s halving operates on a fixed four-year timetable has become one of the most oversimplified narratives in the crypto markets. While the halving still reduces new supply, its influence is no longer confined to predictable timelines or uniform outcomes. As BTC matures into a globally traded asset, the forces shaping its market behavior have expanded beyond the event. How The Cycle Narrative Became Oversimplified In an X post, an analyst known as Deg_ape revealed that the Bitcoin halving cycle was never a rigid four-year clock. BTC’s cycle has always been about phase transitions, shifting liquidity conditions, and market behavior, but never about buying every four years and selling four years later. This cycle actually maps macro bear phases that expand, contract, overlap, and stretch based on macro flows and positioning. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details The four-year cycle still exists, but it is not a linear process. Deg_ape explains that BTC halvings act as a structural anchor, not a price guarantee. This is why market tops usually arrive later than most expect and why bear markets last longer than people can tolerate. Trying to time the BTC market cycle without understanding that these phase dynamics can lead to expensive mistakes. Kyle Chassé has pointed out that Bitcoin dipped, and traders stopped watching the printer, which is a big mistake. This is the most dangerous divergence in the market as price is down, but liquidity is vertical. While traders were panicking and selling their slips, the US Treasury and the Fed quietly injected around $130 billion of fresh liquidity into the system. This shows that liquidity would lead the price, but it won’t do it instantly. There’s a big lag as liquidity will flood the market first, then the assets will reprice. However, a red candle on a green liquidity chart isn’t a crash, but a mispricing. While the printer is screaming up, the price chart is whispering down. Why Retail Holders Are Capitulating At A Historic Rate A crypto analyst known as OnChainCollege outlined that retail holders are under pressure. On-chain data shows the deepest 30-day balance decline among retail wallets since 2018, a level typically associated with periods of extreme fear and capitulation. While retail balances are falling sharply, larger holder cohorts are quietly absorbing the difference. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Exhaustion? BTC Whales Close Long Positions After Extreme Upside Bets The market sentiment has split into two groups with polar-opposite perspectives from retail that are reacting to price action against larger holders that are responding to structure, liquidity, and long-term positioning.

55961496,646198,1766030445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55961496.jpeg,A Structural Shift in Bitcoin: BTC’s Network Activity Tells a New Story,https://bitcoinist.com/a-structural-shift-in-bitcoin-btcs-network-activity/,"Bitcoin is struggling to break away from the bearish market structure that has been in place since late October. Despite several short-lived relief rallies, price action continues to reflect weakness, with bulls failing to reclaim key resistance levels or generate sustained momentum. As uncertainty and fatigue spread across the market, many participants are questioning whether Bitcoin’s current behavior fits the traditional cycle framework that has defined previous bull and bear phases. A recent analysis by Darkfost highlights a structural shift that adds important context to this debate. According to the data , the number of active Bitcoin addresses has been in a persistent decline since April 2021. Historically, bullish phases were characterized by a clear expansion in active addresses, as new investors entered the market and on-chain activity surged. This growth typically peaked near cycle tops, followed by a contraction during bear markets as participation dried up. This cycle, however, looks markedly different. Even during periods of strong price performance since 2022, active addresses have failed to recover meaningfully and continue trending lower. This divergence suggests that Bitcoin’s market structure may be evolving away from a retail-driven, on-chain participation model toward something more concentrated and institutionally influenced. As Bitcoin attempts to stabilize after weeks of downside pressure, understanding these structural changes is becoming critical. The decline in active addresses may not simply signal weakness, but rather a transformation in how Bitcoin is held, traded, and valued in this cycle. Active Addresses Signal A Structural Shift In The Market The analysis suggests that despite Bitcoin’s strong price performance since 2022, on-chain participation continues to deteriorate. Active addresses are once again approaching the lowest levels observed during this cycle, highlighting a growing disconnect between price action and network activity. At the peak in April 2021, Bitcoin recorded roughly 1.15 million active addresses. Today, that figure has nearly halved, sitting near 680,000, a contraction that cannot be ignored. This decline is difficult to attribute to a single cause. Instead, it likely reflects a combination of structural changes in how Bitcoin is held and accessed. One contributing factor appears to be the rise in inactive addresses. While precise classification criteria vary, the broader trend points toward a stronger long-term holding mentality, where coins remain dormant rather than actively transacted on-chain. This behavior reduces visible network activity without necessarily implying bearish conviction. At the same time, a portion of market participants may have shifted away from direct on-chain usage altogether. Centralized exchanges, custodial platforms, and financial products such as ETFs offer exposure to Bitcoin without requiring on-chain interaction. As a result, demand for block space declines even as capital allocation to Bitcoin remains significant. Taken together, the sustained drop in active addresses suggests Bitcoin’s market structure is evolving. The network is becoming less retail-driven and more concentrated, reinforcing the idea that traditional cycle metrics may be losing some of their explanatory power in this environment. Bitcoin Price Tests Long-Term Support as Structure Weakens Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with the chart highlighting a clear deterioration in market structure. After failing to sustain prices above the $100K–$110K zone earlier in the year, BTC has entered a corrective phase marked by lower highs and heavy selling momentum. The recent move toward the $87K area places price directly on a critical demand zone, closely aligned with the rising long-term moving averages. From a trend perspective, the loss of the short- and medium-term moving averages is significant. The blue and green averages have rolled over, acting as dynamic resistance rather than support, reinforcing the bearish bias. Price is now hovering just above the red long-term moving average, a level that has historically defined the boundary between bull market corrections and deeper bearish transitions. A clean breakdown below this zone would materially increase downside risk toward the low-$80K region. Volume behavior adds further context. Selling pressure expanded notably during the sharp drawdown from the highs, while recent bounce attempts have occurred on comparatively weaker volume. This suggests that dip-buying interest remains cautious rather than aggressive. Structurally, the market appears to be consolidating after distribution, not building a strong base yet. In the near term, holding the $85K–$88K range is crucial. A failure to defend this area would confirm a broader trend shift, while reclaiming the $95K–$100K region is required to neutralize the current bearish structure.

Their buying spree occurred between November 2022 and March 2023, with an average cost of just $1,500 per token. This Ethereum whale then demonstrated incredible discipline, entering a period of dormancy for 1,127 days while the market evolved. Their strategy highlights several key principles of successful crypto investing: Accumulation in Fear: They bought aggressively when market sentiment was low. Patience as a Virtue: They held through multiple market cycles without panic selling. Staged Exit: They sold their assets in phases over two weeks, avoiding market impact. What Does This Major Ethereum Transaction Signal for the Market? The whale completed their exit by selling the final 2,040 ETH approximately 10 hours before this analysis. A profit of 6.2 billion won (approximately $4.5 million) represents a significant return on a three-year investment. However, does this signal a lack of confidence in Ethereum’s future, or simply a savvy investor taking well-earned profits? Large transactions from a Ethereum whale always attract scrutiny. This particular move is noteworthy for its timing and execution. The investor avoided dumping all tokens at once, which could have caused unnecessary price volatility. Instead, they employed a measured approach that suggests sophisticated market understanding. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors from This Whale’s Move Every major move by a Ethereum whale offers lessons for retail investors. This transaction particularly emphasizes the power of conviction and timing. The investor identified an accumulation zone during bear market conditions and maintained their position through subsequent rallies and corrections. Consider these actionable insights from this whale’s strategy: Dollar-Cost Averaging Works: Their purchases occurred over four months, averaging their entry price. Hodling Has Its Rewards: 1,127 days of patience yielded multimillion-dollar returns. Exit Strategies Matter: Their phased selling protected their profit margins. How Does Whale Activity Impact the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? When a Ethereum whale makes a move of this magnitude, it creates ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Other large holders monitor these transactions closely, and retail investors often look to whale activity for market signals. However, it’s crucial to remember that every investor has unique circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. This particular whale’s success story demonstrates that strategic accumulation during market downturns, combined with extraordinary patience, can create life-changing returns in the cryptocurrency space. Their story serves as both inspiration and a case study in disciplined crypto investment. Conclusion: The Wisdom of the Ethereum Whale The journey of this Ethereum whale from accumulation to profitable exit provides a masterclass in cryptocurrency investment psychology. Their $4.5 million profit wasn’t the result of luck or timing the market perfectly, but rather consistent strategy and emotional discipline. While not every investor can replicate these results, everyone can learn from the principles demonstrated: buy when others are fearful, hold with conviction, and exit with strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a significantly large amount of ETH, giving them potential influence over market prices through their trading activities. How much ETH makes someone a whale? While there’s no official threshold, addresses holding tens of thousands of ETH are generally considered whales, as their transactions can noticeably impact market liquidity and price. Should I follow whale trading activity? Whale activity provides valuable market data points, but it shouldn’t be your sole investment strategy. Whales have different financial goals, risk profiles, and information access than most retail investors. What does this whale’s sale mean for ETH price? A single whale exiting a position doesn’t necessarily predict price direction. The market absorbed this staged selling without major disruption, suggesting healthy underlying demand. How can I track whale activity myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or specialized analytics platforms that monitor large transactions and wallet movements across the Ethereum network. Is holding for 1,127 days a common strategy? Such extended holding periods are less common but often characterize successful long-term investors who believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition beyond short-term price fluctuations.

This strategic decision represents a significant milestone in corporate cryptocurrency adoption, demonstrating how traditional companies are embracing blockchain technology as part of their long-term investment strategy. Why Is TORICO’s Decision to Purchase ETH So Significant? TORICO’s announcement to purchase ETH marks one of the most substantial corporate cryptocurrency commitments from a Japanese listed company. The company raised 470 million yen specifically for this purpose, showing deliberate planning rather than casual experimentation. This move follows a global trend of institutions recognizing Ethereum’s potential beyond mere speculation. What makes this particularly noteworthy is TORICO’s established position on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Their decision carries weight in traditional financial circles, potentially influencing other listed companies to consider similar moves. The phased approach to purchase ETH starting in January 2026 indicates careful strategic planning rather than impulsive market timing. The Strategic Framework Behind TORICO’s ETH Acquisition TORICO isn’t simply buying cryptocurrency—they’re building infrastructure. The company plans to establish a comprehensive digital asset management and operational framework before they begin to purchase ETH. This systematic approach includes: Phased acquisition strategy beginning January 2026 Professional custody solutions for secure storage Compliance frameworks meeting Japanese regulatory standards Long-term holding strategy rather than short-term trading This structured methodology demonstrates how serious institutions approach cryptocurrency investments differently from retail investors. TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH represents calculated corporate strategy, not speculative gambling. What This Means for Institutional Cryptocurrency Adoption TORICO’s move to purchase ETH signals a maturing market where established companies feel confident allocating significant capital to digital assets. Several factors make this development particularly important: First, it validates Ethereum’s position as an institutional-grade asset. Second, it demonstrates that listed companies can transparently incorporate cryptocurrency into their balance sheets. Third, it may encourage regulatory clarity as more traditional entities enter the space. The timing is also significant. By planning to purchase ETH starting in 2026, TORICO shows confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects beyond current market cycles. This forward-looking approach suggests they view ETH as a strategic asset rather than a tactical trade. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate ETH Investments While TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH represents progress, corporate cryptocurrency adoption still faces hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern, especially for publicly listed companies requiring transparency. Market volatility also presents accounting challenges, though TORICO’s phased approach may mitigate timing risks. Security represents another critical consideration. The company’s commitment to establishing a digital asset management framework suggests they recognize these challenges and are addressing them proactively. Their systematic plan to purchase ETH demonstrates how institutions can navigate cryptocurrency investments responsibly. The Future Impact of TORICO’s ETH Purchase Strategy TORICO’s announcement could trigger a domino effect among other Japanese and global companies. As more institutions witness successful corporate cryptocurrency adoption, barriers to entry may lower. The company’s transparent approach provides a potential blueprint for others considering similar moves. Furthermore, TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH specifically, rather than other cryptocurrencies, reinforces Ethereum’s unique position in the institutional landscape. The network’s established ecosystem, developer community, and transition to proof-of-stake make it particularly attractive for corporate adoption. This strategic move represents more than just a corporate investment—it’s a signal that cryptocurrency is transitioning from alternative asset to mainstream portfolio component. TORICO’s careful planning to purchase ETH demonstrates how traditional finance and blockchain technology can converge productively. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Corporate Crypto Adoption TORICO’s $3 million commitment to purchase ETH marks a pivotal development in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The company’s methodical approach—establishing frameworks before acquisition, implementing phased buying starting in 2026, and transparent communication—sets a new standard for corporate digital asset strategy. This move validates Ethereum’s institutional appeal while demonstrating that listed companies can responsibly incorporate cryptocurrency into their operations. As more traditional entities follow TORICO’s lead, we may witness accelerated convergence between conventional finance and blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions When will TORICO begin to purchase ETH? TOSHIBA plans to begin its phased acquisition of ETH in January 2026, following the establishment of their digital asset management framework. Why did TORICO choose to purchase ETH specifically? While the company hasn’t disclosed all criteria, Ethereum’s established ecosystem, institutional recognition, and transition to proof-of-stake likely contributed to their decision to purchase ETH over other cryptocurrencies. How much ETH will TORICO purchase with $3 million? The exact amount will depend on Ethereum’s price when they execute their purchases starting in 2026. At current prices, $3 million would represent approximately [current ETH amount] tokens. Is TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH risky for a listed company? All investments carry risk, but TORICO’s phased approach and framework development suggest they’re mitigating volatility risks through careful planning rather than making a single large purchase. Could other Japanese companies follow TORICO’s lead? Yes, TORICO’s transparent approach provides a potential model for other listed companies considering cryptocurrency investments, possibly accelerating institutional adoption in Japan and globally. Will TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH affect Ethereum’s price? While $3 million represents a modest portion of Ethereum’s market capitalization, the symbolic importance of institutional adoption may influence market sentiment positively over the long term.

According to a groundbreaking forecast from asset manager Bitwise, this could be our reality next year. The firm predicts Bitcoin volatility will actually fall below that of semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia. This signals a potential seismic shift in how we perceive crypto markets. Why Is Bitcoin Volatility Expected to Drop? Bitwise’s report, cited by Cointelegraph, points to one primary catalyst: institutional maturity. For years, Bitcoin volatility was driven by retail sentiment and speculative trading. However, the landscape is transforming. The firm anticipates lower volatility as heavyweight institutional investors steadily enter the arena and the asset itself matures. A key factor in this shift is the ecosystem around spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These regulated products provide a familiar and secure gateway for traditional finance. Consequently, they are attracting a new class of long-term, stability-focused capital. How Are Big Institutions Changing the Game? The entry of titans like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo is not just about new money. It’s about a fundamental diversification of Bitcoin’s investment structure. Think of it this way: Reduced Risk: Institutional portfolios are typically managed with strict risk parameters, promoting steadier holding patterns. Market Depth: Their large-scale participation adds immense liquidity, making the market harder to move with single trades. Professional Oversight: These firms conduct deep due diligence, fostering a more rational, data-driven market environment. This institutional wave is actively diluting the influence of short-term speculators, which is a direct path to reducing overall Bitcoin volatility . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price and Related Stocks? Interestingly, lower volatility does not mean lower ambition for Bitwise. The firm boldly projects that BTC will reach a new all-time high next year. This combines the promise of price growth with the appeal of a smoother ride—a combination that has historically attracted more conservative capital. Moreover, Bitwise extends its optimism beyond the core asset. The report suggests that crypto-themed stocks are poised to outperform general tech stocks. This indicates a broadening of the bullish thesis across the entire digital asset ecosystem, from the currency to the companies building around it. Is This the Final Step to Mainstream Acceptance? For skeptics who have long pointed to wild price swings as a barrier to adoption, this forecast is a powerful counter-argument. If Bitcoin volatility consistently trends downward and even undercuts major tech stocks, it fundamentally reshapes the asset’s risk profile. This maturation could unlock further adoption from pension funds, insurance companies, and other entities with low tolerance for turbulence. Therefore, the prediction is about more than just price action; it’s about Bitcoin cementing its role as a legitimate, mature component of the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era of Stability Bitwise’s analysis paints a compelling picture of Bitcoin’s future: one defined less by heart-stopping dips and spikes and more by steady, institutional-driven growth. The prediction that Bitcoin volatility will dip below Nvidia’s is a symbolic milestone, representing the asset’s journey from niche digital gold to a mature financial instrument. For investors, this potential stability, coupled with continued price appreciation, creates an unprecedented and attractive opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘volatility’ mean in this context? A1: Volatility refers to the degree of variation in an asset’s trading price over time. High volatility means large, rapid price swings, while low volatility indicates more stable, predictable price movement. Q2: Why is Nvidia used as a comparison point? A2: Nvidia is a bellwether technology stock known for significant growth but also notable price fluctuations. Comparing Bitcoin to a major tech stock helps contextualize its risk profile for traditional investors. Q3: How do Bitcoin ETFs reduce volatility? A3: ETFs attract institutional investors who tend to buy and hold assets as long-term investments. This steady, large-scale demand increases market liquidity and reduces the impact of speculative, short-term trading. Q4: Does lower volatility mean lower potential returns? A4: Not necessarily. An asset can still achieve significant price growth (like Bitwise’s all-time high prediction) while experiencing fewer extreme daily swings. Stability can actually enable larger capital inflows, potentially boosting long-term returns. Q5: What are ‘crypto-themed stocks’? A5: These are publicly traded companies whose business is heavily tied to the cryptocurrency industry, such as crypto mining companies, exchange platforms, or blockchain technology firms.

According to the statement, five specific circumstances have been outlined under which the U.S. SEC would not object to deeming physical possession as a valid means of identification. The statement aims to provide detailed guidance on how broker-dealers can comply with custody obligations for crypto asset securities under existing federal rules. The U.S. SEC stated that the guidance is part of an effort to provide clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto asset securities. Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner, praised the statement’s clarity and called for prompt recommendations on potential amendments to the Rule 15c3-3. U.S. SEC’s new guidance targets paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c3-3 Crypto asset securities have been defined as tokenized representations of equity or debt securities recorded on distributed ledger technology, according to the statement . The new guidance is part of paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows and regulates broker-dealers to promptly obtain and maintain physical possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities carried for customer accounts. The U.S. SEC Division of Trading and Markets outlined that the new guidance applies to any broker-dealer handling crypto assets for customers, including firms engaged in both traditional securities operations and digital asset activities. The release follows inquiries from the market participants seeking a clearer rule applying to blockchain-based assets. According to the U.S. SEC Division for Trading and Markets, its views are confined to physical possession and do not extend to the control aspect, except for broker-dealer financial responsibility rules and additional federal securities law requirements. The staff noted that the statement carries no legal enforcement, does not modify applicable laws, and imposes no new or further obligations. Hester M. Peirce, U.S. SEC Commissioner, released a separate statement praising the clarity. She said the guidance now offers valuable clarity for broker-dealers that aim to provide custody services, especially through requirements for private key protection that align with industry best practices. Peirce thanked Jamie Selway, Director of the Trading and Markets division, and the staff for their efforts and urged the Division to prepare recommendations for the full Commission on amending Rule 15c3-3 to fully accommodate crypto asset custody. U.S. SEC issues five conditions for crypto possession compliance The SEC crypto task force staff issued five circumstances in which they would not recommend enforcement action against a broker-dealer for taking physical possession of customer crypto asset securities. The first circumstance requires the broker-dealer that maintains direct custody to have immediate access to the asset and the technical ability to transfer it across the blockchain. Secondly, the broker-dealer must establish, maintain, and enforce reasonable, written policies and procedures for thorough assessments of the blockchain and its associated networks. The U.S. SEC further noted that the evaluations must be conducted before initiating custody and at reasonable subsequent intervals. According to the U.S. SEC Division for Trading and Markets, key evaluation factors to be considered during assessments of the blockchain include performance reliability, transaction speed and throughput, scalability for increased activity, resilience in times of failure, and security features. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC stated that consensus mechanisms, complexity for maintenance, extensibility for new features, visibility through public code, and documentation are essential factors to consider during assessments. Governance processes such as protocol upgrades, changes, airdrops, and token exchanges are also expected to be reviewed under the new guidance to detect weaknesses that may impair possession. The division’s third circumstance prevents claiming possession if the broker-dealer is aware of material security vulnerabilities, operational deficiencies, and other potential risks directly tied to custody of assets on the specific blockchain, independent of market or reputational concerns. The fourth circumstance requires the broker-dealer to have robust policies, procedures, and controls that are consistent with the industry best practices in safeguarding private keys against theft. Lastly, the fifth circumstance requires a pre-planned policy and procedures that address potential disruptions. These procedures are in response to events such as blockchain malfunctions or failures. Additionally, the pre-planned arrangements should include mechanisms to comply with court orders to seize, freeze, burn tokens, or blockchain transfers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

After two consecutive days of net outflows, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a stunning $459.24 million net inflow on December 17th. This dramatic reversal signals renewed institutional confidence and could mark a turning point for Bitcoin ETF adoption among traditional investors. What Drove the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Surge? According to data from TraderT, the positive momentum came primarily from two institutional giants. Fidelity’s FBTC attracted approximately $390 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT pulled in around $110 million. These substantial inflows completely overwhelmed the modest outflows from other funds, creating the impressive net positive figure. This development matters because Bitcoin ETFs serve as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. When major financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock see significant inflows, it suggests that professional investors are positioning themselves for potential Bitcoin price appreciation. The timing is particularly noteworthy given recent market volatility. Which Bitcoin ETFs Gained and Which Lost? The December 17th flows revealed a clear divergence among different Bitcoin ETF providers. While Fidelity and BlackRock dominated the positive side, other funds experienced contrasting fortunes: Fidelity FBTC: $390 million inflow BlackRock IBIT: $110 million inflow Ark Invest ARKB: $36.96 million outflow Bitwise BITB: $8.41 million outflow The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market saw no net change in their flows. This pattern indicates that investors are becoming more selective, potentially favoring funds from established financial institutions with longer track records in traditional markets. Why Does This Bitcoin ETF Reversal Matter? This inflow reversal breaks a concerning pattern. Two consecutive days of outflows had raised questions about whether institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs was waning. However, the December 17th data suggests otherwise. The substantial inflows demonstrate that major investors view current price levels as attractive entry points. Moreover, the concentration of inflows toward Fidelity and BlackRock highlights an important trend. Institutional investors appear to trust established financial brands when accessing cryptocurrency exposure. This preference could shape the competitive landscape for Bitcoin ETFs moving forward, potentially consolidating assets among a few dominant providers. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs typically correlates with positive price momentum for Bitcoin itself. When institutions allocate capital to these funds, the underlying Bitcoin must be purchased, creating buying pressure in the market. This mechanism creates a direct link between Bitcoin ETF flows and Bitcoin’s market price. Looking ahead, several factors could influence whether this inflow trend continues: Bitcoin’s price stability around key support levels Broader macroeconomic conditions and interest rate expectations Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency markets Institutional adoption trends beyond ETF investments The December 17th data provides a crucial data point for analysts tracking institutional cryptocurrency adoption. It suggests that despite short-term volatility, significant capital remains ready to enter the Bitcoin market through regulated ETF products. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Bitcoin ETFs The $459.24 million net inflow represents more than just a single day’s trading activity. It signals that institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains resilient. As traditional financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock continue to attract capital to their Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency market gains legitimacy and stability. For investors, this development underscores the importance of monitoring Bitcoin ETF flows as a sentiment indicator. The reversal from outflows to substantial inflows suggests that professional money managers see value at current levels. While cryptocurrency markets will always experience volatility, the growing institutional participation through Bitcoin ETFs creates a more mature investment landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did Bitcoin ETFs see outflows before this inflow? Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows likely due to profit-taking after price gains or risk reduction during market uncertainty. The reversal to inflows suggests renewed confidence at current price levels. Which Bitcoin ETF performed best on December 17th? Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the largest inflow at approximately $390 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with about $110 million in new investments. Do Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes, when investors buy Bitcoin ETFs, the fund providers must purchase actual Bitcoin to back the shares. This creates buying pressure that can support or increase Bitcoin’s market price. Are Bitcoin ETFs safe investments? Bitcoin ETFs are regulated financial products, but they still carry the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin itself. They are generally considered safer than direct cryptocurrency ownership for institutional investors due to regulatory oversight and custodial arrangements. Can individual investors buy Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, individual investors can purchase Bitcoin ETFs through standard brokerage accounts, just like they would buy shares of any other ETF or stock. Found this analysis of Bitcoin ETF flows helpful?

According to a leading Bloomberg analyst, a significant wave of crypto ETP liquidations could wash over the market by 2026, leaving investors and the industry to pick up the pieces. This forecast raises critical questions about sustainability in the burgeoning world of digital asset funds. What’s Driving the Rush Toward Crypto ETP Liquidations? Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, a flood of new products has entered the regulatory pipeline. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that an astonishing 126 crypto ETP applications are currently awaiting SEC approval. However, this gold rush mentality comes with a stark warning. Analysts suggest issuers are scrambling to launch products without a clear path to gathering sufficient assets, setting the stage for widespread failure. This scenario isn’t hypothetical. We’ve already seen early casualties. Earlier this year, the BTC-ETH Strategy ETF (ARKY, ARKC), a joint venture by Ark Invest and 21Shares, was liquidated. This event serves as a clear precedent and a potential harbinger of what’s to come for dozens of other funds. How Does an ETP Liquidation Actually Work? For investors, understanding the mechanics of a liquidation is crucial. It’s not merely a fund closing its doors. The process begins when a fund’s assets under management (AUM) fall below a sustainable threshold, often due to low investor interest or poor performance. The issuer then decides to liquidate, halting the creation of new shares. All underlying cryptocurrency assets are sold and converted to cash. Finally, the net cash proceeds are distributed to the remaining shareholders, effectively closing the fund. This process ensures investors get their money back, but it also forces them out of their intended market position, potentially at an inopportune time. Why Are So Many Crypto ETPs at Risk of Failure? The core issue is a simple mismatch between supply and demand. While the supply of new crypto ETP products is exploding, investor capital is finite and tends to concentrate in a few market leaders. Seyffart predicts that many of the 100+ products expected to launch will struggle to attract the necessary assets to remain viable. This leads to a survival-of-the-fittest market. Established funds with strong brand recognition and first-mover advantage are likely to soak up most of the investment. Newer, niche, or poorly marketed products could languish with minimal AUM, making them prime candidates for the predicted wave of crypto ETP liquidations by 2026 or 2027. What Should Investors Do to Navigate This Risk? Knowledge is your best defense. Investors considering these products should conduct thorough due diligence beyond just the underlying crypto asset. Scrutinize the AUM: Favor products with substantial and growing assets under management. Evaluate the issuer: Consider the track record and financial stability of the fund sponsor. Understand the fees: High expense ratios can erode returns and make a fund less competitive. Diversify cautiously: Avoid over-concentration in small, niche ETPs that may be more vulnerable to closure. Staying informed about the fund’s health can provide early warning signs before a liquidation announcement. The Bigger Picture: What Do Mass Liquidations Mean for Crypto? A wave of crypto ETP liquidations presents a double-edged sword for the broader digital asset ecosystem. On one hand, it could be seen as a healthy market correction, weeding out weaker products and solidifying the position of legitimate, useful funds. It demonstrates that the market is maturing and applying traditional financial scrutiny. Conversely, it could temporarily shake investor confidence. News of multiple fund closures may be perceived as a failure of the crypto ETP model itself, rather than a natural business consolidation. However, this pruning process is common in traditional finance and often leads to a stronger, more efficient market in the long run. Conclusion: A Necessary Shakeout on the Horizon The prediction of widespread crypto ETP liquidations by 2026 is not a prophecy of doom but a call for realism. The explosive growth in product filings indicates immense interest but also a potential bubble in fund creation. This impending shakeout will likely separate the robust, investor-centric products from the speculative launches. For the savvy investor, this environment demands vigilance, emphasizing the importance of fund fundamentals over mere crypto exposure. The coming years will test the durability of the crypto ETP landscape, ultimately strengthening it for those that survive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main reason analysts predict so many crypto ETP liquidations? A: Analysts predict a wave of liquidations because over 100 new products are rushing to market, but investor capital is limited. Many funds will fail to gather enough assets under management (AUM) to be economically viable, leading them to close. Q: What happens to my money if the crypto ETP I invest in is liquidated? A: If a fund is liquidated, the issuer sells all the underlying cryptocurrency assets, converts them to cash, and distributes the net proceeds to shareholders. You get your money back, but your investment in that specific product is terminated. Q: Has a crypto ETP been liquidated before? A: Yes. A prominent example is the BTC-ETH Strategy ETF (tickers ARKY and ARKC), launched by Ark Invest and 21Shares, which was liquidated earlier this year due to insufficient assets. Q: How can I avoid investing in a crypto ETP that might be liquidated? A: To mitigate risk, research the fund’s assets under management (AUM), choose products from established issuers with strong track records, and be wary of niche funds with very high fees that may struggle to attract investors. Q: Will mass liquidations hurt the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? A: While the liquidation process involves selling underlying assets, the impact on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is likely to be minimal unless the scale is enormous. The larger effect may be on investor sentiment toward the crypto ETP vehicle itself. Q: Are all new crypto ETPs a bad investment? A: Not necessarily. New products can offer valuable exposure. The key is differentiation and sustainable demand. The predicted liquidations highlight the risk of investing in “me-too” funds without a clear competitive advantage or sufficient investor interest.

Earlier, when Fermi first announced that an investment-grade tenant had exited a deal that would have covered $150 million in construction expenses, its shares plunged 46% on December 12. Now, Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer has confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider that Amazon is the tenant that pulled back funding from the project. Fermi’s Neugebauer asserts that talks between Amazon and the firm are still constructive Fermi is hoping to create the world’s largest private grid to power a sprawling data center campus, with a $19 billion valuation as of October. The company first went public in September, raising more than $680 million at $21 a share. However, since the project’s announcement, concerns have arisen that the AI-led power buildout may be running ahead of demand, dragging on AI-linked stocks as questions mount over tenant security and the need for such large-scale facilities. The company’s development, Project Matador, relies on a long-term, 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System, subject to the firm finalizing a letter of intent with a tenant. The company thus called for a tenant to take the first gigawatt of capacity across 12 facilities at its 11-gigawatt campus in the Texas Panhandle. Amazon had been working toward a deal that would have paid Fermi more than $20 billion over the next two decades. However, it withdrew its offer to provide the $150 million upfront payment required to initiate construction. Nonetheless, Neugebauer insists talks remain constructive and that the advance cancellation does not signal a breakdown. He remarked, “It’s just a normal negotiation. Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.” He added, “It’s a big deal. Big deals take longer.” After Fermi first announced that a tenant had withdrawn, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald noted that they learned the anchor tenant had sought last-minute pricing adjustments that Fermi rejected. Aside from Amazon, Palantir , which provides software to law enforcement and government clients, had also been eyeing the site. The software firm is still in talks with Fermi. Amazon is in discussions to secure a $10 billion deal with OpenAI Amazon is still in negotiations with other companies. According to reports, the firm is exploring a $10 billion deal with OpenAI that would utilize its AI chips. The deal would value OpenAI at over $500 billion. The announcement comes shortly after OpenAI converted to a for-profit structure, giving it more leeway to negotiate with investors beyond Microsoft, which already owns 27% of the company. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:cfa47eac-7502-421e-a473-753bf7e44110-28"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-16"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> If the deal goes through, it would mark a milestone for Amazon’s semiconductor division. Nvidia still dominates the market, but developers like Meta are already exploring alternatives from Google and others. Nevertheless, Amazon is looking to expand its AI investments, given it already has an $8 billion stake in Anthropic, an OpenAI rival. Earlier this month, the firm unveiled its Trainium chip that enhances its Amazon Web Services capabilities. According to Bloomberg, the company claims that Trainium offers cheaper and more efficient computing than Nvidia’s GPUs for the heavy math required by large models, and it’s attempting to win over teams that want to reduce their costs. Amazon also released new Nova models, including Nova 2 Pro, that can process text, images, video, and speech to generate text. Moreover, the company plans to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing power across AWS Top Secret, Secret, and GovCloud (US) regions by constructing data centers with advanced compute and networking. At the start of the year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had noted, “I think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy, medium to long-term, that we’re pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI. We also have capex that we’re spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim towards trying to continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|AI|Amazon|Fermi Inc,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 04:45:17

According to analyst Axel Adler Jr., both the Structure Shift composite indicator and the Bull-Bear Index point to growing downward pressure, particularly in the derivatives market. Risk-Off Signals Flash Red The Structure Shift signal, which measures overall market structure on a scale from -1 to +1, has fallen from positive territory to around -0.5. This confirms the dominance of a bearish regime. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price has dropped toward the lower boundary of the 21-day Donchian Channel, currently hovering near the $85,000 support level. This means that the market has not only firmly established itself in a bearish structural zone, but any recovery will require the composite signal to move back above zero while holding channel support. Derivatives are playing a key role in this transition. The Bull-Bear Index, which separates short-term and long-term market pressure, shows the fast bearish component moving into negative territory, while the bullish component has dropped to just 5%. Such a pattern suggests that selling pressure from futures markets is outweighing demand in the spot market, thereby leaving short-term momentum firmly in the bears’ favor. Adler explained that while a negative Structure Shift signal does not predict an immediate price drop, it does show the need for defensive positioning. Whales and Miners Defy Bitcoin Sell-Off CryptoQuant data added further context to the current regime. While US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded combined outflows of roughly $635 million over two days, on-chain indicators point to significant pessimism among short-term participants. The Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped to deeply negative levels, while the Fear and Greed Index shows extreme fear as it sits at 11. Additional stress indicators, including rising supply in loss, and a depressed short-term holder MVRV, indicate many recent buyers are capitulating at a loss. However, a certain cohort of whales and miners continues to act as outliers in this environment. For instance, the Miner Position Index (MPI) at -0.81 indicates miners are sending fewer BTC to exchanges and thus reducing selling pressure. Meanwhile, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated nearly 700,000 BTC over the past two months.

Time is running out to put your unique spin on K-pop and potentially win a major prize. The groundbreaking ARIA Nana remix contest , a pioneering experiment in on-chain music, will officially close for submissions on January 9. This isn’t just another competition; it’s a front-row seat to the future of how music is created, owned, and shared. What is the ARIA Nana Remix Contest All About? Organized by ARIAIP, a platform specializing in story chain-based IP tokenization, this contest is a bold move to merge the global appeal of K-pop with the transparency of blockchain. The core mission? To expand K-pop on-chain by inviting producers worldwide to reinterpret songs from the talented singer Nana. Think of it as a global collaboration where your creativity helps build a new model for the music industry. Participants are tasked with remixing one of Nana’s three new tracks: ‘GOD,’ ‘Daylight,’ or ‘Hurt.’ The stakes are high, with a total prize pool of $15,000 up for grabs. But the rewards go far beyond the cash. Why Should You Enter This Contest? Beyond the impressive prize money, this contest offers benefits rarely seen in traditional music competitions. Here’s what makes the ARIA Nana remix contest a game-changer: Major Exposure: Selected remixes will be officially released by a music label, giving winners legitimate industry placement. Ownership Revolution: The copyrights for the winning tracks will be tokenized on the ARIA Protocol. This means ownership is recorded on the blockchain, creating a clear, unchangeable record. Ongoing Royalties: This is the revolutionary part. Net royalties from the streaming and sales of these official releases will be distributed automatically. The funds are shared between the remixers themselves and the ARIA community, specifically holders of the APL token. Therefore, entering this contest is more than a one-time win; it’s an opportunity to become part of an ongoing, revenue-generating music ecosystem. Prize Breakdown and Key Dates for the ARIA Contest Let’s talk numbers. The $15,000 prize pool is distributed to fuel top talent: First Place: A grand prize of $10,000. Second Place: A reward of $3,000. Third Place: A reward of $2,000. The most critical date is January 9 , when submissions close. If you’re a producer, this is your final call to action. Prepare your best take on Nana’s songs and ensure your entry is submitted before the deadline passes. How Does This Expand K-Pop On-Chain? You might wonder, what does “expanding K-pop on-chain” actually mean? Traditionally, music rights and royalty distributions can be complex and opaque. By using blockchain technology, ARIA aims to create a more transparent and efficient system. Tokenizing the music copyrights turns them into digital assets that can be managed and traded with clarity. The automatic distribution of royalties via smart contracts ensures remixers and supporters (APL token holders) get their fair share directly and promptly. This ARIA Nana remix contest serves as a live experiment to prove this model works, potentially setting a new standard for artist-fan collaboration in the K-pop world and beyond. Final Call: Don’t Miss This Opportunity The January 9 deadline is fast approaching. This contest represents a unique convergence of music, competition, and technological innovation. For producers, it’s a chance to win significant money, gain official label release, and earn future royalties. For the crypto and music communities, it’s a fascinating case study in IP tokenization in action. In summary, the ARIA Nana remix contest is more than a competition; it’s a glimpse into a future where creators have greater ownership and are rewarded fairly within a community-driven ecosystem. Will your remix be the one that helps shape this future? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the deadline for the ARIA Nana remix contest? A: The deadline for all submissions is January 9 . Ensure your track is submitted before this date. Q: Which songs can I remix for the contest? A: You can submit a remix of any of Nana’s three provided songs: ‘GOD,’ ‘Daylight,’ or ‘Hurt.’ Q: What does ‘tokenizing the music copyright’ mean? A: It means the legal rights to the winning remix will be represented as a digital token on the ARIA blockchain. This creates a transparent and secure record of ownership. Q: Who receives the royalties from the released remixes? A: Net royalties are distributed to two groups: the remixers who created the tracks and the ARIA community, specifically holders of the APL token. Q: Do I need to own cryptocurrency or APL tokens to enter? A: No, the contest entry is likely based on your musical submission. However, participating in the broader royalty ecosystem as a supporter would require holding APL tokens. Q: Where can I find more details and submit my remix? A: You should visit the official ARIAIP website or their designated contest portal for full rules, submission guidelines, and updates. Inspired by the fusion of music and blockchain?

He said that where a payment is required, it must be made in Russian rubles. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Ruble Remains Sole Payment Unit Based on reports, that stance matches existing law. A 2020 federal law on digital financial assets defines digital currency as something different from Russia’s monetary unit and bars its use as a means of payment inside the country. The law treats tokens and classic cryptocurrencies as property or investment items rather than legal tender. Russia Central Bank Concerns Over Stability Officials in Moscow have repeatedly echoed the central bank’s worry that allowing crypto for everyday payments could harm monetary control and financial stability. Regulators say the ruble’s role must be protected, and that volatility in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum makes them unsuitable for regular transactions. Limited Windows For Crypto Use Reports have also noted that while crypto cannot be used to buy goods and services domestically, it can still exist in regulated pockets. Lawmakers and regulators are framing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets, not cash. Some narrow exceptions are being discussed for corporate or cross-border operations under strict rules, but those do not change the basic ban on domestic payments. What The Law Means For People And Business Practical effects are clear. Russian residents and businesses cannot accept digital coins in place of rubles for sales or services. At the same time, individuals can hold, trade, or invest in crypto under the framework that separates ownership from payment rights. The law also requires public officials to declare holdings in digital assets, linking transparency rules to the new regime. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record A Narrowing Path Forward Based on reports from several outlets, the political message is firm: payments stay in rubles. Lawmakers are talking about refining rules for trading, custody and reporting, but they are not signalling a shift toward letting cryptocurrencies replace the ruble for daily use. That position keeps Russia on a different track from some countries that permit crypto payments or give coins legal tender status.

According to the sponsors, the Strengthening Agency Frameworks for Enforcement of Cryptocurrency (SAFE Crypto) Act creates a coordinated federal effort to detect, track, and shut down illicit schemes that use crypto rails. Task Force To Target Crypto Scams The bill would set up a task force that pulls together Treasury officials, federal and local law enforcement, regulators, and private-sector experts to share intelligence and act quickly on threats. Reports have disclosed that the legislation is pitched as a way to get real-time visibility on suspicious activity and to give local police better technical help when they investigate. Senators Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) are listed as the bill’s proponents . The measure appears in Congress under a title that would establish a “Task Force for Recognizing and Averting Cryptocurrency Scams,” and is referenced by bill number S.3428 in congressional records. As of Dec. 17, 2025, the full legislative text had not been posted on the Congressional site. Public Education And Local Support The sponsors say the task force will do more than hunt scammers. It will fund public awareness work so consumers can spot fake investment pitches, phishing schemes, and impersonation fraud. Local law enforcement would get training and access to blockchain analytics tools, the backers say, so officers can follow illicit funds and identify criminal networks before victims lose large sums. Industry figures quoted in the announcement said crypto fraud has been large and growing. According to one industry policy lead cited by the sponsors, “Over the last two years, we’ve tracked billions in scams and fraud across the crypto ecosystem.” That warning is a central piece of the case lawmakers are making for faster, coordinated action. ngl a lot of memecoin etc scammers will probably end up shitting themselves if this goes hard, it fills a regulatory/enforcement gap that many probably assumed is permanent/long-term https://t.co/AdKlzVPh9D — _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) December 16, 2025 Cybercriminals: Panic Mode Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at crypto investment firm Delphi Labs, said that if the SAFE Crypto Act is carried out effectively, it could leave crypto scammers scrambling to stay ahead of enforcement. Shapiro added in a post on X on Tuesday that “scammers will probably end up sh*tting themselves if this goes hard,” stressing that the US attorney general, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the director of the US Secret Service would be among the senior officials leading efforts to pursue the bad guys. Why Lawmakers Are Pushing Now Lawmakers argue that criminals have grown more skilled at using decentralized systems and cross-border services to hide proceeds. The SAFE Crypto Act is being presented as a way to narrow that gap by making public and private responders work from a shared playbook. The initiative is part of a wave of digital currency-related policy moves being discussed in Congress this year.

According to fresh data from Farside Investors, these investment vehicles saw a combined net withdrawal of $22.4 million on December 17th. This persistent trend raises important questions about market sentiment toward Ethereum-based exchange-traded products. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Experiencing Sustained Outflows? The recent data reveals a clear pattern of capital leaving these funds. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the exodus with a substantial $19.6 million net outflow. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) followed with $2.8 million leaving the fund. Meanwhile, other spot Ethereum ETFs reported zero net activity for the day, indicating neither new investments nor significant withdrawals. This five-day outflow streak represents one of the most challenging periods for these relatively new financial products. Since their launch, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The consistent outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs suggest several possible market dynamics: Profit-taking behavior following recent price movements Portfolio rebalancing as year-end approaches Shifting sentiment toward cryptocurrency investments Competition from other investment vehicles offering similar exposure It’s crucial to understand that ETF flows represent just one aspect of the broader Ethereum ecosystem. While these outflows might indicate short-term caution among some investors, they don’t necessarily reflect the fundamental health of the Ethereum network or its long-term prospects. How Do ETF Flows Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Exchange-traded funds serve as important indicators of institutional sentiment. When major players like BlackRock and Fidelity experience outflows from their spot Ethereum ETFs, it often signals how traditional finance views current market conditions. However, these flows represent a relatively small portion of overall Ethereum trading volume and ownership. The performance of spot Ethereum ETFs can influence: Market perception of institutional crypto adoption Regulatory discussions about cryptocurrency products Future development of similar financial instruments Price discovery mechanisms for Ethereum It’s worth noting that outflows from one type of investment vehicle don’t necessarily mean investors are abandoning Ethereum entirely. Many may simply be moving capital to different Ethereum exposure methods or adjusting their overall portfolio allocation. What’s Next for Spot Ethereum ETFs? The coming weeks will be critical for observing whether this outflow trend continues or reverses. Several factors could influence future flows into spot Ethereum ETFs: Ethereum network upgrades and developments Broader cryptocurrency market trends Regulatory clarity from U.S. authorities Institutional adoption milestones Competitive products entering the market For investors considering spot Ethereum ETFs, it’s essential to look beyond short-term flow data. Consider the product’s structure, fees, liquidity, and how it fits within your overall investment strategy. The current outflow period might present opportunities for patient investors, or it might signal broader market trends worth monitoring closely. Conclusion: Reading Between the Flow Lines The fifth consecutive day of outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs certainly warrants attention from market observers. While $22.4 million represents a significant daily movement, it’s important to maintain perspective about what these flows actually indicate. They reflect specific investor decisions about exchange-traded products rather than fundamental judgments about Ethereum’s technology or long-term value proposition. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, flows into and out of regulated products like spot Ethereum ETFs will provide valuable data points about institutional engagement. However, wise investors will consider this information alongside broader market fundamentals, technological developments, and their own investment horizons. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly purchasing or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are investors withdrawing from these ETFs? Possible reasons include profit-taking after price increases, year-end portfolio rebalancing, shifting market sentiment, or moving to alternative investment vehicles offering similar exposure. Do ETF outflows mean Ethereum is losing value? Not necessarily. ETF flows represent just one segment of Ethereum investment. The cryptocurrency’s value depends on numerous factors including network usage, development activity, and broader market conditions. Which spot Ethereum ETF saw the largest outflow? BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) experienced the largest single-day outflow at $19.6 million on December 17th. How long has this outflow trend been continuing? According to Farside Investors data, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflows for five consecutive trading days as of December 17th. Should I be concerned about investing in Ethereum ETFs? Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Short-term flow data is just one factor to consider among many when evaluating any investment.

With the US inflation report looming and the Bank of Japan potentially ending its negative interest rate policy, traders across traditional Forex markets and cryptocurrency sectors are preparing for volatility. The outcome could reshape capital flows between East and West for months to come. Why are Asian currencies under pressure this week? Most Asian currencies traded within narrow ranges on Tuesday, showing minimal movement as markets adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Japanese yen remained steady around 147.33 against the dollar, while the Australian dollar hovered near 0.6616. This tepid trading reflects the market’s anxiety about two potentially conflicting forces: a hawkish Federal Reserve driven by persistent US inflation, and a historic policy shift from the Bank of Japan. The US inflation dilemma: What traders are watching The February US inflation data, scheduled for release on Tuesday, represents the single most important economic indicator for global markets this week. Here’s what analysts are monitoring: Core CPI expectations: Markets forecast a 0.3% month-over-month increase and 3.7% year-over-year Headline inflation: Expected to remain around 3.1% annually Market impact: Higher-than-expected readings could delay Federal Reserve rate cuts, strengthening the dollar against Asian currencies Crypto correlation: Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies often face selling pressure when dollar strength accelerates Key Asian Currency Levels Against USD Currency Current Level Weekly Change Key Resistance Japanese Yen (JPY) 147.33 -0.1% 148.00 Australian Dollar (AUD) 0.6616 +0.2% 0.6650 Chinese Yuan (CNY) 7.1880 Flat 7.2000 Indian Rupee (INR) 82.78 -0.3% 83.00 The BOJ rate hike decision: A historic turning point Market attention is intensely focused on the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting concluding on Tuesday. After years of ultra-loose monetary policy, the central bank is widely expected to end its negative interest rate regime. This potential BOJ rate hike would mark Japan’s first interest rate increase since 2007, fundamentally altering the dynamics of the USD/JPY pair and broader Asian currency markets. Consider these implications of a BOJ policy shift: Yield differentials: Narrowing gap between US and Japanese bond yields could strengthen the yen Carry trade unwinding: Investors may exit positions that borrowed in yen to invest in higher-yielding assets Regional impact: Other Asian central banks might face pressure to adjust their own policies Cryptocurrency flows: Japanese investors might repatriate funds from overseas crypto markets USD/JPY: The critical currency pair to watch The USD/JPY exchange rate sits at the epicenter of this week’s market movements. Currently trading around 147.33, the pair faces conflicting pressures: Bullish factors for USD/JPY: Strong US economic data supporting dollar strength Higher-for-longer Federal Reserve rate expectations Risk aversion typically benefits the dollar against Asian currencies Bearish factors for USD/JPY: Potential BOJ policy normalization supporting yen strength Technical resistance around the 148.00 level Overextended dollar positioning that could trigger profit-taking How Asian Forex markets are preparing for volatility Traders across Asian Forex markets are implementing specific strategies ahead of these dual events: Risk management approaches: Reducing leverage ahead of high-impact news events Implementing stop-loss orders on vulnerable currency pairs Diversifying across correlated and non-correlated assets Increasing cash positions to capitalize on potential dislocations Opportunity identification: Monitoring yen crosses for breakout opportunities Watching for divergence between Asian currency reactions Preparing for potential overshoots in either direction Identifying support and resistance levels for key pairs Cryptocurrency implications of Asian currency movements The intersection between traditional Forex markets and cryptocurrency trading has never been more significant. Asian currency movements directly impact digital asset markets through several channels: Capital flow effects: Japanese yen strength could reduce liquidity in crypto markets Dollar strength typically pressures Bitcoin and major altcoins Regional currency volatility may increase crypto trading as a hedge Changing interest rate differentials affect carry trade strategies involving crypto Trading strategy adjustments: Monitoring USD/JPY as a leading indicator for crypto markets Adjusting position sizing based on dollar index movements Considering Asian trading session patterns in crypto volatility Watching for regulatory responses to currency movements Actionable insights for traders and investors Navigating this week’s events requires specific preparation and strategic thinking: Pre-event positioning: Consider reduced exposure to USD/JPY and correlated pairs Implement option strategies to hedge against volatility spikes Monitor liquidity conditions across Asian trading sessions Prepare contingency plans for both hawkish and dovish outcomes Post-event opportunities: Watch for trend confirmation before committing to major positions Identify currency pairs showing relative strength or weakness Monitor central bank communication for forward guidance changes Assess secondary effects on emerging market currencies FAQs: Understanding this week’s currency market dynamics What time is the US inflation data released? The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February is scheduled for release at 8:30 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday. When does the Bank of Japan announce its rate decision? The BOJ typically announces its policy decision around midday Tokyo time on Tuesday, following its two-day meeting. How could a BOJ rate hike affect cryptocurrency markets? A BOJ rate hike could strengthen the yen, potentially leading Japanese investors to repatriate funds from overseas markets including cryptocurrencies, creating selling pressure. Which Asian currency is most sensitive to these events? The Japanese yen (JPY) is directly affected by both events, while the Chinese yuan (CNY) and Australian dollar (AUD) also show significant sensitivity to US dollar movements. Where can I find official statements from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan? Federal Reserve announcements are available on their official website , while Bank of Japan communications are published on their official portal . Market analysis is frequently provided by institutions like Nomura Holdings and economists such as those at Goldman Sachs . The bottom line: A pivotal moment for Asian currencies This week represents a critical juncture for Asian currencies as they face simultaneous pressure from US monetary policy and potential Japanese normalization. The US inflation data will determine the Federal Reserve’s near-term trajectory, while the BOJ rate hike decision could end an era of unprecedented monetary accommodation. The USD/JPY pair serves as the primary battleground where these forces collide, with implications rippling across all Forex markets and into cryptocurrency valuations. Traders who successfully navigate this volatility will find opportunities, while those unprepared may face significant challenges in the new interest rate environment taking shape across the Pacific.

WLF seeks to enhance strategic CeFi and DeFi partnerships and boost the adoption and usage of USD1 after the token hit a TVL of $3 billion in six months. The WLFI team said they are committed to identifying all partners where WLFI incentives are either mentioned in online communications or offered on official websites. USD1 is the company’s flagship product, but WLFI remains the ecosystem’s governance and coordination layer, supporting every current and future product launched. Meanwhile, the team claims that the success of USD1 will directly strengthen WLFI because the adoption of USD1 will expand the overall footprint, utility, and economic activities of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem as a whole. More users, platforms, institutions, and chains will also integrate WLFI as USD1 grows. However, future use of WLFI treasury holdings directly for USD1 growth will require additional governance votes. More USD1 leads to more World Liberty Financial-governed services demand The World Liberty Financial team believes that having more USD1 in circulation leads to more demand for WLFI-governed services, ecosystem programs, integrations, and liquidity incentives. In practice, this will increase the scale and influence of the network governed by WLFI holders. These holders will gain governance power over a larger network on issues related to product expansions, decisions regarding incentives, and cross-chain strategies. In an open poll on the company’s website, one WLFI investor supporting the use of 5% of unlocked WLFI for USD1 growth said this is a good way for the company to give back to the partners building on USD1 . The investor also believes this is an excellent opportunity to incentivize the development of innovative products that will help expand the USD1 ecosystem. The investor recommends allocating funds towards DEXs, such as Ethereum (acquire DOLO and BLOCK), Solana (acquire AOL, BURGER, US, DREAM, and VALOR), and CEXs. They also recommend investing in BONK and/or additional bonkfun USD1 paired tokens, including $1coin/SPSC. However, a significant number of poll participants were against using the 5% WLFI treasury holdings for USD1, instead recommending that at least 80% of the total WLFI supply tokens be unlocked and held in the treasury. World Liberty Financial community votes for WLFI buyback Following a successful community vote, WLFI activated a portion of its treasury to support the WLFI token buyback initiative, which directly benefits its native USD1 stablecoin . The company executed a massive $10 million worth of WLFI token buyback in a strategic three-week initiative powered by their USD1 stablecoin. The protocol used USD1 to buy WLFI tokens from the open market. Meanwhile, it also emerged that DWF Labs has been secretly supporting USD1 by purchasing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the token through anonymous wallets that circulate it in the WLFI ecosystem. Disruption Banking found, through a combination of analysis of dozens of wallets and thousands of mapped transactions, that the crypto market maker had funneled over $300 million of engineered liquidity through WLFI’s TokenGovernor contract. The reconstruction of multi-chain flows also identified a three-layer liquidity structure that silently injected $84 million in the past month alone. However, while these flows and the funding pipeline have not been previously reported, DWF Labs has publicly bought $25 million worth of USD1 tokens, a large part of which ended up on Binance. The Cantor Network also announced plans to deploy USD1 a few days ago, representing another significant milestone in WLFI’s USD1 expansion strategy. The move aims to increase USD1’s reach across institutional onchain finance and accelerate the token’s adoption among regulated market participants worldwide.

SOL price is now consolidating losses below $130 and might decline further below $120. SOL price started a fresh decline below $130 and $128 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $131 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a recovery wave if the bulls defend $122 or $120. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price failed to remain stable above $132 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $130 and $128 support levels. The price gained bearish momentum below $126. A low was formed at $121, and the price is now consolidating losses. The price recovered a few points and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. Solana is now trading below $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $125 level. The next major resistance is near the $128 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. The main resistance could be $130. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $131 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. A successful close above the $132 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $140. Any more gains might send the price toward the $145 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $128 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $122 zone. The first major support is near the $120 level. A break below the $120 level might send the price toward the $112 support zone. If there is a close below the $112 support, the price could decline toward the $105 support in the near term.

At the same time, Coinbase used its year-end “System Update” conference to unveil a sweeping expansion beyond just crypto trading, including the launch of stock trading in the US, Kalshi-powered prediction markets, an AI-driven investment adviser, custom USDC-backed stablecoins, and a brand new tokenization platform. India Clears Coinbase Stake in CoinDCX India’s competition regulator approved Coinbase’s acquisition of a minority stake in CoinDCX. In a notice that was issued on Tuesday, the Competition Commission of India said it cleared Coinbase Global’s investment in DCX Global Limited, the parent company of CoinDCX, one of India’s most established cryptocurrency platforms. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirmed the approval in a post on X on Wednesday, and described the transaction as a step that deepens Coinbase’s long-term partnership with CoinDCX. While the regulatory filing and Grewal’s comments confirmed the minority nature of the investment, neither revealed the size of the stake or the financial terms involved. The approval follows disclosures made in October, when Coinbase revealed plans to invest in CoinDCX at a post-money valuation of roughly $2.4 billion. At that time, Coinbase said CoinDCX was generating approximately $141 million in annual revenue as of July, despite regulatory uncertainty and shifting market conditions in the country. Coinbase also pushed back against earlier reports suggesting it was pursuing a full acquisition of CoinDCX for around $1 billion, and clarified that its interest was limited to a minority position rather than an outright takeover. CoinDCX is a key player in India’s crypto ecosystem, serving millions of users as a compliant, locally rooted platform. The investment from Coinbase, which is one of the world’s largest publicly listed crypto exchanges, is seen as a vote of confidence in both CoinDCX’s business model and the long-term potential of the Indian market. The deal also comes as Coinbase explores a broader return to India after previously scaling back its presence. According to reports last week, Coinbase is considering the rollout of fiat on-ramps for Indian users beginning in 2026. If implemented, the move would mark Coinbase’s re-entry into the market more than two years after it stopped services in September of 2023 due to regulatory and banking challenges. India’s appeal to global crypto firms is also strong due to its sheer scale and growing adoption of digital assets. With a population of more than 1.4 billion and industry estimates suggesting more than 100 million crypto users nationwide, the country has one of the largest potential user bases in the world. Coinbase Unveils Major Expansions Meanwhile, Coinbase used its year-end “ System Update ” conference on Wednesday to share an ambitious expansion beyond its core crypto exchange business. It unveiled a broad set of new products that push the company further into stocks, prediction markets, tokenization, stablecoins and AI-driven financial services. The biggest reveal was the launch of stock trading on Coinbase, which begins rolling out in the United States. The company framed the move as a step toward enabling 24/7 global trading of stocks and ETFs using crypto-powered infrastructure. By adding equities to its platform, Coinbase now joins a crowded field of companies that already combine crypto and traditional assets, while also looking to get ahead of rivals offering tokenized stocks outside the US. Coinbase also announced the addition of prediction markets through a partnership with Kalshi, which will allow users to trade outcomes tied to events like sports and politics. The rollout starts immediately and will expand more broadly in the US, placing Coinbase among a growing group of companies targeting what analysts expect to be an expanding market. In fact, industry forecasts suggest that prediction market revenues could reach $10 billion by the end of the decade. Another interesting launch was Coinbase Advisor , an AI-powered investment assistant that is designed to offer guidance across crypto, stocks and prediction markets. The tool is currently in beta for select users, and it combines automated insights with oversight from human portfolio managers. On the infrastructure side, Coinbase revealed plans to offer custom stablecoins backed by USDC, which will make it possible for companies to issue branded digital dollars embedded directly into their products. It also introduced Coinbase Tokenize, a full-service platform that is aimed at helping institutions bring traditional assets on-chain by bundling issuance, custody, compliance and trading. The exchange further expanded decentralized trading via deeper Solana integrations , simplified access to futures and perpetual contracts for US traders, and confirmed that its Base layer-2 app is now available in more than 140 countries.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-18 05:30:00

PeckShield flagged the incident in an X alert, observing on Thursday that “a whale’s Multisig was drained of ~$27.3M due to a private key compromise.” On-chain traces shared by the security firm show the drainer routing a large chunk of the haul through Tornado Cash, a privacy mixer often used to break transaction links. PeckShield said the attacker had already laundered about $12.6M, roughly 4,100 ETH, and still held around $2M in liquid assets. #PeckShieldAlert A whale's Multisig was drained of ~$27.3M due to a private key compromise.

PeckShield said the attacker now controls the victim’s multisig, which still holds a leveraged long on Aave, with about $25M in ETH supplied against roughly $12.3M in DAI borrowed. That detail matters because multisig setups do not automatically protect funds if an attacker can meet the signing threshold, or if the wallet’s governance is effectively captured through compromised keys and approvals. Once the attacker can sign, they can move fast, pull liquidity, and make recovery attempts far harder. Live Positions Turn Key Theft Into Cascading Risk Data shows repeated outflows to Tornado Cash in round lots, the sort of pattern traders associate with systematic laundering rather than a one-off panic exit. They also point to the attacker interacting with contracts tied to ownership and control, suggesting the compromise extended beyond a single transfer. Teams can distribute signing keys and still lose them to phishing, malware, SIM swaps, unsafe backups, or rushed approvals on malicious transaction prompts. It also points to a second-order risk specific to DeFi power users. The wallet is not just a vault but a control plane for live positions. Once an attacker gains access to collateral, borrow lines or health factors, the damage can cascade well beyond the initial drain.

In a recent post, he revisited a call he made when XRP traded near $0.11, highlighting his prediction that the asset would reach a new all-time high. Never forget I called for #XRP to make a new ATH when we crashed to $0.11. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 15, 2025 XRP’s Deep Lows and Sharp Rebounds XRP traded near $0.11 in mid-2017. At the time, confidence across the market was low. Months later, XRP surged. It climbed above $3 in early 2018 during the wider crypto rally. That move placed XRP among the top-performing large-cap assets of that cycle. However, the rally did not last. XRP entered a prolonged decline later that year, and its price action stayed muted for years. In early 2021, the asset again approached the $0.11 level. That return tested long-term holders and revived memories of the previous cycle. XRP then rebounded strongly. Within months, it rose to $1.96. Experts believe it would have performed better, but it was suppressed by the Ripple lawsuit . The move reinforced XRP’s reputation for delayed but aggressive bullish moves during broader market expansions. These historical swings now serve as the backdrop for renewed optimism from long-standing analysts. Renewed Optimism and Price Targets CryptoBull has continued to express confidence in XRP. He recently shared a bullish analysis of XRP’s chart, suggesting the asset could soon surpass $5 . His focus remains on longer cycle structures and historical repetition. Most recently, the analyst suggested a crucial technical formation on the asset’s chart could send it to $16 by the end of January 2026. However, XRP has failed to meet expectations in the past few months. The market saw the launch of multiple spot XRP ETFs. The crypto space has anticipated these products for years, but XRP’s price has struggled . Despite this underperformance, analysts like CryptoBull are still confident in the asset’s potential. Referencing his previous analysis suggests that CryptoBull views the current underperformance as a temporary phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions Reflect Division Despite his optimism, several responses challenged CryptoBull’s framing. One reply suggested that being correct once does not validate repeated inaccurate predictions. Another commenter argued that many market participants made similar calls during the crash, which weakens the claim of distinction. A separate reply criticized the timing of the reminder, saying predictions can appear accurate long after the fact. One user also questioned years of bullish commentary that failed to materialize, implying fatigue with repeated optimism. While these reactions show some division, market participants are eagerly watching XRP with the hope of a resurgence in early 2026.

While the flagship cryptocurrency trades sideways, a growing chorus of analysts and market indicators are flashing warning signs. The latest Bitcoin price prediction from some quarters is turning alarmingly bearish, with one prominent analyst even forecasting a potential drop to $10,000. What’s driving this pessimistic outlook, and should investors be concerned? Why Are Analysts Issuing This Bearish Bitcoin Price Prediction? The current Bitcoin price prediction shift isn’t based on mere speculation. Concrete data from the derivatives market reveals growing anxiety. According to CoinDesk, BTC’s 30-day implied volatility has climbed to approximately 45%. More telling is the increased demand for put options, which are contracts that profit when the price falls. This activity clearly shows that sophisticated traders are hedging against or betting on a decline below the $85,000 support level. This cautious sentiment forms the foundation for the current wave of bearish forecasts. The market is digesting the massive rally that pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 earlier this year, and history suggests such parabolic moves are often followed by painful corrections. Could Bitcoin Really Fall to $10,000? The Stark Warning The most eye-catching and severe Bitcoin price prediction comes from Mike McGlone of Bloomberg Intelligence. He presents a sobering analysis: the explosive wealth creation seen in early 2024 may have set the stage for a dramatic reversal. McGlone suggests the cryptocurrency could retrace to levels around $10,000 in the coming year. His rationale hinges on market cycles. Periods of extreme, rapid gains in asset prices frequently lead to equally sharp downturns as markets correct excesses. This isn’t a new phenomenon for Bitcoin, which has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles throughout its history. Historical Precedent: Past bull runs have often ended with 80%+ drawdowns. Leverage Unwind: A highly leveraged market is vulnerable to cascading liquidations. Macro Pressures: Broader economic factors can trigger risk-off sentiment. What Other Factors Could Influence Bitcoin’s Price? While McGlone’s $10,000 Bitcoin price prediction represents the extreme end of the spectrum, other analysts point to more immediate risks. The price trajectory may not be dictated by internal cycles alone. Two external forces could play a decisive role: First, geopolitical instability remains a wildcard. Global tensions can cause sudden flights to safety or, conversely, drive investors away from perceived risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Second, the overall leverage environment in the crypto market is critical. High levels of borrowed money amplify both gains and losses, potentially accelerating any downward move. Therefore, a realistic Bitcoin price prediction must account for this complex mix of technical indicators, cyclical patterns, and external shocks. The path forward is uncertain, and investors should prepare for volatility. How Should You Navigate This Uncertain Market? Facing a conflicting Bitcoin price prediction landscape requires a balanced strategy. Panic selling based on a single forecast is rarely wise. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never over-concentrate in any single asset, no matter how promising. Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders and only invest capital you can afford to lose. Focus on the Long Term: Bitcoin’s history is one of resilience. Short-term predictions often miss long-term trends. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Analyze multiple sources and form your own informed view. Remember, market predictions are probabilities, not certainties. While the options market signals caution, and analysts like McGlone warn of a deep correction, the future is not written. Bitcoin has repeatedly defied the most dire forecasts. Conclusion: A Time for Caution, Not Fear The current bearish Bitcoin price prediction from several analysts serves as a crucial reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. The potential for a significant downside, highlighted by the startling $10,000 forecast, underscores the importance of risk management. However, it also presents a potential opportunity for disciplined, long-term investors. By understanding the signals, respecting market cycles, and avoiding emotional decisions, you can navigate this period of uncertainty. The key is to stay informed, stay cautious, and align your strategy with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the prediction of Bitcoin dropping to $10,000 a consensus view? A: No, it is not a consensus. This is a specific, bearish forecast from analyst Mike McGlone. Many other analysts have differing views, ranging from moderate corrections to continued sideways movement. Q2: What does “increased demand for put options” mean? A: Put options are financial contracts that increase in value if the asset’s price falls. Increased demand for them indicates more traders are either betting on a price drop or paying to insure their holdings against one. Q3: What is “implied volatility” and why is it important? A: Implied volatility (IV) is a market forecast of likely price movement. An IV of 45% suggests the market expects significant price swings over the next 30 days. High IV often precedes big price moves, up or down. Q4: Should I sell all my Bitcoin based on this prediction? A: Making drastic investment decisions based on a single prediction is generally not advisable. Consider your investment horizon, risk tolerance, and overall portfolio strategy. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended for personalized advice. Q5: What are the main risks causing this bearish outlook? A> Key risks include the unwinding of excessive market leverage, a broader macroeconomic downturn, geopolitical events, and the natural correction following a strong rally. Q6: Has Bitcoin ever been at $10,000 before? A: Yes. Bitcoin traded around $10,000 at various points in 2019 and 2020. A return to that level would represent a decline of over 85% from its 2024 highs. Found this analysis of the latest Bitcoin price prediction crucial? Market insights are best when shared.

55967008,646092,1766037603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55967008.jpeg,BitMine Goes Shopping As Ethereum Dips: $140M Buy Spotted On-Chain,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-shopping-ethereum-dips-140m-buy-on-chain/,"Two massive Ethereum transactions have just flowed out from FalconX, with Lookonchain linking them to ETH treasury company BitMine. BitMine Has Received 48,049 Ethereum From FalconX In a new post on X, on-chain sleuth Lookonchain has pointed out how BitMine appears to have acquired 48,049 ETH from a hot wallet connected to FalconX, an institutional digital asset trading platform. The coins transferred through two transactions to two different wallets. The larger transfer involved 31,867 ETH, while the smaller one 16,182 ETH. In total, the tokens were worth about $140.58 million at the time that they were transacted. The moves have come as Ethereum has plunged alongside the wider cryptocurrency sector, with its price dropping below the $3,000 level. Thus, it would appear possible that they are a sign of BitMine buying the dip. Originally a Bitcoin mining-focused company, BitMine transitioned to being an Ethereum treasury vehicle under the leadership of chairman Tom Lee in June of this year. Since then, the firm has rapidly accumulated the cryptocurrency and has established itself as the “ Strategy ” of ETH. On Monday, BitMine published a press release announcing that its holdings reached 3,967,210 ETH. So far, the company hasn’t made any official announcement of the latest buy, but if confirmed, it would take the total reserve past the 4 million ETH milestone. The firm has set a target of 5% of the total circulating Ethereum supply. At present, the company still has some ways to go before this goal is hit, but at about 3.3% of the supply now sitting in its wallets, it has certainly made significant progress. With holdings valued at more than $11 billion, BitMine is the second-largest cryptocurrency corporate holder in the world, only behind Strategy. Unlike Michael Saylor’s firm, however, the Ethereum hoarder has its treasury sitting in the red right now. Nonetheless, if the two blockchain transactions correspond to purchases, then it’s a sign that BitMine is still committed to accumulating more. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked in an X post about how the Ethereum price has changed since BitMine started its accumulation spree. It’s visible in the chart that during the initial buying period, ETH witnessed some rapid growth.

The king of cryptocurrency now faces a decisive battle at a critical Bitcoin price resistance level. According to fresh analysis, the outcome of this clash between bullish derivatives traders and cautious spot market investors will determine the next major move. Let’s break down the forces at play. Why is $95K Such a Critical Bitcoin Price Resistance Level? Glassnode’s recent report highlights a fascinating conflict. The powerful push above $90,000 on December 17th was fueled primarily by leveraged derivatives traders. We know this because open interest rose sharply, and the perpetual futures volume delta turned positive. However, this rally met a harsh reality check. A massive supply wall between $93,000 and $120,000 triggered significant selling from spot market investors. This selling pressure caused the sharp price rejection we witnessed. The analysis concludes that for a sustained rebound, Bitcoin must do two things: first, reclaim the $95,000 Bitcoin price resistance , and second, push past the short-term holder break-even point of $101,500. Until then, the path upward looks blocked. Derivatives vs. Spot: Who’s Driving the Market? The current market dynamic reveals a clear tug-of-war. On one side, we have the derivatives traders using leverage to bet on higher prices. On the other, spot investors are taking profits and creating sell pressure. This conflict creates volatility and uncertainty. Derivatives Traders: Provide short-term momentum and liquidity through futures and options. Spot Investors: Often represent longer-term conviction; their selling indicates a belief that prices are high enough to take profits. This clash means the Bitcoin price resistance is not just a number on a chart. It represents a psychological and economic battleground. Can a Year-End Rally Overcome This Resistance? The broader sentiment adds another layer of complexity. Ryan Yoon, a senior analyst at Tiger Research, suggests that pervasive bearish sentiment across the market makes a sharp, dramatic year-end rally seem improbable. The general caution among investors is a significant headwind. However, Yoon points to a potential catalyst: the upcoming U.S. November Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. A favorable reading, showing cooling inflation, could inject optimism into the entire financial market, including crypto. This could provide the necessary fuel for a short-term bounce, potentially helping Bitcoin challenge the key Bitcoin price resistance level once more. What’s the Actionable Insight for Traders? For anyone watching the markets, this analysis provides a clear framework. The $95,000 level is the line in the sand. A decisive and sustained break above it, confirmed by high volume, could signal the next leg up. Conversely, failure to break through could lead to further consolidation or a pullback. Monitor these key signals: Price Action at $95K: Watch for rejection or acceptance. Spot Market Flows: Signs of accumulation or distribution on major exchanges. Macro Data: The CPI report’s impact on overall risk appetite. The struggle at this Bitcoin price resistance zone is a classic example of market mechanics in action. Conclusion: Patience is the Key Bitcoin’s journey is rarely a straight line. The current standoff at $95,000 is a critical test of strength between different market participants. While derivatives traders provide the thrust, sustained movement requires conviction from the spot market. Until Bitcoin can convincingly conquer this Bitcoin price resistance , patience remains the most valuable strategy. The market is waiting for a clear winner to emerge from this high-stakes conflict. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main Bitcoin price resistance level right now? The primary resistance level is $95,000, according to Glassnode analysis. A break above this is needed for a sustained bullish move. Why did Bitcoin drop after hitting $90K? The price was rejected by a large supply wall (sell orders) between $93,000 and $120,000, primarily from spot market investors taking profits. What is the difference between derivatives and spot market selling? Derivatives trading involves contracts like futures and options, often using leverage. Spot market selling involves selling actual Bitcoin held in wallets. The recent rally was driven by derivatives, while the drop was caused by spot selling. Could the CPI report affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes. A favorable U.S. CPI report showing lower inflation could boost overall market sentiment and potentially trigger a short-term bounce for Bitcoin, helping it test resistance. What is the short-term holder break-even point? This is the average cost basis for investors who bought Bitcoin within the last 155 days, currently around $101,500. It’s a significant psychological level where these holders might look to sell to break even. Is a big year-end rally still possible for Bitcoin? Analysts like Ryan Yoon believe strong bearish sentiment makes a sharp year-end rally improbable, but not impossible if a positive macro catalyst like a good CPI report emerges.

Despite the absence of any markup hearings scheduled for this week, industry representatives and senators engaged in what many considered a productive dialogue regarding the evolving legislative landscape. Senators Collaborate With Industry Leaders Key figures from major crypto firms were among the attendees, including executives from Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, Chainlink, a16z, and Ripple, who have been increasingly involved in discussions aimed at fostering the positive growth of digital assets in the country. According to Eleanor Terret from Crypto In America, the atmosphere of the meeting was described as “constructive and collaborative.” Senators from both parties engaged actively with industry representatives, asking insightful questions and exploring the nuances of the proposed bill text. Related Reading: Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report Participating senators included Democrats Mark Warner and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were noted for their engagement and for posing significant questions to both the industry representatives and Senate Banking staff. Three key areas of ongoing negotiation emerged from the discussions: the classification of tokens—distinguishing between securities and commodities, the roles of stablecoin interest versus rewards, and discussions surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi). The meeting’s update follows earlier confirmation from a committee spokesperson that the Banking Committee will not conduct a markup hearing prior to the upcoming Christmas break. Instead, the committee intends to monitor the bill’s progress for potential action in early 2026. Intensified Talks On Crypto Regulation In a statement released earlier this week, Jeff Naft, spokesperson for Chair Scott, emphasized the committee’s commitment to pursuing a bipartisan approach to address the complexities of digital asset market legislation. “Chairman Scott and the Senate Banking Committee have made strong progress,” Naft noted, underscoring continued efforts to establish a new regulatory framework that would enhance clarity for the crypto sector and position the United States as a leader in the digital assets arena. Negotiations have intensified over the past week, with Republican members of the Banking Committee working closely with their Democratic counterparts to seek a viable compromise.

Ethereum Has Been Trading Inside A Parallel Channel For The Last Few Years In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a long-term pattern that Ethereum has appeared to have been following for the last few years. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder The upper level of a Parallel Channel is likely to facilitate top formations in the asset, while the lower one can act as a support boundary and allow the price to remain above it. Parallel Channels can be of a few different types depending on how the lines are oriented with respect to the graph axes. If the channel has some slope, it falls into either the Ascending or Descending categories. Naturally, it’s the former when the lines are angled upward and latter when they are downward. In the context of the current topic, the simplest type of Parallel Channel is of relevance: a channel that has zero slope. That is, a pattern with lines that are parallel to the time-axis. As an asset trades inside such a channel, it experiences consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. If one of the levels of the pattern break, a sustained continuation of trend may occur in that direction. This means that a surge above the resistance can be a bullish signal, while a fall under support a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the monthly price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the recent bearish wave in Ethereum has meant that its 1-month price has retraced to the midway line of the Parallel Channel located at $2,930. Martinez has noted that if ETH closes December below this level, a decline to lower levels could occur. The next potential support is situated at $2,000, corresponding to the 25% mark of the Parallel Channel. The cryptocurrency found support around this line in the starting months of 2025. In the scenario that this level also fails, Ethereum may be looking at a fall to the bottom line of the Parallel Channel at $1,090. The asset last retested it back in 2022 and successfully found support.

Starting at 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 23, these services will pause to facilitate a crucial network upgrade for the Sei blockchain. This proactive measure ensures a smooth transition and enhanced network performance for all users. What Does the Upbit SEI Service Suspension Mean for You? If you use Upbit for SEI transactions, you need to mark your calendar. The temporary halt affects only deposit and withdrawal functions for the SEI token. Therefore, your existing SEI holdings remain secure in your Upbit wallet during this period. However, you cannot move SEI tokens to or from external wallets while the maintenance window is active. The exchange confirmed this action supports the Sei network’s scheduled upgrade. Network upgrades often introduce new features, improve security, or enhance scalability. Consequently, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily pause external transactions to synchronize their systems with the updated blockchain and prevent any technical issues or fund loss. How Should You Prepare for the SEI Deposit and Withdrawal Pause? Planning ahead prevents last-minute stress. Here is a simple checklist for Upbit users before December 23: Complete pending transactions : Initiate any necessary SEI deposits or withdrawals well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline. Verify wallet addresses : Double-check all external wallet addresses if you plan to move funds, as transactions cannot be reversed once submitted. Monitor official channels : Follow Upbit’s official announcements for updates on service resumption. The exchange will notify users once normal operations resume. Remember, trading of SEI on Upbit’s internal market may continue unaffected during this deposit/withdrawal pause. However, always check the latest exchange notice for confirmation. This temporary inconvenience ultimately aims to provide a more robust and efficient SEI network experience for everyone. Why Do Exchanges Like Upbit Suspend Services for Network Upgrades? Network upgrades are essential for blockchain evolution. When a blockchain like Sei undergoes an upgrade, all network participants, including exchanges, must update their node software to the new version. Upbit suspends SEI deposits and withdrawals to ensure a clean, safe transition. This prevents potential problems like: Transaction failures or losses during the chain migration. Network forks causing confusion over the valid chain. Security vulnerabilities that could arise from running outdated software. This standard industry practice demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to operational security and user asset protection. The temporary pause, while slightly disruptive, is a responsible measure that prioritizes the long-term health of your SEI holdings. What Can We Expect After the Sei Network Upgrade? Once the upgrade completes and Upbit re-enables services, users should experience a seamless return to normal operations. The enhanced network may offer benefits like faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or new functionalities for SEI tokens. Moreover, successful upgrades often strengthen investor confidence in a project’s technical roadmap and long-term viability. To stay informed, users should monitor both Upbit’s official communication and announcements from the Sei development team. The resumption time may vary slightly depending on the upgrade’s complexity, but exchanges typically work diligently to minimize downtime. Final Summary: Navigating the Temporary SEI Service Halt In summary, Upbit’s temporary suspension of SEI deposits and withdrawals is a planned, precautionary step for a significant network improvement. By taking simple preparatory actions before December 23, users can avoid disruption. This upgrade underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology, where periodic maintenance paves the way for better performance and innovation. View this pause not as an obstacle, but as an investment in a more powerful SEI ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade SEI on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Typically, internal trading on the exchange’s order books continues. However, you should verify this in Upbit’s official announcement, as policies can vary. Q2: Are my SEI tokens safe on Upbit during this time? A2: Yes. The suspension only affects moving tokens in or out of the exchange. Your existing SEI balance in your Upbit wallet remains secure and unaffected. Q3: When will SEI deposits and withdrawals resume? A3: Upbit has not announced a specific end time. The service will resume after the network upgrade is complete and the exchange has successfully updated and tested its systems. Monitor Upbit’s notice page for the official resumption announcement. Q4: Do I need to do anything with my SEI tokens before the suspension? A4: Only if you need to deposit or withdraw them. If you are holding SEI on Upbit with no plans to move it, no action is required. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend SEI services? A5: It is likely. Other exchanges supporting SEI may announce similar maintenance windows to handle the same network upgrade. Check with your specific exchange for their schedule. Q6: What happens if I initiate a transaction right before the cutoff time? A6: Transactions initiated before the suspension time will be processed. However, to avoid being caught in a pending state, it is wise to complete all transfers several hours in advance. Found this guide on the Upbit SEI deposits and withdrawals suspension helpful?

This vision inches closer to reality as Standard Chartered, a global banking giant, launches a groundbreaking tokenized deposit solution . This move signals a seismic shift in how traditional finance embraces blockchain technology to solve real-world problems. What is Standard Chartered’s Tokenized Deposit Solution? Standard Chartered has unveiled a blockchain-based platform for tokenizing bank deposits. In simple terms, it turns traditional money in a bank account into digital tokens on a blockchain. The bank collaborated with Ant International to deploy this technology on Ant’s Whale platform. This system enables instant, 24/7 transfers in three major currencies: Hong Kong dollars (HKD) Chinese yuan (CNY) U.S. dollars (USD) Therefore, it removes traditional banking delays, offering a glimpse into the future of frictionless finance. Why is Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble a Game-Changer? This launch is not an isolated experiment. It forms a crucial part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Project Ensemble . This initiative aims to build a robust financial infrastructure for tokenized assets in Hong Kong. Project Ensemble focuses on creating interoperability—ensuring different blockchain systems can work together seamlessly. By backing such innovations, Hong Kong positions itself as a forward-thinking global financial hub. Moreover, it provides a regulated sandbox for testing real-world applications of this tokenized deposit solution . What Are the Real Benefits of Tokenizing Deposits? This technology offers tangible advantages over the current system. First, it provides real-time settlement . Transactions that normally take days can settle in seconds, improving liquidity for businesses. Second, it enhances transparency and security . Every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, reducing fraud risk. Third, it lowers operational costs by automating processes and cutting out intermediaries. For users, it means faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments. This tokenized deposit solution could revolutionize trade finance, supply chain payments, and remittances. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Blockchain in Banking? Despite the promise, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving globally. Banks must navigate complex compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Another challenge is achieving mass adoption. Convincing traditional businesses and consumers to trust a new digital system requires time and education. Furthermore, scalability and energy consumption of blockchain networks are ongoing concerns that need addressing. However, initiatives like Project Ensemble show that collaboration between regulators and innovators can pave the way for responsible adoption. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Finance Standard Chartered’s launch is a landmark moment. It demonstrates that major financial institutions are not just observing blockchain but actively building with it. This tokenized deposit solution is a practical step toward a more efficient and inclusive financial system. As Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble gains momentum, we can expect more pilots and real-world use cases. The fusion of traditional banking trust with blockchain innovation promises to reshape our financial landscape fundamentally. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a tokenized deposit? A tokenized deposit is a digital representation of money held in a traditional bank account. It exists as a token on a blockchain, making it easier and faster to transfer or use in digital transactions. Is my money safe in a tokenized deposit? Yes, when offered by a regulated entity like Standard Chartered. The token is a claim on real money held securely by the bank. The blockchain adds an extra layer of transparency and security to the transaction record. How is this different from a stablecoin? While similar, a key difference is the issuer. A tokenized deposit is issued directly by a licensed bank against its deposits. Many stablecoins are issued by private companies with varying levels of regulatory oversight and reserve backing. Can I use this service as an individual? Currently, this solution is likely aimed at institutional and corporate clients for wholesale payments and trade finance. Retail availability will depend on future regulatory approvals and bank strategy. What does Project Ensemble mean for crypto in Hong Kong? Project Ensemble signals Hong Kong’s serious commitment to integrating blockchain technology into its mainstream financial system. It focuses on tokenizing real-world assets, which could bring more legitimacy and stability to the broader digital asset ecosystem. Will this make international transfers free? Not free, but significantly cheaper and faster. By reducing intermediary banks and manual processes, transaction costs can drop dramatically, benefiting businesses and consumers.

Prior to serving as Commissioner, Pham was a Managing Director at Citigroup heading market structure for strategic initiatives. During her tenure at the CFTC, she oversaw regulatory innovation and groundbreaking digital asset policy. She pressed aggressively on the pro-crypto plans set out by President Trump during his executive orders, launching the “crypto sprint.” The initiative has been running in parallel with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s “Project Crypto.” Last month, she announced a new prediction markets initiative , calling for nominations to head the CFTC arm. Additionally, she proposed a regulatory sandbox – CFTC Digital Asset Markets Pilot Program – that lets Bitcoin, Ether and USDC serve as collateral in derivatives markets. Pham launched the program on December 8, along with new guidance on tokenized collateral. Her successor, Mike Selig, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week, following a final vote.

Key Takeaways: Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum’s trustlessness depends not just on decentralization, but on how many people can understand the protocol. Growing technical complexity risks shifting trust from code to a small group of experts. Ethereum developers may need to sacrifice features to make the network simpler and more widely understandable. In a post on X this week , Buterin said that while Ethereum already operates without centralized control, true trustlessness goes beyond code execution and validator decentralization. It also depends on how many people can actually understand how the protocol works. Vitalik Buterin Warns Complexity Can Undermine Blockchain Trustlessness Trustlessness, in theory, means a system enforces its own rules through code, without relying on developers or intermediaries. However, Buterin noted that when a protocol becomes so complex that only a small group of experts can grasp it end to end, users are still forced to trust that group in practice. “An important and underrated form of trustlessness is increasing the number of people who can actually understand the whole protocol from top to bottom,” Buterin wrote. “Ethereum needs to get better at this by making the protocol simpler.” Ethereum already enforces transactions and smart contracts through open-source software and a decentralized validator set. An important and underrated form of trustlessness is increasing the number of people who can actually understand the whole protocol from top to bottom. Ethereum needs to get better at this (by making the protocol simpler). https://t.co/Pa1PXRG8sA — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 17, 2025 However, Buterin acknowledged that growing layers of features, upgrades and technical abstractions have made it harder for average users, and even developers, to fully follow how the system operates. Asked about the tradeoff between advanced features and simplicity, Buterin said the ecosystem should be willing to accept fewer features if it leads to better understanding and broader participation. Projects building on Ethereum echoed Buterin’s view. INTMAX, a privacy-focused layer-2 network, said trustlessness breaks down when only a handful of people can audit or explain a system. “If only five people can understand how your privacy protocol works, you haven’t achieved trustlessness, you’ve just changed who you trust. Simple, auditable privacy architecture > complex black boxes,” the project said. Same principle for privacy infrastructure.

Simple, auditable privacy architecture > complex black boxes. — INTMAX main (@intmaxIO) December 17, 2025 Ethereum Roadmap Targets Simpler User Experience Ethereum’s own roadmap acknowledges the problem. The network has said it remains “too complex” for most users and has outlined plans to lower barriers to entry and make Ethereum feel closer to a Web2 experience. Planned improvements include smart contract wallets that simplify gas fees and key management, as well as making node operation possible on consumer devices like smartphones and browsers. The Ethereum Foundation also continues to fund education initiatives aimed at expanding understanding of blockchain technology. As reported, Ether held on centralized exchanges has dropped to an all-time low , with balances falling to just 8.7% of total supply, the smallest share since Ethereum launched in 2015. The decline marks a 43% drop since July, a shift analysts say is tightening liquid supply and setting the stage for a potential market squeeze.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-investors-four-year-cycle-analyst-weighs-in/,"With only two weeks left of 2025, market participants wonder whether the Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the crypto market will continue to struggle or begin recovering. An analyst discussed the current market sentiment and the impact it may have on market performance. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns The Four-Year Crypto Cycle Is ‘Like Faith In God’ As we approach the end of the year, concerns about the crypto market’s performance continue to mount. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a 30% decline from its early October peak. As the volatility persist and the flagship crypto trades below its yearly opening price of $93,500, some investors questioned the four-year cycle theory, suggesting that the theory may no longer hold after the recent market’s performance. Responding to one of these comments, pseudonym market observer Plur affirmed that the four-year crypto cycle has evolved over the years and that “there is no magical rule of nature stating price must go up and down on this fixed cadence.” The analyst explained that the theory is a “memetic consensus, which is a form of implicit agreement and coordination that people will buy and sell together at set times, and by doing so, force outsiders to participate and bring their money.” “It’s an egregore-as-cartel. It’s a large group of loosely connected people all saying, every 4 years, we are going to hike up and down this mountain at the same time,” he detailed on the Wednesday post. Another community member added that the crypto cycle “is like faith in God: everyone believes in it, but no one has ever seen it.” Plur added that the initial catalyst and “original metronome” of this theory was the halving but that it has become “something more than that.” Market Struggles As Investors’ Faith Splits The evolution of the four-year crypto cycle has led some market participants to try to shift their behavior to “front run the moves of others” to benefit more.” As a result, many investors started to sell aggressively in 2025 anticipating of the end of the cycle. To the market watcher, this “represents a fraying in the memetic consensus, and eventually it collapses, as belief decays.” Similarly, Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, recently affirmed that Bitcoin is currently “climbing another wall of worry” that has made investors cautious of the upcoming market performance. She explained that there is fear of the four-year cycle, which suggests that 2026 will be a corrective year. Plur noted that the crypto market is in an uncertain state, where some investors continue to believe in the theory and some don’t.

Remember how assured you felt buying in 2023? Now the troops are scattered because the coordination mechanism is gone,” he stated. Plur added that “in equities the memetic consensus is that the index will always grind up over time, buy the dip, trust the process. (…) I had been hopeful that something similar could come in for BTC to replace the 4 year cycle, but sell pressure was way too high,” leading to the indeterminate state of the market. He concluded that it’s time to wait and see if a new form of memetic consensus can form.

Following years of legal hurdles that culminated in Zhao serving time in prison, his recent presidential pardon has revitalized the exchange’s prospects within the US crypto landscape. Binance’s Path To Re-Establish US Operations According to a recent Bloomberg report , Binance has been exploring options to restart operations for its American affiliate, Binance.US. This includes discussions of a recapitalization that could dilute Zhao’s majority stake, which has complicated the company’s efforts to expand in the country. At a recent Binance Blockchain Week event, Zhao expressed his commitment to transforming the US into a central hub for cryptocurrency, dubbing it “an emerging land for us.” His remarks came in the wake of a challenging period for Binance.US, which has seen its market share plummet from an impressive 35% to virtually zero since US regulatory bodies charged Zhao and the cryptocurrency exchange two years ago. Several states have also rescinded Binance’s licenses, while others, notably New York, never granted one in the first place. Supporters of the exchange believe that a forthcoming market-structure bill could establish a federal licensing regime, potentially altering the operational landscape for companies like Binance. However, Bitcoinist has continuously reported that the bill’s progress has stalled amid political divisions, casting doubt on its future. For now, the anticipated markup has been delayed until January 2026. The report suggests that if Binance were able to buy back some or all of Zhao’s holdings, it might consider new leadership and strategies to drive growth while leveraging political connections in Washington. Sources familiar with the situation emphasize a sense of urgency for the exchange to make critical decisions. Potential Partnerships With BlackRock In a separate effort to bolster its standing, the exchange is reportedly aiming for a closer partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. This relationship could involve the utilization of BlackRock’s tokenized money-market fund to support trades on Binance. Discussions regarding enhanced financial ties between the two have included the potential development of additional products and revenue-sharing opportunities. Additionally, Binance is looking to strengthen its relationship with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture co-founded by members of the Trump family. These moves appear to have taken shape following Zhao’s pardon and signify the crypto company’s desire to recalibrate its presence in a more favorable political atmosphere. To facilitate these efforts, Binance has promoted Yi He, Zhao’s partner, as a stabilizing force for the company. Over the past few months, she has assumed a prominent role, leading strategic initiatives and revitalizing Binance’s growth narrative. However, her elevation has sparked questions regarding the dynamics of power between her and Teng, the former regulator who has been instrumental in guiding the exchange’s outreach efforts. At the time of writing, BNB, the exchange’s native token, is trading at $846. This represents a major correction of 38% over the past few months, following the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $1,369.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/dark-defender-narrative-will-continue-to-shift-in-favor-of-xrp-heres-why/,"As uncertainty continues to weigh on digital asset market sentiment, crypto analyst Dark Defender has reiterated a technically grounded outlook on XRP that contrasts with growing concerns about a potential bear market. In a February analysis supported by detailed monthly chart visuals, the analyst provided a structured interpretation of XRP’s price behavior, stating that recent volatility aligns with an anticipated corrective phase rather than signaling a broader trend reversal. The commentary emphasizes long-term structural analysis over short-term price speculation, relying on an Elliott Wave framework that has guided expectations for several months. Tracking the Monthly Wave 4 Development According to Dark Defender, XRP has been progressing through a Monthly Wave 4 structure since mid-February. This corrective phase was mapped well in advance, with specific price zones identified as likely reaction points. The analyst explains that the first leg of the correction, labeled Wave A, was projected toward the $1.88 region, a level that later corresponded with XRP’s decline to approximately $1.60 in April. This move was treated as a normal retracement within a broader bullish cycle rather than a breakdown in market structure. The second phase, Wave B, unfolded as a recovery move. Dark Defender previously identified the $3.80 area as a key upside zone, and XRP’s subsequent advance toward $3.66 in July was cited as validation of that projection. From this perspective, the rally was not interpreted as the start of a new impulsive wave but as a corrective rebound consistent with Wave B characteristics on a higher timeframe. Completion of Wave C and Key Price Zone The most recent development centers on Wave C, the final leg of the Monthly Wave 4 correction. Dark Defender states that the $1.88 leve l was once again targeted, forming a defined accumulation zone between $2.2222 and $1.8815. XRP’s return to this area is described as the technical completion of the corrective structure. The analyst emphasizes that this outcome was anticipated and repeatedly communicated, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a consistent analytical framework during both advances and pullbacks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Forward Outlook Beyond the Correction With Monthly Wave 4 considered complete, Dark Defender’s analysis shifts toward the next phase of the cycle. The attached chart highlights a projected move toward the $5.85 region, derived from Fibonacci extensions and the anticipated Wave 5 advance. The analyst maintains that this outlook remains intact as long as the broader structure holds, reiterating confidence that current conditions do not support a sustained bear market scenario. The overall message underscores discipline and preparation, positioning the recent decline as a technical opportunity rather than a structural failure. Dark Defender concludes by reaffirming personal conviction in XRP’s trajectory , while noting that all views expressed are based on technical interpretation and not financial advice.

He shared a chart showing the average market path the last five times Bitcoin’s RSI broke below 30. The analyst also rejected the popular belief that Bitcoin follows a four-year cycle tied to its halving events. RSI Falling Into Oversold RSI is a momentum indicator that measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold on a scale of zero to 100. Below 30 means oversold, potentially undervalued , and may bounce up, while above 70 means overbought, potentially overvalued, and may pull back. It is calculated by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses over a period (typically 14 days). Bitcoin RSI on the weekly chart is currently just below 37, suggesting it is close to oversold territory, according to TradingView. The last time it was this low in this time frame was at the bear market bottom in December 2022, when BTC was trading at $16,500. Over the next two and a half years or so, it surged 660% to an all-time high in October this year and remains in an uptrend on the weekly time frame. A lot of people have been asking for an update on this chart, so I’ll just leave this here for anyone who needs to see it. This shows the average BTC trajectory following an oversold RSI reading, with RSI falling below 30 at t=0. So far, it’s been pretty bang on. Unless you… pic.twitter.com/FRLt5w7oFT — Julien Bittel, CFA (@BittelJulien) December 17, 2025 Bittel is also among several analysts who believe that the bull market cycle will extend into 2026. “As we’ve outlined many times, based on our work on the business cycle, the current path of financial conditions, and our expectations for overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities is that this cycle extends well into 2026.” He argued that the historical four-year pattern was actually driven by government debt refinancing cycles, not the halving, and that post-COVID fiscal policy pushed this cycle out by one year. Oversold Dips Work Higher Macroeconomic analysts at Milk Road agreed with the hypothesis. “Short-term oversold signals have to be interpreted inside the liquidity and business cycle,” they stated. They added that if conditions keep improving and money keeps flowing back into markets, “these oversold dips tend to work higher over time, even if it’s messy along the way.” “The bigger mistake is assuming every pullback now marks the start of a new bear market, when the macro setup still points to an extended cycle into 2026.” The short-term outlook isn’t so pretty with Bitcoin trading down 4.2% over the past week and hovering around $86,600 at the time of writing.

Virtual Asset Service Provider Hyperithm stands accused of launching a new DeFi financial product without submitting the mandatory risk assessment to regulators. This alleged regulatory filing oversight could have serious consequences for the company and set important precedents for the entire industry. What Exactly Did Hyperithm Allegedly Do Wrong? According to reports from NewsWay, Hyperithm launched a yield-bearing product for Bitcoin and Ethereum through Midas, an offshore Real World Asset platform, on December 17. The problem? South Korean law requires VASPs to provide authorities with a comprehensive risk assessment before introducing new services, especially those involving NFTs and DeFi protocols. Here’s what the regulations specifically demand: Advance notification of launch plans to financial authorities Submission of detailed risk assessment documents Compliance with both the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information Adherence to the Virtual Asset User Protection Act requirements Why Is This Regulatory Filing So Important? South Korea has implemented some of the world’s strictest cryptocurrency regulations following several high-profile exchange collapses and investor protection concerns. The required regulatory filing serves multiple crucial purposes: First, it helps authorities identify potential risks to consumers before products go live. Second, it ensures companies have proper safeguards in place. Third, it maintains market integrity by preventing irresponsible product launches. When companies bypass this regulatory filing process, they potentially expose investors to undisclosed risks and undermine the entire regulatory framework that protects the ecosystem. What Could This Mean for Hyperithm and the Industry? The consequences for Hyperithm could be severe if the allegations prove true. South Korean regulators have shown increasing willingness to enforce compliance through: Substantial financial penalties Suspension of business operations License revocation in extreme cases Increased scrutiny on all future products Beyond Hyperithm, this situation highlights the ongoing tension between innovative DeFi products and traditional regulatory frameworks. Many DeFi platforms operate on principles of decentralization that sometimes conflict with centralized regulatory requirements. How Can Crypto Companies Navigate Regulatory Compliance? For cryptocurrency companies operating in regulated markets, several best practices can help avoid similar situations: Engage regulators early: Don’t wait until product launch to start conversations about compliance requirements. Document everything: Maintain clear records of all regulatory communications and submissions. Seek legal expertise: Cryptocurrency regulations evolve rapidly—expert guidance is essential. Build compliance into product design: Consider regulatory requirements from the earliest development stages. The Bigger Picture: Regulation vs. Innovation This Hyperithm situation represents a classic case of the innovation-regulation dilemma. On one hand, regulators must protect consumers and maintain financial stability. On the other, excessive regulation could stifle the innovation that makes cryptocurrency valuable. The ideal solution lies in balanced approaches that protect users while allowing responsible innovation. However, achieving this balance requires clear communication, reasonable timelines, and mutual understanding between regulators and industry participants. As the cryptocurrency industry matures, incidents like the alleged Hyperithm regulatory filing omission serve as important reminders. Sustainable growth requires playing by established rules while working to improve those rules through constructive dialogue. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Compliance The Hyperithm case could become a watershed moment for cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea and beyond. How authorities respond will signal their seriousness about enforcement, while how the industry reacts will demonstrate its commitment to responsible growth. Ultimately, the future of cryptocurrency depends on finding the right balance between innovation and protection. Companies that prioritize proper regulatory filing and transparent operations will likely thrive, while those cutting corners may face increasing challenges in an increasingly regulated landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is Hyperithm accused of doing? Hyperithm is accused of launching a new DeFi yield product for Bitcoin and Ethereum without submitting the required risk assessment to South Korean regulators, as mandated by law. Why is regulatory filing important for crypto companies? Regulatory filings help protect investors by ensuring companies have identified and addressed potential risks before launching products. They also maintain market integrity and compliance with financial laws. What laws require this regulatory filing in South Korea? The Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information and the Virtual Asset User Protection Act both contain provisions requiring risk assessments before new product launches. What are the potential consequences for Hyperithm? Possible consequences include financial penalties, business operation suspensions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and in severe cases, license revocation. How does this affect other cryptocurrency companies? This case highlights the importance of regulatory compliance and may lead to increased scrutiny of all cryptocurrency companies operating in South Korea. Can DeFi products comply with traditional regulations? Yes, though it requires careful planning and sometimes creative solutions to align decentralized principles with centralized regulatory requirements.

As one of the true OGs of the privacy space, Dash is very much in the mix, backed by a decade of real-world focus on instant, low-cost, private payments. To unpack what’s driving the rally, discuss where on-chain confidentiality fits in everyday use, and forecast what’s next for the long-running Dash DAO, we broke bread with core member Joël Valenzuela. The privacy coin sector has been booming over the past few months. What do you see as the primary catalysts behind this rally, and how is Dash positioned to capitalize? Privacy in crypto is hot right now, mostly because of the relative legal clarity around privacy assets that we’ve seen develop over the past few years. People don’t want to go to prison, and when they’re confident that they won’t, they feel a lot more comfortable engaging. At the same time, uncertainty around the future of AI and governments creating a surveillance state, combined with Bitcoin’s inability to secure user privacy, have created this boom effect. Dash has safeguarded user confidentiality since day one in 2014. As we’ve expanded to focus on greater digital cash functionality like instant transactions and ease of use, we’ve remained committed to our original features, and are actively working to expand them. How does on-chain confidentiality through features like PrivateSend provide a competitive edge over transparent alternatives in everyday payments? Simply put, a complete lack of privacy is a huge liability and security issue. Companies, funds, individuals, and more don’t want their every financial move tracked, and especially in the age of $5 wrench attacks, kidnappings, and more, there could be a real safety risk associated with someone knowing your crypto wealth. Every protocol that wants to have any serious user adoption in the long run needs at least some basic built-in confidentiality features to keep outside observers from knowing who you’re transacting with or how much you have. Tyler Winklevoss recently invested $50m in Zcash, calling privacy “the precondition for freedoms.” I’m sure you agree, but what’s your take on how tools that offer fast, low-cost private transactions – dash included – contribute to that conversation? If decentralization allows us to transact permissionlessly in theory, and privacy allows us to do so in practice, fast, low-cost transactions are what extend this to everyone. When sovereign tools are expensive or difficult to use, few will use them or benefit from them, and when they do it will only be during exceptional circumstances. We believe in extending these freedoms to everyone, everywhere, for every purpose, at all times. What kind of real-world use cases or user behaviors do you think remain underexplored for privacy-oriented projects? Digital identity and data remain unexplored. We should be able to maintain sovereign access to data, access to memberships and property, transaction and communication history, and much, much more. Making this both easily accessible and private is a game changer, and is something we’re working on with our Evolution platform. Once everything a user has from a Google account can be stored and accessed just as easily in a sovereign and private way, we may finally see the beginning of a new era for privacy. Users are starting to demand both privacy and usability in a single transaction. How realistic is this right now? We can offer usability and privacy right now in transactions, though there are some trade-offs. Private transactions typically use more data and resources to use, and affect things like syncing wallet balances. It’s inherently more difficult for an open and public network to function with less information. That being said, improvements and optimizations are happening all the time. Within the next five years, an average user won’t notice a performance degradation from deciding to leverage privacy tools. Dash has been working on refining its tech for over a decade. With evolving regulations and institutional interest in privacy, what’s the biggest opportunity – and risk – for Dash in the next market cycle? Our biggest opportunity is that we finally become the breakthrough digital cash for the world. We’re well-positioned for this, with integrations in many payment processors and other tools, making it feasible to live entirely on Dash today. This will only get easier with some extra features we’re rolling out in the next few months. The biggest risk is simply that users become complacent and don’t value sovereign and decentralized solutions soon enough. If centralized stablecoins eat up too much market share for payments in the short term, that just means it’ll take longer for us to bring decentralized digital cash to the world.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s volatility has fallen below Nvidia’s as institutional products broaden its investor base, Bitwise says. The growth of spot ETFs and traditional market access is reshaping how Bitcoin trades and reducing sharp price swings. Bitwise views the calmer price action as a structural shift and expects further institutional entry in 2026. In a report released Wednesday , Bitwise said Bitcoin is likely to remain less volatile than Nvidia (NVDA) through 2026, pointing to a long-term decline in Bitcoin’s price fluctuations over the past decade. Bitwise Says Institutional Adoption Is Derisking Bitcoin The asset manager argued that Bitcoin’s growing presence in traditional financial markets is changing how it trades. “Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily declined over the past ten years,” Bitwise said, adding that the trend signals a broader “derisking” of the asset as institutional investors gain exposure through regulated products such as spot exchange-traded funds. According to Bitwise, the rise of ETFs and other traditional vehicles has expanded Bitcoin’s investor base beyond retail traders and crypto-native funds. That diversification, the firm said, has helped dampen sharp price moves that once defined the asset. The data highlights a notable contrast between Bitcoin and Nvidia this year. Bitcoin has moved 68% between its 2025 low of around $75,000 in April and its all-time high of $126,000 reached in early October. Nvidia, by comparison, has recorded a much wider 120% swing, rising from a low near $94 in early April to a peak of $207 later in the year. In 2026… … $BTC , $ETH , and $SOL will set new all-time highs, bets on @Polymarket will grow significantly, crypto equities will outperform tech stocks, and 7 other crypto predictions for 2026 by the @BitwiseInvest Research Team. Please note: As with all predictions, these are… — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 17, 2025 Despite Nvidia’s higher volatility, the chipmaker’s shares have delivered stronger returns. Nvidia is up roughly 27% year-to-date, while Bitcoin has slipped about 8% since the start of the year as crypto markets have increasingly decoupled from equities. Bitwise sees the calmer price action as a structural shift rather than a temporary phase. The firm said traditional market forces that once drove extreme crypto cycles, such as leverage-fueled speculation and sharp reactions to halving events, are losing influence. Looking ahead, Bitwise struck an optimistic tone on Bitcoin’s broader outlook. The firm expects Bitcoin to set a new all-time high and break away from the historical four-year cycle that has shaped previous bull and bear markets. It also predicts deeper institutional involvement in 2026, naming banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch as potential entrants. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Selling May Be Nearing Its End: K33 Bitcoin has seen sustained sell-side pressure from long-term holders since 2024, but that trend may be nearing exhaustion , according to a new report from research and brokerage firm K33. The firm estimates that around 1.6 million BTC, worth roughly $138 billion, has re-entered circulation over the past two years as early investors took profits. K33 head of research Vetle Lunde said the scale of these movements points to deliberate selling rather than technical factors like wallet consolidation or ETF-related transfers. The report notes that 2024 and 2025 rank among the largest years on record for long-term supply reactivation, driven not by speculation, but by direct selling into deeper institutional liquidity.

They tend to start with silent advances, emerging involvement and products start to make sense before the majority. The focus of creditors as they position themselves to invest in 2026 is on projects which remain in their early stages but already exhibit existence of genuine demand. A single alternative cryptocurrency based on Ethereum would fit that arrangement well. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been growing consistently, has not experienced sharp bursts, and set a definite direction to go live. The combination of the two is the reason why market commentators are starting to put it on the list of potential early breakout of the next crypto cycle. The Process of Demand Creation at Mutuum Finance via Lending Mutuum Finance is creating a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is constructed on two complementary systems. The former is the peer-to-contract market. Users will deposit assets in common pools and get in turn mtTokens. They are their share expressed in the form of these mtTokens which increase in value as borrowers pay interest. To illustrate, when a user invests an amount of ETH, which has a price of $5,000, they are able to increase in value over time depending on the demand of loans. The APY is automatically adjusted. Increase in the borrowing activity also increases returns. This maintains yield pegged on actual use rather than being incentive-based. The second one is peer-to-peer lending. Borrowers have the option of getting a variable rate with rates that fluctuate with usage or a fixed rate in some circumstances that provides predictable payment. Limits on loan to value make limits on how much may be borrowed against collateral thus serving to handle risk. In case collateral value is decreasing excessively, rules of liquidation are set into force. The liquidators settle off some of the debt, and purchase collateral at a discount, closeting the protocol and reinstating a balance. Growth Numbers In early 2025, Mutuum Finance began its token sale and rolled it out in an organized manner. The token was priced at $0.01 and it currently values at $0.035 in presale. That is a 250% growth. At a launch price of $0.06, Phase 1 participants are already poised to increase by up to 500% MUTM appreciation. Instead of distributing the entire supply at a single time, the project distributed 45.5% of its total token supply which is 4B at to early distribution. That equals about 1.82B tokens. Considerable uptake has been witnessed to date as over 820M tokens have been sold already even before the launch. Along with this development, capital and participation has increased. Mutuum Finance has gathered $19.4M dollars and gained more than 18,500 holders. The allocation at phase 6 is over 99% full and it indicates that access at the current price is just about exhausting. The presale demand is fast growing due to impending supply constriction. Activity within the community is also involved. The best contributor of the day will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM in terms of encouraging consistency in engagement instead of temporary interest levels. V1 Launch and Reasons Analysts are Watching The transition in valuation models may usually be determined by development milestones. As stated by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team on X, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will come with the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This release will comprise of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. The initially supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Security preparation is also proceeding in parallel. Mutuum Finance has also undergone a CertiK Token Scan and scored 90/100. Halborn Security is in the process of finalizing lending and borrowing contracts, which are being audited independently lately. Another review layer is a bug bounty of $50k that targets code vulnerabilities. It is the opinion of some analysts that such a combination is usually a prelude to a repricing phase. Under a bullish assumption, the projections indicate that MUTM could rise to a value higher than its initial launch price of $0.06 as more people and consumers start to watch it and start to use the service. These opinions are founded on form and time, rather than promises. Why the Long View Matters Mutuum finance is scaling beyond V1. The roadmap consists of a stablecoin, which is pegged to borrower interest, intended to work with the lending system. This provides a less volatile alternative to the users and helps to keep the activity active in various market scenarios. Increase in layer-2 will also be provided. Reduced costs and speed of transaction are essential in lending protocols which strive to expand user activity. Together with the strong oracle infrastructure and Chainlink data feeds, these improvements contribute to correct pricing and the liquidation security. According to market commentators, projects that are well prepared for this kind of preparation can shine in case there is a market rotation. Since investors are posing the question of what crypto to invest in today to be able to reap in the year 2026, they are more likely to invest in systems that can expand by use as opposed to exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is available at a price of $0.035. Its 250% increase to date does not show any spikes, it is more of incremental growth. As Phase 6 approaches completion and V1 gets ready, analysts think that it will be one of the first new crypto assets to get much broader traction as the next cycle starts.

Crypto Integration Rumor Ignites Gaming Buzz,https://coinpaper.com/13184/ea-sports-to-add-xrp-payments-crypto-integration-rumor-ignites-gaming-buzz,"EA Sports XRP Integration Rumors Spark Talk of True Mass Adoption A fresh rumor is gaining traction in both crypto and gaming circles as spotlighted by market analyst John Squire, suggesting that EA Sports may be exploring XRP for in-game payments. While unconfirmed, the speculation has reignited debate around true blockchain adoption, where real utility meets global scale. EA Sports is a global gaming powerhouse, with franchises like EA FC, formerly FIFA, Madden NFL, and Apex Legends reaching hundreds of millions of players. Introducing even a fraction of that audience to XRP via seamless in-game payments would deliver unprecedented real-world exposure, far beyond what most blockchain projects could ever achieve. What makes this rumor especially compelling is XRP’s purpose-built design. Engineered for fast, low-cost, and highly scalable transactions, XRP is ideally suited for microtransactions, the backbone of modern gaming economies. In-game purchases, player-to-player transfers, digital collectibles, and cross-border payments all demand speed and efficiency. Traditional payment systems often fall short, plagued by high fees, slow settlement, and regional barriers. XRP, by contrast, settles transactions in seconds at near-zero cost. If EA Sports were to explore such an integration, players would enjoy faster payments, seamless purchases, and global accessibility. And that’s the real takeaway: true mass adoption isn’t driven by speculation or hype, it happens when blockchain runs quietly in the background, delivering real utility and a frictionless user experience at scale. Well, the implications would stretch far beyond gaming. If millions of players began using XRP naturally through gameplay, digital assets could be normalized as everyday payment tools, not speculative instruments. That level of real-world utility could spark a ripple effect, motivating developers, publishers, and entertainment platforms to explore blockchain-based payment systems of their own. It’s important to note this remains a rumor, not an official announcement. Yet the enthusiasm surrounding it underscores a larger reality: true mass adoption is far more likely to emerge through global consumer platforms than niche crypto-native apps. If EA Sports ever integrated XRP, it wouldn’t just be a victory for Ripple or the crypto community, it would mark a turning point for blockchain at scale. Embedding XRP into one of the world’s largest digital ecosystems would demonstrate what true mass adoption looks like: millions of users engaging seamlessly, real-world utility driving everyday transactions, and technology that simply works in the background, exactly as John Squire suggests. Conclusion The speculation around EA Sports and a potential XRP integration points to a much bigger truth about the future of digital assets. Real adoption won’t be driven by whitepapers or price charts, but by everyday experiences where blockchain delivers obvious value. If a global gaming giant were to seamlessly embed XRP into its payment infrastructure, millions of users could engage with blockchain without friction or hype, simply because it works better. While unconfirmed, the rumor underscores how mass adoption is most likely to happen: through trusted consumer platforms, real-world utility, and seamless integration at global scale.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-18 07:32:27

The supply ratio shift indicates a change in holder behavior toward long-term retention, as opposed to retail short-term selling pressure. According to on-chain data provided by CryptoQuant analytics, the Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR), which measures the portion of all ETH held by exchange platforms, has decreased to approximately 0.137 across all exchanges. The drop marks the lowest since 2016 during the early development of the Ethereum blockchain. Across Binance, the largest crypto exchange platform by trading volume and with the highest ETH supply, the ESR has decreased to approximately 0.0325. ETH supply shift indicates diminished intent for immediate liquidation According to the ESR figures provided by CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain, there is a persistent net outflow of Ethereum tokens from exchanges to external or private wallets. The analysis by Arab Chain on CryptoQuant noted that such patterns often align with accumulation phases after a period of volatility, as markets absorb more liquidity with low selling pressure. Ethereum Exchange Supply Falls to Its Lowest Levels Since 2016 “This dynamic reflects increased trader caution and a decline in short-term selling pressure.” – By @ArabxChain pic.twitter.com/QdqLdtzYIo — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 17, 2025 Across all exchanges, the charts tracking the ESR metric show a persistent decline from mid-2024 to late 2025, fluctuating from approximately 0.165 steadily downwards to the current level of around 0.137. Meanwhile, the ETH price has also been fluctuating between $4,500 and its all-time high of $4,953.73 on August 24, 2025, to the current price of $2,830 based on CoinMarketCap data . Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, has recorded a similar pattern, starting from 0.038 in mid-2024, to the current range of 0.032-0.0325. The Ethereum token price tends to follow a similar pattern, exhibiting a positive correlation between the ETH price and ESR. Source: CryptoQuant; Binance exchange ETH supply ratio trend from mid 2024 to late 2025. The Ethereum blockchain’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism has incentivized staking, allowing users to lock tokens and earn rewards. The consensus mechanism has attracted almost 36 million ETH currently staked and requiring transfer off exchanges towards dedicated wallets or protocols. The transition in consensus mechanisms has contributed to the acceleration of the decline in supply across all exchanges. Layer 2 ecosystems, such as Base, amplify the supply shift to DEXs Risks associated with exchange failures, such as the 2022 FTX exchange collapse, have prompted the adoption of self-custody for enhanced security and control. Additionally, Layer 2 ecosystems, including Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, have also attracted liquidity, further reducing the exchange-held supply. Layer 2 ecosystems on Ethereum offer scaling solutions that facilitate cheaper and faster transactions, pulling ETH supply from centralized exchanges (CEX) to decentralized exchanges (DEX). DEXs, such as PancakeSwap and Uniswap, have all been built on these protocols to facilitate direct P2P crypto trading. According to on-chain data, approximately 67 public companies, government entities, and institutions that hold ETH as part of a reserve strategy now hold roughly 6.71 million ETH, valued at around $19.02 billion. Additionally, Ethereum-focused ETFs hold approximately 6.22 million ETH, valued at $17.63 billion. These values represent 5.55% and 5.14%, respectively, of the total ETH supply. Source: Strategic Reserve ; ETH supply across public treasuries and Ethereum ETFs. The reduction in ETH supply across exchanges and rising institutional demand have created a low-liquidity, high-demand environment, leading to a supply squeeze. According to the Arab Chain analysis on CryptoQuant, increased selling pressure may have contributed to the ETH price drop; however, continued buying pressure, particularly from institutional investors, could drive the ETH price upward in the long term.

This appointment isn’t just a headline—it’s a strategic power play that bridges the gap between traditional political power and the digital asset frontier. What does a heavyweight political figure bring to one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges? Let’s explore the implications. Why is the Coinbase Advisory Council a Game-Changer? The Coinbase advisory council serves as a critical bridge between the cryptocurrency industry and the complex world of global policy and regulation. By appointing George Osborne, Coinbase gains more than a famous name. It acquires decades of experience navigating the highest levels of international finance and diplomacy. Osborne served as the UK’s finance chief from 2010 to 2016, a period that included the aftermath of the global financial crisis. His insights are invaluable for an industry seeking clear regulatory frameworks. This council’s role is multifaceted. It provides strategic guidance on policy engagement, helps shape responsible innovation, and advocates for sensible regulations that protect consumers while fostering growth. With Osborne at the helm, the council’s voice in conversations with policymakers in the US, UK, and EU gains significant weight. What Does George Osborne Bring to the Coinbase Advisory Council? George Osborne’s resume reads like a blueprint for influencing financial policy on a global scale. His experience extends far beyond his tenure as Chancellor. Consider his current and past roles: High-Level Network: Decades of relationships with central bankers, finance ministers, and political leaders worldwide. Crisis Management: First-hand experience steering a major economy through financial uncertainty and regulatory overhaul. Media and Communication: As a former newspaper editor, he understands how to shape public and political narrative—a crucial skill for crypto. Global Perspective: His work with various international institutions provides a broad view of differing regulatory approaches. This background is precisely what the Coinbase advisory council needs. The crypto industry’s biggest challenge is no longer technology; it’s policy. Osborne’s appointment shows Coinbase is serious about winning that policy battle. How Will This Shape Crypto Regulation and Institutional Adoption? The involvement of a figure like Osborne is a clear signal to other institutions. It demonstrates that serious, established players are engaging with crypto at the highest levels. This has a ripple effect: Regulatory Clarity: Osborne can help translate industry needs into policy language that regulators understand and trust. Investor Confidence: His presence lends credibility, potentially encouraging more traditional financial institutions to explore digital assets. Strategic Foresight: The council can anticipate regulatory trends and help Coinbase adapt proactively, rather than reactively. Furthermore, this move is part of a larger trend. The Coinbase advisory council itself includes other former policymakers and regulators. This collective expertise creates a powerful advocate for frameworks that recognize crypto’s potential while addressing legitimate concerns about consumer protection and financial stability. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? This strategic hire is not without its complexities. Osborne will need to navigate several key areas: Balancing Acts: Advocating for innovation while ensuring robust consumer safeguards. Global Coordination: Crypto is borderless, but regulation is not. Harmonizing approaches across jurisdictions is a monumental task. Public Perception: Helping shift the narrative from speculation to utility and financial inclusion. However, the opportunities are transformative. A well-advised Coinbase can pioneer models for compliance, security, and transparency that become industry standards. Effective engagement through its advisory council can help shape regulations that foster innovation instead of stifling it. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto’s Future The appointment of George Osborne to lead the Coinbase advisory council is a defining moment. It moves the conversation about cryptocurrency from the fringe to the center of global finance. This is not about a single hire; it’s about the maturation of an entire industry. By leveraging high-level political and regulatory expertise, Coinbase is positioning itself—and by extension, the broader crypto ecosystem—for sustainable, long-term growth within the global financial system. The message is clear: crypto is building its future with the lessons of the past in mind. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coinbase Global Advisory Council? The Coinbase Global Advisory Council is a group of experts from politics, regulation, and finance that provides strategic advice to Coinbase on public policy, regulatory engagement, and corporate strategy. When did George Osborne join the Coinbase advisory council? George Osborne first joined the Coinbase Global Advisory Council in January 2024. His recent appointment is to the role of Chairman of that council. Why would a former politician join a crypto company? Former politicians like Osborne possess invaluable experience in governance, regulation, and international diplomacy. Crypto companies need this expertise to navigate complex legal landscapes and advocate for sensible regulations that allow the industry to grow responsibly. Does this mean crypto regulation will become stricter? Not necessarily. The goal of advisory councils like this is to engage with regulators to help shape clear and practical rules. The aim is often to create frameworks that protect consumers and ensure market integrity without crushing innovation. Experienced advisors can argue for balanced approaches. How does this benefit ordinary crypto users? Ultimately, clearer regulations and stronger institutional involvement can lead to a more stable, secure, and accessible cryptocurrency ecosystem. It can increase consumer protection, reduce fraudulent activity, and pave the way for more mainstream financial products built on crypto technology. Who else is on the Coinbase advisory council? While the full list evolves, such councils typically include former regulators, seasoned diplomats, and experts in national security and finance. Their collective experience is used to tackle the multi-faceted challenges facing the crypto industry. Found this analysis of the Coinbase advisory council’s new leadership insightful?

The analyst emphasized that issuers are currently launching a large number of products, with at least 126 filings with the U.S. SEC still pending approval. Seyffart agreed with Bitwise’s projection that many of the over 100 ETPs waiting for U.S.-listing approval might receive the green light in 2026 but may not survive until the end of the year. Additionally, those who manage to cross to 2027 may not see the end of that year. The analyst believes that the lack of demand could be the main reason for these projected mass ETP liquidations. For perspective, nearly 746 ETFs reportedly debuted in 2024, and approximately 800 new funds entered the market in the first nine months of 2025 alone, as the number of ETF launches surged. Asset flows also rose, with net YTD sales topping $1.1 trillion as of October 2025. However, closures also remained steady, with 266 funds shuttered in the first half of 2025, compared to 253 that closed during the same period in 2024, according to ETFGI data. Those numbers could rise as new products continue to struggle to acquire the necessary assets to survive. Rosenbluth agrees that many ETFs are going to close Todd Rosenbluth, the head of ETF trends research at VettaFi, is also concerned that an excessive number of ETPs are being introduced, and some of them may close. He noted that the reason why BlackRock or any other large asset manager is not closing its popular ETFs is that it has too many of them. They are pulling inventory off the shelf that is not selling to make room for products that are more likely to sell. Greg Stumm, the CEO and president of American Beacon Advisors, also emphasized that new assets may not last, despite issuers launching funds at a rapid pace. He initially believed that half of the 11 U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs would have closed by now, but noted that even the small ones are now worth over $500 million. Meanwhile, ETFGI reported a total of 622 closures in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for the highest number at 196. On the other hand, there were 179 closures in the first four months of 2025. In 2023, there were 244 ETF closures with an average age of 5.4 years and an average AUM (assets under management) of about $54 million. Several popular ETPs, including ARK 21Shares’ ARKY (ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF) and ARKC (ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF), have already been liquidated this year. These investment products ended up shutting down because they failed to attract enough inflows for sufficient AUMs. New U.S. SEC listing guideline to speed up ETF approvals The U.S. SEC introduced new listing guidelines that could speed up ETF approvals, providing issuers with a faster and clearer path to market and reducing the backlog of shutdowns. The generic listing standards were approved in late September, and they removed the need for individual 19(b) approvals for qualifying crypto ETPs. The new U.S. SEC guidelines also allow issuers to choose between requested accelerated effectiveness and automatic effectiveness under Rule 461 for faster launches. The agency approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the Arca, the Nasdaq, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, BZX Exchange. The U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins believes the new listing guidelines will reduce barriers to access crypto-related products and provide investors with more choices. James Selway, Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, added that the commission’s approval of generic listing guidelines provides investors with much-needed regulatory clarity and certainty.

Background: How the Pre-Market Ecosystem Came Into Being Panama City, 19 December, 2025 – By the end of 2022, the crypto market had clearly rolled over into a downtrend. Risk appetite faded, primary market fundraising dried up, and both deal count and total capital raised fell sharply. For many projects, this meant tighter funding, slower user growth, and more difficulty getting meaningful on-chain data. As token issuance cycles dragged out, teams started looking for ways to survive without immediately launching a token, experimenting with non-token revenue models and points-to-airdrop schemes. These structures were used to keep the lights on and, just as importantly, to maintain community engagement and key metrics. Figure 1: Web3 Industry Fundraising Overview (as of 8 Dec, 2025), Source: CryptoRank Looking back at the previous cycle, the huge airdrops from Arbitrum, Optimism, Aptos and other major projects turned “ship the product first, issue the token later” into the default playbook. Before the TGE (Token Generation Event), large numbers of users were already helping build these ecosystems through interactions, staking, trading, testing and so on. Projects, in turn, used this activity to collect behavioral data, test product-market fit and strengthen their pitch when raising in the primary market. As this approach became mainstream, user contribution and incentive design in the pre-TGE phase started to look less like pure “engagement” and more like the early stages of asset formation, paving the way for today’s pre-market trading ecosystem. At the same time, on-chain infrastructure kept maturing, issuance costs fell, and ultra-low-barrier tools such as Pump.fun lowered the bar for spinning up new tokens. The result was an explosion in token count and a constant dilution of market attention. The rise of meme coins drove the point home: in this environment, attention is often a stronger driver of price than fundamentals. For new projects, winning attention before TGE has effectively become a hard requirement. Under that pressure, a number of pre-market asset mechanisms started to emerge: Making points tradable led to the rise of OTC points platforms such as Whales Market. Yield-tokenization protocols (such as Pendle) created new financial wrappers for airdrops and yield streams. CEXs and OTC venues began offering pre-market spot trading. Some exchanges launched pre-market perpetual contracts (for example, WLFI pre-launch perps on HTX). Asset vouchers such as BuildKey provided a new way to trade token subscription rights. Taken together, these mechanisms built a market that used to exist only behind closed doors between VCs and exchanges: the “in-between layer” sitting between primary and secondary markets. That layer has gradually evolved into what many now call the 1.5-level market, or simply the Pre-Market. This is not a phenomenon unique to crypto. In mid-2024, for instance, Robinhood announced that it would offer EU users on-chain, tokenized exposure to private company equity such as OpenAI and SpaceX [1] , reflecting strong retail demand for early-stage assets. In essence, the growth of the pre-market is a restructuring of what used to be a very closed capital flow chain. As a result, pre-TGE trading is no longer a side show or a temporary gimmick. It has become a clearly defined layer of the market. Its influence goes far beyond “more ways to speculate”: it changes how projects launch, it reshapes token distribution over time, it alters the listing pathways on exchanges, and it rewrites the logic of how early liquidity is created. Against this backdrop, this report focuses on a few core questions: Is pre-market trading reshaping the way projects issue tokens? Is it changing how exchanges design their listing systems? Does the pre-market have the ingredients to become a scalable, standalone “new market”? Can users realistically achieve measurable risk–return profiles at an earlier stage? The following sections explore these questions and offer some forward-looking observations. II. Three Value-Anchoring Paths for Pre-Market Assets Assets that trade before TGE do not come in a single, neat format. They form a layered structure built from different sources, logics and settlement methods. Without some systematic classification, it becomes very hard to discuss price formation, settlement, project incentives and participant behavior within a coherent framework. Rather than slicing everything up purely by “product type”, this report groups pre-market assets into three broad categories based on how their future value is anchored. That perspective tracks more closely with how trades actually work in practice and makes it easier to understand what each type of asset is doing during the pre-market phase. Token-value-anchored assets These revolve around future token value and include pre-market OTC deals, pre-market spot and pre-market perpetual contracts. In all of these, the underlying exposure ultimately points to either the token itself or its expected price after listing. Among pre-market assets, this group has the most direct link to the future spot market. Points-anchored assets These are built around points systems, which later become the basis for airdrops. They include the points themselves, the tradability of those points, and the additional claims that appear when yields are split and mapped back to points (for example, “points-mapped yield rights”). Under today’s airdrop-driven tokenomics, this category carries user contribution, behavioral incentives and airdrop expectations, and is often the earliest expression of assetized expectations in the pre-market. Rights-anchored assets These focus on future rights and typically show up as NFTs, access passes, or BuildKey-style vouchers. They package non-standard entitlements—whitelist spots, testing slots, early access, or future token allocations—into tradable units. What they represent is not yield or token exposure directly, but a set of future redeemable rights that have been clearly assigned. Compared with a more traditional “by product” classification, this three-way split better highlights how the pre-market spans multiple chains: a token-value chain that concentrates price discovery, a points chain that drives user growth and early incentives, and a rights chain that handles distribution logic and entitlement assignment from the project’s perspective. Once this basic structure is in place, we can go a level deeper. In the next section, each category is examined in turn: how it came about, how it trades, how prices are formed, and what typical examples look like. III. Three Classic Pre-Market Trading Types and Case Studies Section II outlined a way to think about pre-market assets based on the way their future value is anchored. Building on that, this section looks at the mechanics. Starting from representative products, it breaks down: how each type of asset is generated, how the trading structure works, how prices are formed, and how risk is transmitted. Real cases are used to show how these assets behave in the wild and how “marketized” they actually are, giving a clearer view of what the pre-market looks like in the current cycle. 1. Token-Type Pre-Market Assets: Trading on Future Tokens and Future Prices Within the pre-market ecosystem, the chain centered on future token value is the most liquid, the closest to genuine price discovery, and the most directly linked to a project’s performance after listing. Based on how trades are carried out and the state of the token at the time, this category usually includes: OTC transactions, pre-market spot directed by exchanges (for example, Binance pre-market spot and Gate Pre-Token), and pre-market perpetual futures What they all have in common is that the underlying exposure ultimately points to the token or its expected post-listing price. Using different matching, margin and collateral setups, they effectively pull the future spot market forward into the pre-market window. (1) Pre-Market OTC Pre-market OTC trades behave a lot like conventional OTC deals: they are peer-to-peer transactions with a platform standing in the middle as guarantor. There are both centralized and decentralized versions. On the decentralized side, Whales.Market has become one of the main venues; on the centralized side, CEXs dominate. By late 2025, several exchanges including Bitget, MEXC and Gate had launched their own pre-market OTC offerings. Volumes tended to concentrate in large airdrop projects and hot narrative assets—for example, earlier WLFI trading and popular TON mini-game tokens. Figure 2: Market Size of the Pre-Market OTC Trading Segment, Source: Compiled from Official Platform Data, 8 Dec, 2025 The heart of this model is the collateral arrangement. Both sides must lock up some assets before an order goes live, so that settlement can actually be enforced: When a buyer submits an order, an equivalent amount of stablecoins is frozen in their account until settlement is finished. The seller must lock the future deliverable tokens or equivalent assets according to the platform’s specified collateral rate. Once an order is matched, it moves into a settlement phase. In that window, sellers must transfer the agreed tokens to buyers, and buyers must pay on time. If a seller misses the deadline, all or part of their collateral may be confiscated and paid out to the buyer. In a scenario where the token lists at a much higher price than the pre-market level, the buyer’s theoretical maximum upside is roughly 100% (before fees). The platform usually spells out key timings in advance: when pre-market trading ends, when settlement begins and when spot trading officially opens. Participants who do not have the necessary assets ready by those cut-off times risk having collateral deducted for failing to settle. In other words, buyers in pre-market spot are typically exposed to a maximum gain/loss of around 100% (ignoring fees), while sellers can use the mechanism to lock in profits ahead of listing—or, in extreme cases, choose to walk away from the contract if the economics justify a default. (2) Pre-Market Spot Trading Pre-market spot is essentially regular spot trading shifted forward in time, with a few extra guardrails such as position limits and staking requirements. At present, it is mainly seen on Binance and Gate.io. Binance – Pre-Market Spot Binance has run pre-market spot trading for at least two projects: Scroll (SCR) and Usual (USUAL). Scroll, a zkEVM rollup, was valued at around USD 1.8 billion in 2023, and 5.5% of its total token supply was allocated through Launchpool. On 11 October, at 18:00, Binance opened pre-market trading in SCR and capped individual positions at 2,500 SCR (about 5 BNB). From one hour before pre-market trading began until after it ended, deposits and internal transfers for SCR were paused. Normal deposit/transfer functions were restored only once pre-market spot closed, and withdrawals opened 24 hours after SCR went live on the Binance spot market [2] . In practical terms, aside from these limits, the trading experience was nearly indistinguishable from standard spot. During the 10-day pre-market window, first-day volume exceeded USD 40 million. After that, activity slowed materially, and most days saw volume of about USD 2 million. Figure 3: SCR Price K-Line Chart, Source: Binance, 8 Dec, 2025 The second case, USUAL, allocated 7.5% of total supply via Launchpool. Pre-market trading opened on 19 November 2024 at 18:00 (ten hours after Launchpool ended) and closed on 17 December 2024 at 17:00. Price action followed a similar pattern: an initial uptrend in price followed by weaker trading volumes. Figure 4: USUAL Price Trend K-Line Chart, Source: Binance, 8 Dec, 2025 Importantly, while Binance was running pre-market spot for these assets, other CEXs did not list spot pairs for them. In practice, Binance became the only venue where larger capital could gain spot exposure to these tokens. With a very large user base and relatively small float, pre-market pricing leaned heavily in favor of sellers, as tight supply and intense attention pushed prices higher. It is also clear that this is not a model that every exchange can copy. The product is possible only because of Binance’s dominant position and strong leverage in listing negotiations. From the price charts, users who entered via Launchpool and sold into pre-market spot had a relatively high chance of making a profit. For projects and broader communities, however, pre-market spot is not necessarily ideal: Prices can easily be bid up in a thin-float, high-attention environment, setting the stage for a “spike then fade” pattern after listing. Pre-market sets expectations early, leaving less narrative room before TGE. The mechanism tends to favor Launchpool participants and larger holders, rather than regular community users, making expectation management harder. It may be for these reasons that Binance has so far only experimented with pre-market spot on a very limited set of projects. Gate – Pre-Token Gate’s Pre-Token approach is conceptually similar but implemented differently. It is a stake-and-mint system. Users stake USDT to mint Pre-Tokens, which represent claims in pre-market trading. These Pre-Tokens cannot be deposited, withdrawn or transferred on-chain, but they can be freely traded in Gate’s spot market. Users who prefer not to mint can simply buy them from others. Before pre-market trading ends, Gate shuts down both minting and the pre-market spot market. At that point, the system takes a snapshot of all Pre-Token holders, clears out token balances and moves into settlement. For minters: they must acquire and deliver the real tokens during the settlement window. Once they have delivered successfully, the USDT they staked is returned to their spot or unified account. Failure to deliver results in a loss of the staked USDT. For traders: they can sell their Pre-Tokens before the market closes to lock in profits or hold them through to settlement. After settlement, the system distributes the real tokens delivered by minters, plus a proportional share of any collateral from minters who failed to deliver [3] . By early December 2025, Gate had supported 19 projects through Pre-Token. For most of them, the number of minters was in the hundreds. Telegram mini-game tokens have been particularly popular: for example, HMSTR attracted about 1,400 minters and more than USD 5.4 million in staked USDT, while DOGS reached nearly USD 10 million in stake from 1,331 minters [4] . Because not all tokens are always delivered in full, the undelivered portion is pooled as a default collateral pool, which the system distributes to Pre-Token holders. In practice, this often means a holder ends up with slightly fewer real tokens than the number of Pre-Tokens they held, but receives extra stablecoins as compensation. Figure 5: Gate’s Pre-Market DOGS Settlement Page, Source: Gate Gate’s design offers buyers a basic guarantee that “there will be tokens”, while giving projects and large holders a convenient way to conduct something very close to a pre-spot listing entirely within the exchange, without the friction of moving to external platforms. (3) Pre-Market Perpetual Futures Pre-market perpetuals (often called pre-launch futures) are another step along the same path: they allow users to trade a token’s price before it appears on spot markets. Instead of being anchored to live spot prices, these contracts reference a future spot price, and are traded via margin and limited leverage. HTX ’s WLFI/USDT linear perpetual was one such example. It gave users a way to position ahead of WLFI’s listing and express a view on its eventual price and liquidity. These contracts are usually listed in the days or weeks before TGE is expected to take place. Compared with more mature perpetual markets, pre-market perps rely more on expectations, available liquidity and order book depth. Funding rates often stay relatively fixed, and exchanges tend to cap leverage in the 3x–10x range to constrain risk. Figure 6: Basic Rules for WLFI Pre-Market Contracts, Source: HTX Before listing, these instruments can, in theory, provide a strong price discovery signal. In practice, however, they also come with higher information risk, liquidity risk and settlement uncertainty. Monad—a recently launched L1—is a good example. Across several platforms, MON’s pre-market perp volumes and depth did not reflect its status as a flagship L1. Relative to blue-chip perp markets on the same exchanges, and compared with its volumes after spot listing, pre-market liquidity remained thin. That “underwhelming reality” points to a ceiling on how much pre-market perps can realistically do at this stage. Figure 7: MON Trading Volume Across Selected CEXs and Decentralized Derivatives Platforms, Source: Compiled from Official Sources There have also been clear instances of manipulation. On Hyperliquid, for example, XPL–USDC perps were listed with up to 3x leverage and priced via an internal oracle with no external reference or strict open interest caps. On 26 August, a single whale market-bought around 15.2 million XPL, wiping out the order book and pushing the price from USD 0.60 to USD 1.80 in one move. Hyperliquid’s mark price followed the internal oracle up to USD 1.80, while external markets still traded at USD 0.60. The 200% gap triggered mass liquidations on the short side, with estimated losses around USD 50 million [5] . It was a sharp lesson in how fragile ill-designed pre-market derivative venues can be. Figure 8: XPL Price K-Line Chart and Abnormal Volatility, Source: Hyperliquid Official Website, 8 Dec 2025 2. Points-Type Pre-Market Assets: User Behavior Points and Their Financial Offshoots Because points are inherently quantifiable, early trading of points often started in small, closed communities with third-party escrow. As appetite grew, platforms like Whales Market began using smart contracts to hold collateral and match orders, gradually forming a standardized points OTC market. In this setup, both sides typically settle in stablecoins, and after TGE the platform distributes whatever airdrop rewards are due to buyers based on the project’s official rules. The central problem is that points do not map linearly to value. How much they’re “worth” depends heavily on the final airdrop formula. If the project uses thresholds or multiplier tiers, the points sold in a trade might not correspond one-to-one with actual rewards. For example: User A has 200,000 points and sells 50,000. The rules say: rewards start at 100,000 points; 200,000 points earn double rewards. In that case, should the buyer’s 50,000 points be treated as: below the minimum threshold (so no reward), or part of the “double” tranche that previously belonged to User A? That ambiguity makes pricing extremely difficult. Figure 9: Whales Market Points Trading Mechanism, Source: Tiger Research Pendle offers an elegant workaround. Pendle itself doesn’t airdrop tokens or directly trade points, but its yield-tokenization design—especially the YT (Yield Token)—fits naturally with other projects’ points/airdrop schemes, effectively creating a kind of “airdrop leverage”. Here’s how it works in practice: Users deposit yield-bearing assets (such as stETH, eETH, rsETH) into Pendle. These are wrapped into standardized SY (standardized yield tokens). SY is then split into: PT (Principal Token) – representing the principal, and YT (Yield Token) – representing future yield. In many newer protocols that rely on points-based airdrops—for example Ether.fi, Renzo and Karak—on-chain “yield-generating behavior” is one of the main metrics used to assign points. That means addresses holding YT are often treated as contributors, and are rewarded with points or airdrops based on how much YT they hold and for how long. In simple terms, if you hold YT: you still receive yield from the underlying asset, and you may also earn extra airdrop points thanks to that holding behavior. This turns YT into an “airdrop-qualification asset”. Many users buy YT primarily to farm airdrops rather than to harvest yield. As this setup matured, Pendle became an important hub in the pre-market asset ecosystem. It transforms previously closed “yield rights” into tradable, stackable “contribution credentials”, tying together yield, points and liquidity. Figure 10: Pendle Asset Trading Volume and Liquidity Rankings, Source: Pendle Website, 8 Dec 2025 Daily volume data illustrate this quite clearly: trading volume for airdrop-related assets on Pendle frequently exceeds USD 3 million, and in favorable conditions can climb past USD 10 million. The resilience of this liquidity comes from Pendle’s dual liquidity engines: AMM engine – When a yield-bearing SY is split into PT and YT, the AMM pool offers liquidity between PT and SY. Users can trade PT directly or obtain YT through a flash-swap mechanism, all inside a single pool [6] . Order-book engine – This layer complements the AMM by providing better depth and price granularity. Orders can be placed not only at specific prices but also at a desired implied APY, which creates a more nuanced pricing surface [7] . Deep liquidity then feeds into composability. Other protocols can build on top; PT can be traded in pools, used as collateral in lending, or integrated into structured products. Even so, the model has clear limits: It fits best with DeFi-native protocols where user contribution can be mirrored through on-chain financial flows. Many other projects have no natural way to translate “points” into DeFi positions. Regardless of multipliers or reward tiers attached to YT, the final reward still depends on each project’s own airdrop rules. Pendle can smooth the mapping, but it cannot remove the structural uncertainty inherent in points-based assets. Similar protocols have appeared, each with its own twist—RateX adds leverage, Spectra lets communities spin up their own markets, and so on. But in terms of actual usage, liquidity, and brand recognition, Pendle remains the flagship protocol in this niche. Figure 11: Fundamental Data of Yield-Trading Protocols, Source: Compiled from Official Websites and Documentation, 8 Dec 2025 3. Rights-Type Pre-Market Assets: Redeemable Entitlements, Including Future Tokens In many gaming, social and application projects, early NFTs, in-game items or access passes often play a role in airdrop allocation. In other words, these assets are not just cosmetic or functional; they carry implicit future token redemption rights. Because projects rarely define these rules cleanly at the outset, such “early credentials” usually face two recurring problems: Their non-standard nature makes them hard to price and reduces liquidity. Teams may revise the rules later—or in some cases walk back soft promises—leaving the value of these credentials uncertain. From the project’s point of view, the goal of an airdrop is not to “spread tokens evenly”, but to direct scarce resources toward users who are valuable over the long term. Traditional NFTs or one-off “task passes” aren’t very good at expressing this; they’re too coarse to distinguish between genuine contributors and opportunists, and they rarely give the market a clear, early signal of value. Aspecta addresses this by abstracting those early, messy credentials into a more standardized, tradable unit: the BuildKey. In this model, NFTs, pre-TGE passes and similar objects are wrapped into on-chain vouchers that can trade in a transparent, liquid environment. For pre-market trading, this amounts to tokenizing airdrop expectations—letting “future rights to yield” enter price discovery in advance. Aspecta’s BuildKey system is built around four core modules: Pricing & Trading Supports multiple methods—bonding curves, order books, auctions—enabling genuine on-chain price discovery early on. What used to be a hazy OTC quote becomes a verifiable, traceable price formation process. Gated Distribution & KYC Lets teams set different eligibility layers during issuance. They can segment KYC’d users, developers, KOLs and core contributors; issue publicly or via whitelists; and balance compliance requirements with the need to reward early adopters. Customized Utility Through programmable contracts, BuildKeys can carry more than just a future redemption right. They can embed governance, staking hooks, access control, or ecosystem-point functionality. That gives them intrinsic utility even before tokens exist. Shared Liquidity for Multiple Assets Allows several projects to share the same liquidity pool. This improves capital efficiency and allows a degree of cross-asset price discovery, mitigating the distortions caused by very shallow, project-specific pools. As of 8 December 2025, Aspecta had listed 29 assets. Apart from River, which amassed roughly USD 110.41 million in trading liquidity, most assets see volumes in the USD 1–3 million range—already ahead of many traditional pre-market OTC venues. In effect, BuildKeys have given rise to a standalone pre-market trading venue with a reasonably scalable asset structure [8] . Figure 12: Aspecta Asset Trading Volume, Source: Compiled from Official Website, 8 Dec 2025 They have also produced noticeable wealth effects. Sphere X has seen returns above 11,000%, while even the weakest performer, Pandatitan, posted gains above 140%. Community discussions on X and in various groups suggest that many participants now treat Aspecta as a kind of early-stage launchpad, where they rush to buy BuildKeys in initial offerings. Figure 13: Partial Dataset of Listed Assets on Aspecta, Source: Aspecta Official Website, 8 Dec 2025 Since BuildKey offerings usually disclose—in advance—the range of tokens each voucher will be redeemable for (subject to later adjustment), there is real price competition in the pre-market phase. That, however, naturally pulls in speculative flows. In summary, entitlement vouchers currently form the most broadly applicable pre-market mechanism. They work for both large and small teams, and their advantages are clear: relatively unified structure high composability improved liquidity better alignment between what projects want and what users are looking for That said, the industry has not yet converged on a single standard. Different projects define “redeemable rights” in different ways. Aspecta’s BuildKey is one promising template, but whether it becomes a shared standard is still an open question. On the business side, Aspecta charges a 2.5% trading fee on BuildKey transactions [9] , with discounts in some cases, while its pricing framework for project teams remains somewhat flexible. In effect, teams are trading underpriced token rights today for: earlier, market-based price discovery, broader and faster community reach, and stronger wealth effects around their launch. This trade-off helps explain why the model continues to draw both issuers and traders. 4. An Emerging Front: Prediction Markets in Pre-Market Trading Prediction markets are arguably the most experimental part of the current pre-market stack. Unlike voucher models (presales, BuildKeys) that focus on rights, prediction markets use event outcomes as the underlying asset. Participants bet on things like: listing dates, FDV bands, airdrop sizes, unlock schedules, and so on. They do not trade tokens or vouchers directly, but instead express views on future valuation and timing via probabilities and capital flows.That makes them particularly useful for very early-stage projects where tokenomics are still undefined and valuation is fluid. On the time axis, most of the pre-market mechanisms discussed so far appear in the mid-to-late stage of a project, often close to TGE. Prediction markets push price discovery much earlier. While the project is still in the concept or fundraising stage, events can already be created around it, and capital can begin to cluster there. Figure 14: Prediction Events on Monad’s Launch Across Polymarket and Kalshi, Source: Polymarket Analytics, 8 Dec, 2025 Platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi have already listed events tied to high-profile projects like Monad: when they’ll launch and what FDV they might achieve. Both platforms now maintain Pre-Market sections within their crypto categories, focusing on airdrop schedules, TGE timing and valuation bands. One of the most active examples on Polymarket is a market predicting Lighter’s FDV on the day after listing. As of 8 December 2025, cumulative volume in that market had reached about USD 16 million, with the probability of “FDV > USD 1 billion” around 70%, and “FDV > USD 4 billion” roughly 37% [10] . The way capital is distributed across these brackets effectively draws an early valuation curve for the project. From a project team perspective, prediction markets offer a way to collect genuine market signals without having to issue tokens or NFTs. These signals can inform: internal valuation ranges, how much liquidity to seed, and when and how aggressively to run marketing. From a user perspective, prediction markets offer a way to participate in the pre-market without holding any vouchers. Users can express a view on valuation, hedge risk, or position for a potential payoff long before tokens exist. For that reason, prediction markets can be seen as the front-most layer of pre-market trading. Their structures are light-weight, barriers to entry are relatively low, and they bring forward the moment when the market begins to “price” the project. However, they are also highly dependent on oracles and event resolution. Outcomes usually rely on third-party data or team announcements, and in some cases, the same party that creates or promotes an event has influence over its resolution. That opens the door to manipulation and sharp information asymmetries. Recent examples shared by HTX Research highlight this: In November 2025, a rumor spread on X that OpenSea would launch a token before 31 December. The probability of that outcome on Polymarket surged from under 2% to above 30%, only to crash back into single digits after the team denied the rumor. Traders who chased the move based purely on social media headlines suffered heavy losses. In another case, decisions by the Monad team—such as opening the airdrop portal and postponing TGE—directly reshaped market odds, underlining how much control teams have over the underlying events. Some prediction markets also use ambiguous rules. Terms like “launch”, the choice of reference venue for price, or how FDV is calculated can be interpreted multiple ways. Skilled traders can sometimes exploit these grey areas. MetaDAO’s prediction around Solomon’s fundraising size, for example, saw large early bets and abrupt shifts in the final outcome, sparking debate about whether some participants had an information edge. Taken together, these cases suggest that prediction markets today are not yet full-fledged “truth machines” for events. They’re closer to highly specialized betting arenas where those with better information or deeper pockets often have the upper hand. For ordinary participants, that means: carefully checking who created the event and who stands to benefit, reading the rules and resolution criteria in detail, cross-checking information across platforms, and watching on-chain wallet behavior and liquidity flows, before placing sizeable bets. Prediction markets are still valuable as a forward-looking participation channel in the pre-market, but the reliability of their signals will depend on more transparent oracles and gradually more robust governance [11] . IV. Can the Pre-Market Ecosystem Scale? 1. How Big Can It Get? At this point, pre-market trading is no longer a niche corner of the crypto market. It is evolving into a stable and fast-growing segment. Current data indicate that the largest volumes come from three main areas: pre-market perpetual contracts, pre-market spot markets (especially on Binance), and yield-trading protocols that are tightly tied to airdrops (such as Pendle). The most flexible and broadly applicable mechanism remains pre-market OTC, while Aspecta’s rights-voucher model has already exceeded many traditional OTC platforms in both trading volume and wealth effects, making it a new center of growth. Figure 15: Overview of Pre-Market Trading Ecosystem Data, Source: Compiled from Official Websites and Multiple Channels, 16 Nov 2025 According to RootData, between 1 January 2023 and 8 December 2025 there were: 1,351 fundraising rounds of at least USD 3 million for projects that had not yet issued tokens, of which 540 were deals of at least USD 10 million. After removing repeat rounds, there are still hundreds of medium-to-large projects and several dozen true “flagships” (such as Monad) waiting to launch [12] . If we combine those figures with the trading behavior we see in representative names, a big project can easily generate around USD 100 million in pre-market trading. For the very top tier, such as WLFI or Monad, total pre-market turnover can exceed USD 1 billion. In other words, the pre-market has already become a multi-billion-dollar market in its own right, with clear room to expand. Whether it can grow into the tens or hundreds of billions depends less on the number of projects and more on how far it can go along the path of institutionalization and standardization. 2. What Makes Scaling Difficult? Project count alone does not determine how far the pre-market can grow. To move from a few billion dollars in activity to a much larger, durable market, the ecosystem needs to address a more fundamental question: Does the existing pre-market model have enough capacity to bear risk? Looking back across the cases discussed, we find that nearly all pre-market trading structures concentrate risk in two main areas: Market structure risk, and Settlement and information asymmetry. Each of these affects users, project teams, platforms (CEXs, OTC desks, protocols) and market makers in different ways. Type 1: Market Structure Risk By design, pre-market venues tend to have: thinner liquidity, shallower order books, fewer mature market makers, and less robust, multi-source pricing. Prices therefore lean heavily on expectations, not on a well-balanced supply–demand equilibrium. A single large order can move the market, making large swings, slippage spikes and outright manipulation more likely. The Hyperliquid XPL event—where a single whale trade blew the order book out and triggered mass liquidations—is a textbook case. Implications: For users – It becomes harder to judge what a “fair” price is. In violent moves, users can be stopped out or forced to add margin at very unfavorable levels. For project teams – Extreme pricing distorts expectations, can provoke community backlash, and may damage how the project is perceived once it lists. For platforms – Sharp volatility amplifies the strain on risk engines, funding mechanisms and reputational capital. For market makers – Shallow depth and noisy information make it hard to run stable strategies; capital requirements and risk are higher than on established spot or perp markets. Type 2: Settlement Risk and Information Asymmetry The eventual realization of pre-market assets rests, almost entirely, on project teams. Parameters like TGE timing, first-day circulating supply, airdrop rules and distribution pace are often not fully locked in—and may change. Implications: For users – Points, vouchers or pre-market positions that looked promising can suddenly lose value if rules are tweaked, deadlines moved or mechanics rewritten. For project teams – Changing the rules or dragging out settlement can rapidly erode trust, complicate listing negotiations and weaken long-term community cohesion. For platforms – Any default, delay or abrupt rule change by a project is immediately externalized onto the platform. Exchanges or protocols must deal with compensation, PR, risk management and user expectations. For market makers – Because teams hold privileged information about institutional allocations, market-making deals and circulating supply, market makers can be blindsided by sudden changes that alter their risk exposure. It’s also clear that no single actor can fix this—for example, a CEX can’t solve it alone, nor can any one project or user cohort. For pre-market trading to become truly institutional, the industry needs some form of shared governance framework in the pre-issuance phase. In the context of Web3, that is not easy. Openness and pseudonymity give project teams a lot of freedom, and without stronger norms or incentives, soft rugs and last-minute rule changes are likely to persist. Information asymmetry is almost baked into the system. This is why pre-market risk is, at its core, a governance and incentive problem, not just a technical one. Project teams have little natural incentive to accept strict constraints, platforms lack unified standards, and users typically sit at a disadvantage in terms of information. Even so, as pre-market trading continues to move in a more professional direction, a basic consensus is emerging: only when projects, exchanges, on-chain infra providers and market makers work together to establish: clear, verifiable disclosure standards, traceable pricing mechanisms, and enforceable settlement rules can the pre-market evolve from a “black box of trust” into something more structurally transparent. It is a difficult transition, but in the long run, strong economic incentives make it hard to avoid. V. Outlook and Conclusion With funding tougher to secure, TGE timelines stretching out and points-based operations turning into standard practice, the pre-issuance phase is fast becoming a central battleground for project teams, users, and trading platforms. The expansion of the pre-market ecosystem can be read as the overlap of three forces in the same time window: Projects want to raise earlier and build a user base before launch. Users want to lock in upside or manage risk earlier. Platforms and market makers want new entry points for liquidity and price discovery. From a structural angle, the pre-market is evolving along three visible lines: Liquidity and price discovery are shifting earlier in time. For hot projects, pre-market trading volumes, position structures and price gaps are already strong enough to influence first-day performance. In many cases, pre-market prices now function as a de facto opening level, while listing has become primarily a liquidity event. Pre-market assets are becoming more layered and systematized. Products tied to future token value (OTC, pre-market spot, pre-market perps) concentrate price discovery. Points trading and yield-splitting systems carry user incentives and help filter contributions. Voucherized entitlements convert whitelists, allocations and access rights into tradable claims. Collectively, these three paths create a front-loaded market structure that covers: · value validation, · participation stratification, · expectation management, and · early liquidity anchoring. The function of exchanges is being rewritten. Pre-market activity gradually externalizes what used to be the exclusive domain of CEXs—first price, first liquidity, first access—onto on-chain venues, OTC markets and derivative platforms. For exchanges that adapt, this is less a loss of power and more an opportunity to extend their value chain forward into the pre-issuance stage, rather than just competing at listing. Returning to the four guiding questions from the beginning, we can now offer a more concrete set of answers: 1) Is pre-market trading reshaping how projects issue tokens? Answer: Yes—structurally, and likely irreversibly. With funding under pressure, points-based operation becoming the norm and TGE cycles lengthening, projects are moving from a model of “launch token, then start building” to one that looks more like: incentivize → price → issue Pre-market trading lets teams complete user screening, market-based pricing and liquidity warm-up before TGE. Issuance is no longer a single moment but part of a staged process. Launch paths are evolving from one-step issuance into a phased “points → pre-market → TGE” structure. 2) Is pre-market trading changing how exchanges design their listing systems? Answer: Yes—but more by extending them than by replacing them. Pre-market mechanisms do erode exchanges’ exclusive grip on initial price discovery. At the same time, they create space for exchanges to move into earlier stages—the points phase, the voucher phase and the pre-market itself. For CEXs that choose to participate, the pre-market is not simply a threat. It is a way to build a longer value chain, spanning: early user engagement, pre-market matching and risk management, and final settlement and listing. Listing starts to look less like the birth of liquidity and more like a node where prior expectations are crystallized. 3) Does the pre-market have the ingredients to become a scalable “new market”? Answer: The basic shape is there; whether it breaks the scale ceiling depends on institutionalization. Structurally, the pre-market has already moved beyond a single product category: one chain around token expectations, one around assetized points, and one around voucherized rights. Data show that major projects can generate USD 100 million to 1 billion in pre-market trading individually. With hundreds of projects yet to issue, the pre-market is already a stable multi-billion-dollar market. Breaking through into a much larger, durable segment will hinge on building a cross-entity trust framework that can support higher levels of risk. 4) Can users achieve measurable risk–return profiles at earlier stages? Answer: They can—but only if they understand the specific risks of each pre-market product and their own tolerance. Pre-market perps, OTC deals, yield-tokenization (PT/YT) and BuildKey vouchers all allow users to take explicit positions before TGE. Through: price differentials, yield rights, and redemption rights, users can construct quantifiable early exposures rather than relying on vague promises or lottery-style airdrops. This is a big step forward from earlier cycles, where participation before TGE was mostly about interactions or “points farming” with uncertain payoff. Of course, the trade-off is that users must also bear: market structure risk, counterparty and settlement risk, and information asymmetry. Those who understand these trade-offs, size positions carefully and choose venues with stronger governance are better placed to benefit from the shift. Final Thoughts The pre-market is not just another speculative gimmick that will vanish with the next cycle. It is shaping up to be a foundational layer of the Web3 market structure—sitting between primary and secondary, and increasingly integrated into both. It is: reshaping how projects think about launching and distributing tokens, pushing exchanges to rethink their product stacks and timelines, and giving users new ways to participate, for better or worse, earlier in the lifecycle. As standards mature and more robust governance is put in place, it is reasonable to expect the pre-market to evolve from today’s patchwork of platforms and products into a more cohesive, institutionalized “Pre-market” that will be a fixture of the next crypto cycle rather than a footnote.

Megatrends In Crypto? Bitwise begins by asserting that Bitcoin is poised to break free from its traditional four-year price cycle, setting the stage for new records. Several factors contribute to this bullish forecast. The dynamics of past cycles, including the Bitcoin Halving, interest rate fluctuations, and market booms and busts fueled by leverage, are expected to be less impactful in the coming years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis Notably, the entry of large institutions like Citi, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Merrill Lynch into the crypto space is anticipated to accelerate institutional allocations toward spot ETFs and enhance on-chain developments by 2026. As a result, Bitcoin is projected to become less volatile, even indicating that it has demonstrated lower volatility than tech giant Nvidia throughout 2025. The report also expresses strong optimism for Ethereum and Solana, particularly contingent upon the passing of the CLARITY Act. Bitwise believes that the growth of stablecoins and tokenization represents significant “megatrends,” with both Ethereum and Solana positioned to be the primary beneficiaries of this trend. ETFs To Acquire New Market Supply Institutional demand is forecasted to surge, with ETFs expected to acquire more than 100% of the new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By 2026, Bitwise expects that most institutional investors will have access to crypto ETFs. As Bitwise projects the new supply hitting the market, estimates indicate roughly 166,000 Bitcoin valued at $15.3 billion, 960,000 Ethereum around $3.0 billion, and 23 million Solana coins amounting to $3.2 billion. However, the firm anticipates that ETFs will likely purchase even more than these figures suggest. The report further highlights that crypto equities are expected to outperform traditional tech stocks. While tech shares have surged by 140% over the past three years, crypto equities have significantly outpaced them. The Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, which tracks companies providing crucial infrastructure and services for crypto assets, has rocketed by 585% during the same time frame. Bitwise believes this momentum will persist into 2026, driven by potential revenue growth, mergers and acquisitions, and a favorable regulatory landscape. Stablecoins As Scapegoats For Economic Woes As stablecoins gain traction, Bitwise cautions that they may become scapegoats for destabilizing emerging market currencies. Currently valued at nearly $300 billion, the market for stablecoins, which include tokenized versions of the US dollar like USDT and USDC, is predicted to reach $500 billion by the end of 2026. With this rise, it’s anticipated that one or two countries may blame stablecoins for their financial troubles, despite the reality that people would not turn to stablecoins if their local currencies were stable.

This regulatory clarity sets the stage for what Bitwise dubs “ETF-palooza” in 2026. Lastly, the firm predicts that half of Ivy League endowments will likely invest in cryptocurrencies, and that on-chain vault assets under management will double in the coming years. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,165, having recorded major losses of 2% and almost 7% over the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. Currently, the leading crypto is trading 31.8% below its all-time high of $126,000.

According to Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer at Arca, this is precisely the situation with Bitcoin investment today. While decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenization transform finance, Wall Street maintains a surprisingly narrow focus. Why Is Bitcoin Investment Wall Street’s Sole Crypto Focus? Jeff Dorman identifies a significant disconnect in how traditional finance views blockchain technology. He notes that Wall Street and fintech firms actively participate in issuing new digital assets like stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. However, they treat these as fee-generating products rather than investment opportunities. The actual Bitcoin investment conversation dominates institutional discussions, leaving other blockchain sectors virtually ignored. This creates a curious paradox. Financial giants build infrastructure for a broader crypto ecosystem while their capital remains concentrated in one asset. Dorman explains that large banks and institutional investors aren’t even asking which other tokens might hold value. Research and investment solicitation for assets beyond Bitcoin barely exist in traditional finance circles. What Growth Sectors Are Institutions Missing? While institutions maintain their Bitcoin investment focus, several blockchain sectors demonstrate remarkable expansion: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Protocols enabling lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: Converting physical assets like real estate and commodities into digital tokens Stablecoin Ecosystems: Dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies facilitating global payments and settlements These sectors aren’t just theoretical concepts. They’re experiencing what Dorman calls “explosive growth” with real adoption metrics and revenue generation. Yet institutional capital remains largely absent from direct investment in these areas. How Does This Focus Impact Crypto Markets? The institutional Bitcoin investment concentration creates several market dynamics. First, it means Bitcoin receives disproportionate attention and capital compared to other crypto assets. This can lead to valuation disparities where Bitcoin’s market dominance doesn’t necessarily reflect relative utility or growth potential. Second, it creates opportunity for early investors in other blockchain sectors. While institutions focus solely on Bitcoin, savvy investors can potentially identify value in overlooked areas of the crypto ecosystem. However, this also means these sectors develop with less institutional oversight and potentially greater volatility. What Could Change Wall Street’s Perspective? Several developments might broaden institutional Bitcoin investment focus: Regulatory clarity for non-Bitcoin crypto assets Demonstrable returns from DeFi and tokenization investments Mainstream adoption forcing institutions to engage with broader crypto ecosystems Educational initiatives highlighting diversification benefits within blockchain Dorman suggests that currently, institutions view Bitcoin as a “safe” crypto exposure while considering other blockchain investments too complex or risky. This mindset may shift as these technologies mature and demonstrate sustained value creation. Conclusion: Beyond the Bitcoin Investment Mindset The Arca CIO’s observations reveal a crucial inflection point for cryptocurrency adoption. While Bitcoin serves as a gateway for institutional crypto exposure, it represents just one facet of blockchain’s transformative potential. The growing disconnect between Bitcoin-focused investment strategies and the broader industry’s development suggests either a massive oversight or a timing discrepancy in institutional adoption. As DeFi, tokenization, and stablecoins continue their explosive growth, pressure may build for Wall Street to expand its crypto perspective. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin has investment merit, but whether institutions can afford to ignore the rest of the blockchain revolution while focusing exclusively on one digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions Why do institutions focus only on Bitcoin investment? Institutions view Bitcoin as a simpler, more established crypto asset with clearer regulatory treatment. They often consider other blockchain investments too complex or risky for their current frameworks. What sectors are growing despite being ignored by Wall Street? Decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset tokenization, and stablecoin ecosystems are experiencing explosive growth with minimal institutional investment participation. How does this Bitcoin investment focus affect crypto markets? It creates valuation disparities and opportunity for early investors in overlooked sectors. Bitcoin receives disproportionate capital while other innovations develop with less institutional oversight. Could Wall Street’s perspective change? Yes, regulatory clarity, demonstrated returns from other blockchain sectors, and mainstream adoption could broaden institutional investment beyond Bitcoin. What should investors consider given this situation? Investors might benefit from researching blockchain sectors beyond Bitcoin while recognizing that institutional focus could shift, potentially affecting valuations across the crypto ecosystem. Is Bitcoin still a good investment despite this narrow focus? Bitcoin remains a significant crypto asset, but investors should understand that institutional concentration creates both stability and potential blind spots regarding broader blockchain innovation.

A car accident can have both immediate and far-reaching consequences. It can bring physical injuries, mental and emotional stress, loss of finances, and complications in insurance and legal matters. While seeking medical attention and reporting to the police are the first steps in the first few hours following an accident, the following process involves contacting your insurance provider to determine the best course of action to obtain help and justice. Between enormous paperwork and phone calls, it is common for most claimants to make mistakes that turn out to be grave in the long run. Here’s how to deal with your insurance provider smartly and get the most out of your claim. Report the Accident Promptly Understandably, you need some time to get out of the confusion and anxiety an accident leaves you with. However, it is also crucial to report the accident promptly and accurately. The longer you delay, the greater the risk to your claim will be. Also, ensure that you stick to the basic facts as accurately as possible. These are the when, where, and how of the accident. Avoid disclosing unnecessary details, as this can lead to disputes about who is at fault. Do Not Rush into Recording a Statement Know for sure that the insurance adjusters will ask you to record your statement. While this is not wrong and might be a part of their routine task, a recording done in haste or when you are not mentally stable can be turned against you. It can be used to minimize your claim. Remember that you can politely decline to record the statement until you understand the situation fully or have one of the best car accident attorneys San Diego to defend your claim. Record Every Detail There is no doubt that the insurance providers are there to help you out. However, it is also your responsibility to ensure that the details of every interaction are accurately recorded. Note things like the dates and times of calls and emails, the names of the insurance adjusters you speak with, and even copies of letters, repair estimates, and medical bills. This paper trail will help you as well as your lawyer in strengthening your claim, especially when there is a dispute. Do Not Settle Too Quickly Claiming insurance, legal processes, and the trauma of an accident can make you feel tired. In such a situation, you might just feel like closing the deal with whatever early settlements you are offered. But, often, these will not be enough to cover your medical expenses, car repair costs, loss of pay, and most importantly, emotional distress. Having professionals from agencies like the hhjtrialattorneys.com will help you stay calm and not settle for anything less. Last but not least, protect your peace of mind when you get into this process with the insurance providers. The calmer you are, the higher your potential to deal with the crisis and come out victorious. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As many as 400,000 mining machines have already gone offline, causing a slump in hashrates. Bitcoin is going down because selling pressure is stronger and coming from deeper sources, said analyst Bull Theory on Wednesday. “One major reason is China’s mining crackdown coming back into focus,” they added . Network hashrate has dropped by around 8%, which is a large move considering that China still controls roughly 14% of global hash power, they observed. Asian Whales Selling BTC The analyst added that Asian OG holders likely began selling weeks ago in anticipation of renewed restrictions, and on-chain data confirms increased long-term holder selling over the past couple of months. There has also been a miner capitulation as closed mining farms must sell BTC reserves and equipment to cover their losses. Additionally, Asian exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX show consistent net spot selling through Q4, while US exchanges such as Coinbase show continued net buying, they added. “This is not panic selling. This is supply changing hands. And price usually stays weak until that pressure is gone.” WHY IS BITCOIN STILL DUMPING WHILE INSTITUTIONS ARE MAKING BILLION DOLLAR BUYS? Bitcoin is not going down because fundamentals are weak. It is going down because selling pressure is stronger and coming from deeper sources. One major reason is China’s mining crackdown coming… pic.twitter.com/QBAG8PKAKh — Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio) December 17, 2025 Bitcoin’s hashrate has dropped 10% from around 1,160 EH/s in October to ~1,045 EH/s in December, marking three consecutive negative difficulty adjustments, reported Luxor on Wednesday. They noted that the trend was driven by three factors: “Declining Bitcoin prices pushing legacy hardware into negative margins, regional enforcement actions removing capacity from major mining regions, and rising winter energy costs triggering seasonal curtailment across North America.” This decline in hashrate is driven by a convergence of price compression, seasonal energy costs, and targeted regulatory pressure, which are all squeezing marginal miners simultaneously. Additionally, hashprice, which quantifies the amount a miner can expect to earn from a specific quantity of hashrate, is at an all-time low of $0.036 per terahash per second per day, according to Luxor. Diminishing returns and increasing costs put more pressure on miners to sell. BTC Continues to Fall Bitcoin is bearing the brunt of this hashrate slump as it continues to weaken. Aside from another manipulated pump-and-dump by derivatives degens, the asset is down on the day, having failed to reclaim $87,000. It was trading at $86,560 at the time of writing, at the lower bounds of its range-bound channel that formed in late November.
