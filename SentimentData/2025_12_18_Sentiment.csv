This pivotal approval from India’s Competition Commission (CCI) signals a major step forward for institutional crypto adoption in one of the world’s most crucial markets. But what does this strategic Coinbase stake in CoinDCX truly mean for the future of digital assets in India? Let’s dive into the details. What Does the Coinbase and CoinDCX Partnership Entail? First, it’s crucial to clarify the nature of this deal. Reports initially swirled about a potential full acquisition. However, both companies have firmly denied these claims. The reality is a strategic equity investment—a Coinbase stake in CoinDCX . This distinction is important. It represents a partnership rather than a takeover, allowing CoinDCX to leverage Coinbase’s global expertise while maintaining its operational independence and deep understanding of the local Indian market. The approval from the CCI was the final regulatory hurdle. This body ensures fair competition and prevents monopolies. Its clearance confirms that this partnership is viewed as beneficial for market health and consumer choice, not a threat to it. Why is This Approval a Game-Changer for India’s Crypto Scene? India represents a massive, tech-savvy population with immense potential for cryptocurrency adoption. However, the regulatory environment has been complex. This move by a giant like Coinbase, following proper channels, adds a layer of legitimacy and confidence to the entire ecosystem. The benefits of this Coinbase stake in CoinDCX are multifaceted: Enhanced Liquidity and Access: Collaboration could lead to better liquidity pools and more trading pairs for Indian users. Advanced Security Protocols: Coinbase’s renowned security infrastructure can help bolster safety standards locally. Product Innovation: Expect to see more sophisticated trading tools and investment products tailored for Indian investors. Regulatory Dialogue: This partnership strengthens the voice of the industry in ongoing discussions with Indian policymakers. Coinbase’s Direct Plans: Rupee On-Ramps by 2026 Parallel to this investment, Coinbase has resumed new user registrations in India through its own app. More importantly, the company has announced plans to support direct cryptocurrency purchases using the Indian Rupee (INR) starting in 2026. This is a critical development. Currently, many Indian users face hurdles converting local currency into crypto. Direct INR support would simplify the onboarding process dramatically, removing a significant barrier to entry. It shows Coinbase’s dual-track strategy: investing in a local champion (CoinDCX) while also preparing its own direct service offering for the future. Navigating Challenges and Future Outlook Despite the optimism, challenges remain. India’s tax treatment of crypto assets is still a point of discussion for the broader community. Furthermore, educating a vast new user base and ensuring robust consumer protection will be ongoing priorities for both exchanges. However, the final approval for a Coinbase stake in CoinDCX is undeniably a watershed moment. It demonstrates that major global players see long-term value in the Indian market and are willing to engage with its regulatory framework. This vote of confidence can accelerate institutional interest and pave the way for more structured growth. Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point The final nod for Coinbase’s strategic stake in CoinDCX is more than just a business transaction. It’s a powerful signal of maturation for India’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. This partnership blends global scale with local expertise, aiming to build a more secure, accessible, and innovative digital asset environment for millions of users. As Coinbase also lays the groundwork for direct rupee transactions, the period leading to 2026 is poised to be a transformative chapter for crypto in India. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did Coinbase fully acquire CoinDCX? A: No. Both companies have denied reports of a full acquisition. The deal is a strategic equity investment, meaning Coinbase has taken a significant stake in CoinDCX as a partner and investor. Q2: What does CCI approval mean? A: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) ensures fair market competition. Its final approval means the regulatory body does not see this partnership as creating a monopoly or harming consumer choice, clearing the last major hurdle for the deal. Q3: Can I use Coinbase in India now? A: Coinbase has resumed new user registrations in India through its app. However, full support for direct deposits and purchases in Indian Rupees (INR) is planned for 2026. Q4: How will this partnership benefit Indian crypto users? A: Users can expect potential benefits like enhanced platform security, greater liquidity, more trading options, and innovative products developed from the combined expertise of both exchanges. Q5: Does this make cryptocurrency legal in India? A: Cryptocurrency is not illegal in India, but it exists in a regulatory gray area with specific tax implications. This high-profile, approved investment is a positive step toward greater regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance. Q6: What is the strategic importance of this stake? A: The Coinbase stake in CoinDCX allows Coinbase to tap into the Indian market through a trusted local leader while providing CoinDCX with global resources, creating a powerful synergy.

Related Reading: Here Are The Meme Coins With Over 100% Rallies While Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Struggle After more than a year trading within a broad range, recent price action suggests that the long-standing balance between buyers and sellers is under strain. At the same time, macroeconomic uncertainty and technical upgrades are reshaping how investors assess risk around the asset. SOL has spent much of 2024 and 2025 oscillating between major support and resistance zones, but recent attempts to rebound have been increasingly shallow. Price is now hovering just above key demand areas, with traders closely watching whether these levels can continue to absorb selling pressure. Solana Price Near Key Support as Bearish Signals Build From a technical perspective, Solana has slipped toward the lower end of its multi-month range, from $145 to $120. Momentum indicators remain weak, with relative strength measures remaining below neutral levels and trend indicators indicating continued downside pressure. Repeated failures to reclaim former support zones have shifted attention to the $120–$125 area, which has acted as a floor several times in recent months. A decisive break below this band could expose SOL to a move toward the $100 region, where historical demand clusters sit. Some analysts warn that if selling accelerates and liquidity thins, the price could overshoot that level before stabilizing. Others note that volume has declined alongside price, suggesting hesitation rather than panic, which leaves room for a short-term bounce if buyers step in. Macro Signals Add to Uncertainty Broader economic conditions are adding another layer of complexity. Rising U.S. unemployment and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts have kept markets divided. Lower rates have historically supported crypto assets by improving liquidity, but mixed signals from policymakers have limited risk appetite so far. For Solana, this means macro optimism has yet to translate into sustained inflows. Traders appear reluctant to commit heavily until there is clearer guidance from the Fed. A dovish shift could support a relief rally, while a pause in easing may reinforce downside risks and keep SOL pinned near current levels. Network Resilience Meets Long-Term Transition While price struggles, Solana’s network continues to evolve. The blockchain recently withstood one of the largest DDoS attacks recorded, maintaining transaction speeds with minimal disruption. Separately, the Solana Foundation has begun testing post-quantum cryptographic signatures, signaling preparation for long-term security challenges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculative Activity Cooling Fast: IFP Shows Steep Slide These developments underline improving infrastructure resilience, but they have not yet offset near-term market pressure. For now, SOL’s outlook hinges on whether buyers can defend key support as macro conditions and technical signals converge. A clear break or rebound near $100 is likely to define sentiment into early 2026.

Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/best-xrp-buy-zone-analyst-key-levels/,"Will Taylor, founder of CryptoinsightUK, frames XRP’s “best buy area” as a risk-to-reward question, not a certainty call. In his latest YouTube video from Dec. 17, he argues that XRP is trading back in the lower portion of a well-defined range, which is typically where entries make the most sense for range traders—because invalidation levels are clearer and upside targets are structurally defined. “We’re at the bottom of the range this area, the bottom of the range, and the bottom of the range has been quite wide,” Taylor said. “So, I’d say between like $2.01, then all the way down to about $1.60. This has been the best area to enter […] for the last […] basically year and a bit.” And his emphasis is that it’s attractive because the trade is measurable, not because it’s guaranteed. “Does this mean we can’t break down further? Does this mean we can’t lose support? No, that’s not what I’m saying at all,” he added. “But what I am saying is if you use range trading, if you want to know the best areas for risk-to-reward, we’re at them now.” Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M On lower timeframes, Taylor said XRP has already swept much of the downside liquidity, leaving a smaller pocket below that could still get tagged. He pointed to ~$1.83 as the remaining area of interest. “XRP has taken most of this red liquidity to the downside. There’s a small pocket of liquidity below us still at $1.83,” he said. And crucially, that level is not academic for him — it’s tied to his own stop placement and whether the market is likely to wick lower before any sustained move up. “This is something that I’m considering […] as to whether to move my stop loss below this liquidity down at like say $1.79,” Taylor said. “My stop loss [is] $1.834 at the minute. Do I take it to say like $1.79 […] give us […] the bottom of this wick as potential support and that liquidity. That’s a potential discussion.” The Upside Trigger For XRP Taylor’s near-term bullish trigger is a reclaim of ~$2.07. His reasoning is positioning-driven: he thinks the market has built a meaningful amount of short exposure during the drawdown, and a move back above that level could force covering. Related Reading: XRP Falls Below $2 As $721 Million Profit-Take Hits Market “When you start to get a buildup of […] lower highs like this, all it takes is a bit of momentum to break us above,” he said. “So, say for XRP, if we start to get back above $2.07, you probably should see price squeeze to $2.58-$2.60 quite quickly […] as we squeeze out all of this […] open interest that’s been adding in as price has been coming down.” Taylor’s XRP view is nested inside a broader “crypto is mispriced” thesis. When comparing crypto’s market cap performance against a basket of traditional assets, he argues that crypto has decoupled sharply since the Oct. 10 crash, while sentiment has deteriorated. “Crypto has like decoupled from every other asset class […] crypto is about the only asset that has decoupled this hard,” he said. “I personally believe this is a deep value zone […] we’re clearly mispriced versus other assets.” He also repeatedly leaned on the idea that positioning is skewed: rising open interest into downside, negative premium, and funding flipping between positive and negative — conditions that can set up a squeeze if price starts reclaiming levels. “I think a lot of the market generally is setting up for a bit of a short squeeze to the upside,” Taylor said. “And I think that people are overly negative and […] the sentiment’s overly bearish compared to where the price is.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.92.

This critical action comes as a direct response to an emergency network upgrade, following a concerning halt in block production. For traders holding assets like POL and GMT, this news is a pivotal development that requires immediate understanding. Why Did Upbit Suspend the Polygon Network? The core reason behind this suspension is an urgent technical issue. The Polygon network itself initiated an emergency upgrade after its block production unexpectedly stopped. When a blockchain halts block production, new transactions cannot be confirmed or added to the ledger. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must proactively suspend related services to protect user funds and prevent transactions from being lost or stuck in limbo during the network instability. This is a standard security protocol in the cryptocurrency industry. However, it highlights the inherent challenges of operating within decentralized ecosystems where third-party network performance directly impacts exchange operations. The suspension is a precaution, not necessarily an indication of a problem with Upbit’s own platform. Which Assets Are Affected by This Suspension? The temporary halt specifically impacts any digital asset that utilizes the Polygon network for transfers on Upbit. The exchange has named two major tokens in its announcement: POL (Polygon Ecosystem Token): The native token of the revamped Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. GMT (STEPN): The governance token of the move-to-earn fitness application. It is crucial for users to note that trading of these assets may still be available on Upbit’s internal order books. The suspension applies only to moving tokens on or off the exchange via the Polygon network. Always check the official Upbit announcement page for the most current and complete list of affected assets. What Should Upbit Users Do Now? If you are an Upbit user, do not panic. This is a temporary, protective measure. Here are your actionable steps: Do Not Initiate Deposits: Any attempt to deposit POL, GMT, or other Polygon-based assets to your Upbit wallet during the suspension will likely fail or be significantly delayed. Withdrawals Are On Hold: You cannot withdraw these assets to an external Polygon wallet until Upbit resumes services. Monitor Official Channels: For updates, rely solely on official Upbit announcements via their website or verified social media. Avoid speculation from unverified sources. Consider the Network: Remember, this is a Polygon network issue. Other exchanges may implement similar suspensions, so check the status if you plan to use other platforms. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? While disruptive for direct users, this event serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnected nature of cryptocurrency infrastructure. An issue on a major Layer-2 network like Polygon can ripple through to top-tier exchanges, affecting liquidity and user activity. It underscores the importance of: Network Reliability: The need for robust, fault-tolerant blockchain systems. Exchange Risk Management: How leading exchanges like Upbit implement safeguards. User Education: The critical need for traders to understand the underlying technology of their assets. Historically, such suspensions are resolved within hours or a few days once the underlying network is stable and the exchange has completed its safety checks. Conclusion: A Temporary Hiccup in a Maturing Ecosystem The decision by Upbit to suspend Polygon network services is a prudent and expected response to unforeseen blockchain turbulence. It prioritizes the security of user assets above all else. For the crypto community, it’s a moment to reflect on the growing pains of a rapidly evolving industry. As networks and exchanges coordinate to resolve these issues, the overall system demonstrates its resilience. The key takeaway is that such events, while inconvenient, are part of the process that leads to more robust and reliable infrastructure for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade POL and GMT on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Possibly. The suspension is for deposits and withdrawals via the Polygon network. Internal trading on Upbit’s platform may remain active, but you should verify this on the exchange’s trading interface. Q2: How long will Upbit suspend Polygon network deposits and withdrawals? A2: The duration is not specified but is directly tied to the completion of the Polygon network upgrade and subsequent security verifications by Upbit. Monitor their official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my funds safe on Upbit during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a security measure designed specifically to keep your funds safe. Assets held in your Upbit account are not at risk due to this network-level action. Q4: Does this affect other exchanges besides Upbit? A4: It might. Since the issue originated on the Polygon network, other exchanges that support Polygon-based assets may enact similar temporary suspensions as a precaution. Always check the status with your specific exchange. Q5: What is an emergency network upgrade? A5: It is a critical software update deployed by a blockchain development team to fix a severe bug, vulnerability, or performance issue (like halted block production) that cannot wait for a scheduled upgrade. Q6: Will this suspension affect the price of POL or GMT? A6: It could cause short-term volatility due to reduced liquidity from halted deposits/withdrawals on a major exchange like Upbit. However, the long-term price depends on broader market factors and the swift resolution of the network issue. Found this breakdown of why Upbit suspended Polygon network services helpful?

Bitcoin price prediction metrics suggest that the price must reclaim the $100,000 psychological threshold to prevent a deep bear market decline. Fear Index Hits Extreme Territory as Year-End Approaches Bitcoin’s Fear & Greed Index has plummeted to 11, signaling Extreme Fear. Crypto Markets Enter a Slowdown Phase “The number of active Bitcoin wallets has fallen to its lowest level in the past year, indicating that even when prices move, fewer participants are actually transacting.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/pt9RAEwx0M — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 17, 2025 According to a Japanese analyst at XWIN Research , fresh capital inflows into Bitcoin are beginning to diminish, and as year-end nears, both participation and capital typically become less active, further reducing market liquidity. “In such an environment, price action tends to become more volatile due to thin liquidity. At the same time, reduced noise allows the underlying supply and demand dynamics to become clearer,” the analysts explained. Crypto analyst Moreno also observed that Bitcoin sits at a level carrying more significance than appearances suggest. The current $86,000 price rests above the True Market Mean Price (TMMP), which represents the average on-chain acquisition price of investors, excluding miners. Moreno projects that if Bitcoin maintains above the TMMP ($81,500), the bull trend would be well alive. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Critical $81K Defense Zone Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays a clear transition from expansion to correction following repeated failures above the $100,000 psychological resistance. Price has definitively lost the $100,000 level and now trades below key moving averages, which have begun rolling over and functioning as dynamic resistance around the $103,000–$108,000 zone. The most crucial structural level on the downside sits at $81,000, marked as the average cost basis support. Source: TradingView Price currently hovers just above this zone, making it a critical inflection point for the broader market. The MACD remains firmly bearish with expanding negative histogram bars, signaling downside momentum still dominates despite the recent slowdown in selling pressure. Moreover, a sustained weekly close below $81,000 would expose the final bull-market defense near $74,000, where stronger long-term buyers are expected to emerge. Conversely, reclaiming $100,000 and maintaining above it would be necessary to invalidate bearish momentum and reopen pathways for advancement back toward the $105,000–$110,000 range. Pepenode Raises $2.3M Ahead of Bitcoin Post-Breakout Rally If Bitcoin finally breaks the $100,000 resistance and initiates the 2026 bull run, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) would experience increased demand. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite the crypto market losing over 30% of its value since October. It’s a game where you can mine coins without needing expensive hardware setups. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining rigs , and upgrade your facilities to earn PEPENODE tokens. Now that more people are investing in Pepenode’s mining rigs, the presale price is advancing rapidly. To join the presale before the ongoing round sells out, go to the official Pepenode website , and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet. You can then buy PEPENODE tokens for $0.0012016 and pay with crypto using ETH or USDT, or use a bank card for fast payment.

55950998,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92622,1766014252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Rich List: Can Long-Term Holders Realistically Retire on Crypto Gains?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-rich-list-can-long-term-holders-realistically-retire-on-crypto-gains/,"Many long-term XRP holders view their investment as a potential path to financial independence. Within this context, the XRP Rich List has become a frequent reference point for investors assessing their chances of retiring on crypto gains alone. However, whether reaching one of these tiers can realistically support retirement within the next ten years requires a careful review of both distribution data and price assumptions. XRP has maintained relevance in the digital asset market for more than twelve years, consistently ranking among the most liquid cryptocurrencies. Historical performance data shows that early adopters who accumulated XRP near launch achieved exceptional returns. While those outcomes are well documented, current investors face a very different market environment, prompting renewed debate over whether comparable gains remain achievable. Growth of the XRP Holder Base Recent on-chain data indicates that the number of XRP wallets has expanded meaningfully. At present, approximately 7.41 million addresses are holding XRP, reflecting an increase of more than 1.5 million wallets within the year. This growth suggests renewed participation in the network and a broadening investor base, even as price volatility persists. Despite this expansion, XRP ownership remains unevenly distributed. A relatively small percentage of wallets control a significant share of total supply, which is where the Rich List becomes relevant for long-term financial projections. XRP Rich List Thresholds Explained Current distribution metrics show that entry into the top 10% of XRP holders requires a balance of at least 2,316 XRP. The bar rises sharply for higher tiers, with the top 5% holding no less than 8,010 XRP. Meanwhile, wallets in the top 1% each control 48,895 XRP or more. These thresholds provide a framework for estimating potential outcomes under different price scenarios. Larger balances naturally offer greater leverage if XRP experiences sustained appreciation, but they also highlight how difficult it can be for newer investors to reach upper tiers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Retirement Targets and Regional Differences Retirement goals vary significantly depending on geographic location. In higher-cost economies such as the United States, surveys often cite $1 million as a minimum target for retirement. In contrast, individuals in lower-cost regions may require substantially less capital to achieve similar lifestyle outcomes. Using a $1 million benchmark, investors in the top 10% tier would need XRP to exceed $430 per token to meet that target. For those in the top 5%, a price near $125 would suffice. Investors within the top 1% would reach the same threshold at approximately $20 per XRP. Can XRP Reach These Levels in Ten Years? Whether these price levels are attainable within a decade remains uncertain. According to projections from Google Gemini, XRP could reach a maximum hypothetical price of $100 over the next ten years under highly favorable conditions. At that level, top 1% holders would control multimillion-dollar portfolios, while those in the top 5% could approach or surpass retirement benchmarks in many regions. However, such forecasts remain speculative. Market cycles, regulatory developments, adoption rates, and broader economic conditions will ultimately determine XRP’s long-term valuation. While placement on the XRP Rich List may improve the probability of achieving financial independence, it does not eliminate risk or guarantee retirement within a defined timeframe.

The comparison gained momentum after Kalshi’s head of crypto, John Wang, described prediction markets as “the meme coins of 2023,” arguing that both capture attention during periods when traders are searching for asymmetric opportunities. JUST IN: Head of crypto at Kalshi John Wang says “prediction markets are the memecoins of 2023.” pic.twitter.com/ZtGGHBSaht — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) December 15, 2025 The remark landed as meme coin activity cooled sharply following a volatile run that defined much of the last two years. Meme Coins Had Their Moment — Is This the Collapse Phase? Meme coins surged in 2023, driven by new token launches and heavy social media exposure. The sector’s total market capitalization reached nearly $22 billion by the end of that year, while trading activity expanded dramatically. Source: Coinmarketcap Data from the period shows average trading volume rising more than ninefold over the first eleven months. Two intense rallies defined the year, particularly an April–May burst fueled by highly speculative launches. That speculative energy carried into 2024, when meme coins climbed to an estimated peak market cap of around $150 billion in December, helped by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and a wave of political-themed tokens. The reversal was equally sharp. By late 2025, the sector’s total value had fallen below $42 billion, with daily volumes shrinking and individual tokens losing most of their prior gains. Source: Coinmarketcap Market data now shows memecoin trading volumes down roughly 85% from their highs, reflecting a broad pullback in risk appetite. Are Traders Done With Meme Coins? Prediction Markets Are Quietly Taking Over As meme coins faded, prediction markets moved in the opposite direction. Platforms such as Kalshi, Polymarket, and Limitless recorded a combined $44 billion in trading volume this year, with Kalshi alone reaching $1 billion in weekly volume, driven largely by sports and political contracts. Source: dune/datadashboards On-chain prediction markets have expanded even faster. Monthly volume has jumped from under $100 million in early 2024 to more than $13 billion today, a 130-fold increase, according to joint research from Keyrock and Dune Analytics. Non-sports markets, including economics, politics, and technology-related events, accounted for most of the growth in 2025. The structure of prediction markets differs sharply from memecoins, a point repeatedly raised by industry participants.

Supporters argue this creates clearer pricing and limits some of the manipulation risks that have plagued low-liquidity token markets. Honestly makes sense why people are just moving over to Polymarket and all these other prediction market platforms. You don’t have to worry about 12 year olds bundling coins, you don’t have worry about your “favorite” kol shilling a coin then full clipping soon after, you don’t… — GH0STEE (@gh0stee) December 15, 2025 Critics counter that returns are capped by design, making it harder for smaller traders to achieve outsized gains compared with early-stage memecoin trades. Can Prediction Markets Kill Meme Coins? Framing the trend as “prediction markets killing memecoins” misses the point. Memecoins are not dead. Liquidity has simply receded, and that contraction is affecting many other crypto sectors as well. History shows that meme-driven markets tend to hibernate, not disappear. When volatility returns and risk appetite expands, memecoins can resurface quickly. At the same time, prediction markets are clearly earning a durable user base. Their growth isn’t purely cyclical hype; it’s being driven by real-world events, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and demand for structured speculation. That gives them a resilience memecoins often lack during downturns. The more likely outcome is coexistence, not replacement . Memecoins will continue to dominate during speculative surges and attention-driven cycles. Prediction markets will attract traders seeking clarity, probability-based pricing, and event-driven exposure. They serve different psychological and financial needs. If anything, the current shift shows a maturing crypto market, one where capital rotates rather than evaporates and where speculation takes multiple forms instead of clustering around a single narrative.

Investors who deposited fiat “into an FTX- or Alameda-related account” between 2019 and 2022 are encouraged to submit claims for a $10 million settlement filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California The lawsuit indicates that Investors have until Jan. 30 to opt out or file a claim as part of a settlement that “resolves a lawsuit over whether Silvergate Bank, Silvergate Capital Corporation, and Alan J. Lane aided and abetted tortious conduct on the part of FTX, Alameda, and Sam Bankman-Fried. “The Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate ,” said a Dec. 8 court filing asking for approval. “It marks a significant recovery from the bankrupt Silvergate and will provide additional relief, beyond that obtained in the FTX Bankruptcy, for those affected by the multi-billion-dollar collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.” Court sets final hearing as FTX-linked investors eye recovery Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro will hold a final hearing to consider the settlement on Feb. 9, giving any investors tied to FTX and Alameda over 30 days to file claims. According to court filings, the FTX bankruptcy case has achieved over 46,000 potential claimants via mail, which could result in proportional payments from the $10 million settlement. Silvergate voluntarily wound down operations in March 2023. It was initially one of the few crypto-friendly banks in the US that had ties to the FTX exchange at the time of its collapse in November 2022. While most criminal cases against former FTX and Alameda executives have been resolved over the past three years, some civil cases remain, as well as a potential prosecution of another individual linked to the exchange. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame are serving federal prison sentences for their roles in the collapse. At the same time, executives Nishad Singh and Gary Wang received time served. Additionally, Michelle Bond, wife of Salame, faces campaign finance charges linked to FTX funds in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Her legal team says that prosecutors induced a guilty plea from Salame on the promise that they would not pursue a case against Bond. The next evidentiary hearing for Bond’s case is scheduled for March 4. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison moves to a community confinement program On related developments, former cryptocurrency executive Caroline Ellison, who was once Sam Bankman-Fried’s girlfriend, has been quietly transferred out of federal prison after serving approximately 11 months of her two-year sentence, according to Business Insider. The 31-year-old was moved on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to a community confinement program, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed. That indicates Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, will still be in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso noted. “For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual’s specific location while in community confinement,” Giamusso said. Data from prison records list Ellison’s projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. When reached out by reporters, her attorneys declined to comment for this story. In early November 2024, Ellison reported to the low-security Danbury prison to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s business empire. She had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme. Ellison served as the main witness in Bankman-Fried’s 2023 criminal trial , testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars’ worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.

In a recent commentary, Claver outlined how inefficiencies embedded in legacy banking frameworks continue to lock trillions of dollars out of productive use, creating conditions that favor neutral, real-time settlement assets. Legacy Banking and the $27 Trillion Liquidity Constraint Claver pointed to the continued reliance on correspondent banking structures, particularly the use of nostro and vostro accounts, as a major source of inefficiency. According to his assessment, banks worldwide must collectively immobilize roughly $27 trillion to facilitate cross-border payments. This capital remains parked to ensure transaction completion, rather than circulating through lending, investment, or economic activity. While the recent global adoption of ISO 20022 has improved data standards and communication between institutions, Claver emphasized that it does not resolve the underlying settlement delays. In his view, the standard serves as an upgrade to messaging infrastructure, not a solution to liquidity fragmentation or pre-funding requirements. Why Stablecoins Do Not Solve Institutional Settlement Claver also challenged the notion that stablecoins alone can address these issues. He argued that most stablecoins function as liabilities tied to specific issuers, making them unsuitable as neutral settlement tools between competing institutions. From a balance-sheet perspective, banks remain reluctant to hold digital liabilities issued by other entities, particularly at scale. He further noted that widespread institutional reliance on stablecoins could recreate existing inefficiencies. Managing multiple issuer-specific digital assets would fragment liquidity and increase operational complexity, undermining the efficiency gains the technology aims to deliver. XRP as a Neutral Settlement Layer Against this backdrop, Claver positioned XRP as a settlement asset designed to operate independently of institutional balance sheets. He highlighted XRP’s ability to facilitate value transfer without pre-funded accounts, while settling transactions in seconds at low cost. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Claver, this neutrality allows XRP to function as a bridge between financial infrastructures without introducing counterparty exposure. He also referenced the XRP Ledger’s operational history, noting its long-term stability and extensive testing by financial institutions for backend settlement use cases rather than consumer-facing payments. Tokenized Deposits, AMMs, and Market Structure Shifts Claver suggested that banks are more likely to adopt tokenized deposits and on-chain financial products than to rely on public stablecoins. These instruments allow institutions to maintain yield from treasury holdings while enabling real-time settlement and programmability. He also addressed the growing role of automated market makers on networks like the XRP Ledger, arguing that they can reduce liquidity gaps, tighten spreads, and improve price efficiency through continuous rebalancing. Finally, Claver warned that high leverage, rising debt levels, and prolonged restrictive monetary policy could trigger a broad market repricing across asset classes. However, he framed this as a transition rather than a collapse. In such an environment, governments and institutions would require real-time settlement systems, shared ledgers, and programmable financial infrastructure to manage liquidity and policy execution effectively. Within that framework, Claver believes XRP could benefit as financial markets shift toward more automated, efficient, and interoperable settlement mechanisms.

55954238,646168,1766016033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55954238.jpeg,Grayscale Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Hit A New All-Time High,https://bitcoinist.com/when-bitcoin-price-all-time-high/,"Grayscale, one of the world’s largest digital asset managers, outlined its 2026 Digital Asset Outlook, projecting that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. The forecast is based on structural changes in market design, expanding institutional participation, and broader macroeconomic forces . These developments form the foundation of Grayscale’s view that capital structure and demand dynamics will define Bitcoin’s next market phase. Institutional Capital Redefines The Bitcoin Price Growth Curve A central pillar of Grayscale’s outlook is the transition of Bitcoin from a retail-led asset to an institutionally supported financial instrument . The firm argues that the market is entering a phase where large allocators, including asset managers, advisory platforms, and long-term capital pools, are no longer evaluating Bitcoin as an experiment but as a portfolio component. This shift fundamentally alters demand behavior, replacing short-term trading flows with measured, strategic allocations. Grayscale highlights that regulatory progress and clearer market rules are reducing friction for institutions that previously remained sidelined. As operational and compliance barriers fall, capital that once avoided digital assets due to uncertainty can now enter with greater confidence. This gradual but persistent inflow model creates sustained upward pressure on price rather than sharp, unstable spikes. Crucially, Grayscale notes that institutional exposure to Bitcoin remains relatively small compared to traditional asset classes. From a portfolio construction perspective, this leaves significant room for expansion. Even modest increases in allocation percentages can translate into meaningful demand, especially given Bitcoin’s fixed supply. The firm views this imbalance between potential demand and limited issuance as a key reason price discovery is expected to continue upward into 2026. Macro Pressures And Supply Dynamics Set The Stage For New Highs Beyond institutional adoption , Grayscale’s outlook identifies macroeconomic conditions as a key driver shaping Bitcoin’s next phase of price expansion. Elevated sovereign debt, currency dilution, and persistent inflation risks are directing capital toward assets with transparent and finite supply. In this context, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance schedule reinforces its role as a macro-aligned asset. This macro framing also underpins Grayscale’s reassessment of Bitcoin’s traditional four-year market cycles . As the asset integrates further into mainstream finance, the firm argues that historical, halving-centered models are losing relevance. In their place, Bitcoin’s valuation is increasingly influenced by liquidity conditions, market access, and investor behavior aligned with other macro-sensitive assets. This transition signals a market responding to structural inputs rather than repeating legacy patterns. Supply dynamics further strengthen this view . As issuance slows and long-term Bitcoin holders retain more coins, market liquidity tightens. Combined with expanding demand channels, this creates an environment where price appreciation is supported by structural fundamentals rather than episodic surges. Grayscale’s analysis indicates that these factors could drive Bitcoin to a new all-time high in early 2026.

What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. Related Reading: Who Really Sold The Dip? On-Chain Data Exposes Bitcoin’s True Sellers However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. The New Fundamentals Behind Bitcoin’s Supercycle Thesis According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory.

Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies.

A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

The Board said the financial system changed enough to make the earlier rule useless. The new move applies to both insured and uninsured banks under the Fed’s watch and brings direct consequences for crypto-linked firms that want stable access to payment rails. Fed changes federal access for crypto companies in America “New technologies offer efficiencies to banks and improved products and services to bank customers,” Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said . “By creating a pathway for responsible, innovative products and services, the Board is helping ensure that the banking sector remains safe and sound while also modern, efficient, and effective.” The 2023 policy forced state member banks to follow the same activity rules that other federal regulators used. It also tried to lay out how banks should handle new tools. After it came out, the Board said the financial system shifted and its own understanding grew, so it cleared the rule and replaced it. The new policy lets banks under the Fed take part in certain innovative activities, which matters for firms like Circle, Paxos, Tether, and BitGo. These companies will now place customer reserves directly at the Fed instead of routing everything through commercial banks. That lowers costs and cuts counterparty risk while giving them more control over flows. Some companies tried other ways to reach the Fed’s payment system.The big one was specialty banking charters. One example is Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institution setup, built for crypto companies. Custodia Bank, one of the first to use it, sued the Federal Reserve Board and the Kansas City Fed for what it called “a patently unlawful delay.” A court dismissed the case, and Custodia appealed.

She will now work with MoonPay as its Chief Legal and Administrative Officer. With Caroline Pham’s exit from the CFTC to join the crypto payment company, MoonPay, Mike Selig, a crypto lawyer will fill her role. She follows a path walked by Bo Hines , former White House Crypto Council executive director, who joined Tether, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Hines reportedly now leads the firm’s US expansion activity, while tasked with maintaining compliance with the new requirements of the GENIUS bill. Caroline Pham leaves the CFTC Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is moving to the crypto payments company called MoonPay after working at the commission for nearly four years. “I’m excited to join MoonPay at a pivotal moment,” Pham said in a statement . Pham’s new role involves overseeing all global legal and administrative functions while also leading the company’s policy and regulatory strategy in Washington. Pham’s role at CFTC will be filled by crypto lawyer, Mike Selig, who is now preparing for Senate confirmation. The final vote on his appointment is expected early next week. Pham spent seven years at Citigroup, one of Wall Street’s largest banks before being confirmed as a Republican commissioner starting in 2022. She went on to be unanimously elected as acting chairman in January 2025. During her tenure, Pham encouraged modernization efforts at the CFTC through what she called the “Crypto Sprint,” a series of initiatives designed to bring regulatory clarity to digital asset markets. On December 4, she announced that listed spot crypto products would trade for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets through CFTC-registered futures exchanges. She also launched a pilot program that allowed Bitcoin, Ether, and stablecoin USDC to be used as collateral in U.S. derivatives markets. Tokenized assets such as Treasuries and money market funds were also explored for the same purpose. Last week, Pham said the agency would be withdrawing guidance focused on the “actual delivery” of digital assets, calling it “outdated and overly complex”. She also established the CFTC CEO Innovation Council, naming twelve CEOs to the forum and the Digital Asset Markets Pilot Program, launched on December 8, 2025. Her partnership with SEC Chair Paul Atkins resulted in improved collaboration between the two agencies, despite previous clashes over digital asset oversight. Why did MoonPay hire Pham? MoonPay, founded by Ivan Soto-Wright, Victor Faramond and Maximilian Crown in 2019, is a Miami-based company that provides payment infrastructure for users to purchase cryptocurrencies and digital assets using traditional payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers, and mobile payment options. The company reportedly has more than 30 million customers across 180 countries and supports more than 500 enterprise customers in both crypto and fintech industries. MoonPay raised $555 million in November 2021 in an investment round led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. The deal valued MoonPay at $3.4 billion. In March 2025, the company acquired the crypto checkout startup, Helio, for $175 million and announced the acquisition of the stablecoin platform, Iron. In the second half of 2025, MoonPay secured both its New York BitLicense and New York Limited Purpose Trust Charter. The company’s CEO, Ivan Soto-Wright, called Pham “one of the most influential leaders in U.S. financial regulation” and said her experience in regulatory expertise and traditional finance, as well as her deep understanding of market structure makes her “the perfect leader to guide MoonPay through our next chapter of growth and compliance excellence.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The latest reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 17, firmly entrenched in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This powerful sentiment gauge is flashing red, but savvy investors know that extreme fear often precedes significant market moves. Let’s decode what this critical number really means for Bitcoin, altcoins, and your investment strategy. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial tool that quantifies the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. It scores sentiment on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A reading of 17, as we see now, indicates that fear is the dominant force driving investor behavior. This index isn’t just a guess; it’s calculated using a specific, weighted formula analyzing real market data: Volatility (25%): Measures how wildly prices are swinging. Market Volume (25%): Tracks the momentum of trading activity. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of conversations online. Surveys (15%): Gathers direct sentiment from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Watches if money is flowing into or out of Bitcoin relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Monitors search interest for cryptocurrency terms. Therefore, when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reads 17, it’s a composite signal from all these areas screaming caution. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear? Market sentiment is a powerful, self-fulfilling force. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear, it often leads to panic selling, where investors offload assets at a loss simply to exit the market. This can create exaggerated price drops that may not reflect long-term fundamentals. Historically, however, periods of extreme fear have frequently presented contrarian buying opportunities for patient investors. The key question becomes: is this fear justified by underlying issues, or is it an emotional overreaction? Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a market governed by a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a disciplined approach. First, avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotion. Instead, use this time for research and review your portfolio’s risk tolerance. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This strategy involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, which can be highly effective in volatile, fearful markets as it removes the stress of timing the bottom. Finally, this is an ideal moment to rebalance. You might find high-quality projects are undervalued, presenting a strategic entry point. The Contrarian Perspective: Is This the Time to Buy? Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 epitomizes the latter. For long-term believers in blockchain technology, these fearful periods can be windows of opportunity. However, it’s vital to distinguish between a healthy market correction and a fundamental breakdown. Conduct thorough due diligence on any asset before committing capital, ensuring your moves are strategic, not reactive. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 17 is a clear snapshot of a nervous market. While it signals high risk and potential for further downside, it also hints at the possibility of future reward for those with conviction and a clear plan. Use this metric not as a standalone buy/sell signal, but as a crucial piece of context in your broader investment framework. By understanding the crowd’s emotion, you can better manage your own. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 mean? A: A score of 17 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-25). It indicates that negative sentiment and panic are currently dominating the cryptocurrency market, often driven by price drops and negative news. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: It is a reliable indicator of current market sentiment, not a direct price predictor. However, extreme readings (like 17) have often coincided with market bottoms or tops, making it a valuable contrarian tool. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is typically updated once per day, providing a daily snapshot of market emotion. Q: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? A> It can be a potential opportunity, but never base a decision solely on this index. Always combine sentiment analysis with fundamental and technical research appropriate for your risk profile. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major crypto news platforms also feature it in their market analysis sections. Q: Has the index ever been lower than 17? A: Yes. During major market crashes like the COVID-19 sell-off in March 2020, the index has briefly dipped into single digits, indicating even more severe panic.

A startling drop in network activity to a one-year low signals a major shift: a significant Ethereum retail investor exodus . This departure of everyday participants, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain, creates a critical hurdle for ETH’s price recovery. Let’s explore why this trend is so consequential for the market’s short-term trajectory. What Does the Ethereum Retail Investor Exodus Actually Mean? Recent on-chain data paints a clear picture. The number of active Ethereum sending addresses has plummeted to roughly 170,000. This metric is a direct proxy for retail participation. Simply put, fewer unique addresses conducting transactions means fewer small-scale investors are trading or interacting with the network. This trend isn’t entirely unexpected. Historically, retail activity dwindles after extended periods of market volatility and price declines. The current Ethereum retail investor exodus reflects a natural, if concerning, market phase: weakened short-term confidence and a ‘wait-and-see’ approach from the crowd that often fuels bullish momentum. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Network Activity From an on-chain perspective, such depressed activity presents a paradox. On one hand, it often indicates that intense selling pressure has exhausted itself. The weak hands have likely left, suggesting the immediate downward push may be over. However, the other edge of this sword is far sharper. The absence of retail traders also means a stark lack of new buying demand. Analysts point out that retail investors are typically the primary catalyst for the initial surge in a rebound. Their collective, albeit smaller, purchases help build the momentum that attracts larger players. Therefore, without this group, the path for a sustained ETH rebound becomes much steeper. The market loses a key layer of foundational demand. Why Is Retail Participation So Crucial for an ETH Rebound? Think of the market as a pyramid. Institutional and whale activity sits at the top, but the broad base is built by retail. Their role is multifaceted: Liquidity Providers: They add depth to the market, making it easier to buy and sell. Momentum Starters: A wave of small buys can signal a shift in sentiment, encouraging others. Network Users: Their transactions validate utility beyond pure speculation, supporting ecosystem health. The current Ethereum retail investor exodus weakens all these functions. While institutional interest remains vital, history shows that robust recoveries often need a ‘retail-first’ spark to ignite broader rallies. What’s the Path Forward for Ethereum? This analysis doesn’t spell doom for Ethereum, but it does highlight a challenging transition. The network’s fate in the near term may depend on other factors stepping in to fill the void left by retail. Key aspects to watch include: Institutional Adoption: Continued growth in ETF flows or enterprise usage. Protocol Upgrades: Successful implementation of future improvements that boost efficiency and appeal. Macro Environment: Broader financial conditions becoming more favorable for risk assets. Until then, the limited upside potential remains a reality. The market is in a state of equilibrium at a low activity level, waiting for a new catalyst to either bring retail back or unlock a different source of demand. Conclusion: A Market in Waiting The Ethereum retail investor exodus is a powerful signal the market is sending. It tells us that short-term speculative enthusiasm has cooled significantly. While this may stabilize prices temporarily, it severely limits the potential for a vigorous, short-term ETH rebound . The road to recovery now likely requires patience, fundamental development, or a major external catalyst to rebuild the confidence of the everyday investor. For now, Ethereum’s network awaits its next wave of users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does low retail activity mean the Ethereum price will definitely fall further? A: Not necessarily. It primarily indicates a lack of buying pressure for a strong rebound. The price could stabilize or move sideways until new demand emerges from retail or other sources like institutions. Q: How long do these retail exodus phases typically last? A> There’s no fixed timeline. It can last for weeks or months, often ending when market sentiment improves, volatility decreases, or a positive news catalyst attracts attention back to the asset. Q: Are institutional investors also leaving Ethereum? A> The data discussed specifically highlights retail metrics. Institutional flows can be separate; they may even be accumulating during quiet retail periods, which is a scenario some analysts watch for. Q: What metric is used to measure ‘active addresses’? A> ‘Active sending addresses’ typically counts the number of unique addresses that were the initiator (sender) of a successful transaction on the network over a given period, like daily. It’s a key gauge of unique user activity. Q: As a retail investor, should I avoid Ethereum right now? A> This is not financial advice. However, understanding market phases is crucial. Periods of low activity can be used for research and planning. Many investors see them as times to cautiously build positions based on long-term belief, not short-term momentum.

For crypto enthusiasts and financial professionals alike, this shift could accelerate the merger of old-world finance with new-world technology. What Was the Fed’s Restrictive Guideline? The withdrawn guideline primarily affected banks that operate without FDIC deposit insurance. It created a high barrier to entry, effectively limiting their ability to offer crypto-related services. The rule’s impact was starkly illustrated when the Fed cited it as grounds to deny a master account application from Custodia Bank, a financial institution built specifically for the digital asset space. This denial highlighted the tension between innovative fintech models and established regulatory frameworks. Why Did the Federal Reserve Make This Change? The decision reflects a growing acknowledgment within the Fed that the financial landscape is evolving. In a statement, Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman framed the move as forward-thinking. She emphasized that new technologies, including those underpinning the cryptocurrency business , can enhance bank efficiency and allow them to provide better products to customers. Key reasons behind the shift include: Promoting Responsible Innovation: The Fed aims to create a clear path for banks to explore digital assets safely. Enhancing Competitiveness: Allowing banks to adapt ensures the U.S. banking system remains efficient and competitive globally. Managing Risk: By bringing crypto activities under the banking umbrella, regulators can better oversee associated risks. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Banking? This regulatory shift is more than a procedural update; it’s a signal. It suggests that federal regulators are beginning to view the cryptocurrency business not as a fringe activity, but as a potential component of mainstream finance. For traditional banks, this opens a new frontier. They can now more seriously explore: Custody services for digital assets. Facilitating crypto payments and transfers. Developing hybrid financial products that blend traditional and digital finance. For companies like Custodia Bank, the door for reconsideration may now be open. However, challenges remain. Banks must still navigate a complex web of state and federal regulations, and they must prove they have robust risk management systems in place for handling volatile digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Toward Financial Synthesis The Federal Reserve’s decision to withdraw its restrictive guideline is a cautiously optimistic development. It represents a move away from blanket prohibition and toward a framework of supervised integration. While it doesn’t equate to a free pass, it establishes a crucial precedent: innovation in the cryptocurrency business can have a place within the regulated banking sector. This alignment is essential for building a more inclusive, efficient, and modern financial system that serves the needs of a digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean any bank can now start a cryptocurrency business? A: Not exactly. The withdrawal removes one specific barrier, but banks must still comply with all other applicable banking laws, secure necessary approvals, and demonstrate they can manage the unique risks of digital assets. Q: What is a “master account” and why was it important for Custodia Bank? A: A master account at the Federal Reserve allows a bank to directly access crucial payment systems and services. Without it, a bank like Custodia faces significant operational hurdles, making the previous denial a major setback. Q: Will this lead to lower fees for crypto trading and services? A: Potentially. Increased competition from traditional banks entering the cryptocurrency business could drive innovation and lower costs for consumers over time, but this is not an immediate guarantee. Q: How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A: In the long run, it could mean more secure and familiar avenues to buy, sell, and hold crypto through established banks, potentially increasing mainstream trust and adoption. Q: Is the FDIC insurance rule no longer important? A> FDIC insurance remains a critical consumer protection for traditional deposits. This change specifically addresses access for non-FDIC insured banks to engage in crypto, not the insurance rule itself. Q: What should I watch for next? A> Watch for announcements from regional or smaller banks about pilot crypto programs, and see if the Fed approves new master account applications from crypto-focused institutions.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now taken a significant step to clear the air. The commission has issued new, interim guidance specifically addressing the custody of digital asset securities by registered broker-dealers. This move aims to resolve a critical compliance hurdle and provide much-needed direction for firms operating at the intersection of legacy finance and blockchain technology. What Are the New SEC Custody Guidelines? The core of the SEC’s announcement revolves around Rule 15c3-3, the longstanding regulation governing how broker-dealers must safeguard customer assets. The commission stated that if a broker-dealer meets specific requirements, digital asset securities held for customers can be considered in the firm’s “physical possession” for compliance purposes. This interpretation is crucial because it bridges a gap between the digital nature of these assets and the physical possession concepts in traditional rules. This guidance acts as an interim measure. The SEC explicitly noted it is still reviewing broader issues related to broker-dealer custody of crypto assets. However, by providing this clarity now, the commission is responding directly to requests from market participants who have been navigating a regulatory gray area. Why Does This Guidance Matter for the Crypto Industry? The lack of clear rules has been a major barrier for institutional adoption. Traditional financial firms have been hesitant to offer custodial services for digital asset securities due to compliance risks. This new guidance provides a potential pathway. Here are the key implications: Reduced Uncertainty: Firms now have an official SEC stance to reference when structuring their custody solutions, reducing legal and regulatory risk. Institutional Gateway: Clearer rules could encourage more broker-dealers to safely hold digital asset securities , paving the way for greater institutional investment. Compliance Roadmap: The guidance outlines the SEC’s current thinking, allowing companies to align their operations proactively rather than guessing. What Challenges and Questions Remain? While this is a positive step, it is not a final resolution. The guidance is interim, meaning the rules could evolve. Furthermore, the SEC has not yet detailed all the “certain requirements” a broker-dealer must meet. Key questions for the market include: What specific technological and operational safeguards will satisfy the SEC? How does this guidance interact with state-level money transmitter licenses? Will the requirements differ for various types of digital asset securities ? Therefore, while the path is brighter, firms must proceed with caution and likely engage in further dialogue with regulators to ensure full compliance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses and Investors For broker-dealers and crypto-native firms seeking legitimacy, this is a call to action. Engaging with legal counsel to interpret the guidance in the context of your specific business model is essential. For investors, this development signals a maturing market where established regulatory frameworks are beginning to formally encompass digital assets, potentially leading to more secure and mainstream investment products. Conclusion: A Step Toward Regulatory Integration The SEC’s new custody guidelines for digital asset securities represent a meaningful, though incremental, move toward integrating cryptocurrency into the existing financial regulatory system. By addressing the custody question under Rule 15c3-3, the commission has provided a foundational piece of clarity that the industry has urgently needed. This action fosters a more secure environment for institutional participation and underscores the ongoing process of defining the future of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Rule 15c3-3? A: It’s a key SEC rule, often called the “Customer Protection Rule,” that requires broker-dealers to safeguard customer cash and securities, keeping them separate from the firm’s own assets. Q: Does this mean all cryptocurrencies are now considered securities? A: No. This guidance specifically applies to assets already classified as digital asset securities . The broader debate over what constitutes a security in crypto continues. Q: Is this guidance final law? A: No, it is interim guidance and a statement of the SEC’s current interpretive position. It provides a compliance framework but may be subject to change as the commission continues its review. Q: How does this affect individual crypto investors? A> In the long term, it could lead to more regulated and insured custody options from established financial institutions, potentially increasing safety for investors holding digital asset securities . Q: What should a crypto company do next? A> Firms acting as broker-dealers should consult with securities lawyers to understand how the guidance applies to their operations and what specific controls they need to implement.

A token starts to gain traction in a steady, not a hyped manner, but due to the fact that progress and involvement are moving in the same direction. And that is what is shaping around a new DeFi Crypto being sold at a price under $0.04. Having registered a 250% growth since its initial phase, investor interest is gathering as more now evaluate the cryptocurrency to purchase against the market at large which is still picky. Presale Progress and What MUTM is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale was launched at the beginning of 2025 starting with a price of $0.01 and advanced through a planned phase model, reaching a point of $0.035 within its existing price range. That shift is 250% of growth, which was not caused by volatility but intended stage development. Involvement has increased with the growth. The project has received greater attention in terms of raised funds bringing together over 18,400 holders and exceeding $19.30M in raised funds. Out of a total supply of 4B tokens, 45.5 or 1.82B tokens are distributed to early distribution with 820M tokens already sold. Phase 6 is currently more than 99% allocated and this implies that there is very limited remaining at the present level. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform based on practical usage at a protocol level. Assets are provided by the users to gain yield on the borrowing demand. Liquidity is availed to borrowers whereby collateral is posted at stipulated rules that regulate rates and levels of risk. Creation of value is associated with action as opposed to attention, and that explains why MUTM can rightfully be described as a DeFi crypto designed to engage in action on a longer-term basis. V1 and Growth Features The second significant milestone is execution. The official X announcement says that in Q4 2025, V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet. With the initial assets being ETH and USDT, this release introduces the Liquidity Pool,mtToken framework, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot. One attribute of the protocol is mtTokens. Users provide assets, the increase in redeemable value of the mtTokens happens when borrowers pay off interests. This promotes possession of behavior that is associated with actual usage. It also has a buy and distribute mechanism. On the open market, MUTM is bought and redistributed to those who are willing to place a stake on the safety module in the form of mtTokens. This is a system level demand as the level of borrowing activity increases. Some prognosticators in a temperate tone of voice think that in the case V1 execution and first-mover adoption are in constant motion, MUTM could be selling in the $0.20 to $0.25 range. That would be in the range of 6x-7x up from the current price of $0.035, and run by a usage and not a hype-cycle. Long-term Scenarios Other than the launch, Mutuum Finance intends to roll out a protocol-native stablecoin that is pegged on the interest earned in the system. Stablecoins based on in-house activity tend to enhance the liquidity and maintain value within the ecosystem. The roadmap also includes layer-2 expansion. The participation can be expanded as a result of lower transaction expenditure and rates of execution particularly when it comes to lending protocols that have recurring interactions. The ChainLink-supported fallback and aggregated feeds based on Oracle infrastructure form the basis of precise pricing of collateral valuation and liquidations. Security preparation is a plus of the project approaching V1. Mutuum Finance passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan mark. Simultaneously, Halborn Security is going through the finalized smart contracts and a bug bounty exists of $50,000 USD to find vulnerabilities in advance. The advertising to the community is still obvious with the 24-hour leaderboard rewarding the daily best player with $500 in MUTM. These characteristics have been beneficial in keeping it going on Phase 6 in its concluding phase.

After months of declining prices and heightened volatility across crypto markets, attention has shifted from short-term price action to structural changes that could improve HYPE’s supply dynamics and investor expectations. At the center of the debate is a governance proposal by the Hyper Foundation to formally treat all HYPE held in the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund as permanently burned. While these tokens are already locked in an address without a private key, the vote seeks to codify their removal from performance. If approved, the decision would mark one of the most significant supply reductions in the protocol’s history, removing more than 37 million HYPE, over 10% of circulating supply, through a validator-backed consensus. Governance Vote Puts Hyperliquid Supply Structure in Focus The Assistance Fund accumulates HYPE through an automated mechanism that converts trading fees generated on Hyperliquid’s perpetuals exchange into the native token. These tokens sit in a system address that has never been controlled by a private key, making them inaccessible unless a protocol-level upgrade is authorized. Under the current proposal, validators are being asked to establish a binding social consensus that no such upgrade will ever occur. Voting is stake-weighted, with validators signaling their positions by December 21, and final results are expected on December 24. Approval would effectively lock in a more restrictive supply model, preventing the Assistance Fund from being used for grants, liquidity support, or emergency measures in the future. The proposal follows earlier, unadopted discussions around broader supply cuts in 2025, suggesting a renewed effort to clarify HYPE’s long-term monetary framework rather than pursue incremental adjustments. Market Reaction and Longer-Term Outlook Hyperliquid ( HYPE) has stabilized near the $26 level after several days of losses, with market data suggesting the proposed burn is not yet fully priced in. Futures open interest has climbed above $1.5 billion, and funding rates have turned positive, pointing to growing bullish positioning ahead of the validator vote. In contrast, spot market activity remains muted, as trading volumes have edged lower and technical indicators continue to reflect lingering bearish momentum. Beyond short-term price action, analysts are increasingly focused on Hyperliquid’s longer-term valuation framework. Cantor Fitzgerald has cited the protocol’s fee-driven and deflationary design as a potential driver of sustained growth, projecting billions in annual fees if adoption expands. From this perspective, the Assistance Fund burn is seen as a test of whether stricter supply discipline can help rebuild confidence, with the vote outcome likely shaping how Hyperliquid’s economic model is evaluated into 2026.

Despite holding above a major confluence zone, repeated rejections overhead suggest buyers are losing control. With macro pressure building and liquidity levels still untested, the next move from here could define whether BTC stabilizes or slides into a deeper reset. Lower-Timeframe Rejection Keeps The Downtrend In Control Crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe revealed in a recent post that Bitcoin has faced a clear rejection at a key resistance level. This failure signals that the short-term downtrend remains intact on lower timeframes, confirming that selling pressure currently outweighs buying momentum in the immediate term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details To flip this short-term bias, Van de Poppe expects a clear breakout above the $88,000 level. A successful move above this mark would serve as a strong, unequivocal signal to the markets that the corrective phase is over and that upward momentum is likely to take hold from that point forward. If buyers fail to achieve this necessary breakout, it remains highly probable that the price will pursue liquidity targets below, specifically targeting a test at $83,000 for liquidity. Should that fail, a further descent to the $80,000 level will trigger stop-losses. Finally, Van De Poppe connected the technical outlook to the broader economic environment. Given the high volume of macroeconomic events scheduled to take place over the course of the week, such as FOMC, Poppe believes that the market could experience significant volatility and end up reaching one of the predicted downside liquidity tests. $93,000 Rejection Stalls Momentum, but Weekly Structure Still Intact According to a weekly chart update by Crypto Damus, Bitcoin recently faced a firm rejection at the $93,000 resistance level. Despite that setback, price action remains constructive for now, with BTC holding above the crucial $86,000 weekly support zone. This area is reinforced with the key 100-week moving average confluence, making it an important level to watch in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ That said, the broader structure still leaves room for deeper downside. Crypto Damus notes that a full retracement toward the rising wedge breakdown target cannot be ruled out, which aligns closely with the April low around the $78,000 region. A move into that zone would represent a more pronounced corrective phase within the larger cycle. Looking further ahead, a deeper bear-market-style retest may ultimately present a more attractive long-term opportunity. A revisit of the $70,000 level is highlighted as a potential high-conviction buying area, should the market extend its pullback.

The latest data delivers a sobering reality check. CoinMarketCap’s crucial Altcoin Season Index has held firm at a lowly 18, unchanged from the previous day. This persistent reading signals that Bitcoin continues to command the crypto market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Let’s decode what this stagnant index truly means for your portfolio. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index acts as the crypto market’s primary gauge for investor sentiment and capital rotation. It meticulously measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The rule is simple yet powerful: if 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that period, an official ‘altcoin season’ is declared. A score nearing 100 screams a raging altcoin bull market, while a low score like 18 confirms we are firmly in a ‘Bitcoin season’. This metric is essential for timing your market entries and exits. Why Is the Index Stuck at Such a Low Level? The index’s stagnation at 18 is not a random fluctuation; it reflects deep-seated market dynamics. Currently, Bitcoin is absorbing the majority of institutional and safe-haven capital, especially with the excitement around Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This creates a significant challenge for altcoins, which often struggle to gain traction when Bitcoin dominates headlines and liquidity. Furthermore, the higher risk profile of altcoins makes them less attractive during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or when market sentiment is cautious. Therefore, this low Altcoin Season Index reading is a clear signal that broad, risk-on appetite for smaller cryptocurrencies is currently muted. How Can Traders Use This Information Strategically? Instead of viewing a low index as bad news, savvy traders use it to formulate a strategic plan. Here are actionable insights based on the current Altcoin Season Index of 18: Practice Patience with Altcoin Accumulation: A low index can be an opportunity to research and slowly accumulate high-quality altcoin projects at relatively lower prices, building a position before a potential season shift. Focus on Bitcoin-Centric Strategies: While the index is low, consider that trends favor Bitcoin. Allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to BTC or Bitcoin-related investments aligns with the dominant trend. Set Alert Levels for the Index: Monitor for a sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index above key levels (like 25 or 50). A consistent climb can serve as an early warning signal that capital is beginning to rotate, prompting you to re-evaluate your altcoin holdings. When Should We Expect the Altcoin Season Index to Rise? Predicting the exact turn is difficult, but history shows catalysts exist. A sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index typically follows a period of Bitcoin consolidation or stability, where investors seek higher returns elsewhere. Other potential triggers include breakthrough developments in major altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum upgrades), a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, or a wave of positive regulatory clarity for specific altcoin sectors. The key is to watch for a combination of Bitcoin strength plateauing and altcoins beginning to show independent, positive momentum on their charts.

For now, Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of the crypto hill. However, understanding this index equips you not with despair, but with patience and preparedness. Use this time to conduct thorough research, strengthen your core Bitcoin position, and prepare a watchlist for when the index finally begins its inevitable climb, signaling the next chapter of altcoin opportunity.
