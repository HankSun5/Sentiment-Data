This pivotal approval from India’s Competition Commission (CCI) signals a major step forward for institutional crypto adoption in one of the world’s most crucial markets. But what does this strategic Coinbase stake in CoinDCX truly mean for the future of digital assets in India? Let’s dive into the details. What Does the Coinbase and CoinDCX Partnership Entail? First, it’s crucial to clarify the nature of this deal. Reports initially swirled about a potential full acquisition. However, both companies have firmly denied these claims. The reality is a strategic equity investment—a Coinbase stake in CoinDCX . This distinction is important. It represents a partnership rather than a takeover, allowing CoinDCX to leverage Coinbase’s global expertise while maintaining its operational independence and deep understanding of the local Indian market. The approval from the CCI was the final regulatory hurdle. This body ensures fair competition and prevents monopolies. Its clearance confirms that this partnership is viewed as beneficial for market health and consumer choice, not a threat to it. Why is This Approval a Game-Changer for India’s Crypto Scene? India represents a massive, tech-savvy population with immense potential for cryptocurrency adoption. However, the regulatory environment has been complex. This move by a giant like Coinbase, following proper channels, adds a layer of legitimacy and confidence to the entire ecosystem. The benefits of this Coinbase stake in CoinDCX are multifaceted: Enhanced Liquidity and Access: Collaboration could lead to better liquidity pools and more trading pairs for Indian users. Advanced Security Protocols: Coinbase’s renowned security infrastructure can help bolster safety standards locally. Product Innovation: Expect to see more sophisticated trading tools and investment products tailored for Indian investors. Regulatory Dialogue: This partnership strengthens the voice of the industry in ongoing discussions with Indian policymakers. Coinbase’s Direct Plans: Rupee On-Ramps by 2026 Parallel to this investment, Coinbase has resumed new user registrations in India through its own app. More importantly, the company has announced plans to support direct cryptocurrency purchases using the Indian Rupee (INR) starting in 2026. This is a critical development. Currently, many Indian users face hurdles converting local currency into crypto. Direct INR support would simplify the onboarding process dramatically, removing a significant barrier to entry. It shows Coinbase’s dual-track strategy: investing in a local champion (CoinDCX) while also preparing its own direct service offering for the future. Navigating Challenges and Future Outlook Despite the optimism, challenges remain. India’s tax treatment of crypto assets is still a point of discussion for the broader community. Furthermore, educating a vast new user base and ensuring robust consumer protection will be ongoing priorities for both exchanges. However, the final approval for a Coinbase stake in CoinDCX is undeniably a watershed moment. It demonstrates that major global players see long-term value in the Indian market and are willing to engage with its regulatory framework. This vote of confidence can accelerate institutional interest and pave the way for more structured growth. Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point The final nod for Coinbase’s strategic stake in CoinDCX is more than just a business transaction. It’s a powerful signal of maturation for India’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. This partnership blends global scale with local expertise, aiming to build a more secure, accessible, and innovative digital asset environment for millions of users. As Coinbase also lays the groundwork for direct rupee transactions, the period leading to 2026 is poised to be a transformative chapter for crypto in India. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did Coinbase fully acquire CoinDCX? A: No. Both companies have denied reports of a full acquisition. The deal is a strategic equity investment, meaning Coinbase has taken a significant stake in CoinDCX as a partner and investor. Q2: What does CCI approval mean? A: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) ensures fair market competition. Its final approval means the regulatory body does not see this partnership as creating a monopoly or harming consumer choice, clearing the last major hurdle for the deal. Q3: Can I use Coinbase in India now? A: Coinbase has resumed new user registrations in India through its app. However, full support for direct deposits and purchases in Indian Rupees (INR) is planned for 2026. Q4: How will this partnership benefit Indian crypto users? A: Users can expect potential benefits like enhanced platform security, greater liquidity, more trading options, and innovative products developed from the combined expertise of both exchanges. Q5: Does this make cryptocurrency legal in India? A: Cryptocurrency is not illegal in India, but it exists in a regulatory gray area with specific tax implications. This high-profile, approved investment is a positive step toward greater regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance. Q6: What is the strategic importance of this stake? A: The Coinbase stake in CoinDCX allows Coinbase to tap into the Indian market through a trusted local leader while providing CoinDCX with global resources, creating a powerful synergy.

Related Reading: Here Are The Meme Coins With Over 100% Rallies While Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Struggle After more than a year trading within a broad range, recent price action suggests that the long-standing balance between buyers and sellers is under strain. At the same time, macroeconomic uncertainty and technical upgrades are reshaping how investors assess risk around the asset. SOL has spent much of 2024 and 2025 oscillating between major support and resistance zones, but recent attempts to rebound have been increasingly shallow. Price is now hovering just above key demand areas, with traders closely watching whether these levels can continue to absorb selling pressure. Solana Price Near Key Support as Bearish Signals Build From a technical perspective, Solana has slipped toward the lower end of its multi-month range, from $145 to $120. Momentum indicators remain weak, with relative strength measures remaining below neutral levels and trend indicators indicating continued downside pressure. Repeated failures to reclaim former support zones have shifted attention to the $120–$125 area, which has acted as a floor several times in recent months. A decisive break below this band could expose SOL to a move toward the $100 region, where historical demand clusters sit. Some analysts warn that if selling accelerates and liquidity thins, the price could overshoot that level before stabilizing. Others note that volume has declined alongside price, suggesting hesitation rather than panic, which leaves room for a short-term bounce if buyers step in. Macro Signals Add to Uncertainty Broader economic conditions are adding another layer of complexity. Rising U.S. unemployment and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts have kept markets divided. Lower rates have historically supported crypto assets by improving liquidity, but mixed signals from policymakers have limited risk appetite so far. For Solana, this means macro optimism has yet to translate into sustained inflows. Traders appear reluctant to commit heavily until there is clearer guidance from the Fed. A dovish shift could support a relief rally, while a pause in easing may reinforce downside risks and keep SOL pinned near current levels. Network Resilience Meets Long-Term Transition While price struggles, Solana’s network continues to evolve. The blockchain recently withstood one of the largest DDoS attacks recorded, maintaining transaction speeds with minimal disruption. Separately, the Solana Foundation has begun testing post-quantum cryptographic signatures, signaling preparation for long-term security challenges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculative Activity Cooling Fast: IFP Shows Steep Slide These developments underline improving infrastructure resilience, but they have not yet offset near-term market pressure. For now, SOL’s outlook hinges on whether buyers can defend key support as macro conditions and technical signals converge. A clear break or rebound near $100 is likely to define sentiment into early 2026.

Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/best-xrp-buy-zone-analyst-key-levels/,"Will Taylor, founder of CryptoinsightUK, frames XRP’s “best buy area” as a risk-to-reward question, not a certainty call. In his latest YouTube video from Dec. 17, he argues that XRP is trading back in the lower portion of a well-defined range, which is typically where entries make the most sense for range traders—because invalidation levels are clearer and upside targets are structurally defined. “We’re at the bottom of the range this area, the bottom of the range, and the bottom of the range has been quite wide,” Taylor said. “So, I’d say between like $2.01, then all the way down to about $1.60. This has been the best area to enter […] for the last […] basically year and a bit.” And his emphasis is that it’s attractive because the trade is measurable, not because it’s guaranteed. “Does this mean we can’t break down further? Does this mean we can’t lose support? No, that’s not what I’m saying at all,” he added. “But what I am saying is if you use range trading, if you want to know the best areas for risk-to-reward, we’re at them now.” Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M On lower timeframes, Taylor said XRP has already swept much of the downside liquidity, leaving a smaller pocket below that could still get tagged. He pointed to ~$1.83 as the remaining area of interest. “XRP has taken most of this red liquidity to the downside. There’s a small pocket of liquidity below us still at $1.83,” he said. And crucially, that level is not academic for him — it’s tied to his own stop placement and whether the market is likely to wick lower before any sustained move up. “This is something that I’m considering […] as to whether to move my stop loss below this liquidity down at like say $1.79,” Taylor said. “My stop loss [is] $1.834 at the minute. Do I take it to say like $1.79 […] give us […] the bottom of this wick as potential support and that liquidity. That’s a potential discussion.” The Upside Trigger For XRP Taylor’s near-term bullish trigger is a reclaim of ~$2.07. His reasoning is positioning-driven: he thinks the market has built a meaningful amount of short exposure during the drawdown, and a move back above that level could force covering. Related Reading: XRP Falls Below $2 As $721 Million Profit-Take Hits Market “When you start to get a buildup of […] lower highs like this, all it takes is a bit of momentum to break us above,” he said. “So, say for XRP, if we start to get back above $2.07, you probably should see price squeeze to $2.58-$2.60 quite quickly […] as we squeeze out all of this […] open interest that’s been adding in as price has been coming down.” Taylor’s XRP view is nested inside a broader “crypto is mispriced” thesis. When comparing crypto’s market cap performance against a basket of traditional assets, he argues that crypto has decoupled sharply since the Oct. 10 crash, while sentiment has deteriorated. “Crypto has like decoupled from every other asset class […] crypto is about the only asset that has decoupled this hard,” he said. “I personally believe this is a deep value zone […] we’re clearly mispriced versus other assets.” He also repeatedly leaned on the idea that positioning is skewed: rising open interest into downside, negative premium, and funding flipping between positive and negative — conditions that can set up a squeeze if price starts reclaiming levels. “I think a lot of the market generally is setting up for a bit of a short squeeze to the upside,” Taylor said. “And I think that people are overly negative and […] the sentiment’s overly bearish compared to where the price is.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.92.

This critical action comes as a direct response to an emergency network upgrade, following a concerning halt in block production. For traders holding assets like POL and GMT, this news is a pivotal development that requires immediate understanding. Why Did Upbit Suspend the Polygon Network? The core reason behind this suspension is an urgent technical issue. The Polygon network itself initiated an emergency upgrade after its block production unexpectedly stopped. When a blockchain halts block production, new transactions cannot be confirmed or added to the ledger. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must proactively suspend related services to protect user funds and prevent transactions from being lost or stuck in limbo during the network instability. This is a standard security protocol in the cryptocurrency industry. However, it highlights the inherent challenges of operating within decentralized ecosystems where third-party network performance directly impacts exchange operations. The suspension is a precaution, not necessarily an indication of a problem with Upbit’s own platform. Which Assets Are Affected by This Suspension? The temporary halt specifically impacts any digital asset that utilizes the Polygon network for transfers on Upbit. The exchange has named two major tokens in its announcement: POL (Polygon Ecosystem Token): The native token of the revamped Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. GMT (STEPN): The governance token of the move-to-earn fitness application. It is crucial for users to note that trading of these assets may still be available on Upbit’s internal order books. The suspension applies only to moving tokens on or off the exchange via the Polygon network. Always check the official Upbit announcement page for the most current and complete list of affected assets. What Should Upbit Users Do Now? If you are an Upbit user, do not panic. This is a temporary, protective measure. Here are your actionable steps: Do Not Initiate Deposits: Any attempt to deposit POL, GMT, or other Polygon-based assets to your Upbit wallet during the suspension will likely fail or be significantly delayed. Withdrawals Are On Hold: You cannot withdraw these assets to an external Polygon wallet until Upbit resumes services. Monitor Official Channels: For updates, rely solely on official Upbit announcements via their website or verified social media. Avoid speculation from unverified sources. Consider the Network: Remember, this is a Polygon network issue. Other exchanges may implement similar suspensions, so check the status if you plan to use other platforms. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? While disruptive for direct users, this event serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnected nature of cryptocurrency infrastructure. An issue on a major Layer-2 network like Polygon can ripple through to top-tier exchanges, affecting liquidity and user activity. It underscores the importance of: Network Reliability: The need for robust, fault-tolerant blockchain systems. Exchange Risk Management: How leading exchanges like Upbit implement safeguards. User Education: The critical need for traders to understand the underlying technology of their assets. Historically, such suspensions are resolved within hours or a few days once the underlying network is stable and the exchange has completed its safety checks. Conclusion: A Temporary Hiccup in a Maturing Ecosystem The decision by Upbit to suspend Polygon network services is a prudent and expected response to unforeseen blockchain turbulence. It prioritizes the security of user assets above all else. For the crypto community, it’s a moment to reflect on the growing pains of a rapidly evolving industry. As networks and exchanges coordinate to resolve these issues, the overall system demonstrates its resilience. The key takeaway is that such events, while inconvenient, are part of the process that leads to more robust and reliable infrastructure for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade POL and GMT on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Possibly. The suspension is for deposits and withdrawals via the Polygon network. Internal trading on Upbit’s platform may remain active, but you should verify this on the exchange’s trading interface. Q2: How long will Upbit suspend Polygon network deposits and withdrawals? A2: The duration is not specified but is directly tied to the completion of the Polygon network upgrade and subsequent security verifications by Upbit. Monitor their official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my funds safe on Upbit during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a security measure designed specifically to keep your funds safe. Assets held in your Upbit account are not at risk due to this network-level action. Q4: Does this affect other exchanges besides Upbit? A4: It might. Since the issue originated on the Polygon network, other exchanges that support Polygon-based assets may enact similar temporary suspensions as a precaution. Always check the status with your specific exchange. Q5: What is an emergency network upgrade? A5: It is a critical software update deployed by a blockchain development team to fix a severe bug, vulnerability, or performance issue (like halted block production) that cannot wait for a scheduled upgrade. Q6: Will this suspension affect the price of POL or GMT? A6: It could cause short-term volatility due to reduced liquidity from halted deposits/withdrawals on a major exchange like Upbit. However, the long-term price depends on broader market factors and the swift resolution of the network issue. Found this breakdown of why Upbit suspended Polygon network services helpful?

Bitcoin price prediction metrics suggest that the price must reclaim the $100,000 psychological threshold to prevent a deep bear market decline. Fear Index Hits Extreme Territory as Year-End Approaches Bitcoin’s Fear & Greed Index has plummeted to 11, signaling Extreme Fear. Crypto Markets Enter a Slowdown Phase “The number of active Bitcoin wallets has fallen to its lowest level in the past year, indicating that even when prices move, fewer participants are actually transacting.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/pt9RAEwx0M — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 17, 2025 According to a Japanese analyst at XWIN Research , fresh capital inflows into Bitcoin are beginning to diminish, and as year-end nears, both participation and capital typically become less active, further reducing market liquidity. “In such an environment, price action tends to become more volatile due to thin liquidity. At the same time, reduced noise allows the underlying supply and demand dynamics to become clearer,” the analysts explained. Crypto analyst Moreno also observed that Bitcoin sits at a level carrying more significance than appearances suggest. The current $86,000 price rests above the True Market Mean Price (TMMP), which represents the average on-chain acquisition price of investors, excluding miners. Moreno projects that if Bitcoin maintains above the TMMP ($81,500), the bull trend would be well alive. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Critical $81K Defense Zone Bitcoin’s weekly chart displays a clear transition from expansion to correction following repeated failures above the $100,000 psychological resistance. Price has definitively lost the $100,000 level and now trades below key moving averages, which have begun rolling over and functioning as dynamic resistance around the $103,000–$108,000 zone. The most crucial structural level on the downside sits at $81,000, marked as the average cost basis support. Source: TradingView Price currently hovers just above this zone, making it a critical inflection point for the broader market. The MACD remains firmly bearish with expanding negative histogram bars, signaling downside momentum still dominates despite the recent slowdown in selling pressure. Moreover, a sustained weekly close below $81,000 would expose the final bull-market defense near $74,000, where stronger long-term buyers are expected to emerge. Conversely, reclaiming $100,000 and maintaining above it would be necessary to invalidate bearish momentum and reopen pathways for advancement back toward the $105,000–$110,000 range. Pepenode Raises $2.3M Ahead of Bitcoin Post-Breakout Rally If Bitcoin finally breaks the $100,000 resistance and initiates the 2026 bull run, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) would experience increased demand. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite the crypto market losing over 30% of its value since October. It’s a game where you can mine coins without needing expensive hardware setups. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining rigs , and upgrade your facilities to earn PEPENODE tokens. Now that more people are investing in Pepenode’s mining rigs, the presale price is advancing rapidly. To join the presale before the ongoing round sells out, go to the official Pepenode website , and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet. You can then buy PEPENODE tokens for $0.0012016 and pay with crypto using ETH or USDT, or use a bank card for fast payment.

55950998,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92622,1766014252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Rich List: Can Long-Term Holders Realistically Retire on Crypto Gains?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-rich-list-can-long-term-holders-realistically-retire-on-crypto-gains/,"Many long-term XRP holders view their investment as a potential path to financial independence. Within this context, the XRP Rich List has become a frequent reference point for investors assessing their chances of retiring on crypto gains alone. However, whether reaching one of these tiers can realistically support retirement within the next ten years requires a careful review of both distribution data and price assumptions. XRP has maintained relevance in the digital asset market for more than twelve years, consistently ranking among the most liquid cryptocurrencies. Historical performance data shows that early adopters who accumulated XRP near launch achieved exceptional returns. While those outcomes are well documented, current investors face a very different market environment, prompting renewed debate over whether comparable gains remain achievable. Growth of the XRP Holder Base Recent on-chain data indicates that the number of XRP wallets has expanded meaningfully. At present, approximately 7.41 million addresses are holding XRP, reflecting an increase of more than 1.5 million wallets within the year. This growth suggests renewed participation in the network and a broadening investor base, even as price volatility persists. Despite this expansion, XRP ownership remains unevenly distributed. A relatively small percentage of wallets control a significant share of total supply, which is where the Rich List becomes relevant for long-term financial projections. XRP Rich List Thresholds Explained Current distribution metrics show that entry into the top 10% of XRP holders requires a balance of at least 2,316 XRP. The bar rises sharply for higher tiers, with the top 5% holding no less than 8,010 XRP. Meanwhile, wallets in the top 1% each control 48,895 XRP or more. These thresholds provide a framework for estimating potential outcomes under different price scenarios. Larger balances naturally offer greater leverage if XRP experiences sustained appreciation, but they also highlight how difficult it can be for newer investors to reach upper tiers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Retirement Targets and Regional Differences Retirement goals vary significantly depending on geographic location. In higher-cost economies such as the United States, surveys often cite $1 million as a minimum target for retirement. In contrast, individuals in lower-cost regions may require substantially less capital to achieve similar lifestyle outcomes. Using a $1 million benchmark, investors in the top 10% tier would need XRP to exceed $430 per token to meet that target. For those in the top 5%, a price near $125 would suffice. Investors within the top 1% would reach the same threshold at approximately $20 per XRP. Can XRP Reach These Levels in Ten Years? Whether these price levels are attainable within a decade remains uncertain. According to projections from Google Gemini, XRP could reach a maximum hypothetical price of $100 over the next ten years under highly favorable conditions. At that level, top 1% holders would control multimillion-dollar portfolios, while those in the top 5% could approach or surpass retirement benchmarks in many regions. However, such forecasts remain speculative. Market cycles, regulatory developments, adoption rates, and broader economic conditions will ultimately determine XRP’s long-term valuation. While placement on the XRP Rich List may improve the probability of achieving financial independence, it does not eliminate risk or guarantee retirement within a defined timeframe.

The comparison gained momentum after Kalshi’s head of crypto, John Wang, described prediction markets as “the meme coins of 2023,” arguing that both capture attention during periods when traders are searching for asymmetric opportunities. JUST IN: Head of crypto at Kalshi John Wang says “prediction markets are the memecoins of 2023.” pic.twitter.com/ZtGGHBSaht — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) December 15, 2025 The remark landed as meme coin activity cooled sharply following a volatile run that defined much of the last two years. Meme Coins Had Their Moment — Is This the Collapse Phase? Meme coins surged in 2023, driven by new token launches and heavy social media exposure. The sector’s total market capitalization reached nearly $22 billion by the end of that year, while trading activity expanded dramatically. Source: Coinmarketcap Data from the period shows average trading volume rising more than ninefold over the first eleven months. Two intense rallies defined the year, particularly an April–May burst fueled by highly speculative launches. That speculative energy carried into 2024, when meme coins climbed to an estimated peak market cap of around $150 billion in December, helped by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and a wave of political-themed tokens. The reversal was equally sharp. By late 2025, the sector’s total value had fallen below $42 billion, with daily volumes shrinking and individual tokens losing most of their prior gains. Source: Coinmarketcap Market data now shows memecoin trading volumes down roughly 85% from their highs, reflecting a broad pullback in risk appetite. Are Traders Done With Meme Coins? Prediction Markets Are Quietly Taking Over As meme coins faded, prediction markets moved in the opposite direction. Platforms such as Kalshi, Polymarket, and Limitless recorded a combined $44 billion in trading volume this year, with Kalshi alone reaching $1 billion in weekly volume, driven largely by sports and political contracts. Source: dune/datadashboards On-chain prediction markets have expanded even faster. Monthly volume has jumped from under $100 million in early 2024 to more than $13 billion today, a 130-fold increase, according to joint research from Keyrock and Dune Analytics. Non-sports markets, including economics, politics, and technology-related events, accounted for most of the growth in 2025. The structure of prediction markets differs sharply from memecoins, a point repeatedly raised by industry participants.

Supporters argue this creates clearer pricing and limits some of the manipulation risks that have plagued low-liquidity token markets. Honestly makes sense why people are just moving over to Polymarket and all these other prediction market platforms. You don’t have to worry about 12 year olds bundling coins, you don’t have worry about your “favorite” kol shilling a coin then full clipping soon after, you don’t… — GH0STEE (@gh0stee) December 15, 2025 Critics counter that returns are capped by design, making it harder for smaller traders to achieve outsized gains compared with early-stage memecoin trades. Can Prediction Markets Kill Meme Coins? Framing the trend as “prediction markets killing memecoins” misses the point. Memecoins are not dead. Liquidity has simply receded, and that contraction is affecting many other crypto sectors as well. History shows that meme-driven markets tend to hibernate, not disappear. When volatility returns and risk appetite expands, memecoins can resurface quickly. At the same time, prediction markets are clearly earning a durable user base. Their growth isn’t purely cyclical hype; it’s being driven by real-world events, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and demand for structured speculation. That gives them a resilience memecoins often lack during downturns. The more likely outcome is coexistence, not replacement . Memecoins will continue to dominate during speculative surges and attention-driven cycles. Prediction markets will attract traders seeking clarity, probability-based pricing, and event-driven exposure. They serve different psychological and financial needs. If anything, the current shift shows a maturing crypto market, one where capital rotates rather than evaporates and where speculation takes multiple forms instead of clustering around a single narrative.

Investors who deposited fiat “into an FTX- or Alameda-related account” between 2019 and 2022 are encouraged to submit claims for a $10 million settlement filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California The lawsuit indicates that Investors have until Jan. 30 to opt out or file a claim as part of a settlement that “resolves a lawsuit over whether Silvergate Bank, Silvergate Capital Corporation, and Alan J. Lane aided and abetted tortious conduct on the part of FTX, Alameda, and Sam Bankman-Fried. “The Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate ,” said a Dec. 8 court filing asking for approval. “It marks a significant recovery from the bankrupt Silvergate and will provide additional relief, beyond that obtained in the FTX Bankruptcy, for those affected by the multi-billion-dollar collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.” Court sets final hearing as FTX-linked investors eye recovery Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro will hold a final hearing to consider the settlement on Feb. 9, giving any investors tied to FTX and Alameda over 30 days to file claims. According to court filings, the FTX bankruptcy case has achieved over 46,000 potential claimants via mail, which could result in proportional payments from the $10 million settlement. Silvergate voluntarily wound down operations in March 2023. It was initially one of the few crypto-friendly banks in the US that had ties to the FTX exchange at the time of its collapse in November 2022. While most criminal cases against former FTX and Alameda executives have been resolved over the past three years, some civil cases remain, as well as a potential prosecution of another individual linked to the exchange. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame are serving federal prison sentences for their roles in the collapse. At the same time, executives Nishad Singh and Gary Wang received time served. Additionally, Michelle Bond, wife of Salame, faces campaign finance charges linked to FTX funds in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Her legal team says that prosecutors induced a guilty plea from Salame on the promise that they would not pursue a case against Bond. The next evidentiary hearing for Bond’s case is scheduled for March 4. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison moves to a community confinement program On related developments, former cryptocurrency executive Caroline Ellison, who was once Sam Bankman-Fried’s girlfriend, has been quietly transferred out of federal prison after serving approximately 11 months of her two-year sentence, according to Business Insider. The 31-year-old was moved on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to a community confinement program, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed. That indicates Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, will still be in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso noted. “For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual’s specific location while in community confinement,” Giamusso said. Data from prison records list Ellison’s projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. When reached out by reporters, her attorneys declined to comment for this story. In early November 2024, Ellison reported to the low-security Danbury prison to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s business empire. She had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme. Ellison served as the main witness in Bankman-Fried’s 2023 criminal trial , testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars’ worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.

In a recent commentary, Claver outlined how inefficiencies embedded in legacy banking frameworks continue to lock trillions of dollars out of productive use, creating conditions that favor neutral, real-time settlement assets. Legacy Banking and the $27 Trillion Liquidity Constraint Claver pointed to the continued reliance on correspondent banking structures, particularly the use of nostro and vostro accounts, as a major source of inefficiency. According to his assessment, banks worldwide must collectively immobilize roughly $27 trillion to facilitate cross-border payments. This capital remains parked to ensure transaction completion, rather than circulating through lending, investment, or economic activity. While the recent global adoption of ISO 20022 has improved data standards and communication between institutions, Claver emphasized that it does not resolve the underlying settlement delays. In his view, the standard serves as an upgrade to messaging infrastructure, not a solution to liquidity fragmentation or pre-funding requirements. Why Stablecoins Do Not Solve Institutional Settlement Claver also challenged the notion that stablecoins alone can address these issues. He argued that most stablecoins function as liabilities tied to specific issuers, making them unsuitable as neutral settlement tools between competing institutions. From a balance-sheet perspective, banks remain reluctant to hold digital liabilities issued by other entities, particularly at scale. He further noted that widespread institutional reliance on stablecoins could recreate existing inefficiencies. Managing multiple issuer-specific digital assets would fragment liquidity and increase operational complexity, undermining the efficiency gains the technology aims to deliver. XRP as a Neutral Settlement Layer Against this backdrop, Claver positioned XRP as a settlement asset designed to operate independently of institutional balance sheets. He highlighted XRP’s ability to facilitate value transfer without pre-funded accounts, while settling transactions in seconds at low cost. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Claver, this neutrality allows XRP to function as a bridge between financial infrastructures without introducing counterparty exposure. He also referenced the XRP Ledger’s operational history, noting its long-term stability and extensive testing by financial institutions for backend settlement use cases rather than consumer-facing payments. Tokenized Deposits, AMMs, and Market Structure Shifts Claver suggested that banks are more likely to adopt tokenized deposits and on-chain financial products than to rely on public stablecoins. These instruments allow institutions to maintain yield from treasury holdings while enabling real-time settlement and programmability. He also addressed the growing role of automated market makers on networks like the XRP Ledger, arguing that they can reduce liquidity gaps, tighten spreads, and improve price efficiency through continuous rebalancing. Finally, Claver warned that high leverage, rising debt levels, and prolonged restrictive monetary policy could trigger a broad market repricing across asset classes. However, he framed this as a transition rather than a collapse. In such an environment, governments and institutions would require real-time settlement systems, shared ledgers, and programmable financial infrastructure to manage liquidity and policy execution effectively. Within that framework, Claver believes XRP could benefit as financial markets shift toward more automated, efficient, and interoperable settlement mechanisms.

55954238,646168,1766016033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55954238.jpeg,Grayscale Predicts When Bitcoin Price Will Hit A New All-Time High,https://bitcoinist.com/when-bitcoin-price-all-time-high/,"Grayscale, one of the world’s largest digital asset managers, outlined its 2026 Digital Asset Outlook, projecting that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. The forecast is based on structural changes in market design, expanding institutional participation, and broader macroeconomic forces . These developments form the foundation of Grayscale’s view that capital structure and demand dynamics will define Bitcoin’s next market phase. Institutional Capital Redefines The Bitcoin Price Growth Curve A central pillar of Grayscale’s outlook is the transition of Bitcoin from a retail-led asset to an institutionally supported financial instrument . The firm argues that the market is entering a phase where large allocators, including asset managers, advisory platforms, and long-term capital pools, are no longer evaluating Bitcoin as an experiment but as a portfolio component. This shift fundamentally alters demand behavior, replacing short-term trading flows with measured, strategic allocations. Grayscale highlights that regulatory progress and clearer market rules are reducing friction for institutions that previously remained sidelined. As operational and compliance barriers fall, capital that once avoided digital assets due to uncertainty can now enter with greater confidence. This gradual but persistent inflow model creates sustained upward pressure on price rather than sharp, unstable spikes. Crucially, Grayscale notes that institutional exposure to Bitcoin remains relatively small compared to traditional asset classes. From a portfolio construction perspective, this leaves significant room for expansion. Even modest increases in allocation percentages can translate into meaningful demand, especially given Bitcoin’s fixed supply. The firm views this imbalance between potential demand and limited issuance as a key reason price discovery is expected to continue upward into 2026. Macro Pressures And Supply Dynamics Set The Stage For New Highs Beyond institutional adoption , Grayscale’s outlook identifies macroeconomic conditions as a key driver shaping Bitcoin’s next phase of price expansion. Elevated sovereign debt, currency dilution, and persistent inflation risks are directing capital toward assets with transparent and finite supply. In this context, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance schedule reinforces its role as a macro-aligned asset. This macro framing also underpins Grayscale’s reassessment of Bitcoin’s traditional four-year market cycles . As the asset integrates further into mainstream finance, the firm argues that historical, halving-centered models are losing relevance. In their place, Bitcoin’s valuation is increasingly influenced by liquidity conditions, market access, and investor behavior aligned with other macro-sensitive assets. This transition signals a market responding to structural inputs rather than repeating legacy patterns. Supply dynamics further strengthen this view . As issuance slows and long-term Bitcoin holders retain more coins, market liquidity tightens. Combined with expanding demand channels, this creates an environment where price appreciation is supported by structural fundamentals rather than episodic surges. Grayscale’s analysis indicates that these factors could drive Bitcoin to a new all-time high in early 2026.

What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. Related Reading: Who Really Sold The Dip? On-Chain Data Exposes Bitcoin’s True Sellers However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. The New Fundamentals Behind Bitcoin’s Supercycle Thesis According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory.

Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies.

A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

The Board said the financial system changed enough to make the earlier rule useless. The new move applies to both insured and uninsured banks under the Fed’s watch and brings direct consequences for crypto-linked firms that want stable access to payment rails. Fed changes federal access for crypto companies in America “New technologies offer efficiencies to banks and improved products and services to bank customers,” Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said . “By creating a pathway for responsible, innovative products and services, the Board is helping ensure that the banking sector remains safe and sound while also modern, efficient, and effective.” The 2023 policy forced state member banks to follow the same activity rules that other federal regulators used. It also tried to lay out how banks should handle new tools. After it came out, the Board said the financial system shifted and its own understanding grew, so it cleared the rule and replaced it. The new policy lets banks under the Fed take part in certain innovative activities, which matters for firms like Circle, Paxos, Tether, and BitGo. These companies will now place customer reserves directly at the Fed instead of routing everything through commercial banks. That lowers costs and cuts counterparty risk while giving them more control over flows. Some companies tried other ways to reach the Fed’s payment system.The big one was specialty banking charters. One example is Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institution setup, built for crypto companies. Custodia Bank, one of the first to use it, sued the Federal Reserve Board and the Kansas City Fed for what it called “a patently unlawful delay.” A court dismissed the case, and Custodia appealed.

She will now work with MoonPay as its Chief Legal and Administrative Officer. With Caroline Pham’s exit from the CFTC to join the crypto payment company, MoonPay, Mike Selig, a crypto lawyer will fill her role. She follows a path walked by Bo Hines , former White House Crypto Council executive director, who joined Tether, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Hines reportedly now leads the firm’s US expansion activity, while tasked with maintaining compliance with the new requirements of the GENIUS bill. Caroline Pham leaves the CFTC Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is moving to the crypto payments company called MoonPay after working at the commission for nearly four years. “I’m excited to join MoonPay at a pivotal moment,” Pham said in a statement . Pham’s new role involves overseeing all global legal and administrative functions while also leading the company’s policy and regulatory strategy in Washington. Pham’s role at CFTC will be filled by crypto lawyer, Mike Selig, who is now preparing for Senate confirmation. The final vote on his appointment is expected early next week. Pham spent seven years at Citigroup, one of Wall Street’s largest banks before being confirmed as a Republican commissioner starting in 2022. She went on to be unanimously elected as acting chairman in January 2025. During her tenure, Pham encouraged modernization efforts at the CFTC through what she called the “Crypto Sprint,” a series of initiatives designed to bring regulatory clarity to digital asset markets. On December 4, she announced that listed spot crypto products would trade for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets through CFTC-registered futures exchanges. She also launched a pilot program that allowed Bitcoin, Ether, and stablecoin USDC to be used as collateral in U.S. derivatives markets. Tokenized assets such as Treasuries and money market funds were also explored for the same purpose. Last week, Pham said the agency would be withdrawing guidance focused on the “actual delivery” of digital assets, calling it “outdated and overly complex”. She also established the CFTC CEO Innovation Council, naming twelve CEOs to the forum and the Digital Asset Markets Pilot Program, launched on December 8, 2025. Her partnership with SEC Chair Paul Atkins resulted in improved collaboration between the two agencies, despite previous clashes over digital asset oversight. Why did MoonPay hire Pham? MoonPay, founded by Ivan Soto-Wright, Victor Faramond and Maximilian Crown in 2019, is a Miami-based company that provides payment infrastructure for users to purchase cryptocurrencies and digital assets using traditional payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers, and mobile payment options. The company reportedly has more than 30 million customers across 180 countries and supports more than 500 enterprise customers in both crypto and fintech industries. MoonPay raised $555 million in November 2021 in an investment round led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. The deal valued MoonPay at $3.4 billion. In March 2025, the company acquired the crypto checkout startup, Helio, for $175 million and announced the acquisition of the stablecoin platform, Iron. In the second half of 2025, MoonPay secured both its New York BitLicense and New York Limited Purpose Trust Charter. The company’s CEO, Ivan Soto-Wright, called Pham “one of the most influential leaders in U.S. financial regulation” and said her experience in regulatory expertise and traditional finance, as well as her deep understanding of market structure makes her “the perfect leader to guide MoonPay through our next chapter of growth and compliance excellence.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The latest reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plunged to a mere 17, firmly entrenched in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This powerful sentiment gauge is flashing red, but savvy investors know that extreme fear often precedes significant market moves. Let’s decode what this critical number really means for Bitcoin, altcoins, and your investment strategy. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial tool that quantifies the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. It scores sentiment on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A reading of 17, as we see now, indicates that fear is the dominant force driving investor behavior. This index isn’t just a guess; it’s calculated using a specific, weighted formula analyzing real market data: Volatility (25%): Measures how wildly prices are swinging. Market Volume (25%): Tracks the momentum of trading activity. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of conversations online. Surveys (15%): Gathers direct sentiment from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Watches if money is flowing into or out of Bitcoin relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Monitors search interest for cryptocurrency terms. Therefore, when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reads 17, it’s a composite signal from all these areas screaming caution. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear? Market sentiment is a powerful, self-fulfilling force. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear, it often leads to panic selling, where investors offload assets at a loss simply to exit the market. This can create exaggerated price drops that may not reflect long-term fundamentals. Historically, however, periods of extreme fear have frequently presented contrarian buying opportunities for patient investors. The key question becomes: is this fear justified by underlying issues, or is it an emotional overreaction? Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a market governed by a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a disciplined approach. First, avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotion. Instead, use this time for research and review your portfolio’s risk tolerance. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This strategy involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, which can be highly effective in volatile, fearful markets as it removes the stress of timing the bottom. Finally, this is an ideal moment to rebalance. You might find high-quality projects are undervalued, presenting a strategic entry point. The Contrarian Perspective: Is This the Time to Buy? Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 epitomizes the latter. For long-term believers in blockchain technology, these fearful periods can be windows of opportunity. However, it’s vital to distinguish between a healthy market correction and a fundamental breakdown. Conduct thorough due diligence on any asset before committing capital, ensuring your moves are strategic, not reactive. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 17 is a clear snapshot of a nervous market. While it signals high risk and potential for further downside, it also hints at the possibility of future reward for those with conviction and a clear plan. Use this metric not as a standalone buy/sell signal, but as a crucial piece of context in your broader investment framework. By understanding the crowd’s emotion, you can better manage your own. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 mean? A: A score of 17 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-25). It indicates that negative sentiment and panic are currently dominating the cryptocurrency market, often driven by price drops and negative news. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: It is a reliable indicator of current market sentiment, not a direct price predictor. However, extreme readings (like 17) have often coincided with market bottoms or tops, making it a valuable contrarian tool. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is typically updated once per day, providing a daily snapshot of market emotion. Q: Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? A> It can be a potential opportunity, but never base a decision solely on this index. Always combine sentiment analysis with fundamental and technical research appropriate for your risk profile. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major crypto news platforms also feature it in their market analysis sections. Q: Has the index ever been lower than 17? A: Yes. During major market crashes like the COVID-19 sell-off in March 2020, the index has briefly dipped into single digits, indicating even more severe panic.

A startling drop in network activity to a one-year low signals a major shift: a significant Ethereum retail investor exodus . This departure of everyday participants, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain, creates a critical hurdle for ETH’s price recovery. Let’s explore why this trend is so consequential for the market’s short-term trajectory. What Does the Ethereum Retail Investor Exodus Actually Mean? Recent on-chain data paints a clear picture. The number of active Ethereum sending addresses has plummeted to roughly 170,000. This metric is a direct proxy for retail participation. Simply put, fewer unique addresses conducting transactions means fewer small-scale investors are trading or interacting with the network. This trend isn’t entirely unexpected. Historically, retail activity dwindles after extended periods of market volatility and price declines. The current Ethereum retail investor exodus reflects a natural, if concerning, market phase: weakened short-term confidence and a ‘wait-and-see’ approach from the crowd that often fuels bullish momentum. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Network Activity From an on-chain perspective, such depressed activity presents a paradox. On one hand, it often indicates that intense selling pressure has exhausted itself. The weak hands have likely left, suggesting the immediate downward push may be over. However, the other edge of this sword is far sharper. The absence of retail traders also means a stark lack of new buying demand. Analysts point out that retail investors are typically the primary catalyst for the initial surge in a rebound. Their collective, albeit smaller, purchases help build the momentum that attracts larger players. Therefore, without this group, the path for a sustained ETH rebound becomes much steeper. The market loses a key layer of foundational demand. Why Is Retail Participation So Crucial for an ETH Rebound? Think of the market as a pyramid. Institutional and whale activity sits at the top, but the broad base is built by retail. Their role is multifaceted: Liquidity Providers: They add depth to the market, making it easier to buy and sell. Momentum Starters: A wave of small buys can signal a shift in sentiment, encouraging others. Network Users: Their transactions validate utility beyond pure speculation, supporting ecosystem health. The current Ethereum retail investor exodus weakens all these functions. While institutional interest remains vital, history shows that robust recoveries often need a ‘retail-first’ spark to ignite broader rallies. What’s the Path Forward for Ethereum? This analysis doesn’t spell doom for Ethereum, but it does highlight a challenging transition. The network’s fate in the near term may depend on other factors stepping in to fill the void left by retail. Key aspects to watch include: Institutional Adoption: Continued growth in ETF flows or enterprise usage. Protocol Upgrades: Successful implementation of future improvements that boost efficiency and appeal. Macro Environment: Broader financial conditions becoming more favorable for risk assets. Until then, the limited upside potential remains a reality. The market is in a state of equilibrium at a low activity level, waiting for a new catalyst to either bring retail back or unlock a different source of demand. Conclusion: A Market in Waiting The Ethereum retail investor exodus is a powerful signal the market is sending. It tells us that short-term speculative enthusiasm has cooled significantly. While this may stabilize prices temporarily, it severely limits the potential for a vigorous, short-term ETH rebound . The road to recovery now likely requires patience, fundamental development, or a major external catalyst to rebuild the confidence of the everyday investor. For now, Ethereum’s network awaits its next wave of users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does low retail activity mean the Ethereum price will definitely fall further? A: Not necessarily. It primarily indicates a lack of buying pressure for a strong rebound. The price could stabilize or move sideways until new demand emerges from retail or other sources like institutions. Q: How long do these retail exodus phases typically last? A> There’s no fixed timeline. It can last for weeks or months, often ending when market sentiment improves, volatility decreases, or a positive news catalyst attracts attention back to the asset. Q: Are institutional investors also leaving Ethereum? A> The data discussed specifically highlights retail metrics. Institutional flows can be separate; they may even be accumulating during quiet retail periods, which is a scenario some analysts watch for. Q: What metric is used to measure ‘active addresses’? A> ‘Active sending addresses’ typically counts the number of unique addresses that were the initiator (sender) of a successful transaction on the network over a given period, like daily. It’s a key gauge of unique user activity. Q: As a retail investor, should I avoid Ethereum right now? A> This is not financial advice. However, understanding market phases is crucial. Periods of low activity can be used for research and planning. Many investors see them as times to cautiously build positions based on long-term belief, not short-term momentum.

For crypto enthusiasts and financial professionals alike, this shift could accelerate the merger of old-world finance with new-world technology. What Was the Fed’s Restrictive Guideline? The withdrawn guideline primarily affected banks that operate without FDIC deposit insurance. It created a high barrier to entry, effectively limiting their ability to offer crypto-related services. The rule’s impact was starkly illustrated when the Fed cited it as grounds to deny a master account application from Custodia Bank, a financial institution built specifically for the digital asset space. This denial highlighted the tension between innovative fintech models and established regulatory frameworks. Why Did the Federal Reserve Make This Change? The decision reflects a growing acknowledgment within the Fed that the financial landscape is evolving. In a statement, Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman framed the move as forward-thinking. She emphasized that new technologies, including those underpinning the cryptocurrency business , can enhance bank efficiency and allow them to provide better products to customers. Key reasons behind the shift include: Promoting Responsible Innovation: The Fed aims to create a clear path for banks to explore digital assets safely. Enhancing Competitiveness: Allowing banks to adapt ensures the U.S. banking system remains efficient and competitive globally. Managing Risk: By bringing crypto activities under the banking umbrella, regulators can better oversee associated risks. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Banking? This regulatory shift is more than a procedural update; it’s a signal. It suggests that federal regulators are beginning to view the cryptocurrency business not as a fringe activity, but as a potential component of mainstream finance. For traditional banks, this opens a new frontier. They can now more seriously explore: Custody services for digital assets. Facilitating crypto payments and transfers. Developing hybrid financial products that blend traditional and digital finance. For companies like Custodia Bank, the door for reconsideration may now be open. However, challenges remain. Banks must still navigate a complex web of state and federal regulations, and they must prove they have robust risk management systems in place for handling volatile digital assets. Conclusion: A Step Toward Financial Synthesis The Federal Reserve’s decision to withdraw its restrictive guideline is a cautiously optimistic development. It represents a move away from blanket prohibition and toward a framework of supervised integration. While it doesn’t equate to a free pass, it establishes a crucial precedent: innovation in the cryptocurrency business can have a place within the regulated banking sector. This alignment is essential for building a more inclusive, efficient, and modern financial system that serves the needs of a digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean any bank can now start a cryptocurrency business? A: Not exactly. The withdrawal removes one specific barrier, but banks must still comply with all other applicable banking laws, secure necessary approvals, and demonstrate they can manage the unique risks of digital assets. Q: What is a “master account” and why was it important for Custodia Bank? A: A master account at the Federal Reserve allows a bank to directly access crucial payment systems and services. Without it, a bank like Custodia faces significant operational hurdles, making the previous denial a major setback. Q: Will this lead to lower fees for crypto trading and services? A: Potentially. Increased competition from traditional banks entering the cryptocurrency business could drive innovation and lower costs for consumers over time, but this is not an immediate guarantee. Q: How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A: In the long run, it could mean more secure and familiar avenues to buy, sell, and hold crypto through established banks, potentially increasing mainstream trust and adoption. Q: Is the FDIC insurance rule no longer important? A> FDIC insurance remains a critical consumer protection for traditional deposits. This change specifically addresses access for non-FDIC insured banks to engage in crypto, not the insurance rule itself. Q: What should I watch for next? A> Watch for announcements from regional or smaller banks about pilot crypto programs, and see if the Fed approves new master account applications from crypto-focused institutions.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has now taken a significant step to clear the air. The commission has issued new, interim guidance specifically addressing the custody of digital asset securities by registered broker-dealers. This move aims to resolve a critical compliance hurdle and provide much-needed direction for firms operating at the intersection of legacy finance and blockchain technology. What Are the New SEC Custody Guidelines? The core of the SEC’s announcement revolves around Rule 15c3-3, the longstanding regulation governing how broker-dealers must safeguard customer assets. The commission stated that if a broker-dealer meets specific requirements, digital asset securities held for customers can be considered in the firm’s “physical possession” for compliance purposes. This interpretation is crucial because it bridges a gap between the digital nature of these assets and the physical possession concepts in traditional rules. This guidance acts as an interim measure. The SEC explicitly noted it is still reviewing broader issues related to broker-dealer custody of crypto assets. However, by providing this clarity now, the commission is responding directly to requests from market participants who have been navigating a regulatory gray area. Why Does This Guidance Matter for the Crypto Industry? The lack of clear rules has been a major barrier for institutional adoption. Traditional financial firms have been hesitant to offer custodial services for digital asset securities due to compliance risks. This new guidance provides a potential pathway. Here are the key implications: Reduced Uncertainty: Firms now have an official SEC stance to reference when structuring their custody solutions, reducing legal and regulatory risk. Institutional Gateway: Clearer rules could encourage more broker-dealers to safely hold digital asset securities , paving the way for greater institutional investment. Compliance Roadmap: The guidance outlines the SEC’s current thinking, allowing companies to align their operations proactively rather than guessing. What Challenges and Questions Remain? While this is a positive step, it is not a final resolution. The guidance is interim, meaning the rules could evolve. Furthermore, the SEC has not yet detailed all the “certain requirements” a broker-dealer must meet. Key questions for the market include: What specific technological and operational safeguards will satisfy the SEC? How does this guidance interact with state-level money transmitter licenses? Will the requirements differ for various types of digital asset securities ? Therefore, while the path is brighter, firms must proceed with caution and likely engage in further dialogue with regulators to ensure full compliance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses and Investors For broker-dealers and crypto-native firms seeking legitimacy, this is a call to action. Engaging with legal counsel to interpret the guidance in the context of your specific business model is essential. For investors, this development signals a maturing market where established regulatory frameworks are beginning to formally encompass digital assets, potentially leading to more secure and mainstream investment products. Conclusion: A Step Toward Regulatory Integration The SEC’s new custody guidelines for digital asset securities represent a meaningful, though incremental, move toward integrating cryptocurrency into the existing financial regulatory system. By addressing the custody question under Rule 15c3-3, the commission has provided a foundational piece of clarity that the industry has urgently needed. This action fosters a more secure environment for institutional participation and underscores the ongoing process of defining the future of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Rule 15c3-3? A: It’s a key SEC rule, often called the “Customer Protection Rule,” that requires broker-dealers to safeguard customer cash and securities, keeping them separate from the firm’s own assets. Q: Does this mean all cryptocurrencies are now considered securities? A: No. This guidance specifically applies to assets already classified as digital asset securities . The broader debate over what constitutes a security in crypto continues. Q: Is this guidance final law? A: No, it is interim guidance and a statement of the SEC’s current interpretive position. It provides a compliance framework but may be subject to change as the commission continues its review. Q: How does this affect individual crypto investors? A> In the long term, it could lead to more regulated and insured custody options from established financial institutions, potentially increasing safety for investors holding digital asset securities . Q: What should a crypto company do next? A> Firms acting as broker-dealers should consult with securities lawyers to understand how the guidance applies to their operations and what specific controls they need to implement.

A token starts to gain traction in a steady, not a hyped manner, but due to the fact that progress and involvement are moving in the same direction. And that is what is shaping around a new DeFi Crypto being sold at a price under $0.04. Having registered a 250% growth since its initial phase, investor interest is gathering as more now evaluate the cryptocurrency to purchase against the market at large which is still picky. Presale Progress and What MUTM is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale was launched at the beginning of 2025 starting with a price of $0.01 and advanced through a planned phase model, reaching a point of $0.035 within its existing price range. That shift is 250% of growth, which was not caused by volatility but intended stage development. Involvement has increased with the growth. The project has received greater attention in terms of raised funds bringing together over 18,400 holders and exceeding $19.30M in raised funds. Out of a total supply of 4B tokens, 45.5 or 1.82B tokens are distributed to early distribution with 820M tokens already sold. Phase 6 is currently more than 99% allocated and this implies that there is very limited remaining at the present level. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform based on practical usage at a protocol level. Assets are provided by the users to gain yield on the borrowing demand. Liquidity is availed to borrowers whereby collateral is posted at stipulated rules that regulate rates and levels of risk. Creation of value is associated with action as opposed to attention, and that explains why MUTM can rightfully be described as a DeFi crypto designed to engage in action on a longer-term basis. V1 and Growth Features The second significant milestone is execution. The official X announcement says that in Q4 2025, V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet. With the initial assets being ETH and USDT, this release introduces the Liquidity Pool,mtToken framework, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot. One attribute of the protocol is mtTokens. Users provide assets, the increase in redeemable value of the mtTokens happens when borrowers pay off interests. This promotes possession of behavior that is associated with actual usage. It also has a buy and distribute mechanism. On the open market, MUTM is bought and redistributed to those who are willing to place a stake on the safety module in the form of mtTokens. This is a system level demand as the level of borrowing activity increases. Some prognosticators in a temperate tone of voice think that in the case V1 execution and first-mover adoption are in constant motion, MUTM could be selling in the $0.20 to $0.25 range. That would be in the range of 6x-7x up from the current price of $0.035, and run by a usage and not a hype-cycle. Long-term Scenarios Other than the launch, Mutuum Finance intends to roll out a protocol-native stablecoin that is pegged on the interest earned in the system. Stablecoins based on in-house activity tend to enhance the liquidity and maintain value within the ecosystem. The roadmap also includes layer-2 expansion. The participation can be expanded as a result of lower transaction expenditure and rates of execution particularly when it comes to lending protocols that have recurring interactions. The ChainLink-supported fallback and aggregated feeds based on Oracle infrastructure form the basis of precise pricing of collateral valuation and liquidations. Security preparation is a plus of the project approaching V1. Mutuum Finance passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan mark. Simultaneously, Halborn Security is going through the finalized smart contracts and a bug bounty exists of $50,000 USD to find vulnerabilities in advance. The advertising to the community is still obvious with the 24-hour leaderboard rewarding the daily best player with $500 in MUTM. These characteristics have been beneficial in keeping it going on Phase 6 in its concluding phase.

After months of declining prices and heightened volatility across crypto markets, attention has shifted from short-term price action to structural changes that could improve HYPE’s supply dynamics and investor expectations. At the center of the debate is a governance proposal by the Hyper Foundation to formally treat all HYPE held in the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund as permanently burned. While these tokens are already locked in an address without a private key, the vote seeks to codify their removal from performance. If approved, the decision would mark one of the most significant supply reductions in the protocol’s history, removing more than 37 million HYPE, over 10% of circulating supply, through a validator-backed consensus. Governance Vote Puts Hyperliquid Supply Structure in Focus The Assistance Fund accumulates HYPE through an automated mechanism that converts trading fees generated on Hyperliquid’s perpetuals exchange into the native token. These tokens sit in a system address that has never been controlled by a private key, making them inaccessible unless a protocol-level upgrade is authorized. Under the current proposal, validators are being asked to establish a binding social consensus that no such upgrade will ever occur. Voting is stake-weighted, with validators signaling their positions by December 21, and final results are expected on December 24. Approval would effectively lock in a more restrictive supply model, preventing the Assistance Fund from being used for grants, liquidity support, or emergency measures in the future. The proposal follows earlier, unadopted discussions around broader supply cuts in 2025, suggesting a renewed effort to clarify HYPE’s long-term monetary framework rather than pursue incremental adjustments. Market Reaction and Longer-Term Outlook Hyperliquid ( HYPE) has stabilized near the $26 level after several days of losses, with market data suggesting the proposed burn is not yet fully priced in. Futures open interest has climbed above $1.5 billion, and funding rates have turned positive, pointing to growing bullish positioning ahead of the validator vote. In contrast, spot market activity remains muted, as trading volumes have edged lower and technical indicators continue to reflect lingering bearish momentum. Beyond short-term price action, analysts are increasingly focused on Hyperliquid’s longer-term valuation framework. Cantor Fitzgerald has cited the protocol’s fee-driven and deflationary design as a potential driver of sustained growth, projecting billions in annual fees if adoption expands. From this perspective, the Assistance Fund burn is seen as a test of whether stricter supply discipline can help rebuild confidence, with the vote outcome likely shaping how Hyperliquid’s economic model is evaluated into 2026.

Despite holding above a major confluence zone, repeated rejections overhead suggest buyers are losing control. With macro pressure building and liquidity levels still untested, the next move from here could define whether BTC stabilizes or slides into a deeper reset. Lower-Timeframe Rejection Keeps The Downtrend In Control Crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe revealed in a recent post that Bitcoin has faced a clear rejection at a key resistance level. This failure signals that the short-term downtrend remains intact on lower timeframes, confirming that selling pressure currently outweighs buying momentum in the immediate term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details To flip this short-term bias, Van de Poppe expects a clear breakout above the $88,000 level. A successful move above this mark would serve as a strong, unequivocal signal to the markets that the corrective phase is over and that upward momentum is likely to take hold from that point forward. If buyers fail to achieve this necessary breakout, it remains highly probable that the price will pursue liquidity targets below, specifically targeting a test at $83,000 for liquidity. Should that fail, a further descent to the $80,000 level will trigger stop-losses. Finally, Van De Poppe connected the technical outlook to the broader economic environment. Given the high volume of macroeconomic events scheduled to take place over the course of the week, such as FOMC, Poppe believes that the market could experience significant volatility and end up reaching one of the predicted downside liquidity tests. $93,000 Rejection Stalls Momentum, but Weekly Structure Still Intact According to a weekly chart update by Crypto Damus, Bitcoin recently faced a firm rejection at the $93,000 resistance level. Despite that setback, price action remains constructive for now, with BTC holding above the crucial $86,000 weekly support zone. This area is reinforced with the key 100-week moving average confluence, making it an important level to watch in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ That said, the broader structure still leaves room for deeper downside. Crypto Damus notes that a full retracement toward the rising wedge breakdown target cannot be ruled out, which aligns closely with the April low around the $78,000 region. A move into that zone would represent a more pronounced corrective phase within the larger cycle. Looking further ahead, a deeper bear-market-style retest may ultimately present a more attractive long-term opportunity. A revisit of the $70,000 level is highlighted as a potential high-conviction buying area, should the market extend its pullback.

The latest data delivers a sobering reality check. CoinMarketCap’s crucial Altcoin Season Index has held firm at a lowly 18, unchanged from the previous day. This persistent reading signals that Bitcoin continues to command the crypto market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Let’s decode what this stagnant index truly means for your portfolio. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index acts as the crypto market’s primary gauge for investor sentiment and capital rotation. It meticulously measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The rule is simple yet powerful: if 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that period, an official ‘altcoin season’ is declared. A score nearing 100 screams a raging altcoin bull market, while a low score like 18 confirms we are firmly in a ‘Bitcoin season’. This metric is essential for timing your market entries and exits. Why Is the Index Stuck at Such a Low Level? The index’s stagnation at 18 is not a random fluctuation; it reflects deep-seated market dynamics. Currently, Bitcoin is absorbing the majority of institutional and safe-haven capital, especially with the excitement around Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This creates a significant challenge for altcoins, which often struggle to gain traction when Bitcoin dominates headlines and liquidity. Furthermore, the higher risk profile of altcoins makes them less attractive during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or when market sentiment is cautious. Therefore, this low Altcoin Season Index reading is a clear signal that broad, risk-on appetite for smaller cryptocurrencies is currently muted. How Can Traders Use This Information Strategically? Instead of viewing a low index as bad news, savvy traders use it to formulate a strategic plan. Here are actionable insights based on the current Altcoin Season Index of 18: Practice Patience with Altcoin Accumulation: A low index can be an opportunity to research and slowly accumulate high-quality altcoin projects at relatively lower prices, building a position before a potential season shift. Focus on Bitcoin-Centric Strategies: While the index is low, consider that trends favor Bitcoin. Allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to BTC or Bitcoin-related investments aligns with the dominant trend. Set Alert Levels for the Index: Monitor for a sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index above key levels (like 25 or 50). A consistent climb can serve as an early warning signal that capital is beginning to rotate, prompting you to re-evaluate your altcoin holdings. When Should We Expect the Altcoin Season Index to Rise? Predicting the exact turn is difficult, but history shows catalysts exist. A sustained rise in the Altcoin Season Index typically follows a period of Bitcoin consolidation or stability, where investors seek higher returns elsewhere. Other potential triggers include breakthrough developments in major altcoin ecosystems (like Ethereum upgrades), a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, or a wave of positive regulatory clarity for specific altcoin sectors. The key is to watch for a combination of Bitcoin strength plateauing and altcoins beginning to show independent, positive momentum on their charts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin-Dominant Landscape The Altcoin Season Index holding at 18 is a powerful piece of market intelligence. It tells a story of caution, dominance, and waiting. For now, Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of the crypto hill. However, understanding this index equips you not with despair, but with patience and preparedness. Use this time to conduct thorough research, strengthen your core Bitcoin position, and prepare a watchlist for when the index finally begins its inevitable climb, signaling the next chapter of altcoin opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 18 mean? A: A score of 18 indicates that very few altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the measured 90-day period. It strongly suggests the market is in a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where BTC is the primary asset attracting gains and investor interest. Q2: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: The index is published by CoinMarketCap. You can typically find it on their website or by searching for ‘Altcoin Season Index’ on crypto data aggregators. Q3: Is it a bad time to buy altcoins when the index is low? A> Not necessarily. A low index can signal lower prices and accumulation opportunities for long-term believers in specific projects. However, it generally advises against expecting broad, short-term altcoin rallies until the index trends upward. Q4: What index score signals the start of an altcoin season? A: The threshold is 75. The index must cross and sustain above 75 to indicate that 75% of top altcoins are beating Bitcoin, officially marking an altcoin season. Q5: Does the index include meme coins like Dogecoin? A> Yes, if a meme coin is ranked within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap (and is not a stablecoin), its performance is factored into the Altcoin Season Index calculation. Q6: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoin market performance.

55954805,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=880431,1766020065,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55954805.jpeg,India’s competition regulator approves Coinbase minority stake in CoinDCX,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/india-approves-coinbase-stake-in-coindcx/,"The Competition Commission of India, which oversees and promotes fair competition in the country, has cleared Coinbase’s acquisition of a minority stake in cryptocurrency platform CoinDCX. In a notice released, the regulator confirmed its approval of Coinbase Global’s investment in DCX Global Limited, the parent company of CoinDCX. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal shared the update on X Wednesday, stating that the move strengthens the exchange’s “long-term partnership with one of India’s most established and trusted digital asset platforms.” Both the regulator’s announcement and Grewal’s post omitted the exact percentage of Coinbase’s stake in the crypto exchange. Reporters contacted a Coinbase spokesperson for comment, but had not received a response by the time of publication. The approval follows an October notice that Coinbase was planning to invest in CoinDCX with a post-money valuation of approximately $2.4 billion. At that time, Coinbase reported that CoinDCX had about $141 million in annual revenue as of July; however, it denied earlier reports that it was planning to purchase the company outright for $1 billion. Coinbase returns to Indian crypto market After a pause of more than two years, Coinbase has opened its app for registration in India. Currently, users can make crypto-to-crypto trades. However, speaking at India Blockchain Week (IBW), Coinbase’s APAC director, John O’Loghlen, stated that the company plans to introduce a fiat on-ramp in 2026, enabling users in the country to load money and purchase crypto. Coinbase opened its services in India in 2022, but within days, it had to shut down support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment network. This move followed the UPI operator National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI) refusal to acknowledge Coinbase’s presence in the country. Later in 2023, Coinbase ceased all operations for Indian users and requested that they close their accounts. “We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated. Because we wanted to kind of burn the boats [sic], have a clean slate here. As a commercial business person wanting to make money and active users, that’s like the worst thing you can do, and so you know it wasn’t without some hesitation,” O’Loghlen said. Coinbase navigates regulations and tax challenges while expanding in India The company began engaging with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency responsible for overseeing transactions and combating fraud, and eventually registered with them this year. In October, the app began onboarding users through early access, and it is now open to all users. Many internet companies have established their bases in India, aiming to tap into the world’s second-largest online user base. While social platforms and AI companies like OpenAI have experienced rapid growth in the market, it has been challenging for crypto companies to follow the same path due to the strict regulations and taxation surrounding cryptocurrencies. The South Asian country imposes a 30% tax on crypto income without any loss offset, and also charges a 1% deduction on each transaction, which may deter users from trading frequently. O’Loghlen said that the company hopes that the government will relax the taxation to make it less burdensome for people to hold digital assets. Despite these hurdles, Coinbase remains optimistic about the Indian market. Its venture arm recently increased its investment in local exchange CoinDCX, which has a post-money valuation of $2.45 billion. The company plans to expand its employee base of over 500 in the country by hiring for multiple roles serving both domestic and global markets. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The move positions the exchange among the first major centralized venues to adopt a permanent zero‑fee structure, reshaping the competitive landscape for crypto trading. Sources close to the situation indicated that this new policy will be made available to all significant trading products currently listed on the exchange. These products include: regular crypto spot gains, margin trading, perpetual derivatives contracts, tokenized securities, and over-the-counter (OTC) trades. In a statement, a representative from the cryptocurrency exchange mentioned that the fees will be eliminated for both takers and market makers across the board. With this strategic approach of eliminating trading costs, Bitfinex highlighted that the company aims to establish a new standard for key trading platforms and promote financial inclusion. It also expressed its belief that this new strategy will significantly enhance overall market liquidity and streamline the trading process, particularly for new users who are new to trading. Several analysts weighed in on the exchange’s new policy . They acknowledged that this decision will play a crucial role in expanding the company’s services and positioning it as one of the most budget-friendly options available for trading BTC , other virtual currencies, and tokenized securities. Bitfinex’s new policy sparks excitement in the crypto industry In a press release, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bitfinex, Paolo Ardoino, noted that the exchange believes in the existence of a high probability that it might successfully reward its current clients and greatly attract new customers to the platform. He also revealed that Bitfinex was excited to implement this strategy, thanks to the crypto exchange’s long history of generating profits and the superiority of its technology. Meanwhile, Ardoino claimed that they will closely observe the effects this new policy will have on the rest of the industry. His remarks followed Bitfinex’s recent comment about market behaviors encountered in the past. In this comment, the platform outlined a comparison that was released in a public message, declaring that the current period of reduced trading volume resembles the previous market cycles. Concerning this discovery, reports highlighted that such persistent reductions in spot trading have frequently occurred in the past just before major price fluctuations in the market, either going up or down. On the other hand, data from CoinMarketCap indicated that the total spot trading volume over the last month drastically decreased across all leading exchanges. This trading volume declined from more than $500 billion recorded at the start of November to about $250 billion this week. It was also confirmed that daily trading activity faced difficulties in maintaining the level above the $300 to $350 billion range in late November and early December. At times, volumes decreased to as low as $200 billion, representing the lowest level ever recorded in several months. Analysts attempted to explain that this ongoing drop followed a swift but sharp increase above $550 billion encountered in mid-November. Afterwards, trading volumes fell back at a faster rate. Phantom introduces a new feature in the market Meanwhile, Phantom , a popular Solana-based, non-custodial Web3 wallet, has introduced a new feature called Phantom Prediction Markets. This feature is powered by Kalshi, a prediction market platform that is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Notably, Bitfinex and Phantom have a functional relationship. To illustrate this claim, sources noted that Phantom’s support website recommends Bitfinex as a famous exchange that its clients can utilize to fund their Phantom wallets. In the meantime, reports have admitted that Phantom and Kalshi’s integration will enable users to explore trending events, stay updated on live odds, and trade tokenized positions based on real-life outcomes directly within the Phantom app. According to sources with knowledge on the matter, this outcome could include sectors such as politics, cryptocurrency prices, sports, culture, and economics. In a tweet, Phantom stated, “Prediction markets in Phantom are not available everywhere. They may come with risks such as changing prices, limited availability of assets, and possible regulatory changes. Trading in prediction markets might have transaction fees and other costs. If your guess is wrong, you could lose all the money you put into an event.

This initiative represents a potential turning point for how digital assets interact with traditional financial infrastructure, signaling a more collaborative approach to regulation that balances innovation with investor protection. What Does the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Trading Inquiry Mean for Markets? Commissioner Peirce’s announcement focuses specifically on how cryptocurrencies might trade on National Securities Exchanges (NSEs) and Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs). The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets recently published guidance addressing how platforms should handle trading pairs that mix security and non-security cryptocurrencies. This creates a framework that could finally bring clarity to a long-standing regulatory gray area. The commission emphasizes its willingness to support platforms that list legitimate trading pairs. This represents a significant shift from previous enforcement-heavy approaches. The goal is to establish regulations that protect investors while maintaining fair markets, without unnecessarily stifling the innovation that has characterized the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. Why Is This Feedback Process So Crucial Right Now? The timing of this inquiry couldn’t be more important. As cryptocurrency trading volumes continue to grow globally, U.S. markets risk falling behind without clear regulatory pathways. Commissioner Peirce, often called “Crypto Mom” for her supportive stance, recognizes that thoughtful regulation requires industry input. Key aspects the SEC wants market participants to address include: Practical challenges of listing cryptocurrency trading pairs on regulated exchanges Risk management considerations for mixed security/non-security pairs Investor protection mechanisms specific to digital assets Technical requirements for clearing and settlement How Could This Change Cryptocurrency Trading Infrastructure? If implemented thoughtfully, this regulatory framework could transform cryptocurrency trading in several fundamental ways. First, it could bring greater legitimacy and institutional participation to digital asset markets. Second, it might establish clearer custody and security standards that protect investors. Third, it could create more efficient price discovery through regulated venues. However, challenges remain. The SEC must balance several competing priorities: Maintaining market integrity without over-regulating Protecting retail investors while allowing innovation Creating rules flexible enough for rapidly evolving technology Ensuring U.S. competitiveness in global crypto markets What Are the Immediate Next Steps for Market Participants? Industry stakeholders now have a valuable opportunity to shape the future of cryptocurrency trading regulation. The feedback process allows exchanges, trading platforms, investors, and technology providers to share their practical experiences and concerns. This collaborative approach could result in more workable regulations that actually address real-world challenges. The SEC’s willingness to consider cryptocurrency trading on national exchanges represents a potential breakthrough. It acknowledges that digital assets are here to stay and need appropriate regulatory homes rather than constant enforcement actions. This could lead to more stable markets and greater investor confidence in cryptocurrency trading platforms. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for Crypto Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s initiative marks a potentially transformative moment for cryptocurrency trading in the United States. By seeking market input before finalizing rules, the SEC demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of digital assets’ unique characteristics. This approach could finally provide the regulatory clarity that has been missing since Bitcoin’s inception, potentially unlocking trillions in institutional investment while better protecting everyday investors. The success of this initiative will depend on robust participation from all market segments. The resulting framework could either propel U.S. cryptocurrency trading to global leadership or constrain it with impractical rules. The coming months of feedback and response will likely determine which path American digital asset markets take. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is Commissioner Peirce asking for? She’s seeking public feedback on how cryptocurrencies should be traded on regulated national exchanges and alternative trading systems, particularly regarding mixed security/non-security trading pairs. How does this differ from previous SEC approaches to crypto? This represents a more collaborative, forward-looking approach that seeks industry input before establishing rules, rather than relying primarily on enforcement actions after the fact. What types of cryptocurrency trading pairs are being considered? The SEC is particularly interested in frameworks for trading pairs that mix cryptocurrencies deemed securities with those considered non-securities, which has been a regulatory gray area. How can industry participants provide feedback? While specific submission guidelines will be published, typically the SEC accepts comments through its official website, with opportunities for both written submissions and potentially public hearings. What’s the timeline for this regulatory process? Regulatory processes typically take several months to a year, depending on the complexity of issues and volume of feedback received. How might this affect existing cryptocurrency exchanges? Existing exchanges might need to adjust their operations to comply with new standards, but they could also gain access to broader investor bases through integration with traditional financial infrastructure.

The software giant, known for its creative tools, now faces a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging it used pirated books to train its AI models. This case represents yet another battle in the ongoing war between content creators and tech companies over who owns the data that powers our AI future. What Exactly Is Adobe Accused Of in This AI Training Data Lawsuit? The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Oregon author Elizabeth Lyon, claims Adobe used unauthorized copies of copyrighted books to train its SlimLM program. SlimLM is described by Adobe as a small language model series optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. According to court documents, the company allegedly trained this model on the SlimPajama-627B dataset, which contains the controversial Books3 collection of 191,000 books. Elizabeth Lyon, who has written several guidebooks for non-fiction writing, discovered her works were included in the pretraining dataset without her permission. Her lawsuit states: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3). Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.” Why Is This Adobe AI Lawsuit Different From Other Tech Legal Battles? This case stands out for several reasons. First, Adobe has positioned itself as a company that respects creator rights, making these allegations particularly damaging to its reputation. Second, the lawsuit specifically targets the company’s use of the Books3 dataset, which has become a focal point in multiple legal actions against tech companies. Consider these key aspects of the case: Scale of Alleged Infringement: Books3 contains 191,000 books, potentially affecting thousands of authors Precedent Setting: Similar cases against Apple and Salesforce have cited the same dataset Industry Impact: The outcome could force AI companies to completely rethink their training data strategies Financial Stakes: The Anthropic settlement of $1.5 billion shows the potential cost of these cases How Common Are These AI Training Data Lawsuits Becoming? Unfortunately for the tech industry, lawsuits over AI training data have become increasingly common. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has outpaced the development of clear legal frameworks, creating a perfect storm of litigation. Here’s a comparison of recent notable cases: Company Allegation Status Potential Impact Adobe Using pirated books via SlimPajama dataset Proposed class-action filed Could affect all Adobe AI products Apple Using copyrighted material for Apple Intelligence Ongoing litigation May delay AI feature releases Salesforce Using RedPajama for training Similar lawsuit filed Could impact enterprise AI tools Anthropic Using pirated work for Claude training Settled for $1.5 billion Sets financial precedent What Does This Mean for Copyright Infringement in the AI Era? The Adobe case highlights a fundamental tension in the AI industry. Companies need massive amounts of data to train effective models, but obtaining proper licensing for all that content is expensive and complex. This has led some companies to use datasets like Books3 and RedPajama, which contain copyrighted material obtained through questionable means. The legal landscape is evolving rapidly, with several key developments: Increased Scrutiny: Courts are becoming more familiar with AI technology and its data requirements Author Organization: Writers and creators are forming coalitions to protect their rights Regulatory Attention: Governments worldwide are considering new AI regulations Industry Standards: Some companies are developing ethical data sourcing guidelines What Are the Potential Consequences for Adobe’s SlimLM Program? If the lawsuit succeeds, Adobe could face significant consequences. The company might need to: Retrain its SlimLM model using properly licensed data Pay substantial damages to affected authors Implement new data verification processes Potentially remove or limit certain AI features Face increased regulatory scrutiny for future AI developments How Can Companies Avoid Similar AI Training Data Issues? Based on the growing number of lawsuits, companies developing AI systems should consider these proactive measures: Transparent Data Sourcing: Clearly document where training data comes from Proper Licensing: Obtain explicit permission for copyrighted materials Ethical Guidelines: Develop and follow ethical AI development principles Legal Review: Involve legal teams early in AI development processes Creator Compensation: Consider fair compensation models for content creators Frequently Asked Questions What is the Books3 dataset mentioned in the lawsuit? Books3 is a collection of approximately 191,000 books that has been widely used to train generative AI systems. It has become controversial because it contains copyrighted material that was allegedly obtained without proper authorization from authors and publishers. Who is Elizabeth Lyon? Elizabeth Lyon is an author from Oregon who specializes in writing guidebooks for non-fiction writing. She is the lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit against Adobe , alleging that her copyrighted works were used without permission to train the company’s AI models. What is SlimLM? SlimLM is Adobe’s small language model series designed for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. According to the company, it was pre-trained on the SlimPajama-627B dataset, which is at the center of the current legal dispute. How does this case relate to other AI lawsuits? This case is part of a growing trend of legal actions against tech companies using copyrighted material for AI training. Similar lawsuits have been filed against Apple and Salesforce , while Anthropic recently settled a similar case for $1.5 billion. What could be the outcome of this lawsuit? Potential outcomes include financial damages for affected authors, requirements for Adobe to retrain its models with properly licensed data, and the establishment of legal precedents that could shape how all companies approach AI training data in the future. Conclusion The Adobe lawsuit represents a critical moment in the ongoing struggle to balance AI innovation with copyright protection. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives and business operations, the rules governing how these systems are trained must evolve. This case, along with others like it, will help define the boundaries of acceptable AI development and establish important precedents for how creators are compensated in the age of artificial intelligence. The outcome could force the entire tech industry to reconsider its approach to training data, potentially leading to more ethical and sustainable AI development practices.

That’s exactly what’s happening right now, creating one of the most significant dormant BTC movements in cryptocurrency history. According to Wu Blockchain and K33 Research, long-term holders are selling at rates not seen in five years, fundamentally changing Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. What Does This Massive Dormant BTC Movement Mean? The term ‘ dormant BTC ‘ refers to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from wallets for extended periods, often years. When this cryptocurrency suddenly becomes active, it signals major holder behavior shifts. This year’s unprecedented $300 billion movement represents a fundamental change in how early investors view their Bitcoin holdings. Previously, spot Bitcoin ETF demand and institutional buying absorbed much of this selling pressure. However, the current situation reveals a worrying imbalance. With ETF inflows declining and retail participation dropping, the market faces direct exposure to this massive dormant BTC sell-off without its usual buffers. Why Are Long-Term Holders Selling Now? Understanding this sell-off requires examining several key factors: Profit-taking opportunities after Bitcoin’s significant price appreciation Macroeconomic concerns influencing investment decisions Changing risk appetite among early cryptocurrency adopters Portfolio rebalancing as investors diversify their crypto holdings The K33 Research report highlights that selling pressure over the past 30 days has been the strongest in five years. This suggests a coordinated or sentiment-driven movement among long-term holders rather than isolated decisions. How Does This Impact Bitcoin’s Market Stability? When dormant BTC enters circulation, it increases available supply. Normally, healthy markets absorb this additional supply through new demand. However, current conditions present challenges: First, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have declined recently, reducing institutional buying pressure. Second, derivatives trading volume has decreased, indicating lower speculative activity. Third, retail investor participation remains subdued compared to previous bull markets. This combination creates what analysts call an ‘unstable market’ scenario. The substantial dormant BTC sell-off meets reduced buying interest, potentially leading to increased price volatility and downward pressure. What Can Investors Learn From This Situation? This massive movement of previously inactive Bitcoin offers valuable insights for cryptocurrency investors: Monitor holder behavior metrics alongside price movements Understand supply dynamics beyond simple circulating supply figures Watch for correlation changes between different market participant groups Consider time horizons when evaluating market sentiment indicators The movement of dormant BTC serves as a crucial indicator of market health. When long-term holders who have weathered previous cycles begin selling en masse, it warrants attention from all market participants. What’s Next for Bitcoin Markets? The critical question remains: Can new demand sources emerge to absorb this dormant BTC supply? Several potential developments could change the current dynamic: Increased institutional adoption through new financial products might revive ETF inflows. Regulatory clarity could bring traditional investors into cryptocurrency markets. Technological developments might create new use cases driving Bitcoin demand. However, in the immediate term, markets must navigate this unprecedented supply increase. The $300 billion in previously inactive Bitcoin now seeking buyers represents both a challenge and an opportunity for market structure evolution. Conclusion: Navigating the New Bitcoin Landscape The $300 billion dormant BTC movement marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency markets. Long-term holder behavior has shifted dramatically, exposing underlying market fragility previously masked by institutional demand. While concerning in the short term, this development ultimately reflects Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class. Successful navigation of this new landscape requires understanding supply dynamics beyond surface-level metrics. The movement of previously inactive Bitcoin tells a deeper story about holder psychology, market structure, and cryptocurrency’s evolving role in global finance. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is dormant BTC? Dormant BTC refers to Bitcoin that hasn’t moved from its wallet address for an extended period, typically one year or more. These coins represent long-term holder positions that suddenly becoming active signals significant market changes. Why does dormant BTC selling affect prices? When dormant BTC enters the market, it increases available supply. If this additional supply meets reduced demand, it creates selling pressure that can push prices downward, especially in already volatile conditions. How unusual is this $300 billion movement? Extremely unusual. The K33 Research report indicates this represents the strongest selling pressure from long-term holders in five years, making it a historically significant event in Bitcoin markets. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this news? Not necessarily. While the dormant BTC movement indicates increased selling pressure, investment decisions should consider your individual strategy, time horizon, and risk tolerance rather than reacting to single data points. Will this affect Bitcoin’s long-term value? Short-term price movements don’t necessarily impact long-term value. Bitcoin has weathered similar supply events throughout its history, though the scale of this particular movement warrants close monitoring. How can I track dormant BTC movements? Several blockchain analytics platforms track holder behavior metrics, including Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and specialized research firms like K33 Research that published the original report.

Danal, the operator behind the popular Paycoin (PCI) payment system, has officially joined the Circle Alliance Program . This strategic move makes Danal the first South Korean payment company to enter this exclusive global initiative led by USDC issuer Circle. For crypto enthusiasts and industry watchers, this signals a major step toward mainstream stablecoin adoption in one of Asia’s most dynamic digital economies. What Does Joining the Circle Alliance Program Mean? Circle launched its Circle Alliance Program in November 2023 with a clear vision: to build a more open, inclusive, and internet-native financial system. The program connects traditional financial institutions, fintech innovators, and blockchain developers. Therefore, Danal’s entry is not just a membership; it’s a commitment to co-developing the infrastructure for the future of money. This partnership focuses on exploring stablecoin services specifically tailored for the South Korean market, which has shown immense appetite for digital assets but operates under strict regulatory frameworks. Why is This Partnership a Game-Changer for South Korea? The collaboration between a domestic payment giant and a global stablecoin leader addresses several key challenges in the Korean market. First, it bridges the gap between local payment networks and global dollar-denominated digital assets like USDC. Second, it provides a regulated pathway for innovation. The companies held informal talks earlier this year, laying the groundwork for this formal alliance. Their cooperation could lead to: Enhanced Cross-Border Payments: Faster and cheaper remittances using USDC. New Merchant Solutions: Integrating stablecoin payments into Danal’s existing Paycoin ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: Working within Korea’s evolving digital asset framework to set industry standards. How Will the Circle Alliance Program Shape Fintech’s Future? This alliance is a powerful example of how traditional finance and crypto-native companies can collaborate. For users, the benefits are tangible: increased financial access, reduced transaction costs, and exposure to global markets. For the industry, it demonstrates that compliance and innovation can go hand-in-hand. Moreover, Danal’s pioneering role may encourage other Korean financial institutions to explore similar blockchain integrations, accelerating the region’s digital transformation. What Are the Immediate Next Steps for Danal and Circle? While the announcement is formal, the real work begins now. The focus will likely be on pilot programs and regulatory dialogue. Key areas to watch include how they navigate Korea’s specific rules on foreign-currency-linked stablecoins and how they integrate USDC into a market dominated by local payment methods. The success of this Circle Alliance Program partnership could serve as a blueprint for other markets in Asia and beyond. In conclusion, Danal’s entry into the Circle Alliance Program is more than a corporate announcement. It is a strategic leap that merges South Korea’s advanced payment infrastructure with the borderless potential of stablecoins. This partnership promises to enhance financial inclusion, streamline cross-border commerce, and set a new standard for regulated crypto innovation. The eyes of the global fintech world are now on Seoul, watching this alliance unfold and redefine the future of digital payments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Circle Alliance Program? The Circle Alliance Program is an initiative launched by Circle, the issuer of USDC, to partner with financial institutions and fintech companies worldwide to build an internet-based financial system using stablecoin technology. Why is Danal’s membership significant? Danal is the first South Korean payment company to join the program. This gives Circle a major foothold in Korea’s large and tech-savvy market and allows Danal to pioneer new stablecoin services for its users. What is Paycoin (PCI)? Paycoin is a South Korean digital payment platform and cryptocurrency operated by Danal. It is widely used for everyday transactions, similar to how one might use a digital wallet or a domestic payment app. How could this affect USDC adoption in Asia? A successful partnership in a major market like South Korea could encourage adoption in neighboring countries and demonstrate a working model for integrating global stablecoins with local payment rails. What are the regulatory challenges? South Korea has strict regulations for crypto assets. A key challenge will be ensuring that any USDC-based services comply with local laws regarding foreign exchange and anti-money laundering (AML). Will this make crypto payments easier in Korea? Potentially, yes. By integrating a stable, widely accepted asset like USDC into a familiar payment system like Danal’s, it could simplify crypto payments for both consumers and merchants.

According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s ongoing retracement and key support levels could trigger a stronger correction for XRP. However, this projected downtrend is expected to pave the way for a reversal to higher target levels. XRP Price Outlook Tied To Bitcoin Retracement While the broader crypto market continued to trend lower, crypto market expert Tara shared a fresh technical analysis on XRP. On Tuesday, she stated in an X post that the current XRP price structure shows it is completing a deeper pullback compared to Bitcoin, which is still progressing through its corrective phase. According to her, this mismatch is likely to create irregular price behavior for XRP in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How Low The XRP Price Will Go Before Bouncing Tara noted that XRP recently touched the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level near $1.95 after crashing below $2 last week. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price is only halfway to a similar Fibonacci level. She notes that Bitcoin’s gradual retracement could slightly disrupt XRP’s price movements. However, if BTC pushes for its 0.382 retracement near $88,800, the analyst believes that it could eventually serve as a major catalyst for renewed strength in XRP. In her analysis report, Tara highlighted key downside levels for XRP traders to watch closely. She disclosed that a breakdown below $1.916 could open the door for a short-term move toward $1.90, where the Lower Time Frame (LTF) support sits. She further added that another test near $1.88 remains possible as long as XRP continues to trade under $2.0. Notably, Tara has marked $2 as a key resistance zone that could cap any recovery attempt from XRP. She notes that a move back to this level would likely depend on Bitcoin pushing higher during its retracement. The accompanying chart clearly shows XRP trading in a downtrend on the 4-hour timeframe with price remaining below short-term Moving Averages (MA). Fibonacci levels also highlight $1.95 as a complete retracement area, while deeper support zones cluster between $1.90 and $1.88. The RSI indicator at the bottom of the chart is hovering in the lower range, suggesting weakening momentum but also the potential for a relief bounce if support holds. XRP Short-Term Rally Stays Under $2.30 Responding to questions under her X post, Tara provided insights into XRP’s price outlook, focusing on both short- and long-term expectations. She noted that the $2 level only represents the LTF resistance for XRP, while the real barrier lies much higher at $9. Currently trading around $1.91, a move to $9 would reflect a more than 374% price increase. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why Given XRP’s downtrend and broader market uncertainty, Tara has indicated that a rally to $9 is unlikely in the near term. She also dismissed claims that the cryptocurrency could crash to $1 this December. Instead, she shared her bullish expectations, suggesting that XRP could reach no higher than $2.30 before the year runs out.

After weeks of choppy price action and repeated failures to sustain upside momentum, sentiment across the market has shifted sharply. Fear and apathy are increasingly dominant, with a growing number of analysts and participants beginning to call for a broader bear market. For many investors, the narrative has changed from buying dips to questioning whether the cycle has already peaked. This deterioration in confidence is occurring alongside renewed selling pressure from large, well-capitalized players. According to data from Arkham, two wallets linked to Matrixport deposited a combined 4,000 BTC, worth approximately $347.56 million, into Binance today. Matrixport is a large digital-asset financial services platform founded by former Bitmain executives, offering products including crypto lending, structured products, asset management, and custody solutions. Such large inflows to exchanges are closely watched by the market, as they often precede distribution or hedging activity, particularly during periods of heightened uncertainty. While not every deposit translates directly into spot selling, the timing of these transfers adds to the growing sense of caution. Whether current demand can absorb this supply and stabilize price will likely determine if this phase becomes a deeper correction—or the start of a more prolonged bearish regime. Exchange Inflows And What They Mean For Bitcoin Large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges are almost always interpreted by the market as a bearish signal, since they increase the immediate supply available for sale. In most historical cases, sharp spikes in exchange inflows have preceded periods of downside volatility, reinforcing the perception that whales are preparing to distribute into liquidity. However, some investors urge caution when reading this data in isolation, as not every exchange transfer results in spot selling. In certain scenarios, large inflows can be linked to internal treasury management, collateral rotation, or the opening of hedged derivatives positions rather than outright liquidation. Institutions may move Bitcoin to centralized venues to post margin for futures or options, allowing them to hedge downside risk without selling their underlying holdings. In other cases, funds prepare liquidity for over-the-counter settlements or cross-exchange arbitrage, activities that do not necessarily translate into sustained selling pressure on the spot market. Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s price action over the coming months will likely depend on whether these inflows are followed by a clear increase in realized selling volume. If demand continues to absorb supply near the $85K–$86K zone, the market could transition into a prolonged consolidation phase, allowing sentiment to reset. However, if exchange balances continue to rise alongside weakening spot demand, downside risks remain elevated. In that scenario, Bitcoin may revisit lower support levels before any durable recovery can begin. Price Tests Critical Long-Term Support Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure shows a clear loss of momentum after failing to hold above prior highs. On the weekly chart, BTC is now consolidating around the $86,000–$87,000 zone after a sharp rejection from the $110,000–$120,000 region. This area has become a critical demand zone, as price is currently hovering near the rising 200-day moving average, which historically acts as a key trend filter during cycle transitions. The short-term structure remains fragile. Bitcoin is trading below the 50-week moving average, which has started to roll over, signaling weakening upside momentum. Meanwhile, the 100-week moving average is still trending higher and sits below the current price, suggesting that the broader macro trend has not fully broken but is clearly under stress. From a price-action perspective, BTC is forming a lower high relative to the previous cycle peak, while volatility remains compressed. This often precedes a larger directional move. If bulls fail to defend the $85,000 support decisively, the next downside targets sit near the $78,000–$80,000 region, where previous consolidation occurred. Conversely, any structural recovery would require a reclaim and weekly close above $90,000, followed by sustained acceptance above the 50-week average.

Coinbase said it is rolling out a full set of new features that push the platform into stocks, advanced trading tools, and a full prediction-market setup, as well as adding on-chain products for businesses, developers, and users who want automated financial guidance. The company said these features have been in the pipeline for months but are now finished and ready for customers. CEO Brian Armstrong said he wants the platform to become the place where people trade every major asset. Coinbase expands trading lineup with stocks, futures, and prediction markets Brian said the plan includes stocks, a simpler futures and perpetuals layout, and prediction markets built through Kalshi. Coinbase is also building a tokenization roadmap that aims to bring more traditional assets on-chain, including equities. He said this push is meant to take the first step toward a world where stock trading and tokenized assets sit in the same app. The prediction-market space is getting crowded fast. DraftKings is buying its own exchange. FanDuel is teaming up with CME. Polymarket is entering the U.S. through a new approved venue. Good morning. We’re going to announce a lot of cool stuff today. If you have notifications on, sorry in advance. See you on the livestream. — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) December 17, 2025 Robinhood is putting LedgerX at the center of its regulated derivatives plan. The main rivalry remains Kalshi versus Polymarket, which Brian described as regulated rails against crypto-native liquidity. He said prediction markets are not only for trading but for reading what people expect to happen next. “If you look at things like economic indicators … or elections, people are using prediction markets to try to figure out what is going to happen next month,” Brian told CNBC. He added that only a small group use them for trading, while most use them to check sentiment, saying it can feel like an alternative to traditional media or even entertainment. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October, Brian joked about how prediction markets can be influenced. “I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call,” he said. “And I just want to add here the words bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, staking and Web3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call.” Robinhood expanded its own prediction-market push this week with parlays and prop-style contracts.It also said the category is now its fastest-growing business by revenue. Coinbase is adding the same kind of outcome trading to its ecosystem as part of a bigger model where one app holds traditional assets, derivatives, and on-chain activity. Moving assets on-chain and building tools for businesses and developers Coinbase tied this expansion to its tokenization plans.It is launching Coinbase Tokenize, a stack for institutions that want support for real-world asset tokenization. Brian said stock trading is “a good first step,” but the real goal is tokenized equities. Brian said tokenized equity could “democratize access for people over the world,” and open the door for new market structures in the U.S., including stronger futures markets tied to equities. “So this is the starting point,” he said. The rollout also widens Coinbase’s on-chain liquidity role. The company said it wants to be more than a place where tokens are listed. It wants to be a core provider of liquidity across markets. For businesses and developers, the company is expanding its reach beyond retail users. Coinbase Business is opening to eligible customers in the U.S. and Singapore. Coinbase is also releasing a larger API suite that spans custody, payments, trading, and stablecoins. Brian said, “Crypto is updating all financial services,” predicting that every major asset class will move on-chain, from equities and prediction markets to commodities and real-world assets like real estate. Coinbase is also introducing “custom stablecoins” for businesses that want their own branded payment rails. It is promoting x402, a payments standard designed to attach stablecoin payments to web requests, including automated commerce and agent-driven transactions. Coinbase said the long-term goal behind all of this is to keep users on the platform across every market cycle. It already owns a large crypto-native base and wants those users to stay and trade other asset classes even when volumes fall and spot-trade revenue dips.

Approximately 50% of Robinhood users expressed plans to allocate new capital specifically to prediction market trading. In contrast, only 37% of Coinbase users shared the same intention. This gap is more than just a percentage point. It signals a stronger user appetite and a higher potential for prediction market revenue growth on the Robinhood platform. Consequently, Mizuho has raised its financial forecast for Robinhood based on this projected demand. Why Is Robinhood’s User Base More Engaged? Understanding this divergence requires looking at each platform’s core identity. Robinhood built its reputation on democratizing stock and ETF trading for everyday investors. Its interface is famously simple and geared towards accessibility. Familiarity with Event-Based Trading: Robinhood users are already accustomed to trading based on company earnings, economic data, and other events. Prediction markets, which allow betting on real-world outcomes, are a natural extension. Broader Demographic Appeal: The platform’s design attracts users interested in various asset classes, making them more likely to explore a new product like prediction markets. Therefore, the survey suggests Robinhood’s community sees prediction markets as a new, exciting addition to their portfolio. Could Prediction Markets Hurt Coinbase’s Core Business? Mizuho’s report carries a warning for Coinbase. The bank didn’t just raise its outlook for Robinhood; it also lowered its price target for Coinbase . The primary concern is cannibalization. Coinbase’s main revenue driver is cryptocurrency trading fees. The bank worries that if Coinbase users shift their attention and capital from buying Bitcoin or Ethereum to trading on prediction markets, it could eat into their established, lucrative business. This potential internal competition makes analysts cautious about Coinbase’s near-term growth from this new venture. What Are the Real-World Implications for Traders? This shift isn’t just about Wall Street forecasts. It has tangible effects for anyone using these apps. A platform generating higher prediction market revenue will likely invest more back into that product. Better Features & Markets: Expect Robinhood to potentially offer more prediction events, improved interfaces, and competitive incentives to solidify its lead. Strategic Divergence: Coinbase may take a more measured approach, carefully balancing its new prediction market against its core crypto trading to avoid self-cannibalization. This competition ultimately benefits users through innovation, but it also clarifies the strategic paths these two giants are taking. The Final Verdict on the Prediction Market Race Mizuho’s analysis provides a compelling snapshot of a market in flux. While both Robinhood and Coinbase have launched prediction markets, user readiness appears starkly different. Robinhood’s integrated, multi-asset approach seems to give it an early edge in capturing user interest and, by extension, prediction market revenue . For Coinbase, the challenge is unique. It must prove that prediction markets can be a true growth engine without undermining the cryptocurrency trading empire it has built. The coming quarters will reveal which strategy wins, reshaping how we interact with financial markets online. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are prediction markets in this context? A: They are platforms where users can trade shares based on the predicted outcome of real-world events (like elections or sports), turning opinions into tradable assets. Q: Why did Mizuho lower Coinbase’s price target? A: Due to concerns that Coinbase’s new prediction market service might draw users and funds away from its primary business of cryptocurrency trading, potentially reducing overall revenue. Q: How many users did Mizuho survey? A: The analysis was based on a survey of 230 users across both the Robinhood and Coinbase platforms. Q: Does this mean Coinbase’s prediction market will fail? A: Not necessarily. It means analysts see more immediate growth potential for Robinhood in this area. Coinbase’s success will depend on how it integrates the service without hurting its core crypto trading. Q: Should I switch platforms based on this news? A: Your choice should depend on your primary investment goals. If exploring prediction markets is a priority, Robinhood’s user data suggests stronger engagement. For focused crypto trading, both platforms remain major players. Found this analysis of the shifting prediction market revenue landscape insightful?

In a move that highlights the evolving nature of blockchain technology, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a temporary Binance INJ suspension . Starting at 1:00 p.m. UTC on December 18th, deposits and withdrawals for INJ will be paused. This proactive step is to ensure a smooth and secure network upgrade and hard fork for the Injective protocol. If you’re trading or holding INJ, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief intermission confidently. Why is Binance Suspending INJ Transactions? The core reason for the Binance INJ suspension is straightforward: to support the Injective network’s own scheduled upgrade. Think of it like a scheduled power outage in your neighborhood so the utility company can install a new, more powerful transformer. Binance is halting the flow of INJ tokens on and off its platform to prevent any potential issues, such as lost transactions or funds being sent to incorrect addresses, during the blockchain’s transition period. This is a standard, safety-first practice in the crypto industry during major network events. What Does This Mean for Your INJ Holdings? First and foremost, don’t panic. This suspension is temporary and planned. Here’s a clear breakdown of what is and isn’t affected: Trading is NOT suspended: You can still buy, sell, and trade INJ against other cryptocurrencies on Binance’s spot and futures markets during this period. Deposits and Withdrawals ARE suspended: You cannot send INJ from an external wallet to your Binance account, or from your Binance account to an external wallet. Your assets are safe: The INJ tokens already in your Binance wallet remain secure and under your control. The key takeaway is that while the movement of INJ is paused, your ability to manage your position within the exchange continues uninterrupted. How to Prepare for the Binance INJ Network Upgrade A little preparation goes a long way. To ensure you’re not caught off guard by the Binance INJ suspension , consider these simple steps: Complete pending transfers early: If you need to move INJ, do so well before the 1:00 p.m. UTC deadline on December 18th. Monitor official channels: Follow Binance’s official announcements and the Injective project’s social media for the “all-clear” notice when services resume. Understand the upgrade’s purpose: Network upgrades often bring enhancements like improved speed, lower fees, or new features. This pause is a sign of progress for the Injective ecosystem. The Bigger Picture: Why Network Upgrades Matter While a temporary Binance INJ suspension might seem like a minor inconvenience, it underscores a critical strength of leading blockchain projects: their capacity for improvement. Hard forks and upgrades are essential for: Enhancing Security: Patching vulnerabilities and strengthening the network against threats. Boosting Scalability: Enabling the network to handle more transactions faster and cheaper. Introducing New Features: Unlocking new functionalities for developers and users. Therefore, this brief operational pause by Binance is a collaborative step towards a more robust and capable Injective network for all users. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain The temporary Binance INJ suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a routine and responsible action. It reflects the exchange’s commitment to user asset safety during significant blockchain events. For traders and holders, it’s a short-term operational note, not a cause for concern. By understanding the reasons and planning accordingly, you can view this moment not as a disruption, but as a necessary step in the ongoing evolution and maturation of the Injective protocol. The resumption of services will mark the successful completion of an upgrade, paving the way for a better network experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When will Binance resume INJ deposits and withdrawals? Binance will resume services once the Injective network upgrade is confirmed to be stable. They will make a separate announcement. There is no pre-announced end time, so users should monitor official channels. Can I still trade INJ on Binance during the suspension? Yes. The suspension only applies to depositing INJ into your Binance account and withdrawing INJ out of it. All spot and futures trading for INJ will continue as normal. Are my INJ tokens safe on Binance during this time? Yes. Your existing INJ balance in your Binance wallet is not affected and remains secure. The suspension is a preventive measure for transaction processing, not a security issue. What happens if I try to send INJ to Binance during the suspension? Any INJ deposits sent to Binance after the suspension begins will not be credited to your account. The transactions may be lost. It is crucial to wait until Binance officially announces that deposit services have reopened. What is a “hard fork” in this context? A hard fork is a permanent divergence in a blockchain’s protocol, creating a new set of rules. It often requires all nodes and users to upgrade to the latest version. Exchanges like Binance pause services to safely manage this transition for their users. Will other exchanges also suspend INJ services? It is likely. Other major exchanges that support INJ often announce similar temporary suspensions to facilitate the same network upgrade. Always check the announcements page of your specific exchange.

The entrepreneur revealed that he lost approximately $14,189 (100,000 yuan) in cryptocurrency that he had accumulated over the course of eight years. Koh detailed his encounter on Monday on LinkedIn, which was later reported by the Lianhe Zaobao Newspaper. The digital asset investor confirmed that he didn’t lose his portfolio due to a crypto rug pull or from linking to a malicious dApp. He added that he hasn’t left his wallet open since his involvement in Web3 in 2017. Koh regrets keeping his virtual assets on-chain The early Polygon investor said he believed in crypto and helped build the DeFi ecosystem on Polygon and BSC. Koh revealed that his belief in keeping virtual assets on-chain instead of on centralized exchanges cost him everything. The angel investor said he found a beta testing campaign for a gaming project called MetaJoy in a Telegram group. He confirmed that the campaign had a professional website, active Discord, and GitBook documentation. A local newspaper revealed that Koh met a team member named Shanni, who claimed to be the co-founder of the Meta team. He saw that Shanni had listed some of his professional credentials, including from Persistence One and Bitunix Official. The entrepreneur added that he was also convinced since the team replied to his questions thoughtfully and didn’t rush him. Koh argued that his numerous evaluations of Web3 projects gave him an edge in spotting scams. However, he acknowledged that the fatal mistake he made was downloading the MetaJoy game launcher, which is intended for testing beta versions. He noted that the malware in the game embedded itself in his system the moment he ran the installer. The crypto entrepreneur said he was shocked by the sophistication of the attack, as he had never connected his wallet to anything. Koh added that his Norton antivirus, which he’s on 360 deluxe, immediately flagged suspicious activity. He said he thought he was safe after deleting every suspicious file he could find in his registry entries. He added that he was even more confident about his safety after enabling TPM 2.0, memory isolation, and reinstalling Windows 11. Koh found that all wallets connected to his Rabby and Phantom browser extensions had been completely drained just 24 hours after the incident. He also acknowledged that not just his main wallet, but all of them. “The malware had already exfiltrated my encrypted wallet data before I even knew anything was wrong. All my cleanup efforts were already too late. The attacker waited patiently, decoded what they needed, and executed the theft when I thought the danger had passed.” – Mark Koh , Co-Founder of RektSurvivor. Koh filed a police report at 21:52 hours on December 12 under Report number F/20251212/7113. He said he has been waiting for someone from the Singapore Police Force to contact him for the last three days. Attacker offramps stolen funds through CEXs Koh said his involvement in the project stemmed from his belief in TPRO Network, SBP Game, and NeverLetGo. He added that he planned to support those projects by holding their crypto assets. The angel investor believes the incident was credential theft at the operating system level. He also said his belief in self-custody over centralized exchanges, which he had advocated for years, backfired immediately. The co-founder of RektSurvivor said his firm helps people who’ve lost funds in crypto, but he’s now one of the victims. The entrepreneur believes that the attacker may have sent the funds to other exchanges, including Cryptomus, Binance, and WhiteBIT.

But there’s one factor players underestimate: volatility. The price of LTC moves constantly, and those fluctuations directly influence your bankroll, your bet sizing and even your cash-out timing. If you ignore it, you’ll make weak decisions. If you understand it, volatility becomes part of your edge. Why Volatility Matters More in Crypto Gambling Traditional casino currency is stable. Ten euros today is ten euros tomorrow. With LTC, your bankroll shifts even when you’re not touching it. A winning streak can be worth less the next morning, and a mediocre session can suddenly look great after a market pump. In other words: you’re playing two games at once. 1. The casino game itself2. The market value of the coin you’re using Your strategy must account for both. Bankroll Strategy: Fixed LTC vs Fixed Fiat Value Most LTC gamblers choose one of two approaches. Fixed LTC Bankroll You decide: “My bankroll is 5 LTC. That’s it.” This is simple and crypto-native, but it exposes you fully to volatility. If LTC drops 15 percent overnight, your bankroll effectively shrinks even if you didn't lose a bet. When to use: • You believe LTC will go up long term• You don’t mind variance• Your casino sessions are short Fixed Fiat Value Bankroll You treat your bankroll as if you’re playing with a stable value. Example: you want a 300 dollar bankroll, so you convert that into LTC at the moment of play. This reduces volatility risk during play, but you still face volatility before and after each session. When to use: • You play strategically and compare results across sessions• You want consistent risk exposure• You prefer predictable bet sizing Bet Sizing: Avoid Static Bets in a Moving Market Crypto beginners often lock in static bets like “I’ll bet 0.01 LTC each round.”This breaks quickly when the LTC price moves 10, 20 or even 30 percent. Better practice: parallel sizing. • Define a base unit in fiat terms (for example 2 dollars per bet)• Convert that to LTC each session• Adjust if the market moves significantly mid-session This prevents your bet sizing from becoming accidentally high-risk during market drops or too conservative when LTC pumps. Volatility Windows: When to Play, When to Pause Not every part of the day is equally favourable for LTC gambling . Market conditions matter. High-volatility periods • Major announcements• Halving cycles• FOMC or macro news• Large LTC whale movements Effect on strategy: • Play shorter sessions• Stick to smaller stakes• Cash out faster if you’re ahead Reason: You’re carrying exposure both in the casino game and the market swing. Low-volatility periods Price movement is slow and predictable. Effect on strategy: • Normal or extended sessions• Stable bet sizing• You can hold your winnings longer Low volatility reduces external risk, making this the safest environment for LTC players. Winning and Cash-Out Strategy: Know When to Hold LTC When you win in LTC, you face a choice: 1. Cash out into stable value2. Hold your LTC and ride the market The decision depends on two factors: • Expected LTC trend• Your risk appetite If you expect LTC to rise Holding your winnings makes sense. A modest session can grow significantly if the market pumps. Many advanced players accept small casino gains because their real upside sits in the LTC price move. If you expect a drop Convert part of your winnings to stable value or withdraw. There’s no point winning 0.5 LTC and losing that value overnight. Hybrid approach This is what experienced gamblers use: Cash out 50 percent to lock profit and keep 50 percent as LTC exposure It’s risk-managed, simple and works across market cycles. Game Selection: Volatility Influences Your Risk Profile If LTC is highly volatile, your overall exposure increases. That means you should avoid additional high-variance games when the market is already unpredictable. In high LTC volatility Choose: • Blackjack• Baccarat• Low-volatility slots• Live roulette with steady RTP Avoid: • Crash• Plinko with wide multipliers• High-variance slots Reason: You don’t stack multiple layers of volatility. In low LTC volatility Your risk budget is bigger.High-volatility games become more acceptable. Long-Term Impact: Variance Becomes Part of Your Profit Curve Litecoin gamblers who think long-term treat LTC volatility as part of their expected return. You might lose a bit in the casino but win on the LTC price move. Or you win in the casino but LTC drops and erases half the gain. Your goal is to make volatility work for you, not against you. That means: • Track results in both LTC and fiat• Use consistent bet sizing• Avoid emotional decisions during price spikes• Understand that your bankroll is dynamic Volatility Is Not Your Enemy Volatility is only dangerous if you ignore it. Handled well, it can amplify your winnings and sharpen your strategy. Litecoins.com readers who adapt to volatility think in two layers: the casino layer and the market layer. Once you master both, you play smarter than 90 percent of crypto casino users. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This vision is moving closer to reality. In a significant blockchain development, Creditcoin (CTC) has announced a powerful partnership with the privacy-focused network, Midnight. Their mission? To construct a revolutionary decentralized identity infrastructure that can stand firm against the rising tide of AI-powered deepfakes and fraud. What Does This Decentralized Identity Partnership Aim to Achieve? At its core, this collaboration is about merging two powerful forces. Creditcoin brings a unique asset to the table: verifiable, on-chain credit history. Meanwhile, Midnight, a project led by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, contributes its advanced privacy-preserving technology. The goal is to create a new model for human authentication. This model wouldn’t rely on easily stolen documents but on a person’s proven financial behavior, all while keeping their sensitive data completely private. Why Is a New Decentralized Identity System Urgently Needed? The digital landscape is becoming increasingly hazardous. Sophisticated AI tools can now generate convincing fake videos, audio, and documents, making traditional verification methods obsolete. This partnership directly addresses that threat. The proposed decentralized identity framework aims to: Verify Economic Activity: Confirm a user’s real-world financial behavior without exposing transaction details. Combat Deepfakes: Create a verification layer that AI-generated forgeries cannot easily bypass. Preserve Privacy: Use zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy tech to share only the proof of legitimacy, not the underlying data. How Will Creditcoin and Midnight’s Technologies Work Together? Think of it as building a trustworthy digital resume that you control. Creditcoin’s blockchain acts as a secure, tamper-proof ledger of creditworthy interactions. Midnight’s platform provides the “privacy cloak,” allowing you to present proof of your good history without revealing the specifics. For example, you could prove you have a reliable repayment history to a lender without showing every loan you’ve ever taken. This synergy could unlock secure access to global financial services for millions. What Are the Potential Challenges for This Decentralized Identity Vision? While the potential is transformative, the path has hurdles. Widespread adoption requires convincing institutions and users to trust a new, unfamiliar system. Furthermore, designing a decentralized identity protocol that is both globally interoperable and compliant with diverse regional regulations is a complex task. The technical challenge of making the system seamless for everyday users cannot be underestimated. The Transformative Impact of a Successful Decentralized Identity System Success here would be a watershed moment. It would shift power from centralized data hoarders back to individuals. You would own and control your digital self. This could revolutionize everything from KYC processes and secure voting to streamlined job applications and trusted social media interactions. The partnership between Creditcoin and Midnight isn’t just building a tool; it’s laying the groundwork for a more secure and private internet. In conclusion, the alliance between Creditcoin and Midnight marks a proactive step toward solving one of the web’s most pressing issues: proving you are you in the age of AI. By leveraging on-chain credit data and cutting-edge privacy technology, they are pioneering a decentralized identity solution that promises enhanced security, user sovereignty, and resilience against digital forgery. This collaboration could very well define the standard for how we establish trust online in the coming decade. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is decentralized identity (DID)? Decentralized identity is a model where individuals own and control their digital identifiers (like a digital driver’s license) without relying on a central authority like a government or corporation. How can blockchain verify my identity without my data? Using privacy technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, a blockchain can verify that your data meets certain criteria (e.g., “credit score > 700”) without ever seeing the actual score or your personal details. What role does Creditcoin play in this partnership? Creditcoin provides the foundational layer of verifiable, on-chain financial history and credit data that can be used as a proof point for authentication. Who is behind the Midnight blockchain? Midnight is a privacy-focused blockchain project developed by Input Output Global (IOG) and led by Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Cardano. Can this technology really stop AI deepfakes? It aims to create a verification layer that is separate from easily forged media. While not a “silver bullet,” it makes identity theft and synthetic fraud significantly harder by anchoring identity to immutable, private behavioral proof. When will this decentralized identity system be available? The announcement is for a research and development collaboration. A functional, mainstream product will likely take considerable time for development, testing, and adoption. Found this deep dive into the future of digital identity fascinating?

Rumors suggest that the initiative is part of Google’s ambitious plan to advance its Tensor Processing ​Units as a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s industry-leading GPUs. Alphabet Inc., a multinational conglomerate and parent company that owns Google, is reportedly working with the U.S.-based Social Media conglomerate Meta to advance artificial intelligence and challenge Nvidia’s monopoly in the sector. NVIDIA’s stock drops by 6.21% as Google and Meta join efforts to weaken its AI dominance According to people familiar with the matter, Google and Meta are reportedly working on the development of TorchTPU, which aims to make Google’s TPU chips fully compatible with PyTorch, the leading AI software framework. The initiative aims to streamline the adoption of TPU chips, favoring customers who already have PyTorch software infrastructure. TPU adoption was heavily inhibited by its poor compatibility with PyTorch. NVIDIA’s stock price has plummeted by 6.21% in the last 24 hours, and the stock is currently trading at $171.46. The stock is down 8.12% in the last month but has surged by 27.84% YTD, according to data from real-time stock price tracking platform Google Finance. The sources also revealed that Google has devoted more resources and organizational focus to the development of TorchTPUs due to the growing demand for TPU chips among tech companies. The company is also opting to open-source parts of the software to accelerate adoption among customers, according to the anonymous tips. AI developers utilize PyTorch to develop AI models, and Meta provides significant support for its development. The partnership aims to challenge Nvidia’s dominance and monopoly over the AI sector. The chip maker currently dominates the AI processor industry through its CUDA software ecosystem. CUDA is Nvidia’s strongest shield against rising competition, according to some Wall Street analysts. The CUDA software is deeply integrated into PyTorch and has become the default method for training and running large AI models. The rumors also revealed that Meta has a strategic interest in developing software compatible with TPUs. Meta reportedly aims to diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s monopoly and lower inference costs. The partnership aligns with Google’s objective to make its TPUs a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, which have gained a monopoly in the sector. TPU revenue has significantly boosted the company’s cloud revenue, as Google seeks to demonstrate to investors that its AI investments are profitable. Google begins commissioning TPUs for commercial supply For the longest time, Google had reserved a majority of its TPU supply for internal use only. However, the company switched policies in 2022 when Google’s cloud computing unit gained control over the group that sells TPUs. The reforms took place amid the ongoing AI race, which has increased global chip demand and AI infrastructure. Google’s chips are specifically designed to run on the Jax software frameworks. Therefore, companies that have already installed PyTorch frameworks would need to reengineer their infrastructure to accommodate the Jax frameworks, a costly process that would require significant time and resources to achieve. Once Google’s initiative to make its chips PyTorch compatible is successful, the companies will incur significantly reduced costs to modify their infrastructure to house the chips. Google requires solutions to supply Google Cloud customers, such as Anthropic, who purchase TPUs and run its products, including Google AI-powered search and the Gemini chatbot. Google’s ties to Meta in AI technology advancement were previously uncovered by a recent Cryptopolitan report , which revealed that the two tech giants were discussing a multi-billion-dollar deal to supply Meta with Google’s AI chips. Google’s recent moves have revealed the company’s obsession with AI technology. According to another report by Cryptopolitan, the company backed a multi-year contract deal worth $7 billion that Hut 8 signed to lease a data center in Louisiana. A press release revealed that Google will provide financial support to cover the lease payments and related pass-through obligations.

Bitcoin Could Trade At A Discount If No Quantum Fix Is Deployed As Quantum Computing continues to advance, many in the Bitcoin community have been raising concerns about what a breakthrough could mean for the cryptocurrency. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has been one of those voices. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Top Whales Reverse Course, Quietly Scoop Up $263M In LINK Last week, Edwards gave a presentation on the Quantum threat to Bitcoin at the Global Blockchain Show in Abu Dhabi. The analyst has also shared some insights on X. According to Edwards, there’s a 34% chance that Quantum will undermine BTC’s cryptography in the next three years. Based on this, the Capriole founder has assigned a 34% discount to BTC today. “Given a 2-3 yr timeline to deploy fix, this is the current discount rate,” noted Edwards. “And it is growing. Every. Single. Day.” The probability has been estimated using seven different sources providing timelines for Quantum Computing breakthroughs. If Capriole’s calculations are to go by, the Quantum threat has a chance of more than 50% to affect blockchain technology by 2030. What will happen in the scenario that Quantum Computing does end up unlocking Bitcoin’s cryptography? Even if wallets today are secured properly, there are still old wallets that can be vulnerable. A chunk of the BTC supply has been dormant for years, and with a Quantum breakthrough, it could potentially find its way back into circulation. The most popular example of dormant holdings is, of course, the ones attributed to the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi’s wallets hold a total of 1,096,354 BTC, worth a whopping $95 billion at current prices. All these coins possibly being dumped on the market would naturally have a negative effect on the Bitcoin price. Not just because of the scale involved, but also because of the loss of confidence that such an event would result in. Considering the threat, Capriole has repeatedly stressed that a fix needs to be implemented as soon as possible. So far, the community hasn’t reached a consensus on when or what the solution should be. In an X post, Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has also chimed in on the topic. “Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it,” wrote Saylor. “The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen.” In this scenario, the coins attached to Satoshi and other early miners will forever become inaccessible. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge Triggers Near-$600 Million Crypto Long Flush Edwards has warned that if a solution isn’t implemented in time, the coin may face its biggest bear market in history. “If we haven’t deployed a fix by 2028, I expect Bitcoin will be sub $50K and continue to fall until it’s fixed,” said the Capriole founder. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,500, down 5.7% over the last week.

Intersect, which coordinates parts of Cardano’s governance process, said on X: “On the 7th day of GA… We hit the Epoch’s end. DReps at 80%. Stake pools supporting- It looks like we have a new CC. Ratified. Thank you to everyone who reviewed, voted, and wrote rationales,Santa has been notified.” Why The Cardano Governance Was Stuck Cardano’s governance model is tripartite: delegate representatives (DReps), stake pool operators (SPOs), and the Constitutional Committee . The CC plays a gatekeeping role: it judges whether on-chain actions are constitutional and ratifies decisions needed for the network to adapt. That mechanism stalled after an unexpected mid-term departure left the CC below its minimum operational size. The Cardano Atlantic Council retired mid-term in epoch 597, opening a seat and reducing the committee below quorum. The consequence was that the Cardano CC could not ratify key actions, even as the chain continued to operate normally at the protocol level. The vote asked DReps and SPOs to ratify a newly elected CC member and restore the committee to full capacity. The candidate, Cardano Curia, was selected off-chain through a DRep vote using the Ekklesia tool, with on-chain ratification required to formalize the result. The governance materials described the restoration as bringing the CC back to seven members and activating a clarified alternate-member process to handle future vacancies with less disruption. Approval thresholds were set at 67% from DReps and 51% support from SPOs. Intersect’s update indicates those thresholds were met as the epoch ended. Why This Was Treated As Urgent The vote was framed as more than housekeeping because an undersized CC effectively blocks major governance flows. Without quorum: Treasury withdrawals couldn’t proceed, the Critical Integrations Budget could not pass, hard forks could not be ratified, delaying network upgrades and several categories of governance actions were blocked, leaving only a limited subset able to move forward. There was also a timing element: delays risk actions expiring, which would force a repeat of the voting process and extend the governance backlog. With the restoration ratified, Cardano’s governance process can resume normal throughput — reopening the path for upgrades, budget approvals, and protocol changes that depend on a functioning Constitutional Committee.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $14.03. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $22.81. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $2.90 Market Cap $1.57B Trading Volume $75.65M Circulating Supply 543.71M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.11 24-h Low $2.87 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 15.09% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 35.53 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.51 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30 %) 200-Day SMA $4.97 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP remains bearish below $3.10. The key support zone for ICP is between $2.85 and $2.80. Only a reclaim of $3.05–$3.20 would hint at trend relief. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for December 18, ICP is trading around $2.90–$2.91 after a prolonged sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a firmly bearish structure. The price remains well below the mid and upper Bollinger Bands, with the 20-day basis near $3.43 acting as dynamic resistance, and the upper band around $4.05 far out of reach. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Currently, the RSI is hovering near 36, showing mild oversold conditions but no bullish divergence yet. The MACD stays negative and flat, signaling weak downside momentum rather than a reversal. As long as ICP fails to reclaim $3.10–$3.20, downside risk persists toward the $2.75–$2.80 zone. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP is attempting to stabilize just above $2.90 after a sharp selloff, but it remains capped below the Alligator averages, which are clustered between $2.98 and $3.08. This alignment confirms bearish trend control, with any bounce likely corrective. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD shows shallow negative momentum with no decisive bullish crossover, suggesting sellers are still dominant despite slowing pressure. A clean break above $3.05 would be needed to shift short-term bias, while failure risks another sweep toward $2.85. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.69 SELL SMA 5 $3.56 SELL SMA 10 $3.57 SELL SMA 21 $3.71 SELL SMA 50 $4.51 SELL SMA 100 $4.29 SELL SMA 200 $4.97 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $3.81 SELL EMA 5 $4.04 SELL EMA 10 $4.28 SELL EMA 21 $4.57 SELL EMA 50 $4.91 SELL EMA 100 $5.15 SELL EMA 200 $5.74 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis Overall, ICP is still in a corrective downtrend with only tentative signs of stabilization. Without a reclaim of $3.10 and above, rallies look vulnerable to rejection, while holding $2.85 is critical to avoid deeper continuation losses. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects.

The pressure built overnight as investors cut exposure to high-multiple technology names and the broader AI trade, a shift that usually spills into crypto when momentum fades. In early Asia, shares in Japan and Australia fell and Hong Kong shares pointed lower. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $86,575, down 1.1% Ether : $2,832, down 4.2% XRP : $1.86, down 3.7% Total crypto market cap: $3 trillion, down 1.5% Tech Rout Deepens As AI Valuation Fears Grip Wall Street In the US, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.9% on Wednesday. Nvidia slid 3.8% to its lowest since September, and the S&P 500 fell 1.2% to a three-week low, slipping under its 50-day moving average. Final S&P 500 $SPX Wednesday Heat Map Not quite the Santa Rally I expected.. pic.twitter.com/8Snp9mhHq4 — Jesse Cohen (@JesseCohenInv) December 17, 2025 The selling gathered pace as investors questioned whether the companies at the center of the AI boom can continue to justify their lofty valuations and heavy spending. Concerns around the cost and viability of data centre expansion added to the unease, with traders watching how big-ticket financing plans ripple through the sector. Oracle fell 5.4% after a report said its largest data centre partner, Blue Owl Capital, will not back a $10B deal for its next facility. Amazon slipped 0.6% after a report said it is in talks to invest about $10B in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and Alphabet dropped 3.2% after a Reuters report said Google is working on an effort, alongside Meta, to erode Nvidia’s software advantage. The chip complex took a broader hit. Broadcom fell 4.5% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.9%, reinforcing a market mood that has turned more sensitive to any sign that the AI buildout may deliver profits slower than hoped. Crypto Awaits CPI As Bitcoin Hovers Without Clear Support For Bitcoin, that backdrop kept the move heavy and the bounce restrained. Mike Marshall, head of research at Amberdata, said the key is that the “support bid” has not shown up in size. “We are seeing weak market structure beneath price and relatively light ETF inflows, which reduces the market’s ability to stabilize quickly when momentum flips. Broader macro worries around rates, growth uncertainty, and cautious risk sentiment are compounding it.” “In this environment, the market tends to probe until it finds a level where buyers have conviction. Based on our ETF cost-basis analysis, the first meaningful floor is near $80K, and if we see sustained outflows or tighter financial conditions, $60K becomes the next major reference,” he said. Rate markets reflected the same caution. Comments from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, often viewed as dovish, supported demand for two- and five-year Treasuries, and longer-dated bonds lagged, nudging the 10-year yield about one basis point higher to roughly 4.15%.

The comments come as the Avalanche ecosystem gains traction with institutional partners and enterprise developers heading into 2025. In an interview with TheStreet Roundtable, John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, emphasized the company’s long-term vision of creating customized blockchain environments tailored to specific use cases — from finance to global brands and enterprise deployments. Rather than following short‑lived trends that dominate social media, Nahas said Avalanche is focused on durable, real‑world blockchain solutions. “We don’t need more block space. We don’t need more blockchains,” Nahas said. “But we do need more blockchains that are purpose‑built, because that’s how the real world works.” Projects that dwell too heavily on buzzy crypto narratives also struggle to gain traction, says Nahas, as trends typically last only a few months before losing steam. He noted that Avalanche, by contrast, has emphasized fundamentals. Nahas said that this patience was now being rewarded, as adoption extended well beyond crypto-native users into traditional finance, international brands, and enterprise operators. He said valuable infrastructure takes time to build and that success in crypto today is increasingly a function of medium- to long-term thinking. Avalanche builds blockchains for real-world use Avalanche’s core technology enables developers to launch sovereign Layer‑1 blockchains — sometimes referred to as subnets — that operate independently with unique governance, performance parameters, and economic models . According to Nahas, this architecture positions Avalanche to cater to a broad spectrum of use cases that existing monolithic networks cannot serve effectively. For a long time, Nahas has said that the industry nonetheless follows an outdated model predicated on the idea that all applications eventually run on a single, dominant blockchain. He dismissed the notion, adding that the world doesn’t require endless generic block space. Instead, blockchains must be carefully tailored to the specific needs of their users. Sectors such as finance, supply chains, digital identity, and enterprise operations all have unique requirements, and Avalanche’s architecture is designed to meet them. Companies can establish their own separate networks, with their own rules and governance, within the network. These chains can be private, public, or hybrid and remain interoperable, but with separate sets of rules and governance. Nahas pointed out that this method emulates the operation of real-world systems, where independent but interrelated infrastructures connect. Enterprise adoption accelerates worldwide Avalanche’s model is already attracting major institutions. Nahas explained banks want regulated and compliant environments, asset managers want custom-made infrastructure, and the enterprise also needs systems that fit its internal operations, he said. Avalanche, he added, offers solutions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Toyota, for instance, is constructing four different Avalanche chains designed to work in tandem with varying business processes. Additionally, FIFA and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Japan are building independent environments on the network. These projects demonstrate how Avalanche is extending into new frontiers of crypto-native use cases. Nahas emphasized these enterprise chains as not separate silos. Avalanche promotes interoperability (utilizing both private and public networks) and thus maintains control over the same infrastructure while simultaneously retaining the benefits of shared infrastructure. He said this balance will be a key to long-term adoption. There is expanding growth on the network. Nahas stated that nearly 80 Avalanche layer-one chains are already live, with more than 100 others in test networks. By next year, he anticipates that roughly 200 institutional and enterprise chains will be operating in finance, digital identity, artificial intelligence, and government services. As crypto enters its next phase, Avalanche’s leadership thinks these are the clearer prospects for the industry. The future will be developed on purpose-built blockchains rather than hype, Nahas said. Get seen where it counts.

This wave of forced selling, primarily in perpetual futures contracts, highlights the extreme volatility and risks inherent in leveraged trading. For traders and investors, understanding what triggered this event is crucial for navigating future market turbulence. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto futures liquidations mean. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because they no longer have enough funds to keep it open. This happens when the market moves against their bet. A cascade of these events can amplify price swings, creating a feedback loop of selling pressure. Therefore, monitoring crypto futures liquidations is a key gauge of market stress and trader sentiment. Breaking Down the $370M Liquidation Carnage The past 24 hours saw forced closures across major cryptocurrencies. Here is a breakdown of the top assets affected: Ethereum (ETH): Led the pack with $167 million in liquidations. A crushing 80.25% of these were long positions, meaning most traders betting on a price increase were wiped out. Bitcoin (BTC): Followed closely with $160 million. Interestingly, over half (53.58%) were short positions, indicating many who bet on a price drop also got caught in the volatility. Other Assets (like HYPE): Showed even more extreme skews, with one asset seeing over 99% of its $42.37 million in liquidations come from long positions. This data paints a picture of a market where aggressive leverage met sudden, opposing price action, resulting in a broad cleanup of positions. What Triggered This Wave of Crypto Futures Liquidations? While the specific catalyst can vary, large-scale crypto futures liquidations are often triggered by a sharp, unexpected price movement. This could be due to a major news event, a large whale selling, or simply the unwinding of over-leveraged positions in a thin market. The key takeaway is that high leverage multiplies both gains and losses. When the market turns, it turns quickly, and those using excessive leverage are the first to be liquidated. How Can Traders Navigate and Survive Liquidation Events? Surviving these market storms requires discipline and risk management. Here are actionable insights: Use Lower Leverage: High leverage is the fastest path to a liquidation. Using 2x or 5x instead of 10x or 25x dramatically increases your survival odds. Set Stop-Losses: A stop-loss order automatically exits your position at a predetermined price, helping you control losses before a forced liquidation. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive or negative funding rates in perpetual futures can signal overcrowded trades, which are prone to sudden reversals. Keep Adequate Margin: Always maintain a healthy cushion of collateral (margin) in your account to withstand normal price fluctuations. The Bottom Line on Market Volatility The $370 million in crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder: the crypto market is inherently volatile. While futures trading offers significant profit potential, it comes with equally significant risk. Events like this periodically reset over-leveraged markets and can create new opportunities for disciplined investors. The goal is not to avoid volatility but to manage your exposure to it wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a ‘liquidation’ in crypto futures? A: It’s when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their losses have nearly or completely depleted their initial collateral, ensuring the exchange doesn’t lose money. Q: Why did Ethereum have more long liquidations than Bitcoin? A: It suggests that leading up to the price drop, more traders were using leverage to bet on ETH rising compared to BTC, making those positions more vulnerable when the market fell. Q: Are liquidations always bad for the market? A: Not necessarily. While painful for those liquidated, they can remove excessive leverage and overconfidence, potentially leading to a healthier market foundation afterward. Q: Can I avoid getting liquidated? A> Absolutely. By using sensible leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and constantly monitoring your margin ratio, you can greatly reduce the risk of a forced liquidation. Q: Where can I track crypto futures liquidations in real-time? A> Several data websites like Coinglass provide real-time liquidation dashboards across all major exchanges. Q: Do large liquidations signal a market bottom or top? A> They can sometimes signal a local extreme. A massive long liquidation event might indicate capitulation and a potential short-term bottom, but it’s not a guaranteed indicator.

A tiny float and nonstop social hype kept RRP’s stock locked at its daily limit-up for 149 sessions, and both its exchange and the company warned buyers while the rally kept going. The story flipped when regulators stepped in. The Securities and Exchange Board of India opened a review into the surge, so the stock now trades only once a week under new exchange rules and has slipped 6% from its Nov. 7 high. Tracking the cracks as regulators act India has few listed chipmakers, and that gap turned RRP into a proxy for traders chasing the AI boom that lifted names like Nvidia. Sonam Srivastava of Wryght Research & Capital Pvt. said “ semiconductors have been really hot,” adding that traders jump at any local name tied to the space. The rush came even as exchanges across Asia pushed alerts. Moore Threads in Shanghai fell 13% on Dec. 12 after flagging risk. SK Hynix dropped after the Korean exchange raised a warning on Dec. 11. BSE, the exchange where RRP trades, said its surveillance steps went out through market circulars. RRP Electronics, owned by RRP Group founder Rajendra Chodankar, declined comment because of a legal appeal. His ties to RRP and a batch of related firms added more heat to the mystery around the stock. RRP’s shift started in early 2024 when Chodankar took control of G D Trading and Agencies by clearing an 80 million-rupee loan owed by its founders. On April 23, the board approved selling him and others shares at 12 rupees each, which was well below market price. The deal gave Chodankar 74.5% ownership and cut the founders to under 2%. The company later changed its name to RRP Semiconductor. Two months before that, Chodankar set up RRP Electronics Pvt. to build a chip assembly and testing plant in Maharashtra, a detail that fed traders’ belief that the listed company was part of the same semiconductor push. At an event in Navi Mumbai in September, he said, “India is going to be a superhuman, it’s established beyond doubt.” Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar were present at the launch, according to RRP’s videos. Showing the links behind the rally Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chip plan, a 760 billion-rupee program, attracted $18 billion from Micron, Tata, Foxconn and HCL Technologies. RRP listed RRP Electronics as a related party since Chodankar owns both, though the listed firm does not have a stake in the private one. About 98% of RRP’s shares sit with Chodankar and a small group tied to several RRP-linked companies, filings show. The exchange withdrew approval for a share sale in April and placed the stock under strict surveillance a year ago. SEBI had already said in 2024 that the firm fell under a group barred from the market after Shree Vindhya Paper Mills was delisted in 2017. A person at BSE said the exchange had an “internal lapse” when reviewing RRP’s offering and may ask SEBI if the lock-in should be extended. BSE said RRP stated in its application that it and its directors were not barred. As the stock exploded from 20 rupees in April 2024, Chodankar left the board. The CFO quit, then returned as company secretary. RRP filed a police report against a social-media influencer for spreading claims about ties to Tendulkar and state land. In a Nov. 3 filing, the firm said it had not started chipmaking work, had not applied for government programs, and denied celebrity links. Financials showed negative revenue of 68.2 million rupees and a net loss of 71.5 million rupees in the September quarter. The negative revenue came after RRP reversed sales from a 4.4-billion-rupee deal with Telecrown Infratech that fell apart over “contractual disagreements.” It also canceled 80 million rupees of revenue earlier in the year.

This peak was fueled by post-election optimism in the crypto market and renewed institutional interest. However, the year saw a sharp correction, with SOL dropping over 55% during Q4 amid broader market pressures, including macroeconomic uncertainties and reduced liquidity. By mid-December 2025, SOL traded around $130–$135, reflecting a bearish short-term sentiment but strong underlying fundamentals.

DeFi activity remained robust, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing $4.5–$13 billion at points, driven by high-throughput applications. Major Events Impacting Price Several pivotal events shaped SOL’s trajectory: January ATH Surge. SOL hit $294 amid crypto-friendly policy expectations following the U.S. election outcomes, boosting overall market sentiment. Network Upgrades. Key advancements included the rollout of Firedancer (a new validator client for improved reliability and performance) and progress on Alpenglow consensus upgrade, reducing finality to ~150ms and enhancing scalability. These mitigated past outage concerns and attracted high-frequency trading firms. Breakpoint 2025 Conference. Held in Abu Dhabi (or alternative locations per reports), it featured announcements on tokenization, stablecoins (e.g., Circle minting $500M USDC on Solana), and real-world assets (RWAs), reinforcing institutional adoption. Q4 Correction. A 55% drawdown from the ATH was influenced by global risk-off sentiment, though fundamentals like revenue and activity diverged positively from price action. Meme coin frenzy and DeFi volumes also played roles, with spikes in activity from tokens like BONK and new launches driving temporary pumps followed by corrections. Trends and Developments Solana solidified its position as a high-performance Layer-1 in 2025: DeFi and Meme Coin Dominance. Solana led in DEX volumes and meme coin launches, with vibrant ecosystems in NFTs, gaming, and RWAs. TVL growth and developer activity outpaced competitors. Institutional Momentum. Partnerships, stablecoin integrations, and potential ETF speculation increased inflows, positioning Solana for tokenized securities and payments. Technical Resilience. Upgrades like Firedancer and Alpenglow addressed scalability and reliability, enabling 65,000+ TPS and sub-150ms latency. Despite challenges like regulatory uncertainty, Solana’s low fees and speed continued attracting builders, with events like Accelerate and community conferences fostering growth. Forecast for 2026 Looking to 2026, experts are predominantly bullish on SOL, citing continued upgrades, ecosystem expansion, and potential bull market recovery. Predictions vary: CoinCodex and similar platforms forecast $140–$150 early in 2026, with upside to $200+ if adoption accelerates. More optimistic views (e.g., InvestingHaven, CryptoNews) see averages around $300–$400, with highs up to $644 in bullish scenarios. Analysts like Miles Deutscher and panels from Changelly emphasize $300–$500 potential, driven by DeFi dominance and institutional capital. Risks include macro downturns or delays in upgrades, but Solana’s flywheel of activity and innovation positions it for strong recovery and growth in 2026.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BONK|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 03:37:27

This launch marks a pivotal moment for the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization space, directly tackling one of its biggest hurdles—fragmented liquidity. Built in collaboration with interoperability protocol LayerZero, the bridge empowers users to move over 100 different RWA tokens seamlessly between the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks. Let’s explore what this means for the future of finance. What Exactly is the Ondo Bridge and Why Does It Matter? The Ondo Bridge is a specialized cross-chain communication protocol. Think of it as a secure highway built specifically for tokenized real-world assets. Before its launch, an RWA token issued on Ethereum was largely confined to that ecosystem. This created silos, limiting user access and fragmenting market liquidity. The new Ondo Bridge smashes these barriers, enabling trustless transfers of assets like tokenized treasury bills, bonds, and commodities between two of the largest blockchains. This development is crucial because it enhances capital efficiency and broadens investor choice. A user on BNB Chain can now easily access yield-bearing RWA opportunities originally launched on Ethereum, and vice-versa. Therefore, the bridge doesn’t just move tokens; it connects economies and unlocks unprecedented flexibility for decentralized finance (DeFi). How Does the Ondo Bridge Work with LayerZero? The technical backbone of this operation is LayerZero, a leading omnichain interoperability protocol. Ondo Finance didn’t build the communication layer from scratch; instead, it leveraged LayerZero’s proven, secure messaging system. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process: Initiation: A user locks their RWA tokens in a smart contract on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum). Message Relaying: LayerZero’s ultra-light nodes (Oracles and Relayers) securely transmit proof of this lock to the destination chain (e.g., BNB Chain). Minting: Upon verification, an equivalent amount of the same RWA token is minted on the destination chain for the user. Security First: This design ensures assets are never custodied by a central party; the system uses cryptographic proofs for security. This collaboration means the Ondo Bridge inherits the security and reliability of the robust LayerZero network, which is already trusted by hundreds of applications. What Are the Immediate Benefits of Using the Ondo Bridge? The launch delivers tangible advantages for various market participants right now. For investors and DeFi users, it’s a game-changer. Expanded Access: Instantly tap into a wider array of RWA yields and products without being chain-restricted. Improved Liquidity: By pooling liquidity from two major chains, trading depth improves, potentially leading to better prices and lower slippage. Enhanced Composability: RWA tokens can now be more easily integrated into multi-chain DeFi strategies, lending protocols, and yield aggregators. Reduced Friction: Eliminates the need for complex, multi-step processes involving centralized exchanges to move between chains. Moreover, for the broader RWA ecosystem, this is a significant step towards maturity. It signals that infrastructure is evolving to support the scalable, cross-chain future that institutional adoption requires. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Cross-Chain RWA Transfers? While the Ondo Bridge is a powerful solution, it operates within a landscape of inherent challenges. Security remains the paramount concern for any cross-chain activity; users must trust the underlying smart contracts and the LayerZero protocol’s security assumptions. Additionally, bridging activities introduce new variables like gas fees on two networks and potential latency during the message-passing process. Another consideration is regulatory clarity. As real-world assets are by nature tied to traditional finance, their cross-chain movement may attract scrutiny from regulators watching how compliance (like KYC/AML) travels across decentralized networks. Ondo Finance and similar projects must navigate this evolving space carefully. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Accessible Real-World Assets The launch of the Ondo Bridge is more than a product update; it’s a strategic infrastructure upgrade for the entire tokenized assets space. By seamlessly connecting Ethereum and BNB Chain, Ondo Finance is removing critical friction points, empowering users, and setting a new standard for RWA accessibility. This move accelerates the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance, making sophisticated investment strategies more democratic. The bridge is now live, inviting users to experience a more connected and efficient future for finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What tokens can I transfer using the Ondo Bridge? A: Initially, the Ondo Bridge supports over 100 real-world asset (RWA) tokens native to the Ondo ecosystem, including their flagship products like OUSG (tokenized U.S. Treasuries), moving between Ethereum and BNB Chain. Q: Is using the Ondo Bridge safe? A: The bridge is built using LayerZero’s audited and widely-used cross-chain messaging protocol. However, as with any DeFi protocol, users should conduct their own research, understand the smart contract risks, and start with small amounts. Q: Are there any fees for bridging? A: Yes, you will need to pay network gas fees on both the source and destination blockchain to execute the transaction. There may also be a small protocol fee. Q: How long does a cross-chain transfer take? A: Transfer times can vary based on network congestion, but using LayerZero’s infrastructure, transactions are typically confirmed within a few minutes. Q: Can I bridge tokens to chains other than Ethereum or BNB Chain? A: The initial launch supports Ethereum and BNB Chain. However, given the collaboration with LayerZero, future expansions to other compatible chains like Arbitrum, Polygon, or Avalanche are a logical possibility. Q: Do I need to complete KYC to use the Ondo Bridge? A: The bridge itself is a permissionless protocol. However, accessing the underlying RWA tokens (like OUSG) on Ondo Finance’s platform may require KYC, depending on the product and your jurisdiction.

In a significant development for institutional adoption, global asset manager Invesco has partnered with Galaxy Asset Management to launch the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETP (QSOL). This new product provides a regulated, exchange-traded pathway for investors to gain exposure to the spot price of Solana, marking a pivotal moment for the blockchain network. But what exactly is a Solana ETP , and why does this launch matter for the broader market? What is the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETP? An Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) is a security that tracks the price of an underlying asset and trades on a traditional stock exchange. The newly launched Solana ETP , tickered QSOL, is designed to mirror the performance of Solana’s spot price. This partnership leverages Invesco’s massive scale in traditional finance and Galaxy’s deep expertise in digital assets. Therefore, it creates a bridge for conventional investors who seek crypto exposure without the complexities of direct ownership, like managing private keys or using crypto exchanges. Why is This Solana ETP Launch a Big Deal? This announcement is more than just another financial product. It represents a powerful validation signal from the traditional finance world. Here are the key implications: Institutional Gateway: It provides a familiar, regulated vehicle for pensions, hedge funds, and other large institutions to allocate capital to Solana. Enhanced Legitimacy: Backing from established names like Invesco and Galaxy boosts Solana’s credibility as a core crypto asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Simplified Access: Investors can now buy and sell exposure to Solana through their existing brokerage accounts, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry. Moreover, this move follows the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, suggesting a clear pattern of institutional acceptance for major digital assets. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? Like any financial innovation, the Solana ETP comes with its own set of opportunities and considerations for investors. Key Benefits for Investors Regulatory Clarity: Trading occurs within a well-defined regulatory framework, offering peace of mind. Security and Convenience: Custody is handled by the institutions, removing technical hurdles. Portfolio Integration: Easily fits into a diversified traditional investment portfolio. Important Considerations However, investors should be aware of certain factors. ETPs typically carry management fees, which can slightly erode returns over time. Furthermore, while the ETP tracks the spot price, it does not grant direct ownership of SOL tokens, meaning holders cannot participate in network activities like staking. Finally, the product’s success is tied to Solana’s own network performance and market adoption. The Future of Crypto ETPs and Market Impact The launch of a Solana ETP is a clear indicator of where the market is heading. It signals that asset managers view Solana as a foundational layer-1 blockchain with lasting value. This institutional endorsement could lead to increased liquidity and stability for SOL. Consequently, we may see other major altcoins follow suit, seeking similar structured products to attract institutional capital. Conclusion: A Milestone for Mainstream Crypto Adoption The collaboration between Invesco and Galaxy to launch a Solana ETP is a transformative step. It powerfully bridges the gap between the innovative world of decentralized blockchain and the established realm of global finance. For Solana, it provides a robust channel for sustained capital inflow. For the average investor, it offers a streamlined, secure door into the crypto ecosystem. This move underscores a broader trend: digital assets are becoming an indispensable part of the modern financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ticker symbol for the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETP? The product trades under the ticker symbol QSOL . Where can I buy the Solana ETP? The Solana ETP (QSOL) will be available for trading on traditional stock exchanges in jurisdictions where it is approved, accessible through standard brokerage accounts. Does holding the Solana ETP mean I own SOL tokens? No. When you invest in the ETP, you own shares of the product that tracks Solana’s price. You do not directly own or have control over the underlying SOL tokens held in custody by the product issuer. Can I stake my Solana through this ETP? Typically, no. ETPs of this nature are designed for price exposure and do not pass on staking rewards to shareholders. The custodian may choose to stake the underlying assets, but any rewards are usually reinvested into the fund or used to offset fees. How does this differ from a Bitcoin ETF? The structure is conceptually similar—both are exchange-traded products providing exposure to a cryptocurrency. The primary difference is the underlying asset (Solana vs. Bitcoin). Regulatory approval processes and specific structures (ETP vs. ETF) can also vary by region. Is this product available to U.S. investors? Initial reports suggest the product is launching in Europe. Availability for U.S. investors depends on future regulatory approvals from bodies like the SEC. Found this insight into the new Solana ETP valuable?

That’s exactly what’s happening with USDT payments . Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has processed a staggering $156 billion in small-value transactions under $1,000 so far this year. This isn’t just a big number—it’s a revolution in how people move money globally. Why Are Small USDT Payments Exploding in Popularity? According to data from Chainalysis and Artemis, the average daily volume for these small USDT payments now exceeds $500 million. This massive flow of capital highlights a fundamental shift. People aren’t just holding USDT as a digital asset; they’re actively using it to pay for goods and services. The market clearly views Tether’s stablecoin as a reliable global payment rail for U.S. dollar transactions. This trend is most powerful in regions with limited access to traditional banking. For millions, opening a dollar-denominated bank account is impossible. However, with a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can access USDT payments . This bridges a critical gap in the global financial system. How USDT is Becoming the World’s Digital Dollar Highway Think of USDT as a new financial infrastructure. Traditional cross-border payments are often slow, expensive, and opaque. In contrast, USDT payments on blockchains like Tron and Ethereum are near-instant and have transparent fees. This efficiency is driving adoption for everyday use cases. Remittances: Migrant workers can send money home faster and cheaper than through services like Western Union. Freelance Payments: International freelancers receive payments in a stable currency without worrying about bank delays. Commerce: Small businesses can accept dollar payments from anywhere in the world, bypassing complex merchant accounts. This utility transforms USDT from a trading tool into an essential financial service. The $156 billion volume proves that demand for efficient, borderless dollars is not just theoretical—it’s here and growing exponentially. What Challenges Does This Growth Present? However, this rapid adoption doesn’t come without hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny remains intense. Authorities worldwide are concerned about the potential for USDT payments to be used for illicit activities due to their pseudonymous nature. Tether must continue to work with regulators and enhance its compliance measures. Furthermore, the user experience still needs refinement. While sending USDT is technically simple, the process of onboarding fiat currency (real-world money) onto a crypto platform can be confusing for newcomers. Simplifying this journey is crucial for mainstream adoption. Despite these challenges, the trajectory is clear. The sheer volume of transactions indicates that the benefits—speed, low cost, and accessibility—far outweigh the current friction points for a vast global user base. The Future of Global Finance Runs on Stablecoins The data tells a compelling story: USDT is no longer just a crypto trading pair. It has matured into a foundational layer for a new, more inclusive global economy. The $156 billion in small-value USDT payments is a powerful signal that people are voting with their wallets for a better financial system. This growth will likely push further innovation in wallets, point-of-sale systems, and regulatory frameworks designed specifically for stablecoin payments. As these tools improve, we can expect the daily volume of USDT payments to climb even higher, solidifying its role as the digital dollar for the internet age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are “small-value” USDT payments? The report defines them as individual transactions worth less than $1,000. This typically includes everyday payments like remittances, online purchases, and peer-to-peer transfers, rather than large institutional trades. Why is USDT preferred over other stablecoins for payments? USDT has the largest market capitalization and the deepest liquidity across the most blockchain networks (like Tron and Ethereum). This makes it the most widely accepted and easiest stablecoin to send and receive globally. Is it safe to use USDT for everyday payments? The technology (blockchain) is secure, but users must practice good security. This includes using reputable wallets, safeguarding private keys, and double-checking recipient addresses, as transactions are irreversible. How does this impact traditional banks? It presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Banks face competition for cross-border payment services. However, many are now exploring how to integrate stablecoins like USDT into their own offerings to modernize their services. What does this mean for the future of cash? In regions with high inflation or poor banking, digital dollars like USDT could become a more common store of value and medium of exchange than physical cash, driving financial inclusion. Are there fees for sending USDT? Yes, but they are typically much lower than traditional wire transfers or remittance services. The fee is a small network transaction fee paid in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain (e.g., TRX for the Tron network) used to process the USDT payment .

Halving Narrative Is Evolving Beyond Fixed Timelines,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-era-loading/,"The idea that Bitcoin’s halving operates on a fixed four-year timetable has become one of the most oversimplified narratives in the crypto markets. While the halving still reduces new supply, its influence is no longer confined to predictable timelines or uniform outcomes. As BTC matures into a globally traded asset, the forces shaping its market behavior have expanded beyond the event. How The Cycle Narrative Became Oversimplified In an X post, an analyst known as Deg_ape revealed that the Bitcoin halving cycle was never a rigid four-year clock. BTC’s cycle has always been about phase transitions, shifting liquidity conditions, and market behavior, but never about buying every four years and selling four years later. This cycle actually maps macro bear phases that expand, contract, overlap, and stretch based on macro flows and positioning. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Structure Weakens As Inter-Exchange Liquidity Touches Red Zone – Details The four-year cycle still exists, but it is not a linear process. Deg_ape explains that BTC halvings act as a structural anchor, not a price guarantee. This is why market tops usually arrive later than most expect and why bear markets last longer than people can tolerate. Trying to time the BTC market cycle without understanding that these phase dynamics can lead to expensive mistakes. Kyle Chassé has pointed out that Bitcoin dipped, and traders stopped watching the printer, which is a big mistake. This is the most dangerous divergence in the market as price is down, but liquidity is vertical. While traders were panicking and selling their slips, the US Treasury and the Fed quietly injected around $130 billion of fresh liquidity into the system. This shows that liquidity would lead the price, but it won’t do it instantly. There’s a big lag as liquidity will flood the market first, then the assets will reprice. However, a red candle on a green liquidity chart isn’t a crash, but a mispricing. While the printer is screaming up, the price chart is whispering down. Why Retail Holders Are Capitulating At A Historic Rate A crypto analyst known as OnChainCollege outlined that retail holders are under pressure. On-chain data shows the deepest 30-day balance decline among retail wallets since 2018, a level typically associated with periods of extreme fear and capitulation. While retail balances are falling sharply, larger holder cohorts are quietly absorbing the difference. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Exhaustion? BTC Whales Close Long Positions After Extreme Upside Bets The market sentiment has split into two groups with polar-opposite perspectives from retail that are reacting to price action against larger holders that are responding to structure, liquidity, and long-term positioning.

55961496,646198,1766030445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55961496.jpeg,A Structural Shift in Bitcoin: BTC’s Network Activity Tells a New Story,https://bitcoinist.com/a-structural-shift-in-bitcoin-btcs-network-activity/,"Bitcoin is struggling to break away from the bearish market structure that has been in place since late October. Despite several short-lived relief rallies, price action continues to reflect weakness, with bulls failing to reclaim key resistance levels or generate sustained momentum. As uncertainty and fatigue spread across the market, many participants are questioning whether Bitcoin’s current behavior fits the traditional cycle framework that has defined previous bull and bear phases. A recent analysis by Darkfost highlights a structural shift that adds important context to this debate. According to the data , the number of active Bitcoin addresses has been in a persistent decline since April 2021. Historically, bullish phases were characterized by a clear expansion in active addresses, as new investors entered the market and on-chain activity surged. This growth typically peaked near cycle tops, followed by a contraction during bear markets as participation dried up. This cycle, however, looks markedly different. Even during periods of strong price performance since 2022, active addresses have failed to recover meaningfully and continue trending lower. This divergence suggests that Bitcoin’s market structure may be evolving away from a retail-driven, on-chain participation model toward something more concentrated and institutionally influenced. As Bitcoin attempts to stabilize after weeks of downside pressure, understanding these structural changes is becoming critical. The decline in active addresses may not simply signal weakness, but rather a transformation in how Bitcoin is held, traded, and valued in this cycle. Active Addresses Signal A Structural Shift In The Market The analysis suggests that despite Bitcoin’s strong price performance since 2022, on-chain participation continues to deteriorate. Active addresses are once again approaching the lowest levels observed during this cycle, highlighting a growing disconnect between price action and network activity. At the peak in April 2021, Bitcoin recorded roughly 1.15 million active addresses. Today, that figure has nearly halved, sitting near 680,000, a contraction that cannot be ignored. This decline is difficult to attribute to a single cause. Instead, it likely reflects a combination of structural changes in how Bitcoin is held and accessed. One contributing factor appears to be the rise in inactive addresses. While precise classification criteria vary, the broader trend points toward a stronger long-term holding mentality, where coins remain dormant rather than actively transacted on-chain. This behavior reduces visible network activity without necessarily implying bearish conviction. At the same time, a portion of market participants may have shifted away from direct on-chain usage altogether. Centralized exchanges, custodial platforms, and financial products such as ETFs offer exposure to Bitcoin without requiring on-chain interaction. As a result, demand for block space declines even as capital allocation to Bitcoin remains significant. Taken together, the sustained drop in active addresses suggests Bitcoin’s market structure is evolving. The network is becoming less retail-driven and more concentrated, reinforcing the idea that traditional cycle metrics may be losing some of their explanatory power in this environment. Bitcoin Price Tests Long-Term Support as Structure Weakens Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with the chart highlighting a clear deterioration in market structure. After failing to sustain prices above the $100K–$110K zone earlier in the year, BTC has entered a corrective phase marked by lower highs and heavy selling momentum. The recent move toward the $87K area places price directly on a critical demand zone, closely aligned with the rising long-term moving averages. From a trend perspective, the loss of the short- and medium-term moving averages is significant. The blue and green averages have rolled over, acting as dynamic resistance rather than support, reinforcing the bearish bias. Price is now hovering just above the red long-term moving average, a level that has historically defined the boundary between bull market corrections and deeper bearish transitions. A clean breakdown below this zone would materially increase downside risk toward the low-$80K region. Volume behavior adds further context. Selling pressure expanded notably during the sharp drawdown from the highs, while recent bounce attempts have occurred on comparatively weaker volume. This suggests that dip-buying interest remains cautious rather than aggressive. Structurally, the market appears to be consolidating after distribution, not building a strong base yet. In the near term, holding the $85K–$88K range is crucial. A failure to defend this area would confirm a broader trend shift, while reclaiming the $95K–$100K region is required to neutralize the current bearish structure.

Their buying spree occurred between November 2022 and March 2023, with an average cost of just $1,500 per token. This Ethereum whale then demonstrated incredible discipline, entering a period of dormancy for 1,127 days while the market evolved. Their strategy highlights several key principles of successful crypto investing: Accumulation in Fear: They bought aggressively when market sentiment was low. Patience as a Virtue: They held through multiple market cycles without panic selling. Staged Exit: They sold their assets in phases over two weeks, avoiding market impact. What Does This Major Ethereum Transaction Signal for the Market? The whale completed their exit by selling the final 2,040 ETH approximately 10 hours before this analysis. A profit of 6.2 billion won (approximately $4.5 million) represents a significant return on a three-year investment. However, does this signal a lack of confidence in Ethereum’s future, or simply a savvy investor taking well-earned profits? Large transactions from a Ethereum whale always attract scrutiny. This particular move is noteworthy for its timing and execution. The investor avoided dumping all tokens at once, which could have caused unnecessary price volatility. Instead, they employed a measured approach that suggests sophisticated market understanding. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors from This Whale’s Move Every major move by a Ethereum whale offers lessons for retail investors. This transaction particularly emphasizes the power of conviction and timing. The investor identified an accumulation zone during bear market conditions and maintained their position through subsequent rallies and corrections. Consider these actionable insights from this whale’s strategy: Dollar-Cost Averaging Works: Their purchases occurred over four months, averaging their entry price. Hodling Has Its Rewards: 1,127 days of patience yielded multimillion-dollar returns. Exit Strategies Matter: Their phased selling protected their profit margins. How Does Whale Activity Impact the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? When a Ethereum whale makes a move of this magnitude, it creates ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Other large holders monitor these transactions closely, and retail investors often look to whale activity for market signals. However, it’s crucial to remember that every investor has unique circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. This particular whale’s success story demonstrates that strategic accumulation during market downturns, combined with extraordinary patience, can create life-changing returns in the cryptocurrency space. Their story serves as both inspiration and a case study in disciplined crypto investment. Conclusion: The Wisdom of the Ethereum Whale The journey of this Ethereum whale from accumulation to profitable exit provides a masterclass in cryptocurrency investment psychology. Their $4.5 million profit wasn’t the result of luck or timing the market perfectly, but rather consistent strategy and emotional discipline. While not every investor can replicate these results, everyone can learn from the principles demonstrated: buy when others are fearful, hold with conviction, and exit with strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a significantly large amount of ETH, giving them potential influence over market prices through their trading activities. How much ETH makes someone a whale? While there’s no official threshold, addresses holding tens of thousands of ETH are generally considered whales, as their transactions can noticeably impact market liquidity and price. Should I follow whale trading activity? Whale activity provides valuable market data points, but it shouldn’t be your sole investment strategy. Whales have different financial goals, risk profiles, and information access than most retail investors. What does this whale’s sale mean for ETH price? A single whale exiting a position doesn’t necessarily predict price direction. The market absorbed this staged selling without major disruption, suggesting healthy underlying demand. How can I track whale activity myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or specialized analytics platforms that monitor large transactions and wallet movements across the Ethereum network. Is holding for 1,127 days a common strategy? Such extended holding periods are less common but often characterize successful long-term investors who believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition beyond short-term price fluctuations.

This strategic decision represents a significant milestone in corporate cryptocurrency adoption, demonstrating how traditional companies are embracing blockchain technology as part of their long-term investment strategy. Why Is TORICO’s Decision to Purchase ETH So Significant? TORICO’s announcement to purchase ETH marks one of the most substantial corporate cryptocurrency commitments from a Japanese listed company. The company raised 470 million yen specifically for this purpose, showing deliberate planning rather than casual experimentation. This move follows a global trend of institutions recognizing Ethereum’s potential beyond mere speculation. What makes this particularly noteworthy is TORICO’s established position on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Their decision carries weight in traditional financial circles, potentially influencing other listed companies to consider similar moves. The phased approach to purchase ETH starting in January 2026 indicates careful strategic planning rather than impulsive market timing. The Strategic Framework Behind TORICO’s ETH Acquisition TORICO isn’t simply buying cryptocurrency—they’re building infrastructure. The company plans to establish a comprehensive digital asset management and operational framework before they begin to purchase ETH. This systematic approach includes: Phased acquisition strategy beginning January 2026 Professional custody solutions for secure storage Compliance frameworks meeting Japanese regulatory standards Long-term holding strategy rather than short-term trading This structured methodology demonstrates how serious institutions approach cryptocurrency investments differently from retail investors. TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH represents calculated corporate strategy, not speculative gambling. What This Means for Institutional Cryptocurrency Adoption TORICO’s move to purchase ETH signals a maturing market where established companies feel confident allocating significant capital to digital assets. Several factors make this development particularly important: First, it validates Ethereum’s position as an institutional-grade asset. Second, it demonstrates that listed companies can transparently incorporate cryptocurrency into their balance sheets. Third, it may encourage regulatory clarity as more traditional entities enter the space. The timing is also significant. By planning to purchase ETH starting in 2026, TORICO shows confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects beyond current market cycles. This forward-looking approach suggests they view ETH as a strategic asset rather than a tactical trade. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate ETH Investments While TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH represents progress, corporate cryptocurrency adoption still faces hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern, especially for publicly listed companies requiring transparency. Market volatility also presents accounting challenges, though TORICO’s phased approach may mitigate timing risks. Security represents another critical consideration. The company’s commitment to establishing a digital asset management framework suggests they recognize these challenges and are addressing them proactively. Their systematic plan to purchase ETH demonstrates how institutions can navigate cryptocurrency investments responsibly. The Future Impact of TORICO’s ETH Purchase Strategy TORICO’s announcement could trigger a domino effect among other Japanese and global companies. As more institutions witness successful corporate cryptocurrency adoption, barriers to entry may lower. The company’s transparent approach provides a potential blueprint for others considering similar moves. Furthermore, TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH specifically, rather than other cryptocurrencies, reinforces Ethereum’s unique position in the institutional landscape. The network’s established ecosystem, developer community, and transition to proof-of-stake make it particularly attractive for corporate adoption. This strategic move represents more than just a corporate investment—it’s a signal that cryptocurrency is transitioning from alternative asset to mainstream portfolio component. TORICO’s careful planning to purchase ETH demonstrates how traditional finance and blockchain technology can converge productively. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Corporate Crypto Adoption TORICO’s $3 million commitment to purchase ETH marks a pivotal development in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The company’s methodical approach—establishing frameworks before acquisition, implementing phased buying starting in 2026, and transparent communication—sets a new standard for corporate digital asset strategy. This move validates Ethereum’s institutional appeal while demonstrating that listed companies can responsibly incorporate cryptocurrency into their operations. As more traditional entities follow TORICO’s lead, we may witness accelerated convergence between conventional finance and blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions When will TORICO begin to purchase ETH? TOSHIBA plans to begin its phased acquisition of ETH in January 2026, following the establishment of their digital asset management framework. Why did TORICO choose to purchase ETH specifically? While the company hasn’t disclosed all criteria, Ethereum’s established ecosystem, institutional recognition, and transition to proof-of-stake likely contributed to their decision to purchase ETH over other cryptocurrencies. How much ETH will TORICO purchase with $3 million? The exact amount will depend on Ethereum’s price when they execute their purchases starting in 2026. At current prices, $3 million would represent approximately [current ETH amount] tokens. Is TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH risky for a listed company? All investments carry risk, but TORICO’s phased approach and framework development suggest they’re mitigating volatility risks through careful planning rather than making a single large purchase. Could other Japanese companies follow TORICO’s lead? Yes, TORICO’s transparent approach provides a potential model for other listed companies considering cryptocurrency investments, possibly accelerating institutional adoption in Japan and globally. Will TORICO’s decision to purchase ETH affect Ethereum’s price? While $3 million represents a modest portion of Ethereum’s market capitalization, the symbolic importance of institutional adoption may influence market sentiment positively over the long term.

According to a groundbreaking forecast from asset manager Bitwise, this could be our reality next year. The firm predicts Bitcoin volatility will actually fall below that of semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia. This signals a potential seismic shift in how we perceive crypto markets. Why Is Bitcoin Volatility Expected to Drop? Bitwise’s report, cited by Cointelegraph, points to one primary catalyst: institutional maturity. For years, Bitcoin volatility was driven by retail sentiment and speculative trading. However, the landscape is transforming. The firm anticipates lower volatility as heavyweight institutional investors steadily enter the arena and the asset itself matures. A key factor in this shift is the ecosystem around spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These regulated products provide a familiar and secure gateway for traditional finance. Consequently, they are attracting a new class of long-term, stability-focused capital. How Are Big Institutions Changing the Game? The entry of titans like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo is not just about new money. It’s about a fundamental diversification of Bitcoin’s investment structure. Think of it this way: Reduced Risk: Institutional portfolios are typically managed with strict risk parameters, promoting steadier holding patterns. Market Depth: Their large-scale participation adds immense liquidity, making the market harder to move with single trades. Professional Oversight: These firms conduct deep due diligence, fostering a more rational, data-driven market environment. This institutional wave is actively diluting the influence of short-term speculators, which is a direct path to reducing overall Bitcoin volatility . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price and Related Stocks? Interestingly, lower volatility does not mean lower ambition for Bitwise. The firm boldly projects that BTC will reach a new all-time high next year. This combines the promise of price growth with the appeal of a smoother ride—a combination that has historically attracted more conservative capital. Moreover, Bitwise extends its optimism beyond the core asset. The report suggests that crypto-themed stocks are poised to outperform general tech stocks. This indicates a broadening of the bullish thesis across the entire digital asset ecosystem, from the currency to the companies building around it. Is This the Final Step to Mainstream Acceptance? For skeptics who have long pointed to wild price swings as a barrier to adoption, this forecast is a powerful counter-argument. If Bitcoin volatility consistently trends downward and even undercuts major tech stocks, it fundamentally reshapes the asset’s risk profile. This maturation could unlock further adoption from pension funds, insurance companies, and other entities with low tolerance for turbulence. Therefore, the prediction is about more than just price action; it’s about Bitcoin cementing its role as a legitimate, mature component of the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era of Stability Bitwise’s analysis paints a compelling picture of Bitcoin’s future: one defined less by heart-stopping dips and spikes and more by steady, institutional-driven growth. The prediction that Bitcoin volatility will dip below Nvidia’s is a symbolic milestone, representing the asset’s journey from niche digital gold to a mature financial instrument. For investors, this potential stability, coupled with continued price appreciation, creates an unprecedented and attractive opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘volatility’ mean in this context? A1: Volatility refers to the degree of variation in an asset’s trading price over time. High volatility means large, rapid price swings, while low volatility indicates more stable, predictable price movement. Q2: Why is Nvidia used as a comparison point? A2: Nvidia is a bellwether technology stock known for significant growth but also notable price fluctuations. Comparing Bitcoin to a major tech stock helps contextualize its risk profile for traditional investors. Q3: How do Bitcoin ETFs reduce volatility? A3: ETFs attract institutional investors who tend to buy and hold assets as long-term investments. This steady, large-scale demand increases market liquidity and reduces the impact of speculative, short-term trading. Q4: Does lower volatility mean lower potential returns? A4: Not necessarily. An asset can still achieve significant price growth (like Bitwise’s all-time high prediction) while experiencing fewer extreme daily swings. Stability can actually enable larger capital inflows, potentially boosting long-term returns. Q5: What are ‘crypto-themed stocks’? A5: These are publicly traded companies whose business is heavily tied to the cryptocurrency industry, such as crypto mining companies, exchange platforms, or blockchain technology firms.

According to the statement, five specific circumstances have been outlined under which the U.S. SEC would not object to deeming physical possession as a valid means of identification. The statement aims to provide detailed guidance on how broker-dealers can comply with custody obligations for crypto asset securities under existing federal rules. The U.S. SEC stated that the guidance is part of an effort to provide clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto asset securities. Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner, praised the statement’s clarity and called for prompt recommendations on potential amendments to the Rule 15c3-3. U.S. SEC’s new guidance targets paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c3-3 Crypto asset securities have been defined as tokenized representations of equity or debt securities recorded on distributed ledger technology, according to the statement . The new guidance is part of paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows and regulates broker-dealers to promptly obtain and maintain physical possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities carried for customer accounts. The U.S. SEC Division of Trading and Markets outlined that the new guidance applies to any broker-dealer handling crypto assets for customers, including firms engaged in both traditional securities operations and digital asset activities. The release follows inquiries from the market participants seeking a clearer rule applying to blockchain-based assets. According to the U.S. SEC Division for Trading and Markets, its views are confined to physical possession and do not extend to the control aspect, except for broker-dealer financial responsibility rules and additional federal securities law requirements. The staff noted that the statement carries no legal enforcement, does not modify applicable laws, and imposes no new or further obligations. Hester M. Peirce, U.S. SEC Commissioner, released a separate statement praising the clarity. She said the guidance now offers valuable clarity for broker-dealers that aim to provide custody services, especially through requirements for private key protection that align with industry best practices. Peirce thanked Jamie Selway, Director of the Trading and Markets division, and the staff for their efforts and urged the Division to prepare recommendations for the full Commission on amending Rule 15c3-3 to fully accommodate crypto asset custody. U.S. SEC issues five conditions for crypto possession compliance The SEC crypto task force staff issued five circumstances in which they would not recommend enforcement action against a broker-dealer for taking physical possession of customer crypto asset securities. The first circumstance requires the broker-dealer that maintains direct custody to have immediate access to the asset and the technical ability to transfer it across the blockchain. Secondly, the broker-dealer must establish, maintain, and enforce reasonable, written policies and procedures for thorough assessments of the blockchain and its associated networks. The U.S. SEC further noted that the evaluations must be conducted before initiating custody and at reasonable subsequent intervals. According to the U.S. SEC Division for Trading and Markets, key evaluation factors to be considered during assessments of the blockchain include performance reliability, transaction speed and throughput, scalability for increased activity, resilience in times of failure, and security features. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC stated that consensus mechanisms, complexity for maintenance, extensibility for new features, visibility through public code, and documentation are essential factors to consider during assessments. Governance processes such as protocol upgrades, changes, airdrops, and token exchanges are also expected to be reviewed under the new guidance to detect weaknesses that may impair possession. The division’s third circumstance prevents claiming possession if the broker-dealer is aware of material security vulnerabilities, operational deficiencies, and other potential risks directly tied to custody of assets on the specific blockchain, independent of market or reputational concerns. The fourth circumstance requires the broker-dealer to have robust policies, procedures, and controls that are consistent with the industry best practices in safeguarding private keys against theft. Lastly, the fifth circumstance requires a pre-planned policy and procedures that address potential disruptions. These procedures are in response to events such as blockchain malfunctions or failures. Additionally, the pre-planned arrangements should include mechanisms to comply with court orders to seize, freeze, burn tokens, or blockchain transfers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

After two consecutive days of net outflows, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a stunning $459.24 million net inflow on December 17th. This dramatic reversal signals renewed institutional confidence and could mark a turning point for Bitcoin ETF adoption among traditional investors. What Drove the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Surge? According to data from TraderT, the positive momentum came primarily from two institutional giants. Fidelity’s FBTC attracted approximately $390 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT pulled in around $110 million. These substantial inflows completely overwhelmed the modest outflows from other funds, creating the impressive net positive figure. This development matters because Bitcoin ETFs serve as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. When major financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock see significant inflows, it suggests that professional investors are positioning themselves for potential Bitcoin price appreciation. The timing is particularly noteworthy given recent market volatility. Which Bitcoin ETFs Gained and Which Lost? The December 17th flows revealed a clear divergence among different Bitcoin ETF providers. While Fidelity and BlackRock dominated the positive side, other funds experienced contrasting fortunes: Fidelity FBTC: $390 million inflow BlackRock IBIT: $110 million inflow Ark Invest ARKB: $36.96 million outflow Bitwise BITB: $8.41 million outflow The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market saw no net change in their flows. This pattern indicates that investors are becoming more selective, potentially favoring funds from established financial institutions with longer track records in traditional markets. Why Does This Bitcoin ETF Reversal Matter? This inflow reversal breaks a concerning pattern. Two consecutive days of outflows had raised questions about whether institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs was waning. However, the December 17th data suggests otherwise. The substantial inflows demonstrate that major investors view current price levels as attractive entry points. Moreover, the concentration of inflows toward Fidelity and BlackRock highlights an important trend. Institutional investors appear to trust established financial brands when accessing cryptocurrency exposure. This preference could shape the competitive landscape for Bitcoin ETFs moving forward, potentially consolidating assets among a few dominant providers. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The renewed interest in Bitcoin ETFs typically correlates with positive price momentum for Bitcoin itself. When institutions allocate capital to these funds, the underlying Bitcoin must be purchased, creating buying pressure in the market. This mechanism creates a direct link between Bitcoin ETF flows and Bitcoin’s market price. Looking ahead, several factors could influence whether this inflow trend continues: Bitcoin’s price stability around key support levels Broader macroeconomic conditions and interest rate expectations Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency markets Institutional adoption trends beyond ETF investments The December 17th data provides a crucial data point for analysts tracking institutional cryptocurrency adoption. It suggests that despite short-term volatility, significant capital remains ready to enter the Bitcoin market through regulated ETF products. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Bitcoin ETFs The $459.24 million net inflow represents more than just a single day’s trading activity. It signals that institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains resilient. As traditional financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock continue to attract capital to their Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency market gains legitimacy and stability. For investors, this development underscores the importance of monitoring Bitcoin ETF flows as a sentiment indicator. The reversal from outflows to substantial inflows suggests that professional money managers see value at current levels. While cryptocurrency markets will always experience volatility, the growing institutional participation through Bitcoin ETFs creates a more mature investment landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did Bitcoin ETFs see outflows before this inflow? Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows likely due to profit-taking after price gains or risk reduction during market uncertainty. The reversal to inflows suggests renewed confidence at current price levels. Which Bitcoin ETF performed best on December 17th? Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the largest inflow at approximately $390 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with about $110 million in new investments. Do Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes, when investors buy Bitcoin ETFs, the fund providers must purchase actual Bitcoin to back the shares. This creates buying pressure that can support or increase Bitcoin’s market price. Are Bitcoin ETFs safe investments? Bitcoin ETFs are regulated financial products, but they still carry the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin itself. They are generally considered safer than direct cryptocurrency ownership for institutional investors due to regulatory oversight and custodial arrangements. Can individual investors buy Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, individual investors can purchase Bitcoin ETFs through standard brokerage accounts, just like they would buy shares of any other ETF or stock. Found this analysis of Bitcoin ETF flows helpful?

According to a leading Bloomberg analyst, a significant wave of crypto ETP liquidations could wash over the market by 2026, leaving investors and the industry to pick up the pieces. This forecast raises critical questions about sustainability in the burgeoning world of digital asset funds. What’s Driving the Rush Toward Crypto ETP Liquidations? Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, a flood of new products has entered the regulatory pipeline. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart notes that an astonishing 126 crypto ETP applications are currently awaiting SEC approval. However, this gold rush mentality comes with a stark warning. Analysts suggest issuers are scrambling to launch products without a clear path to gathering sufficient assets, setting the stage for widespread failure. This scenario isn’t hypothetical. We’ve already seen early casualties. Earlier this year, the BTC-ETH Strategy ETF (ARKY, ARKC), a joint venture by Ark Invest and 21Shares, was liquidated. This event serves as a clear precedent and a potential harbinger of what’s to come for dozens of other funds. How Does an ETP Liquidation Actually Work? For investors, understanding the mechanics of a liquidation is crucial. It’s not merely a fund closing its doors. The process begins when a fund’s assets under management (AUM) fall below a sustainable threshold, often due to low investor interest or poor performance. The issuer then decides to liquidate, halting the creation of new shares. All underlying cryptocurrency assets are sold and converted to cash. Finally, the net cash proceeds are distributed to the remaining shareholders, effectively closing the fund. This process ensures investors get their money back, but it also forces them out of their intended market position, potentially at an inopportune time. Why Are So Many Crypto ETPs at Risk of Failure? The core issue is a simple mismatch between supply and demand. While the supply of new crypto ETP products is exploding, investor capital is finite and tends to concentrate in a few market leaders. Seyffart predicts that many of the 100+ products expected to launch will struggle to attract the necessary assets to remain viable. This leads to a survival-of-the-fittest market. Established funds with strong brand recognition and first-mover advantage are likely to soak up most of the investment. Newer, niche, or poorly marketed products could languish with minimal AUM, making them prime candidates for the predicted wave of crypto ETP liquidations by 2026 or 2027. What Should Investors Do to Navigate This Risk? Knowledge is your best defense. Investors considering these products should conduct thorough due diligence beyond just the underlying crypto asset. Scrutinize the AUM: Favor products with substantial and growing assets under management. Evaluate the issuer: Consider the track record and financial stability of the fund sponsor. Understand the fees: High expense ratios can erode returns and make a fund less competitive. Diversify cautiously: Avoid over-concentration in small, niche ETPs that may be more vulnerable to closure. Staying informed about the fund’s health can provide early warning signs before a liquidation announcement. The Bigger Picture: What Do Mass Liquidations Mean for Crypto? A wave of crypto ETP liquidations presents a double-edged sword for the broader digital asset ecosystem. On one hand, it could be seen as a healthy market correction, weeding out weaker products and solidifying the position of legitimate, useful funds. It demonstrates that the market is maturing and applying traditional financial scrutiny. Conversely, it could temporarily shake investor confidence. News of multiple fund closures may be perceived as a failure of the crypto ETP model itself, rather than a natural business consolidation. However, this pruning process is common in traditional finance and often leads to a stronger, more efficient market in the long run. Conclusion: A Necessary Shakeout on the Horizon The prediction of widespread crypto ETP liquidations by 2026 is not a prophecy of doom but a call for realism. The explosive growth in product filings indicates immense interest but also a potential bubble in fund creation. This impending shakeout will likely separate the robust, investor-centric products from the speculative launches. For the savvy investor, this environment demands vigilance, emphasizing the importance of fund fundamentals over mere crypto exposure. The coming years will test the durability of the crypto ETP landscape, ultimately strengthening it for those that survive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main reason analysts predict so many crypto ETP liquidations? A: Analysts predict a wave of liquidations because over 100 new products are rushing to market, but investor capital is limited. Many funds will fail to gather enough assets under management (AUM) to be economically viable, leading them to close. Q: What happens to my money if the crypto ETP I invest in is liquidated? A: If a fund is liquidated, the issuer sells all the underlying cryptocurrency assets, converts them to cash, and distributes the net proceeds to shareholders. You get your money back, but your investment in that specific product is terminated. Q: Has a crypto ETP been liquidated before? A: Yes. A prominent example is the BTC-ETH Strategy ETF (tickers ARKY and ARKC), launched by Ark Invest and 21Shares, which was liquidated earlier this year due to insufficient assets. Q: How can I avoid investing in a crypto ETP that might be liquidated? A: To mitigate risk, research the fund’s assets under management (AUM), choose products from established issuers with strong track records, and be wary of niche funds with very high fees that may struggle to attract investors. Q: Will mass liquidations hurt the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? A: While the liquidation process involves selling underlying assets, the impact on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is likely to be minimal unless the scale is enormous. The larger effect may be on investor sentiment toward the crypto ETP vehicle itself. Q: Are all new crypto ETPs a bad investment? A: Not necessarily. New products can offer valuable exposure. The key is differentiation and sustainable demand. The predicted liquidations highlight the risk of investing in “me-too” funds without a clear competitive advantage or sufficient investor interest.

Earlier, when Fermi first announced that an investment-grade tenant had exited a deal that would have covered $150 million in construction expenses, its shares plunged 46% on December 12. Now, Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer has confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider that Amazon is the tenant that pulled back funding from the project. Fermi’s Neugebauer asserts that talks between Amazon and the firm are still constructive Fermi is hoping to create the world’s largest private grid to power a sprawling data center campus, with a $19 billion valuation as of October. The company first went public in September, raising more than $680 million at $21 a share. However, since the project’s announcement, concerns have arisen that the AI-led power buildout may be running ahead of demand, dragging on AI-linked stocks as questions mount over tenant security and the need for such large-scale facilities. The company’s development, Project Matador, relies on a long-term, 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System, subject to the firm finalizing a letter of intent with a tenant. The company thus called for a tenant to take the first gigawatt of capacity across 12 facilities at its 11-gigawatt campus in the Texas Panhandle. Amazon had been working toward a deal that would have paid Fermi more than $20 billion over the next two decades. However, it withdrew its offer to provide the $150 million upfront payment required to initiate construction. Nonetheless, Neugebauer insists talks remain constructive and that the advance cancellation does not signal a breakdown. He remarked, “It’s just a normal negotiation. Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.” He added, “It’s a big deal. Big deals take longer.” After Fermi first announced that a tenant had withdrawn, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald noted that they learned the anchor tenant had sought last-minute pricing adjustments that Fermi rejected. Aside from Amazon, Palantir , which provides software to law enforcement and government clients, had also been eyeing the site. The software firm is still in talks with Fermi. Amazon is in discussions to secure a $10 billion deal with OpenAI Amazon is still in negotiations with other companies. According to reports, the firm is exploring a $10 billion deal with OpenAI that would utilize its AI chips. The deal would value OpenAI at over $500 billion. The announcement comes shortly after OpenAI converted to a for-profit structure, giving it more leeway to negotiate with investors beyond Microsoft, which already owns 27% of the company. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:cfa47eac-7502-421e-a473-753bf7e44110-28"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-16"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> If the deal goes through, it would mark a milestone for Amazon’s semiconductor division. Nvidia still dominates the market, but developers like Meta are already exploring alternatives from Google and others. Nevertheless, Amazon is looking to expand its AI investments, given it already has an $8 billion stake in Anthropic, an OpenAI rival. Earlier this month, the firm unveiled its Trainium chip that enhances its Amazon Web Services capabilities. According to Bloomberg, the company claims that Trainium offers cheaper and more efficient computing than Nvidia’s GPUs for the heavy math required by large models, and it’s attempting to win over teams that want to reduce their costs. Amazon also released new Nova models, including Nova 2 Pro, that can process text, images, video, and speech to generate text. Moreover, the company plans to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing power across AWS Top Secret, Secret, and GovCloud (US) regions by constructing data centers with advanced compute and networking. At the start of the year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had noted, “I think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy, medium to long-term, that we’re pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI. We also have capex that we’re spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim towards trying to continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|AI|Amazon|Fermi Inc,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 04:45:17

According to analyst Axel Adler Jr., both the Structure Shift composite indicator and the Bull-Bear Index point to growing downward pressure, particularly in the derivatives market. Risk-Off Signals Flash Red The Structure Shift signal, which measures overall market structure on a scale from -1 to +1, has fallen from positive territory to around -0.5. This confirms the dominance of a bearish regime. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price has dropped toward the lower boundary of the 21-day Donchian Channel, currently hovering near the $85,000 support level. This means that the market has not only firmly established itself in a bearish structural zone, but any recovery will require the composite signal to move back above zero while holding channel support. Derivatives are playing a key role in this transition. The Bull-Bear Index, which separates short-term and long-term market pressure, shows the fast bearish component moving into negative territory, while the bullish component has dropped to just 5%. Such a pattern suggests that selling pressure from futures markets is outweighing demand in the spot market, thereby leaving short-term momentum firmly in the bears’ favor. Adler explained that while a negative Structure Shift signal does not predict an immediate price drop, it does show the need for defensive positioning. Whales and Miners Defy Bitcoin Sell-Off CryptoQuant data added further context to the current regime. While US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded combined outflows of roughly $635 million over two days, on-chain indicators point to significant pessimism among short-term participants. The Coinbase Premium Gap has dropped to deeply negative levels, while the Fear and Greed Index shows extreme fear as it sits at 11. Additional stress indicators, including rising supply in loss, and a depressed short-term holder MVRV, indicate many recent buyers are capitulating at a loss. However, a certain cohort of whales and miners continues to act as outliers in this environment. For instance, the Miner Position Index (MPI) at -0.81 indicates miners are sending fewer BTC to exchanges and thus reducing selling pressure. Meanwhile, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated nearly 700,000 BTC over the past two months.

Time is running out to put your unique spin on K-pop and potentially win a major prize. The groundbreaking ARIA Nana remix contest , a pioneering experiment in on-chain music, will officially close for submissions on January 9. This isn’t just another competition; it’s a front-row seat to the future of how music is created, owned, and shared. What is the ARIA Nana Remix Contest All About? Organized by ARIAIP, a platform specializing in story chain-based IP tokenization, this contest is a bold move to merge the global appeal of K-pop with the transparency of blockchain. The core mission? To expand K-pop on-chain by inviting producers worldwide to reinterpret songs from the talented singer Nana. Think of it as a global collaboration where your creativity helps build a new model for the music industry. Participants are tasked with remixing one of Nana’s three new tracks: ‘GOD,’ ‘Daylight,’ or ‘Hurt.’ The stakes are high, with a total prize pool of $15,000 up for grabs. But the rewards go far beyond the cash. Why Should You Enter This Contest? Beyond the impressive prize money, this contest offers benefits rarely seen in traditional music competitions. Here’s what makes the ARIA Nana remix contest a game-changer: Major Exposure: Selected remixes will be officially released by a music label, giving winners legitimate industry placement. Ownership Revolution: The copyrights for the winning tracks will be tokenized on the ARIA Protocol. This means ownership is recorded on the blockchain, creating a clear, unchangeable record. Ongoing Royalties: This is the revolutionary part. Net royalties from the streaming and sales of these official releases will be distributed automatically. The funds are shared between the remixers themselves and the ARIA community, specifically holders of the APL token. Therefore, entering this contest is more than a one-time win; it’s an opportunity to become part of an ongoing, revenue-generating music ecosystem. Prize Breakdown and Key Dates for the ARIA Contest Let’s talk numbers. The $15,000 prize pool is distributed to fuel top talent: First Place: A grand prize of $10,000. Second Place: A reward of $3,000. Third Place: A reward of $2,000. The most critical date is January 9 , when submissions close. If you’re a producer, this is your final call to action. Prepare your best take on Nana’s songs and ensure your entry is submitted before the deadline passes. How Does This Expand K-Pop On-Chain? You might wonder, what does “expanding K-pop on-chain” actually mean? Traditionally, music rights and royalty distributions can be complex and opaque. By using blockchain technology, ARIA aims to create a more transparent and efficient system. Tokenizing the music copyrights turns them into digital assets that can be managed and traded with clarity. The automatic distribution of royalties via smart contracts ensures remixers and supporters (APL token holders) get their fair share directly and promptly. This ARIA Nana remix contest serves as a live experiment to prove this model works, potentially setting a new standard for artist-fan collaboration in the K-pop world and beyond. Final Call: Don’t Miss This Opportunity The January 9 deadline is fast approaching. This contest represents a unique convergence of music, competition, and technological innovation. For producers, it’s a chance to win significant money, gain official label release, and earn future royalties. For the crypto and music communities, it’s a fascinating case study in IP tokenization in action. In summary, the ARIA Nana remix contest is more than a competition; it’s a glimpse into a future where creators have greater ownership and are rewarded fairly within a community-driven ecosystem. Will your remix be the one that helps shape this future? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the deadline for the ARIA Nana remix contest? A: The deadline for all submissions is January 9 . Ensure your track is submitted before this date. Q: Which songs can I remix for the contest? A: You can submit a remix of any of Nana’s three provided songs: ‘GOD,’ ‘Daylight,’ or ‘Hurt.’ Q: What does ‘tokenizing the music copyright’ mean? A: It means the legal rights to the winning remix will be represented as a digital token on the ARIA blockchain. This creates a transparent and secure record of ownership. Q: Who receives the royalties from the released remixes? A: Net royalties are distributed to two groups: the remixers who created the tracks and the ARIA community, specifically holders of the APL token. Q: Do I need to own cryptocurrency or APL tokens to enter? A: No, the contest entry is likely based on your musical submission. However, participating in the broader royalty ecosystem as a supporter would require holding APL tokens. Q: Where can I find more details and submit my remix? A: You should visit the official ARIAIP website or their designated contest portal for full rules, submission guidelines, and updates. Inspired by the fusion of music and blockchain?

He said that where a payment is required, it must be made in Russian rubles. Related Reading: Ethereum Meets Wall Street: JPMorgan Rolls Out Tokenized Fund Ruble Remains Sole Payment Unit Based on reports, that stance matches existing law. A 2020 federal law on digital financial assets defines digital currency as something different from Russia’s monetary unit and bars its use as a means of payment inside the country. The law treats tokens and classic cryptocurrencies as property or investment items rather than legal tender. Russia Central Bank Concerns Over Stability Officials in Moscow have repeatedly echoed the central bank’s worry that allowing crypto for everyday payments could harm monetary control and financial stability. Regulators say the ruble’s role must be protected, and that volatility in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum makes them unsuitable for regular transactions. Limited Windows For Crypto Use Reports have also noted that while crypto cannot be used to buy goods and services domestically, it can still exist in regulated pockets. Lawmakers and regulators are framing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets, not cash. Some narrow exceptions are being discussed for corporate or cross-border operations under strict rules, but those do not change the basic ban on domestic payments. What The Law Means For People And Business Practical effects are clear. Russian residents and businesses cannot accept digital coins in place of rubles for sales or services. At the same time, individuals can hold, trade, or invest in crypto under the framework that separates ownership from payment rights. The law also requires public officials to declare holdings in digital assets, linking transparency rules to the new regime. Related Reading: 5,606 Bitcoin: Lightning Network Sets Fresh Capacity Record A Narrowing Path Forward Based on reports from several outlets, the political message is firm: payments stay in rubles. Lawmakers are talking about refining rules for trading, custody and reporting, but they are not signalling a shift toward letting cryptocurrencies replace the ruble for daily use. That position keeps Russia on a different track from some countries that permit crypto payments or give coins legal tender status.

According to the sponsors, the Strengthening Agency Frameworks for Enforcement of Cryptocurrency (SAFE Crypto) Act creates a coordinated federal effort to detect, track, and shut down illicit schemes that use crypto rails. Task Force To Target Crypto Scams The bill would set up a task force that pulls together Treasury officials, federal and local law enforcement, regulators, and private-sector experts to share intelligence and act quickly on threats. Reports have disclosed that the legislation is pitched as a way to get real-time visibility on suspicious activity and to give local police better technical help when they investigate. Senators Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) are listed as the bill’s proponents . The measure appears in Congress under a title that would establish a “Task Force for Recognizing and Averting Cryptocurrency Scams,” and is referenced by bill number S.3428 in congressional records. As of Dec. 17, 2025, the full legislative text had not been posted on the Congressional site. Public Education And Local Support The sponsors say the task force will do more than hunt scammers. It will fund public awareness work so consumers can spot fake investment pitches, phishing schemes, and impersonation fraud. Local law enforcement would get training and access to blockchain analytics tools, the backers say, so officers can follow illicit funds and identify criminal networks before victims lose large sums. Industry figures quoted in the announcement said crypto fraud has been large and growing. According to one industry policy lead cited by the sponsors, “Over the last two years, we’ve tracked billions in scams and fraud across the crypto ecosystem.” That warning is a central piece of the case lawmakers are making for faster, coordinated action. ngl a lot of memecoin etc scammers will probably end up shitting themselves if this goes hard, it fills a regulatory/enforcement gap that many probably assumed is permanent/long-term https://t.co/AdKlzVPh9D — _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) December 16, 2025 Cybercriminals: Panic Mode Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at crypto investment firm Delphi Labs, said that if the SAFE Crypto Act is carried out effectively, it could leave crypto scammers scrambling to stay ahead of enforcement. Shapiro added in a post on X on Tuesday that “scammers will probably end up sh*tting themselves if this goes hard,” stressing that the US attorney general, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the director of the US Secret Service would be among the senior officials leading efforts to pursue the bad guys. Why Lawmakers Are Pushing Now Lawmakers argue that criminals have grown more skilled at using decentralized systems and cross-border services to hide proceeds. The SAFE Crypto Act is being presented as a way to narrow that gap by making public and private responders work from a shared playbook. The initiative is part of a wave of digital currency-related policy moves being discussed in Congress this year.

According to fresh data from Farside Investors, these investment vehicles saw a combined net withdrawal of $22.4 million on December 17th. This persistent trend raises important questions about market sentiment toward Ethereum-based exchange-traded products. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Experiencing Sustained Outflows? The recent data reveals a clear pattern of capital leaving these funds. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the exodus with a substantial $19.6 million net outflow. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) followed with $2.8 million leaving the fund. Meanwhile, other spot Ethereum ETFs reported zero net activity for the day, indicating neither new investments nor significant withdrawals. This five-day outflow streak represents one of the most challenging periods for these relatively new financial products. Since their launch, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted significant attention from both retail and institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The consistent outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs suggest several possible market dynamics: Profit-taking behavior following recent price movements Portfolio rebalancing as year-end approaches Shifting sentiment toward cryptocurrency investments Competition from other investment vehicles offering similar exposure It’s crucial to understand that ETF flows represent just one aspect of the broader Ethereum ecosystem. While these outflows might indicate short-term caution among some investors, they don’t necessarily reflect the fundamental health of the Ethereum network or its long-term prospects. How Do ETF Flows Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Exchange-traded funds serve as important indicators of institutional sentiment. When major players like BlackRock and Fidelity experience outflows from their spot Ethereum ETFs, it often signals how traditional finance views current market conditions. However, these flows represent a relatively small portion of overall Ethereum trading volume and ownership. The performance of spot Ethereum ETFs can influence: Market perception of institutional crypto adoption Regulatory discussions about cryptocurrency products Future development of similar financial instruments Price discovery mechanisms for Ethereum It’s worth noting that outflows from one type of investment vehicle don’t necessarily mean investors are abandoning Ethereum entirely. Many may simply be moving capital to different Ethereum exposure methods or adjusting their overall portfolio allocation. What’s Next for Spot Ethereum ETFs? The coming weeks will be critical for observing whether this outflow trend continues or reverses. Several factors could influence future flows into spot Ethereum ETFs: Ethereum network upgrades and developments Broader cryptocurrency market trends Regulatory clarity from U.S. authorities Institutional adoption milestones Competitive products entering the market For investors considering spot Ethereum ETFs, it’s essential to look beyond short-term flow data. Consider the product’s structure, fees, liquidity, and how it fits within your overall investment strategy. The current outflow period might present opportunities for patient investors, or it might signal broader market trends worth monitoring closely. Conclusion: Reading Between the Flow Lines The fifth consecutive day of outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs certainly warrants attention from market observers. While $22.4 million represents a significant daily movement, it’s important to maintain perspective about what these flows actually indicate. They reflect specific investor decisions about exchange-traded products rather than fundamental judgments about Ethereum’s technology or long-term value proposition. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, flows into and out of regulated products like spot Ethereum ETFs will provide valuable data points about institutional engagement. However, wise investors will consider this information alongside broader market fundamentals, technological developments, and their own investment horizons. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly purchasing or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are investors withdrawing from these ETFs? Possible reasons include profit-taking after price increases, year-end portfolio rebalancing, shifting market sentiment, or moving to alternative investment vehicles offering similar exposure. Do ETF outflows mean Ethereum is losing value? Not necessarily. ETF flows represent just one segment of Ethereum investment. The cryptocurrency’s value depends on numerous factors including network usage, development activity, and broader market conditions. Which spot Ethereum ETF saw the largest outflow? BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) experienced the largest single-day outflow at $19.6 million on December 17th. How long has this outflow trend been continuing? According to Farside Investors data, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflows for five consecutive trading days as of December 17th. Should I be concerned about investing in Ethereum ETFs? Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Short-term flow data is just one factor to consider among many when evaluating any investment.

With the US inflation report looming and the Bank of Japan potentially ending its negative interest rate policy, traders across traditional Forex markets and cryptocurrency sectors are preparing for volatility. The outcome could reshape capital flows between East and West for months to come. Why are Asian currencies under pressure this week? Most Asian currencies traded within narrow ranges on Tuesday, showing minimal movement as markets adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Japanese yen remained steady around 147.33 against the dollar, while the Australian dollar hovered near 0.6616. This tepid trading reflects the market’s anxiety about two potentially conflicting forces: a hawkish Federal Reserve driven by persistent US inflation, and a historic policy shift from the Bank of Japan. The US inflation dilemma: What traders are watching The February US inflation data, scheduled for release on Tuesday, represents the single most important economic indicator for global markets this week. Here’s what analysts are monitoring: Core CPI expectations: Markets forecast a 0.3% month-over-month increase and 3.7% year-over-year Headline inflation: Expected to remain around 3.1% annually Market impact: Higher-than-expected readings could delay Federal Reserve rate cuts, strengthening the dollar against Asian currencies Crypto correlation: Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies often face selling pressure when dollar strength accelerates Key Asian Currency Levels Against USD Currency Current Level Weekly Change Key Resistance Japanese Yen (JPY) 147.33 -0.1% 148.00 Australian Dollar (AUD) 0.6616 +0.2% 0.6650 Chinese Yuan (CNY) 7.1880 Flat 7.2000 Indian Rupee (INR) 82.78 -0.3% 83.00 The BOJ rate hike decision: A historic turning point Market attention is intensely focused on the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting concluding on Tuesday. After years of ultra-loose monetary policy, the central bank is widely expected to end its negative interest rate regime. This potential BOJ rate hike would mark Japan’s first interest rate increase since 2007, fundamentally altering the dynamics of the USD/JPY pair and broader Asian currency markets. Consider these implications of a BOJ policy shift: Yield differentials: Narrowing gap between US and Japanese bond yields could strengthen the yen Carry trade unwinding: Investors may exit positions that borrowed in yen to invest in higher-yielding assets Regional impact: Other Asian central banks might face pressure to adjust their own policies Cryptocurrency flows: Japanese investors might repatriate funds from overseas crypto markets USD/JPY: The critical currency pair to watch The USD/JPY exchange rate sits at the epicenter of this week’s market movements. Currently trading around 147.33, the pair faces conflicting pressures: Bullish factors for USD/JPY: Strong US economic data supporting dollar strength Higher-for-longer Federal Reserve rate expectations Risk aversion typically benefits the dollar against Asian currencies Bearish factors for USD/JPY: Potential BOJ policy normalization supporting yen strength Technical resistance around the 148.00 level Overextended dollar positioning that could trigger profit-taking How Asian Forex markets are preparing for volatility Traders across Asian Forex markets are implementing specific strategies ahead of these dual events: Risk management approaches: Reducing leverage ahead of high-impact news events Implementing stop-loss orders on vulnerable currency pairs Diversifying across correlated and non-correlated assets Increasing cash positions to capitalize on potential dislocations Opportunity identification: Monitoring yen crosses for breakout opportunities Watching for divergence between Asian currency reactions Preparing for potential overshoots in either direction Identifying support and resistance levels for key pairs Cryptocurrency implications of Asian currency movements The intersection between traditional Forex markets and cryptocurrency trading has never been more significant. Asian currency movements directly impact digital asset markets through several channels: Capital flow effects: Japanese yen strength could reduce liquidity in crypto markets Dollar strength typically pressures Bitcoin and major altcoins Regional currency volatility may increase crypto trading as a hedge Changing interest rate differentials affect carry trade strategies involving crypto Trading strategy adjustments: Monitoring USD/JPY as a leading indicator for crypto markets Adjusting position sizing based on dollar index movements Considering Asian trading session patterns in crypto volatility Watching for regulatory responses to currency movements Actionable insights for traders and investors Navigating this week’s events requires specific preparation and strategic thinking: Pre-event positioning: Consider reduced exposure to USD/JPY and correlated pairs Implement option strategies to hedge against volatility spikes Monitor liquidity conditions across Asian trading sessions Prepare contingency plans for both hawkish and dovish outcomes Post-event opportunities: Watch for trend confirmation before committing to major positions Identify currency pairs showing relative strength or weakness Monitor central bank communication for forward guidance changes Assess secondary effects on emerging market currencies FAQs: Understanding this week’s currency market dynamics What time is the US inflation data released? The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February is scheduled for release at 8:30 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday. When does the Bank of Japan announce its rate decision? The BOJ typically announces its policy decision around midday Tokyo time on Tuesday, following its two-day meeting. How could a BOJ rate hike affect cryptocurrency markets? A BOJ rate hike could strengthen the yen, potentially leading Japanese investors to repatriate funds from overseas markets including cryptocurrencies, creating selling pressure. Which Asian currency is most sensitive to these events? The Japanese yen (JPY) is directly affected by both events, while the Chinese yuan (CNY) and Australian dollar (AUD) also show significant sensitivity to US dollar movements. Where can I find official statements from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan? Federal Reserve announcements are available on their official website , while Bank of Japan communications are published on their official portal . Market analysis is frequently provided by institutions like Nomura Holdings and economists such as those at Goldman Sachs . The bottom line: A pivotal moment for Asian currencies This week represents a critical juncture for Asian currencies as they face simultaneous pressure from US monetary policy and potential Japanese normalization. The US inflation data will determine the Federal Reserve’s near-term trajectory, while the BOJ rate hike decision could end an era of unprecedented monetary accommodation. The USD/JPY pair serves as the primary battleground where these forces collide, with implications rippling across all Forex markets and into cryptocurrency valuations. Traders who successfully navigate this volatility will find opportunities, while those unprepared may face significant challenges in the new interest rate environment taking shape across the Pacific.

WLF seeks to enhance strategic CeFi and DeFi partnerships and boost the adoption and usage of USD1 after the token hit a TVL of $3 billion in six months. The WLFI team said they are committed to identifying all partners where WLFI incentives are either mentioned in online communications or offered on official websites. USD1 is the company’s flagship product, but WLFI remains the ecosystem’s governance and coordination layer, supporting every current and future product launched. Meanwhile, the team claims that the success of USD1 will directly strengthen WLFI because the adoption of USD1 will expand the overall footprint, utility, and economic activities of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem as a whole. More users, platforms, institutions, and chains will also integrate WLFI as USD1 grows. However, future use of WLFI treasury holdings directly for USD1 growth will require additional governance votes. More USD1 leads to more World Liberty Financial-governed services demand The World Liberty Financial team believes that having more USD1 in circulation leads to more demand for WLFI-governed services, ecosystem programs, integrations, and liquidity incentives. In practice, this will increase the scale and influence of the network governed by WLFI holders. These holders will gain governance power over a larger network on issues related to product expansions, decisions regarding incentives, and cross-chain strategies. In an open poll on the company’s website, one WLFI investor supporting the use of 5% of unlocked WLFI for USD1 growth said this is a good way for the company to give back to the partners building on USD1 . The investor also believes this is an excellent opportunity to incentivize the development of innovative products that will help expand the USD1 ecosystem. The investor recommends allocating funds towards DEXs, such as Ethereum (acquire DOLO and BLOCK), Solana (acquire AOL, BURGER, US, DREAM, and VALOR), and CEXs. They also recommend investing in BONK and/or additional bonkfun USD1 paired tokens, including $1coin/SPSC. However, a significant number of poll participants were against using the 5% WLFI treasury holdings for USD1, instead recommending that at least 80% of the total WLFI supply tokens be unlocked and held in the treasury. World Liberty Financial community votes for WLFI buyback Following a successful community vote, WLFI activated a portion of its treasury to support the WLFI token buyback initiative, which directly benefits its native USD1 stablecoin . The company executed a massive $10 million worth of WLFI token buyback in a strategic three-week initiative powered by their USD1 stablecoin. The protocol used USD1 to buy WLFI tokens from the open market. Meanwhile, it also emerged that DWF Labs has been secretly supporting USD1 by purchasing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the token through anonymous wallets that circulate it in the WLFI ecosystem. Disruption Banking found, through a combination of analysis of dozens of wallets and thousands of mapped transactions, that the crypto market maker had funneled over $300 million of engineered liquidity through WLFI’s TokenGovernor contract. The reconstruction of multi-chain flows also identified a three-layer liquidity structure that silently injected $84 million in the past month alone. However, while these flows and the funding pipeline have not been previously reported, DWF Labs has publicly bought $25 million worth of USD1 tokens, a large part of which ended up on Binance. The Cantor Network also announced plans to deploy USD1 a few days ago, representing another significant milestone in WLFI’s USD1 expansion strategy. The move aims to increase USD1’s reach across institutional onchain finance and accelerate the token’s adoption among regulated market participants worldwide.

SOL price is now consolidating losses below $130 and might decline further below $120. SOL price started a fresh decline below $130 and $128 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $131 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a recovery wave if the bulls defend $122 or $120. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price failed to remain stable above $132 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $130 and $128 support levels. The price gained bearish momentum below $126. A low was formed at $121, and the price is now consolidating losses. The price recovered a few points and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. Solana is now trading below $128 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $125 level. The next major resistance is near the $128 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $134 swing high to the $121 low. The main resistance could be $130. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $131 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. A successful close above the $132 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $140. Any more gains might send the price toward the $145 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $128 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $122 zone. The first major support is near the $120 level. A break below the $120 level might send the price toward the $112 support zone. If there is a close below the $112 support, the price could decline toward the $105 support in the near term.

At the same time, Coinbase used its year-end “System Update” conference to unveil a sweeping expansion beyond just crypto trading, including the launch of stock trading in the US, Kalshi-powered prediction markets, an AI-driven investment adviser, custom USDC-backed stablecoins, and a brand new tokenization platform. India Clears Coinbase Stake in CoinDCX India’s competition regulator approved Coinbase’s acquisition of a minority stake in CoinDCX. In a notice that was issued on Tuesday, the Competition Commission of India said it cleared Coinbase Global’s investment in DCX Global Limited, the parent company of CoinDCX, one of India’s most established cryptocurrency platforms. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirmed the approval in a post on X on Wednesday, and described the transaction as a step that deepens Coinbase’s long-term partnership with CoinDCX. While the regulatory filing and Grewal’s comments confirmed the minority nature of the investment, neither revealed the size of the stake or the financial terms involved. The approval follows disclosures made in October, when Coinbase revealed plans to invest in CoinDCX at a post-money valuation of roughly $2.4 billion. At that time, Coinbase said CoinDCX was generating approximately $141 million in annual revenue as of July, despite regulatory uncertainty and shifting market conditions in the country. Coinbase also pushed back against earlier reports suggesting it was pursuing a full acquisition of CoinDCX for around $1 billion, and clarified that its interest was limited to a minority position rather than an outright takeover. CoinDCX is a key player in India’s crypto ecosystem, serving millions of users as a compliant, locally rooted platform. The investment from Coinbase, which is one of the world’s largest publicly listed crypto exchanges, is seen as a vote of confidence in both CoinDCX’s business model and the long-term potential of the Indian market. The deal also comes as Coinbase explores a broader return to India after previously scaling back its presence. According to reports last week, Coinbase is considering the rollout of fiat on-ramps for Indian users beginning in 2026. If implemented, the move would mark Coinbase’s re-entry into the market more than two years after it stopped services in September of 2023 due to regulatory and banking challenges. India’s appeal to global crypto firms is also strong due to its sheer scale and growing adoption of digital assets. With a population of more than 1.4 billion and industry estimates suggesting more than 100 million crypto users nationwide, the country has one of the largest potential user bases in the world. Coinbase Unveils Major Expansions Meanwhile, Coinbase used its year-end “ System Update ” conference on Wednesday to share an ambitious expansion beyond its core crypto exchange business. It unveiled a broad set of new products that push the company further into stocks, prediction markets, tokenization, stablecoins and AI-driven financial services. The biggest reveal was the launch of stock trading on Coinbase, which begins rolling out in the United States. The company framed the move as a step toward enabling 24/7 global trading of stocks and ETFs using crypto-powered infrastructure. By adding equities to its platform, Coinbase now joins a crowded field of companies that already combine crypto and traditional assets, while also looking to get ahead of rivals offering tokenized stocks outside the US. Coinbase also announced the addition of prediction markets through a partnership with Kalshi, which will allow users to trade outcomes tied to events like sports and politics. The rollout starts immediately and will expand more broadly in the US, placing Coinbase among a growing group of companies targeting what analysts expect to be an expanding market. In fact, industry forecasts suggest that prediction market revenues could reach $10 billion by the end of the decade. Another interesting launch was Coinbase Advisor , an AI-powered investment assistant that is designed to offer guidance across crypto, stocks and prediction markets. The tool is currently in beta for select users, and it combines automated insights with oversight from human portfolio managers. On the infrastructure side, Coinbase revealed plans to offer custom stablecoins backed by USDC, which will make it possible for companies to issue branded digital dollars embedded directly into their products. It also introduced Coinbase Tokenize, a full-service platform that is aimed at helping institutions bring traditional assets on-chain by bundling issuance, custody, compliance and trading. The exchange further expanded decentralized trading via deeper Solana integrations , simplified access to futures and perpetual contracts for US traders, and confirmed that its Base layer-2 app is now available in more than 140 countries.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-18 05:30:00

PeckShield flagged the incident in an X alert, observing on Thursday that “a whale’s Multisig was drained of ~$27.3M due to a private key compromise.” On-chain traces shared by the security firm show the drainer routing a large chunk of the haul through Tornado Cash, a privacy mixer often used to break transaction links. PeckShield said the attacker had already laundered about $12.6M, roughly 4,100 ETH, and still held around $2M in liquid assets. #PeckShieldAlert A whale's Multisig was drained of ~$27.3M due to a private key compromise.

PeckShield said the attacker now controls the victim’s multisig, which still holds a leveraged long on Aave, with about $25M in ETH supplied against roughly $12.3M in DAI borrowed. That detail matters because multisig setups do not automatically protect funds if an attacker can meet the signing threshold, or if the wallet’s governance is effectively captured through compromised keys and approvals. Once the attacker can sign, they can move fast, pull liquidity, and make recovery attempts far harder. Live Positions Turn Key Theft Into Cascading Risk Data shows repeated outflows to Tornado Cash in round lots, the sort of pattern traders associate with systematic laundering rather than a one-off panic exit. They also point to the attacker interacting with contracts tied to ownership and control, suggesting the compromise extended beyond a single transfer. Teams can distribute signing keys and still lose them to phishing, malware, SIM swaps, unsafe backups, or rushed approvals on malicious transaction prompts. It also points to a second-order risk specific to DeFi power users. The wallet is not just a vault but a control plane for live positions. Once an attacker gains access to collateral, borrow lines or health factors, the damage can cascade well beyond the initial drain.

In a recent post, he revisited a call he made when XRP traded near $0.11, highlighting his prediction that the asset would reach a new all-time high. Never forget I called for #XRP to make a new ATH when we crashed to $0.11. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 15, 2025 XRP’s Deep Lows and Sharp Rebounds XRP traded near $0.11 in mid-2017. At the time, confidence across the market was low. Months later, XRP surged. It climbed above $3 in early 2018 during the wider crypto rally. That move placed XRP among the top-performing large-cap assets of that cycle. However, the rally did not last. XRP entered a prolonged decline later that year, and its price action stayed muted for years. In early 2021, the asset again approached the $0.11 level. That return tested long-term holders and revived memories of the previous cycle. XRP then rebounded strongly. Within months, it rose to $1.96. Experts believe it would have performed better, but it was suppressed by the Ripple lawsuit . The move reinforced XRP’s reputation for delayed but aggressive bullish moves during broader market expansions. These historical swings now serve as the backdrop for renewed optimism from long-standing analysts. Renewed Optimism and Price Targets CryptoBull has continued to express confidence in XRP. He recently shared a bullish analysis of XRP’s chart, suggesting the asset could soon surpass $5 . His focus remains on longer cycle structures and historical repetition. Most recently, the analyst suggested a crucial technical formation on the asset’s chart could send it to $16 by the end of January 2026. However, XRP has failed to meet expectations in the past few months. The market saw the launch of multiple spot XRP ETFs. The crypto space has anticipated these products for years, but XRP’s price has struggled . Despite this underperformance, analysts like CryptoBull are still confident in the asset’s potential. Referencing his previous analysis suggests that CryptoBull views the current underperformance as a temporary phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions Reflect Division Despite his optimism, several responses challenged CryptoBull’s framing. One reply suggested that being correct once does not validate repeated inaccurate predictions. Another commenter argued that many market participants made similar calls during the crash, which weakens the claim of distinction. A separate reply criticized the timing of the reminder, saying predictions can appear accurate long after the fact. One user also questioned years of bullish commentary that failed to materialize, implying fatigue with repeated optimism. While these reactions show some division, market participants are eagerly watching XRP with the hope of a resurgence in early 2026.

While the flagship cryptocurrency trades sideways, a growing chorus of analysts and market indicators are flashing warning signs. The latest Bitcoin price prediction from some quarters is turning alarmingly bearish, with one prominent analyst even forecasting a potential drop to $10,000. What’s driving this pessimistic outlook, and should investors be concerned? Why Are Analysts Issuing This Bearish Bitcoin Price Prediction? The current Bitcoin price prediction shift isn’t based on mere speculation. Concrete data from the derivatives market reveals growing anxiety. According to CoinDesk, BTC’s 30-day implied volatility has climbed to approximately 45%. More telling is the increased demand for put options, which are contracts that profit when the price falls. This activity clearly shows that sophisticated traders are hedging against or betting on a decline below the $85,000 support level. This cautious sentiment forms the foundation for the current wave of bearish forecasts. The market is digesting the massive rally that pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 earlier this year, and history suggests such parabolic moves are often followed by painful corrections. Could Bitcoin Really Fall to $10,000? The Stark Warning The most eye-catching and severe Bitcoin price prediction comes from Mike McGlone of Bloomberg Intelligence. He presents a sobering analysis: the explosive wealth creation seen in early 2024 may have set the stage for a dramatic reversal. McGlone suggests the cryptocurrency could retrace to levels around $10,000 in the coming year. His rationale hinges on market cycles. Periods of extreme, rapid gains in asset prices frequently lead to equally sharp downturns as markets correct excesses. This isn’t a new phenomenon for Bitcoin, which has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles throughout its history. Historical Precedent: Past bull runs have often ended with 80%+ drawdowns. Leverage Unwind: A highly leveraged market is vulnerable to cascading liquidations. Macro Pressures: Broader economic factors can trigger risk-off sentiment. What Other Factors Could Influence Bitcoin’s Price? While McGlone’s $10,000 Bitcoin price prediction represents the extreme end of the spectrum, other analysts point to more immediate risks. The price trajectory may not be dictated by internal cycles alone. Two external forces could play a decisive role: First, geopolitical instability remains a wildcard. Global tensions can cause sudden flights to safety or, conversely, drive investors away from perceived risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Second, the overall leverage environment in the crypto market is critical. High levels of borrowed money amplify both gains and losses, potentially accelerating any downward move. Therefore, a realistic Bitcoin price prediction must account for this complex mix of technical indicators, cyclical patterns, and external shocks. The path forward is uncertain, and investors should prepare for volatility. How Should You Navigate This Uncertain Market? Facing a conflicting Bitcoin price prediction landscape requires a balanced strategy. Panic selling based on a single forecast is rarely wise. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never over-concentrate in any single asset, no matter how promising. Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders and only invest capital you can afford to lose. Focus on the Long Term: Bitcoin’s history is one of resilience. Short-term predictions often miss long-term trends. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Analyze multiple sources and form your own informed view. Remember, market predictions are probabilities, not certainties. While the options market signals caution, and analysts like McGlone warn of a deep correction, the future is not written. Bitcoin has repeatedly defied the most dire forecasts. Conclusion: A Time for Caution, Not Fear The current bearish Bitcoin price prediction from several analysts serves as a crucial reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. The potential for a significant downside, highlighted by the startling $10,000 forecast, underscores the importance of risk management. However, it also presents a potential opportunity for disciplined, long-term investors. By understanding the signals, respecting market cycles, and avoiding emotional decisions, you can navigate this period of uncertainty. The key is to stay informed, stay cautious, and align your strategy with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the prediction of Bitcoin dropping to $10,000 a consensus view? A: No, it is not a consensus. This is a specific, bearish forecast from analyst Mike McGlone. Many other analysts have differing views, ranging from moderate corrections to continued sideways movement. Q2: What does “increased demand for put options” mean? A: Put options are financial contracts that increase in value if the asset’s price falls. Increased demand for them indicates more traders are either betting on a price drop or paying to insure their holdings against one. Q3: What is “implied volatility” and why is it important? A: Implied volatility (IV) is a market forecast of likely price movement. An IV of 45% suggests the market expects significant price swings over the next 30 days. High IV often precedes big price moves, up or down. Q4: Should I sell all my Bitcoin based on this prediction? A: Making drastic investment decisions based on a single prediction is generally not advisable. Consider your investment horizon, risk tolerance, and overall portfolio strategy. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended for personalized advice. Q5: What are the main risks causing this bearish outlook? A> Key risks include the unwinding of excessive market leverage, a broader macroeconomic downturn, geopolitical events, and the natural correction following a strong rally. Q6: Has Bitcoin ever been at $10,000 before? A: Yes. Bitcoin traded around $10,000 at various points in 2019 and 2020. A return to that level would represent a decline of over 85% from its 2024 highs. Found this analysis of the latest Bitcoin price prediction crucial? Market insights are best when shared.

55967008,646092,1766037603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55967008.jpeg,BitMine Goes Shopping As Ethereum Dips: $140M Buy Spotted On-Chain,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-shopping-ethereum-dips-140m-buy-on-chain/,"Two massive Ethereum transactions have just flowed out from FalconX, with Lookonchain linking them to ETH treasury company BitMine. BitMine Has Received 48,049 Ethereum From FalconX In a new post on X, on-chain sleuth Lookonchain has pointed out how BitMine appears to have acquired 48,049 ETH from a hot wallet connected to FalconX, an institutional digital asset trading platform. The coins transferred through two transactions to two different wallets. The larger transfer involved 31,867 ETH, while the smaller one 16,182 ETH. In total, the tokens were worth about $140.58 million at the time that they were transacted. The moves have come as Ethereum has plunged alongside the wider cryptocurrency sector, with its price dropping below the $3,000 level. Thus, it would appear possible that they are a sign of BitMine buying the dip. Originally a Bitcoin mining-focused company, BitMine transitioned to being an Ethereum treasury vehicle under the leadership of chairman Tom Lee in June of this year. Since then, the firm has rapidly accumulated the cryptocurrency and has established itself as the “ Strategy ” of ETH. On Monday, BitMine published a press release announcing that its holdings reached 3,967,210 ETH. So far, the company hasn’t made any official announcement of the latest buy, but if confirmed, it would take the total reserve past the 4 million ETH milestone. The firm has set a target of 5% of the total circulating Ethereum supply. At present, the company still has some ways to go before this goal is hit, but at about 3.3% of the supply now sitting in its wallets, it has certainly made significant progress. With holdings valued at more than $11 billion, BitMine is the second-largest cryptocurrency corporate holder in the world, only behind Strategy. Unlike Michael Saylor’s firm, however, the Ethereum hoarder has its treasury sitting in the red right now. Nonetheless, if the two blockchain transactions correspond to purchases, then it’s a sign that BitMine is still committed to accumulating more. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked in an X post about how the Ethereum price has changed since BitMine started its accumulation spree. It’s visible in the chart that during the initial buying period, ETH witnessed some rapid growth.

The king of cryptocurrency now faces a decisive battle at a critical Bitcoin price resistance level. According to fresh analysis, the outcome of this clash between bullish derivatives traders and cautious spot market investors will determine the next major move. Let’s break down the forces at play. Why is $95K Such a Critical Bitcoin Price Resistance Level? Glassnode’s recent report highlights a fascinating conflict. The powerful push above $90,000 on December 17th was fueled primarily by leveraged derivatives traders. We know this because open interest rose sharply, and the perpetual futures volume delta turned positive. However, this rally met a harsh reality check. A massive supply wall between $93,000 and $120,000 triggered significant selling from spot market investors. This selling pressure caused the sharp price rejection we witnessed. The analysis concludes that for a sustained rebound, Bitcoin must do two things: first, reclaim the $95,000 Bitcoin price resistance , and second, push past the short-term holder break-even point of $101,500. Until then, the path upward looks blocked. Derivatives vs. Spot: Who’s Driving the Market? The current market dynamic reveals a clear tug-of-war. On one side, we have the derivatives traders using leverage to bet on higher prices. On the other, spot investors are taking profits and creating sell pressure. This conflict creates volatility and uncertainty. Derivatives Traders: Provide short-term momentum and liquidity through futures and options. Spot Investors: Often represent longer-term conviction; their selling indicates a belief that prices are high enough to take profits. This clash means the Bitcoin price resistance is not just a number on a chart. It represents a psychological and economic battleground. Can a Year-End Rally Overcome This Resistance? The broader sentiment adds another layer of complexity. Ryan Yoon, a senior analyst at Tiger Research, suggests that pervasive bearish sentiment across the market makes a sharp, dramatic year-end rally seem improbable. The general caution among investors is a significant headwind. However, Yoon points to a potential catalyst: the upcoming U.S. November Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. A favorable reading, showing cooling inflation, could inject optimism into the entire financial market, including crypto. This could provide the necessary fuel for a short-term bounce, potentially helping Bitcoin challenge the key Bitcoin price resistance level once more. What’s the Actionable Insight for Traders? For anyone watching the markets, this analysis provides a clear framework. The $95,000 level is the line in the sand. A decisive and sustained break above it, confirmed by high volume, could signal the next leg up. Conversely, failure to break through could lead to further consolidation or a pullback. Monitor these key signals: Price Action at $95K: Watch for rejection or acceptance. Spot Market Flows: Signs of accumulation or distribution on major exchanges. Macro Data: The CPI report’s impact on overall risk appetite. The struggle at this Bitcoin price resistance zone is a classic example of market mechanics in action. Conclusion: Patience is the Key Bitcoin’s journey is rarely a straight line. The current standoff at $95,000 is a critical test of strength between different market participants. While derivatives traders provide the thrust, sustained movement requires conviction from the spot market. Until Bitcoin can convincingly conquer this Bitcoin price resistance , patience remains the most valuable strategy. The market is waiting for a clear winner to emerge from this high-stakes conflict. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main Bitcoin price resistance level right now? The primary resistance level is $95,000, according to Glassnode analysis. A break above this is needed for a sustained bullish move. Why did Bitcoin drop after hitting $90K? The price was rejected by a large supply wall (sell orders) between $93,000 and $120,000, primarily from spot market investors taking profits. What is the difference between derivatives and spot market selling? Derivatives trading involves contracts like futures and options, often using leverage. Spot market selling involves selling actual Bitcoin held in wallets. The recent rally was driven by derivatives, while the drop was caused by spot selling. Could the CPI report affect Bitcoin’s price? Yes. A favorable U.S. CPI report showing lower inflation could boost overall market sentiment and potentially trigger a short-term bounce for Bitcoin, helping it test resistance. What is the short-term holder break-even point? This is the average cost basis for investors who bought Bitcoin within the last 155 days, currently around $101,500. It’s a significant psychological level where these holders might look to sell to break even. Is a big year-end rally still possible for Bitcoin? Analysts like Ryan Yoon believe strong bearish sentiment makes a sharp year-end rally improbable, but not impossible if a positive macro catalyst like a good CPI report emerges.

Despite the absence of any markup hearings scheduled for this week, industry representatives and senators engaged in what many considered a productive dialogue regarding the evolving legislative landscape. Senators Collaborate With Industry Leaders Key figures from major crypto firms were among the attendees, including executives from Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, Chainlink, a16z, and Ripple, who have been increasingly involved in discussions aimed at fostering the positive growth of digital assets in the country. According to Eleanor Terret from Crypto In America, the atmosphere of the meeting was described as “constructive and collaborative.” Senators from both parties engaged actively with industry representatives, asking insightful questions and exploring the nuances of the proposed bill text. Related Reading: Cantor Fitzgerald Projects Major Growth For Hyperliquid (HYPE) In Explosive New Report Participating senators included Democrats Mark Warner and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were noted for their engagement and for posing significant questions to both the industry representatives and Senate Banking staff. Three key areas of ongoing negotiation emerged from the discussions: the classification of tokens—distinguishing between securities and commodities, the roles of stablecoin interest versus rewards, and discussions surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi). The meeting’s update follows earlier confirmation from a committee spokesperson that the Banking Committee will not conduct a markup hearing prior to the upcoming Christmas break. Instead, the committee intends to monitor the bill’s progress for potential action in early 2026. Intensified Talks On Crypto Regulation In a statement released earlier this week, Jeff Naft, spokesperson for Chair Scott, emphasized the committee’s commitment to pursuing a bipartisan approach to address the complexities of digital asset market legislation. “Chairman Scott and the Senate Banking Committee have made strong progress,” Naft noted, underscoring continued efforts to establish a new regulatory framework that would enhance clarity for the crypto sector and position the United States as a leader in the digital assets arena. Negotiations have intensified over the past week, with Republican members of the Banking Committee working closely with their Democratic counterparts to seek a viable compromise.

Ethereum Has Been Trading Inside A Parallel Channel For The Last Few Years In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a long-term pattern that Ethereum has appeared to have been following for the last few years. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel” from technical analysis (TA), which forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder The upper level of a Parallel Channel is likely to facilitate top formations in the asset, while the lower one can act as a support boundary and allow the price to remain above it. Parallel Channels can be of a few different types depending on how the lines are oriented with respect to the graph axes. If the channel has some slope, it falls into either the Ascending or Descending categories. Naturally, it’s the former when the lines are angled upward and latter when they are downward. In the context of the current topic, the simplest type of Parallel Channel is of relevance: a channel that has zero slope. That is, a pattern with lines that are parallel to the time-axis. As an asset trades inside such a channel, it experiences consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. If one of the levels of the pattern break, a sustained continuation of trend may occur in that direction. This means that a surge above the resistance can be a bullish signal, while a fall under support a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the monthly price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the recent bearish wave in Ethereum has meant that its 1-month price has retraced to the midway line of the Parallel Channel located at $2,930. Martinez has noted that if ETH closes December below this level, a decline to lower levels could occur. The next potential support is situated at $2,000, corresponding to the 25% mark of the Parallel Channel. The cryptocurrency found support around this line in the starting months of 2025. In the scenario that this level also fails, Ethereum may be looking at a fall to the bottom line of the Parallel Channel at $1,090. The asset last retested it back in 2022 and successfully found support.

Starting at 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 23, these services will pause to facilitate a crucial network upgrade for the Sei blockchain. This proactive measure ensures a smooth transition and enhanced network performance for all users. What Does the Upbit SEI Service Suspension Mean for You? If you use Upbit for SEI transactions, you need to mark your calendar. The temporary halt affects only deposit and withdrawal functions for the SEI token. Therefore, your existing SEI holdings remain secure in your Upbit wallet during this period. However, you cannot move SEI tokens to or from external wallets while the maintenance window is active. The exchange confirmed this action supports the Sei network’s scheduled upgrade. Network upgrades often introduce new features, improve security, or enhance scalability. Consequently, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily pause external transactions to synchronize their systems with the updated blockchain and prevent any technical issues or fund loss. How Should You Prepare for the SEI Deposit and Withdrawal Pause? Planning ahead prevents last-minute stress. Here is a simple checklist for Upbit users before December 23: Complete pending transactions : Initiate any necessary SEI deposits or withdrawals well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline. Verify wallet addresses : Double-check all external wallet addresses if you plan to move funds, as transactions cannot be reversed once submitted. Monitor official channels : Follow Upbit’s official announcements for updates on service resumption. The exchange will notify users once normal operations resume. Remember, trading of SEI on Upbit’s internal market may continue unaffected during this deposit/withdrawal pause. However, always check the latest exchange notice for confirmation. This temporary inconvenience ultimately aims to provide a more robust and efficient SEI network experience for everyone. Why Do Exchanges Like Upbit Suspend Services for Network Upgrades? Network upgrades are essential for blockchain evolution. When a blockchain like Sei undergoes an upgrade, all network participants, including exchanges, must update their node software to the new version. Upbit suspends SEI deposits and withdrawals to ensure a clean, safe transition. This prevents potential problems like: Transaction failures or losses during the chain migration. Network forks causing confusion over the valid chain. Security vulnerabilities that could arise from running outdated software. This standard industry practice demonstrates Upbit’s commitment to operational security and user asset protection. The temporary pause, while slightly disruptive, is a responsible measure that prioritizes the long-term health of your SEI holdings. What Can We Expect After the Sei Network Upgrade? Once the upgrade completes and Upbit re-enables services, users should experience a seamless return to normal operations. The enhanced network may offer benefits like faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or new functionalities for SEI tokens. Moreover, successful upgrades often strengthen investor confidence in a project’s technical roadmap and long-term viability. To stay informed, users should monitor both Upbit’s official communication and announcements from the Sei development team. The resumption time may vary slightly depending on the upgrade’s complexity, but exchanges typically work diligently to minimize downtime. Final Summary: Navigating the Temporary SEI Service Halt In summary, Upbit’s temporary suspension of SEI deposits and withdrawals is a planned, precautionary step for a significant network improvement. By taking simple preparatory actions before December 23, users can avoid disruption. This upgrade underscores the dynamic nature of blockchain technology, where periodic maintenance paves the way for better performance and innovation. View this pause not as an obstacle, but as an investment in a more powerful SEI ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade SEI on Upbit during the suspension? A1: Typically, internal trading on the exchange’s order books continues. However, you should verify this in Upbit’s official announcement, as policies can vary. Q2: Are my SEI tokens safe on Upbit during this time? A2: Yes. The suspension only affects moving tokens in or out of the exchange. Your existing SEI balance in your Upbit wallet remains secure and unaffected. Q3: When will SEI deposits and withdrawals resume? A3: Upbit has not announced a specific end time. The service will resume after the network upgrade is complete and the exchange has successfully updated and tested its systems. Monitor Upbit’s notice page for the official resumption announcement. Q4: Do I need to do anything with my SEI tokens before the suspension? A4: Only if you need to deposit or withdraw them. If you are holding SEI on Upbit with no plans to move it, no action is required. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend SEI services? A5: It is likely. Other exchanges supporting SEI may announce similar maintenance windows to handle the same network upgrade. Check with your specific exchange for their schedule. Q6: What happens if I initiate a transaction right before the cutoff time? A6: Transactions initiated before the suspension time will be processed. However, to avoid being caught in a pending state, it is wise to complete all transfers several hours in advance. Found this guide on the Upbit SEI deposits and withdrawals suspension helpful?

This vision inches closer to reality as Standard Chartered, a global banking giant, launches a groundbreaking tokenized deposit solution . This move signals a seismic shift in how traditional finance embraces blockchain technology to solve real-world problems. What is Standard Chartered’s Tokenized Deposit Solution? Standard Chartered has unveiled a blockchain-based platform for tokenizing bank deposits. In simple terms, it turns traditional money in a bank account into digital tokens on a blockchain. The bank collaborated with Ant International to deploy this technology on Ant’s Whale platform. This system enables instant, 24/7 transfers in three major currencies: Hong Kong dollars (HKD) Chinese yuan (CNY) U.S. dollars (USD) Therefore, it removes traditional banking delays, offering a glimpse into the future of frictionless finance. Why is Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble a Game-Changer? This launch is not an isolated experiment. It forms a crucial part of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Project Ensemble . This initiative aims to build a robust financial infrastructure for tokenized assets in Hong Kong. Project Ensemble focuses on creating interoperability—ensuring different blockchain systems can work together seamlessly. By backing such innovations, Hong Kong positions itself as a forward-thinking global financial hub. Moreover, it provides a regulated sandbox for testing real-world applications of this tokenized deposit solution . What Are the Real Benefits of Tokenizing Deposits? This technology offers tangible advantages over the current system. First, it provides real-time settlement . Transactions that normally take days can settle in seconds, improving liquidity for businesses. Second, it enhances transparency and security . Every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, reducing fraud risk. Third, it lowers operational costs by automating processes and cutting out intermediaries. For users, it means faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments. This tokenized deposit solution could revolutionize trade finance, supply chain payments, and remittances. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Blockchain in Banking? Despite the promise, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving globally. Banks must navigate complex compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Another challenge is achieving mass adoption. Convincing traditional businesses and consumers to trust a new digital system requires time and education. Furthermore, scalability and energy consumption of blockchain networks are ongoing concerns that need addressing. However, initiatives like Project Ensemble show that collaboration between regulators and innovators can pave the way for responsible adoption. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Finance Standard Chartered’s launch is a landmark moment. It demonstrates that major financial institutions are not just observing blockchain but actively building with it. This tokenized deposit solution is a practical step toward a more efficient and inclusive financial system. As Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble gains momentum, we can expect more pilots and real-world use cases. The fusion of traditional banking trust with blockchain innovation promises to reshape our financial landscape fundamentally. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a tokenized deposit? A tokenized deposit is a digital representation of money held in a traditional bank account. It exists as a token on a blockchain, making it easier and faster to transfer or use in digital transactions. Is my money safe in a tokenized deposit? Yes, when offered by a regulated entity like Standard Chartered. The token is a claim on real money held securely by the bank. The blockchain adds an extra layer of transparency and security to the transaction record. How is this different from a stablecoin? While similar, a key difference is the issuer. A tokenized deposit is issued directly by a licensed bank against its deposits. Many stablecoins are issued by private companies with varying levels of regulatory oversight and reserve backing. Can I use this service as an individual? Currently, this solution is likely aimed at institutional and corporate clients for wholesale payments and trade finance. Retail availability will depend on future regulatory approvals and bank strategy. What does Project Ensemble mean for crypto in Hong Kong? Project Ensemble signals Hong Kong’s serious commitment to integrating blockchain technology into its mainstream financial system. It focuses on tokenizing real-world assets, which could bring more legitimacy and stability to the broader digital asset ecosystem. Will this make international transfers free? Not free, but significantly cheaper and faster. By reducing intermediary banks and manual processes, transaction costs can drop dramatically, benefiting businesses and consumers.

Prior to serving as Commissioner, Pham was a Managing Director at Citigroup heading market structure for strategic initiatives. During her tenure at the CFTC, she oversaw regulatory innovation and groundbreaking digital asset policy. She pressed aggressively on the pro-crypto plans set out by President Trump during his executive orders, launching the “crypto sprint.” The initiative has been running in parallel with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s “Project Crypto.” Last month, she announced a new prediction markets initiative , calling for nominations to head the CFTC arm. Additionally, she proposed a regulatory sandbox – CFTC Digital Asset Markets Pilot Program – that lets Bitcoin, Ether and USDC serve as collateral in derivatives markets. Pham launched the program on December 8, along with new guidance on tokenized collateral. Her successor, Mike Selig, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week, following a final vote.

Key Takeaways: Vitalik Buterin says Ethereum’s trustlessness depends not just on decentralization, but on how many people can understand the protocol. Growing technical complexity risks shifting trust from code to a small group of experts. Ethereum developers may need to sacrifice features to make the network simpler and more widely understandable. In a post on X this week , Buterin said that while Ethereum already operates without centralized control, true trustlessness goes beyond code execution and validator decentralization. It also depends on how many people can actually understand how the protocol works. Vitalik Buterin Warns Complexity Can Undermine Blockchain Trustlessness Trustlessness, in theory, means a system enforces its own rules through code, without relying on developers or intermediaries. However, Buterin noted that when a protocol becomes so complex that only a small group of experts can grasp it end to end, users are still forced to trust that group in practice. “An important and underrated form of trustlessness is increasing the number of people who can actually understand the whole protocol from top to bottom,” Buterin wrote. “Ethereum needs to get better at this by making the protocol simpler.” Ethereum already enforces transactions and smart contracts through open-source software and a decentralized validator set. An important and underrated form of trustlessness is increasing the number of people who can actually understand the whole protocol from top to bottom. Ethereum needs to get better at this (by making the protocol simpler). https://t.co/Pa1PXRG8sA — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 17, 2025 However, Buterin acknowledged that growing layers of features, upgrades and technical abstractions have made it harder for average users, and even developers, to fully follow how the system operates. Asked about the tradeoff between advanced features and simplicity, Buterin said the ecosystem should be willing to accept fewer features if it leads to better understanding and broader participation. Projects building on Ethereum echoed Buterin’s view. INTMAX, a privacy-focused layer-2 network, said trustlessness breaks down when only a handful of people can audit or explain a system. “If only five people can understand how your privacy protocol works, you haven’t achieved trustlessness, you’ve just changed who you trust. Simple, auditable privacy architecture > complex black boxes,” the project said. Same principle for privacy infrastructure.

Simple, auditable privacy architecture > complex black boxes. — INTMAX main (@intmaxIO) December 17, 2025 Ethereum Roadmap Targets Simpler User Experience Ethereum’s own roadmap acknowledges the problem. The network has said it remains “too complex” for most users and has outlined plans to lower barriers to entry and make Ethereum feel closer to a Web2 experience. Planned improvements include smart contract wallets that simplify gas fees and key management, as well as making node operation possible on consumer devices like smartphones and browsers. The Ethereum Foundation also continues to fund education initiatives aimed at expanding understanding of blockchain technology. As reported, Ether held on centralized exchanges has dropped to an all-time low , with balances falling to just 8.7% of total supply, the smallest share since Ethereum launched in 2015. The decline marks a 43% drop since July, a shift analysts say is tightening liquid supply and setting the stage for a potential market squeeze.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-investors-four-year-cycle-analyst-weighs-in/,"With only two weeks left of 2025, market participants wonder whether the Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the crypto market will continue to struggle or begin recovering. An analyst discussed the current market sentiment and the impact it may have on market performance. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns The Four-Year Crypto Cycle Is ‘Like Faith In God’ As we approach the end of the year, concerns about the crypto market’s performance continue to mount. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a 30% decline from its early October peak. As the volatility persist and the flagship crypto trades below its yearly opening price of $93,500, some investors questioned the four-year cycle theory, suggesting that the theory may no longer hold after the recent market’s performance. Responding to one of these comments, pseudonym market observer Plur affirmed that the four-year crypto cycle has evolved over the years and that “there is no magical rule of nature stating price must go up and down on this fixed cadence.” The analyst explained that the theory is a “memetic consensus, which is a form of implicit agreement and coordination that people will buy and sell together at set times, and by doing so, force outsiders to participate and bring their money.” “It’s an egregore-as-cartel. It’s a large group of loosely connected people all saying, every 4 years, we are going to hike up and down this mountain at the same time,” he detailed on the Wednesday post. Another community member added that the crypto cycle “is like faith in God: everyone believes in it, but no one has ever seen it.” Plur added that the initial catalyst and “original metronome” of this theory was the halving but that it has become “something more than that.” Market Struggles As Investors’ Faith Splits The evolution of the four-year crypto cycle has led some market participants to try to shift their behavior to “front run the moves of others” to benefit more.” As a result, many investors started to sell aggressively in 2025 anticipating of the end of the cycle. To the market watcher, this “represents a fraying in the memetic consensus, and eventually it collapses, as belief decays.” Similarly, Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, recently affirmed that Bitcoin is currently “climbing another wall of worry” that has made investors cautious of the upcoming market performance. She explained that there is fear of the four-year cycle, which suggests that 2026 will be a corrective year. Plur noted that the crypto market is in an uncertain state, where some investors continue to believe in the theory and some don’t.

Remember how assured you felt buying in 2023? Now the troops are scattered because the coordination mechanism is gone,” he stated. Plur added that “in equities the memetic consensus is that the index will always grind up over time, buy the dip, trust the process. (…) I had been hopeful that something similar could come in for BTC to replace the 4 year cycle, but sell pressure was way too high,” leading to the indeterminate state of the market. He concluded that it’s time to wait and see if a new form of memetic consensus can form.

Following years of legal hurdles that culminated in Zhao serving time in prison, his recent presidential pardon has revitalized the exchange’s prospects within the US crypto landscape. Binance’s Path To Re-Establish US Operations According to a recent Bloomberg report , Binance has been exploring options to restart operations for its American affiliate, Binance.US. This includes discussions of a recapitalization that could dilute Zhao’s majority stake, which has complicated the company’s efforts to expand in the country. At a recent Binance Blockchain Week event, Zhao expressed his commitment to transforming the US into a central hub for cryptocurrency, dubbing it “an emerging land for us.” His remarks came in the wake of a challenging period for Binance.US, which has seen its market share plummet from an impressive 35% to virtually zero since US regulatory bodies charged Zhao and the cryptocurrency exchange two years ago. Several states have also rescinded Binance’s licenses, while others, notably New York, never granted one in the first place. Supporters of the exchange believe that a forthcoming market-structure bill could establish a federal licensing regime, potentially altering the operational landscape for companies like Binance. However, Bitcoinist has continuously reported that the bill’s progress has stalled amid political divisions, casting doubt on its future. For now, the anticipated markup has been delayed until January 2026. The report suggests that if Binance were able to buy back some or all of Zhao’s holdings, it might consider new leadership and strategies to drive growth while leveraging political connections in Washington. Sources familiar with the situation emphasize a sense of urgency for the exchange to make critical decisions. Potential Partnerships With BlackRock In a separate effort to bolster its standing, the exchange is reportedly aiming for a closer partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. This relationship could involve the utilization of BlackRock’s tokenized money-market fund to support trades on Binance. Discussions regarding enhanced financial ties between the two have included the potential development of additional products and revenue-sharing opportunities. Additionally, Binance is looking to strengthen its relationship with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture co-founded by members of the Trump family. These moves appear to have taken shape following Zhao’s pardon and signify the crypto company’s desire to recalibrate its presence in a more favorable political atmosphere. To facilitate these efforts, Binance has promoted Yi He, Zhao’s partner, as a stabilizing force for the company. Over the past few months, she has assumed a prominent role, leading strategic initiatives and revitalizing Binance’s growth narrative. However, her elevation has sparked questions regarding the dynamics of power between her and Teng, the former regulator who has been instrumental in guiding the exchange’s outreach efforts. At the time of writing, BNB, the exchange’s native token, is trading at $846. This represents a major correction of 38% over the past few months, following the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $1,369.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/dark-defender-narrative-will-continue-to-shift-in-favor-of-xrp-heres-why/,"As uncertainty continues to weigh on digital asset market sentiment, crypto analyst Dark Defender has reiterated a technically grounded outlook on XRP that contrasts with growing concerns about a potential bear market. In a February analysis supported by detailed monthly chart visuals, the analyst provided a structured interpretation of XRP’s price behavior, stating that recent volatility aligns with an anticipated corrective phase rather than signaling a broader trend reversal. The commentary emphasizes long-term structural analysis over short-term price speculation, relying on an Elliott Wave framework that has guided expectations for several months. Tracking the Monthly Wave 4 Development According to Dark Defender, XRP has been progressing through a Monthly Wave 4 structure since mid-February. This corrective phase was mapped well in advance, with specific price zones identified as likely reaction points. The analyst explains that the first leg of the correction, labeled Wave A, was projected toward the $1.88 region, a level that later corresponded with XRP’s decline to approximately $1.60 in April. This move was treated as a normal retracement within a broader bullish cycle rather than a breakdown in market structure. The second phase, Wave B, unfolded as a recovery move. Dark Defender previously identified the $3.80 area as a key upside zone, and XRP’s subsequent advance toward $3.66 in July was cited as validation of that projection. From this perspective, the rally was not interpreted as the start of a new impulsive wave but as a corrective rebound consistent with Wave B characteristics on a higher timeframe. Completion of Wave C and Key Price Zone The most recent development centers on Wave C, the final leg of the Monthly Wave 4 correction. Dark Defender states that the $1.88 leve l was once again targeted, forming a defined accumulation zone between $2.2222 and $1.8815. XRP’s return to this area is described as the technical completion of the corrective structure. The analyst emphasizes that this outcome was anticipated and repeatedly communicated, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a consistent analytical framework during both advances and pullbacks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Forward Outlook Beyond the Correction With Monthly Wave 4 considered complete, Dark Defender’s analysis shifts toward the next phase of the cycle. The attached chart highlights a projected move toward the $5.85 region, derived from Fibonacci extensions and the anticipated Wave 5 advance. The analyst maintains that this outlook remains intact as long as the broader structure holds, reiterating confidence that current conditions do not support a sustained bear market scenario. The overall message underscores discipline and preparation, positioning the recent decline as a technical opportunity rather than a structural failure. Dark Defender concludes by reaffirming personal conviction in XRP’s trajectory , while noting that all views expressed are based on technical interpretation and not financial advice.

He shared a chart showing the average market path the last five times Bitcoin’s RSI broke below 30. The analyst also rejected the popular belief that Bitcoin follows a four-year cycle tied to its halving events. RSI Falling Into Oversold RSI is a momentum indicator that measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold on a scale of zero to 100. Below 30 means oversold, potentially undervalued , and may bounce up, while above 70 means overbought, potentially overvalued, and may pull back. It is calculated by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses over a period (typically 14 days). Bitcoin RSI on the weekly chart is currently just below 37, suggesting it is close to oversold territory, according to TradingView. The last time it was this low in this time frame was at the bear market bottom in December 2022, when BTC was trading at $16,500. Over the next two and a half years or so, it surged 660% to an all-time high in October this year and remains in an uptrend on the weekly time frame. A lot of people have been asking for an update on this chart, so I’ll just leave this here for anyone who needs to see it. This shows the average BTC trajectory following an oversold RSI reading, with RSI falling below 30 at t=0. So far, it’s been pretty bang on. Unless you… pic.twitter.com/FRLt5w7oFT — Julien Bittel, CFA (@BittelJulien) December 17, 2025 Bittel is also among several analysts who believe that the bull market cycle will extend into 2026. “As we’ve outlined many times, based on our work on the business cycle, the current path of financial conditions, and our expectations for overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities is that this cycle extends well into 2026.” He argued that the historical four-year pattern was actually driven by government debt refinancing cycles, not the halving, and that post-COVID fiscal policy pushed this cycle out by one year. Oversold Dips Work Higher Macroeconomic analysts at Milk Road agreed with the hypothesis. “Short-term oversold signals have to be interpreted inside the liquidity and business cycle,” they stated. They added that if conditions keep improving and money keeps flowing back into markets, “these oversold dips tend to work higher over time, even if it’s messy along the way.” “The bigger mistake is assuming every pullback now marks the start of a new bear market, when the macro setup still points to an extended cycle into 2026.” The short-term outlook isn’t so pretty with Bitcoin trading down 4.2% over the past week and hovering around $86,600 at the time of writing.

Virtual Asset Service Provider Hyperithm stands accused of launching a new DeFi financial product without submitting the mandatory risk assessment to regulators. This alleged regulatory filing oversight could have serious consequences for the company and set important precedents for the entire industry. What Exactly Did Hyperithm Allegedly Do Wrong? According to reports from NewsWay, Hyperithm launched a yield-bearing product for Bitcoin and Ethereum through Midas, an offshore Real World Asset platform, on December 17. The problem? South Korean law requires VASPs to provide authorities with a comprehensive risk assessment before introducing new services, especially those involving NFTs and DeFi protocols. Here’s what the regulations specifically demand: Advance notification of launch plans to financial authorities Submission of detailed risk assessment documents Compliance with both the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information Adherence to the Virtual Asset User Protection Act requirements Why Is This Regulatory Filing So Important? South Korea has implemented some of the world’s strictest cryptocurrency regulations following several high-profile exchange collapses and investor protection concerns. The required regulatory filing serves multiple crucial purposes: First, it helps authorities identify potential risks to consumers before products go live. Second, it ensures companies have proper safeguards in place. Third, it maintains market integrity by preventing irresponsible product launches. When companies bypass this regulatory filing process, they potentially expose investors to undisclosed risks and undermine the entire regulatory framework that protects the ecosystem. What Could This Mean for Hyperithm and the Industry? The consequences for Hyperithm could be severe if the allegations prove true. South Korean regulators have shown increasing willingness to enforce compliance through: Substantial financial penalties Suspension of business operations License revocation in extreme cases Increased scrutiny on all future products Beyond Hyperithm, this situation highlights the ongoing tension between innovative DeFi products and traditional regulatory frameworks. Many DeFi platforms operate on principles of decentralization that sometimes conflict with centralized regulatory requirements. How Can Crypto Companies Navigate Regulatory Compliance? For cryptocurrency companies operating in regulated markets, several best practices can help avoid similar situations: Engage regulators early: Don’t wait until product launch to start conversations about compliance requirements. Document everything: Maintain clear records of all regulatory communications and submissions. Seek legal expertise: Cryptocurrency regulations evolve rapidly—expert guidance is essential. Build compliance into product design: Consider regulatory requirements from the earliest development stages. The Bigger Picture: Regulation vs. Innovation This Hyperithm situation represents a classic case of the innovation-regulation dilemma. On one hand, regulators must protect consumers and maintain financial stability. On the other, excessive regulation could stifle the innovation that makes cryptocurrency valuable. The ideal solution lies in balanced approaches that protect users while allowing responsible innovation. However, achieving this balance requires clear communication, reasonable timelines, and mutual understanding between regulators and industry participants. As the cryptocurrency industry matures, incidents like the alleged Hyperithm regulatory filing omission serve as important reminders. Sustainable growth requires playing by established rules while working to improve those rules through constructive dialogue. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Compliance The Hyperithm case could become a watershed moment for cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea and beyond. How authorities respond will signal their seriousness about enforcement, while how the industry reacts will demonstrate its commitment to responsible growth. Ultimately, the future of cryptocurrency depends on finding the right balance between innovation and protection. Companies that prioritize proper regulatory filing and transparent operations will likely thrive, while those cutting corners may face increasing challenges in an increasingly regulated landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is Hyperithm accused of doing? Hyperithm is accused of launching a new DeFi yield product for Bitcoin and Ethereum without submitting the required risk assessment to South Korean regulators, as mandated by law. Why is regulatory filing important for crypto companies? Regulatory filings help protect investors by ensuring companies have identified and addressed potential risks before launching products. They also maintain market integrity and compliance with financial laws. What laws require this regulatory filing in South Korea? The Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information and the Virtual Asset User Protection Act both contain provisions requiring risk assessments before new product launches. What are the potential consequences for Hyperithm? Possible consequences include financial penalties, business operation suspensions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and in severe cases, license revocation. How does this affect other cryptocurrency companies? This case highlights the importance of regulatory compliance and may lead to increased scrutiny of all cryptocurrency companies operating in South Korea. Can DeFi products comply with traditional regulations? Yes, though it requires careful planning and sometimes creative solutions to align decentralized principles with centralized regulatory requirements.

As one of the true OGs of the privacy space, Dash is very much in the mix, backed by a decade of real-world focus on instant, low-cost, private payments. To unpack what’s driving the rally, discuss where on-chain confidentiality fits in everyday use, and forecast what’s next for the long-running Dash DAO, we broke bread with core member Joël Valenzuela. The privacy coin sector has been booming over the past few months. What do you see as the primary catalysts behind this rally, and how is Dash positioned to capitalize? Privacy in crypto is hot right now, mostly because of the relative legal clarity around privacy assets that we’ve seen develop over the past few years. People don’t want to go to prison, and when they’re confident that they won’t, they feel a lot more comfortable engaging. At the same time, uncertainty around the future of AI and governments creating a surveillance state, combined with Bitcoin’s inability to secure user privacy, have created this boom effect. Dash has safeguarded user confidentiality since day one in 2014. As we’ve expanded to focus on greater digital cash functionality like instant transactions and ease of use, we’ve remained committed to our original features, and are actively working to expand them. How does on-chain confidentiality through features like PrivateSend provide a competitive edge over transparent alternatives in everyday payments? Simply put, a complete lack of privacy is a huge liability and security issue. Companies, funds, individuals, and more don’t want their every financial move tracked, and especially in the age of $5 wrench attacks, kidnappings, and more, there could be a real safety risk associated with someone knowing your crypto wealth. Every protocol that wants to have any serious user adoption in the long run needs at least some basic built-in confidentiality features to keep outside observers from knowing who you’re transacting with or how much you have. Tyler Winklevoss recently invested $50m in Zcash, calling privacy “the precondition for freedoms.” I’m sure you agree, but what’s your take on how tools that offer fast, low-cost private transactions – dash included – contribute to that conversation? If decentralization allows us to transact permissionlessly in theory, and privacy allows us to do so in practice, fast, low-cost transactions are what extend this to everyone. When sovereign tools are expensive or difficult to use, few will use them or benefit from them, and when they do it will only be during exceptional circumstances. We believe in extending these freedoms to everyone, everywhere, for every purpose, at all times. What kind of real-world use cases or user behaviors do you think remain underexplored for privacy-oriented projects? Digital identity and data remain unexplored. We should be able to maintain sovereign access to data, access to memberships and property, transaction and communication history, and much, much more. Making this both easily accessible and private is a game changer, and is something we’re working on with our Evolution platform. Once everything a user has from a Google account can be stored and accessed just as easily in a sovereign and private way, we may finally see the beginning of a new era for privacy. Users are starting to demand both privacy and usability in a single transaction. How realistic is this right now? We can offer usability and privacy right now in transactions, though there are some trade-offs. Private transactions typically use more data and resources to use, and affect things like syncing wallet balances. It’s inherently more difficult for an open and public network to function with less information. That being said, improvements and optimizations are happening all the time. Within the next five years, an average user won’t notice a performance degradation from deciding to leverage privacy tools. Dash has been working on refining its tech for over a decade. With evolving regulations and institutional interest in privacy, what’s the biggest opportunity – and risk – for Dash in the next market cycle? Our biggest opportunity is that we finally become the breakthrough digital cash for the world. We’re well-positioned for this, with integrations in many payment processors and other tools, making it feasible to live entirely on Dash today. This will only get easier with some extra features we’re rolling out in the next few months. The biggest risk is simply that users become complacent and don’t value sovereign and decentralized solutions soon enough. If centralized stablecoins eat up too much market share for payments in the short term, that just means it’ll take longer for us to bring decentralized digital cash to the world.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s volatility has fallen below Nvidia’s as institutional products broaden its investor base, Bitwise says. The growth of spot ETFs and traditional market access is reshaping how Bitcoin trades and reducing sharp price swings. Bitwise views the calmer price action as a structural shift and expects further institutional entry in 2026. In a report released Wednesday , Bitwise said Bitcoin is likely to remain less volatile than Nvidia (NVDA) through 2026, pointing to a long-term decline in Bitcoin’s price fluctuations over the past decade. Bitwise Says Institutional Adoption Is Derisking Bitcoin The asset manager argued that Bitcoin’s growing presence in traditional financial markets is changing how it trades. “Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily declined over the past ten years,” Bitwise said, adding that the trend signals a broader “derisking” of the asset as institutional investors gain exposure through regulated products such as spot exchange-traded funds. According to Bitwise, the rise of ETFs and other traditional vehicles has expanded Bitcoin’s investor base beyond retail traders and crypto-native funds. That diversification, the firm said, has helped dampen sharp price moves that once defined the asset. The data highlights a notable contrast between Bitcoin and Nvidia this year. Bitcoin has moved 68% between its 2025 low of around $75,000 in April and its all-time high of $126,000 reached in early October. Nvidia, by comparison, has recorded a much wider 120% swing, rising from a low near $94 in early April to a peak of $207 later in the year. In 2026… … $BTC , $ETH , and $SOL will set new all-time highs, bets on @Polymarket will grow significantly, crypto equities will outperform tech stocks, and 7 other crypto predictions for 2026 by the @BitwiseInvest Research Team. Please note: As with all predictions, these are… — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 17, 2025 Despite Nvidia’s higher volatility, the chipmaker’s shares have delivered stronger returns. Nvidia is up roughly 27% year-to-date, while Bitcoin has slipped about 8% since the start of the year as crypto markets have increasingly decoupled from equities. Bitwise sees the calmer price action as a structural shift rather than a temporary phase. The firm said traditional market forces that once drove extreme crypto cycles, such as leverage-fueled speculation and sharp reactions to halving events, are losing influence. Looking ahead, Bitwise struck an optimistic tone on Bitcoin’s broader outlook. The firm expects Bitcoin to set a new all-time high and break away from the historical four-year cycle that has shaped previous bull and bear markets. It also predicts deeper institutional involvement in 2026, naming banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch as potential entrants. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Selling May Be Nearing Its End: K33 Bitcoin has seen sustained sell-side pressure from long-term holders since 2024, but that trend may be nearing exhaustion , according to a new report from research and brokerage firm K33. The firm estimates that around 1.6 million BTC, worth roughly $138 billion, has re-entered circulation over the past two years as early investors took profits. K33 head of research Vetle Lunde said the scale of these movements points to deliberate selling rather than technical factors like wallet consolidation or ETF-related transfers. The report notes that 2024 and 2025 rank among the largest years on record for long-term supply reactivation, driven not by speculation, but by direct selling into deeper institutional liquidity.

They tend to start with silent advances, emerging involvement and products start to make sense before the majority. The focus of creditors as they position themselves to invest in 2026 is on projects which remain in their early stages but already exhibit existence of genuine demand. A single alternative cryptocurrency based on Ethereum would fit that arrangement well. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been growing consistently, has not experienced sharp bursts, and set a definite direction to go live. The combination of the two is the reason why market commentators are starting to put it on the list of potential early breakout of the next crypto cycle. The Process of Demand Creation at Mutuum Finance via Lending Mutuum Finance is creating a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is constructed on two complementary systems. The former is the peer-to-contract market. Users will deposit assets in common pools and get in turn mtTokens. They are their share expressed in the form of these mtTokens which increase in value as borrowers pay interest. To illustrate, when a user invests an amount of ETH, which has a price of $5,000, they are able to increase in value over time depending on the demand of loans. The APY is automatically adjusted. Increase in the borrowing activity also increases returns. This maintains yield pegged on actual use rather than being incentive-based. The second one is peer-to-peer lending. Borrowers have the option of getting a variable rate with rates that fluctuate with usage or a fixed rate in some circumstances that provides predictable payment. Limits on loan to value make limits on how much may be borrowed against collateral thus serving to handle risk. In case collateral value is decreasing excessively, rules of liquidation are set into force. The liquidators settle off some of the debt, and purchase collateral at a discount, closeting the protocol and reinstating a balance. Growth Numbers In early 2025, Mutuum Finance began its token sale and rolled it out in an organized manner. The token was priced at $0.01 and it currently values at $0.035 in presale. That is a 250% growth. At a launch price of $0.06, Phase 1 participants are already poised to increase by up to 500% MUTM appreciation. Instead of distributing the entire supply at a single time, the project distributed 45.5% of its total token supply which is 4B at to early distribution. That equals about 1.82B tokens. Considerable uptake has been witnessed to date as over 820M tokens have been sold already even before the launch. Along with this development, capital and participation has increased. Mutuum Finance has gathered $19.4M dollars and gained more than 18,500 holders. The allocation at phase 6 is over 99% full and it indicates that access at the current price is just about exhausting. The presale demand is fast growing due to impending supply constriction. Activity within the community is also involved. The best contributor of the day will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM in terms of encouraging consistency in engagement instead of temporary interest levels. V1 Launch and Reasons Analysts are Watching The transition in valuation models may usually be determined by development milestones. As stated by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team on X, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will come with the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This release will comprise of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. The initially supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Security preparation is also proceeding in parallel. Mutuum Finance has also undergone a CertiK Token Scan and scored 90/100. Halborn Security is in the process of finalizing lending and borrowing contracts, which are being audited independently lately. Another review layer is a bug bounty of $50k that targets code vulnerabilities. It is the opinion of some analysts that such a combination is usually a prelude to a repricing phase. Under a bullish assumption, the projections indicate that MUTM could rise to a value higher than its initial launch price of $0.06 as more people and consumers start to watch it and start to use the service. These opinions are founded on form and time, rather than promises. Why the Long View Matters Mutuum finance is scaling beyond V1. The roadmap consists of a stablecoin, which is pegged to borrower interest, intended to work with the lending system. This provides a less volatile alternative to the users and helps to keep the activity active in various market scenarios. Increase in layer-2 will also be provided. Reduced costs and speed of transaction are essential in lending protocols which strive to expand user activity. Together with the strong oracle infrastructure and Chainlink data feeds, these improvements contribute to correct pricing and the liquidation security. According to market commentators, projects that are well prepared for this kind of preparation can shine in case there is a market rotation. Since investors are posing the question of what crypto to invest in today to be able to reap in the year 2026, they are more likely to invest in systems that can expand by use as opposed to exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is available at a price of $0.035. Its 250% increase to date does not show any spikes, it is more of incremental growth. As Phase 6 approaches completion and V1 gets ready, analysts think that it will be one of the first new crypto assets to get much broader traction as the next cycle starts.

Crypto Integration Rumor Ignites Gaming Buzz,https://coinpaper.com/13184/ea-sports-to-add-xrp-payments-crypto-integration-rumor-ignites-gaming-buzz,"EA Sports XRP Integration Rumors Spark Talk of True Mass Adoption A fresh rumor is gaining traction in both crypto and gaming circles as spotlighted by market analyst John Squire, suggesting that EA Sports may be exploring XRP for in-game payments. While unconfirmed, the speculation has reignited debate around true blockchain adoption, where real utility meets global scale. EA Sports is a global gaming powerhouse, with franchises like EA FC, formerly FIFA, Madden NFL, and Apex Legends reaching hundreds of millions of players. Introducing even a fraction of that audience to XRP via seamless in-game payments would deliver unprecedented real-world exposure, far beyond what most blockchain projects could ever achieve. What makes this rumor especially compelling is XRP’s purpose-built design. Engineered for fast, low-cost, and highly scalable transactions, XRP is ideally suited for microtransactions, the backbone of modern gaming economies. In-game purchases, player-to-player transfers, digital collectibles, and cross-border payments all demand speed and efficiency. Traditional payment systems often fall short, plagued by high fees, slow settlement, and regional barriers. XRP, by contrast, settles transactions in seconds at near-zero cost. If EA Sports were to explore such an integration, players would enjoy faster payments, seamless purchases, and global accessibility. And that’s the real takeaway: true mass adoption isn’t driven by speculation or hype, it happens when blockchain runs quietly in the background, delivering real utility and a frictionless user experience at scale. Well, the implications would stretch far beyond gaming. If millions of players began using XRP naturally through gameplay, digital assets could be normalized as everyday payment tools, not speculative instruments. That level of real-world utility could spark a ripple effect, motivating developers, publishers, and entertainment platforms to explore blockchain-based payment systems of their own. It’s important to note this remains a rumor, not an official announcement. Yet the enthusiasm surrounding it underscores a larger reality: true mass adoption is far more likely to emerge through global consumer platforms than niche crypto-native apps. If EA Sports ever integrated XRP, it wouldn’t just be a victory for Ripple or the crypto community, it would mark a turning point for blockchain at scale. Embedding XRP into one of the world’s largest digital ecosystems would demonstrate what true mass adoption looks like: millions of users engaging seamlessly, real-world utility driving everyday transactions, and technology that simply works in the background, exactly as John Squire suggests. Conclusion The speculation around EA Sports and a potential XRP integration points to a much bigger truth about the future of digital assets. Real adoption won’t be driven by whitepapers or price charts, but by everyday experiences where blockchain delivers obvious value. If a global gaming giant were to seamlessly embed XRP into its payment infrastructure, millions of users could engage with blockchain without friction or hype, simply because it works better. While unconfirmed, the rumor underscores how mass adoption is most likely to happen: through trusted consumer platforms, real-world utility, and seamless integration at global scale.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-18 07:32:27

The supply ratio shift indicates a change in holder behavior toward long-term retention, as opposed to retail short-term selling pressure. According to on-chain data provided by CryptoQuant analytics, the Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR), which measures the portion of all ETH held by exchange platforms, has decreased to approximately 0.137 across all exchanges. The drop marks the lowest since 2016 during the early development of the Ethereum blockchain. Across Binance, the largest crypto exchange platform by trading volume and with the highest ETH supply, the ESR has decreased to approximately 0.0325. ETH supply shift indicates diminished intent for immediate liquidation According to the ESR figures provided by CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain, there is a persistent net outflow of Ethereum tokens from exchanges to external or private wallets. The analysis by Arab Chain on CryptoQuant noted that such patterns often align with accumulation phases after a period of volatility, as markets absorb more liquidity with low selling pressure. Ethereum Exchange Supply Falls to Its Lowest Levels Since 2016 “This dynamic reflects increased trader caution and a decline in short-term selling pressure.” – By @ArabxChain pic.twitter.com/QdqLdtzYIo — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 17, 2025 Across all exchanges, the charts tracking the ESR metric show a persistent decline from mid-2024 to late 2025, fluctuating from approximately 0.165 steadily downwards to the current level of around 0.137. Meanwhile, the ETH price has also been fluctuating between $4,500 and its all-time high of $4,953.73 on August 24, 2025, to the current price of $2,830 based on CoinMarketCap data . Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, has recorded a similar pattern, starting from 0.038 in mid-2024, to the current range of 0.032-0.0325. The Ethereum token price tends to follow a similar pattern, exhibiting a positive correlation between the ETH price and ESR. Source: CryptoQuant; Binance exchange ETH supply ratio trend from mid 2024 to late 2025. The Ethereum blockchain’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism has incentivized staking, allowing users to lock tokens and earn rewards. The consensus mechanism has attracted almost 36 million ETH currently staked and requiring transfer off exchanges towards dedicated wallets or protocols. The transition in consensus mechanisms has contributed to the acceleration of the decline in supply across all exchanges. Layer 2 ecosystems, such as Base, amplify the supply shift to DEXs Risks associated with exchange failures, such as the 2022 FTX exchange collapse, have prompted the adoption of self-custody for enhanced security and control. Additionally, Layer 2 ecosystems, including Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, have also attracted liquidity, further reducing the exchange-held supply. Layer 2 ecosystems on Ethereum offer scaling solutions that facilitate cheaper and faster transactions, pulling ETH supply from centralized exchanges (CEX) to decentralized exchanges (DEX). DEXs, such as PancakeSwap and Uniswap, have all been built on these protocols to facilitate direct P2P crypto trading. According to on-chain data, approximately 67 public companies, government entities, and institutions that hold ETH as part of a reserve strategy now hold roughly 6.71 million ETH, valued at around $19.02 billion. Additionally, Ethereum-focused ETFs hold approximately 6.22 million ETH, valued at $17.63 billion. These values represent 5.55% and 5.14%, respectively, of the total ETH supply. Source: Strategic Reserve ; ETH supply across public treasuries and Ethereum ETFs. The reduction in ETH supply across exchanges and rising institutional demand have created a low-liquidity, high-demand environment, leading to a supply squeeze. According to the Arab Chain analysis on CryptoQuant, increased selling pressure may have contributed to the ETH price drop; however, continued buying pressure, particularly from institutional investors, could drive the ETH price upward in the long term.

This appointment isn’t just a headline—it’s a strategic power play that bridges the gap between traditional political power and the digital asset frontier. What does a heavyweight political figure bring to one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges? Let’s explore the implications. Why is the Coinbase Advisory Council a Game-Changer? The Coinbase advisory council serves as a critical bridge between the cryptocurrency industry and the complex world of global policy and regulation. By appointing George Osborne, Coinbase gains more than a famous name. It acquires decades of experience navigating the highest levels of international finance and diplomacy. Osborne served as the UK’s finance chief from 2010 to 2016, a period that included the aftermath of the global financial crisis. His insights are invaluable for an industry seeking clear regulatory frameworks. This council’s role is multifaceted. It provides strategic guidance on policy engagement, helps shape responsible innovation, and advocates for sensible regulations that protect consumers while fostering growth. With Osborne at the helm, the council’s voice in conversations with policymakers in the US, UK, and EU gains significant weight. What Does George Osborne Bring to the Coinbase Advisory Council? George Osborne’s resume reads like a blueprint for influencing financial policy on a global scale. His experience extends far beyond his tenure as Chancellor. Consider his current and past roles: High-Level Network: Decades of relationships with central bankers, finance ministers, and political leaders worldwide. Crisis Management: First-hand experience steering a major economy through financial uncertainty and regulatory overhaul. Media and Communication: As a former newspaper editor, he understands how to shape public and political narrative—a crucial skill for crypto. Global Perspective: His work with various international institutions provides a broad view of differing regulatory approaches. This background is precisely what the Coinbase advisory council needs. The crypto industry’s biggest challenge is no longer technology; it’s policy. Osborne’s appointment shows Coinbase is serious about winning that policy battle. How Will This Shape Crypto Regulation and Institutional Adoption? The involvement of a figure like Osborne is a clear signal to other institutions. It demonstrates that serious, established players are engaging with crypto at the highest levels. This has a ripple effect: Regulatory Clarity: Osborne can help translate industry needs into policy language that regulators understand and trust. Investor Confidence: His presence lends credibility, potentially encouraging more traditional financial institutions to explore digital assets. Strategic Foresight: The council can anticipate regulatory trends and help Coinbase adapt proactively, rather than reactively. Furthermore, this move is part of a larger trend. The Coinbase advisory council itself includes other former policymakers and regulators. This collective expertise creates a powerful advocate for frameworks that recognize crypto’s potential while addressing legitimate concerns about consumer protection and financial stability. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? This strategic hire is not without its complexities. Osborne will need to navigate several key areas: Balancing Acts: Advocating for innovation while ensuring robust consumer safeguards. Global Coordination: Crypto is borderless, but regulation is not. Harmonizing approaches across jurisdictions is a monumental task. Public Perception: Helping shift the narrative from speculation to utility and financial inclusion. However, the opportunities are transformative. A well-advised Coinbase can pioneer models for compliance, security, and transparency that become industry standards. Effective engagement through its advisory council can help shape regulations that foster innovation instead of stifling it. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto’s Future The appointment of George Osborne to lead the Coinbase advisory council is a defining moment. It moves the conversation about cryptocurrency from the fringe to the center of global finance. This is not about a single hire; it’s about the maturation of an entire industry. By leveraging high-level political and regulatory expertise, Coinbase is positioning itself—and by extension, the broader crypto ecosystem—for sustainable, long-term growth within the global financial system. The message is clear: crypto is building its future with the lessons of the past in mind. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coinbase Global Advisory Council? The Coinbase Global Advisory Council is a group of experts from politics, regulation, and finance that provides strategic advice to Coinbase on public policy, regulatory engagement, and corporate strategy. When did George Osborne join the Coinbase advisory council? George Osborne first joined the Coinbase Global Advisory Council in January 2024. His recent appointment is to the role of Chairman of that council. Why would a former politician join a crypto company? Former politicians like Osborne possess invaluable experience in governance, regulation, and international diplomacy. Crypto companies need this expertise to navigate complex legal landscapes and advocate for sensible regulations that allow the industry to grow responsibly. Does this mean crypto regulation will become stricter? Not necessarily. The goal of advisory councils like this is to engage with regulators to help shape clear and practical rules. The aim is often to create frameworks that protect consumers and ensure market integrity without crushing innovation. Experienced advisors can argue for balanced approaches. How does this benefit ordinary crypto users? Ultimately, clearer regulations and stronger institutional involvement can lead to a more stable, secure, and accessible cryptocurrency ecosystem. It can increase consumer protection, reduce fraudulent activity, and pave the way for more mainstream financial products built on crypto technology. Who else is on the Coinbase advisory council? While the full list evolves, such councils typically include former regulators, seasoned diplomats, and experts in national security and finance. Their collective experience is used to tackle the multi-faceted challenges facing the crypto industry. Found this analysis of the Coinbase advisory council’s new leadership insightful?

55972216,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=880528,1766044676,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55972216.jpeg,James Seyffart warns many crypto ETPs may not survive past 2027,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/etf-analyst-james-seyffart-on-crypto-etps/,"Bloomberg Intelligence crypto ETF analyst James Seyffart claimed on December 17 that crypto ETPs could face a surge in liquidations by the end of 2027. The analyst emphasized that issuers are currently launching a large number of products, with at least 126 filings with the U.S. SEC still pending approval. Seyffart agreed with Bitwise’s projection that many of the over 100 ETPs waiting for U.S.-listing approval might receive the green light in 2026 but may not survive until the end of the year. Additionally, those who manage to cross to 2027 may not see the end of that year. The analyst believes that the lack of demand could be the main reason for these projected mass ETP liquidations. For perspective, nearly 746 ETFs reportedly debuted in 2024, and approximately 800 new funds entered the market in the first nine months of 2025 alone, as the number of ETF launches surged. Asset flows also rose, with net YTD sales topping $1.1 trillion as of October 2025. However, closures also remained steady, with 266 funds shuttered in the first half of 2025, compared to 253 that closed during the same period in 2024, according to ETFGI data. Those numbers could rise as new products continue to struggle to acquire the necessary assets to survive. Rosenbluth agrees that many ETFs are going to close Todd Rosenbluth, the head of ETF trends research at VettaFi, is also concerned that an excessive number of ETPs are being introduced, and some of them may close. He noted that the reason why BlackRock or any other large asset manager is not closing its popular ETFs is that it has too many of them. They are pulling inventory off the shelf that is not selling to make room for products that are more likely to sell. Greg Stumm, the CEO and president of American Beacon Advisors, also emphasized that new assets may not last, despite issuers launching funds at a rapid pace. He initially believed that half of the 11 U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs would have closed by now, but noted that even the small ones are now worth over $500 million. Meanwhile, ETFGI reported a total of 622 closures in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for the highest number at 196. On the other hand, there were 179 closures in the first four months of 2025. In 2023, there were 244 ETF closures with an average age of 5.4 years and an average AUM (assets under management) of about $54 million. Several popular ETPs, including ARK 21Shares’ ARKY (ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF) and ARKC (ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF), have already been liquidated this year. These investment products ended up shutting down because they failed to attract enough inflows for sufficient AUMs. New U.S. SEC listing guideline to speed up ETF approvals The U.S. SEC introduced new listing guidelines that could speed up ETF approvals, providing issuers with a faster and clearer path to market and reducing the backlog of shutdowns. The generic listing standards were approved in late September, and they removed the need for individual 19(b) approvals for qualifying crypto ETPs. The new U.S. SEC guidelines also allow issuers to choose between requested accelerated effectiveness and automatic effectiveness under Rule 461 for faster launches. The agency approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the Arca, the Nasdaq, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, BZX Exchange. The U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins believes the new listing guidelines will reduce barriers to access crypto-related products and provide investors with more choices. James Selway, Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, added that the commission’s approval of generic listing guidelines provides investors with much-needed regulatory clarity and certainty.

Background: How the Pre-Market Ecosystem Came Into Being Panama City, 19 December, 2025 – By the end of 2022, the crypto market had clearly rolled over into a downtrend. Risk appetite faded, primary market fundraising dried up, and both deal count and total capital raised fell sharply. For many projects, this meant tighter funding, slower user growth, and more difficulty getting meaningful on-chain data. As token issuance cycles dragged out, teams started looking for ways to survive without immediately launching a token, experimenting with non-token revenue models and points-to-airdrop schemes. These structures were used to keep the lights on and, just as importantly, to maintain community engagement and key metrics. Figure 1: Web3 Industry Fundraising Overview (as of 8 Dec, 2025), Source: CryptoRank Looking back at the previous cycle, the huge airdrops from Arbitrum, Optimism, Aptos and other major projects turned “ship the product first, issue the token later” into the default playbook. Before the TGE (Token Generation Event), large numbers of users were already helping build these ecosystems through interactions, staking, trading, testing and so on. Projects, in turn, used this activity to collect behavioral data, test product-market fit and strengthen their pitch when raising in the primary market. As this approach became mainstream, user contribution and incentive design in the pre-TGE phase started to look less like pure “engagement” and more like the early stages of asset formation, paving the way for today’s pre-market trading ecosystem. At the same time, on-chain infrastructure kept maturing, issuance costs fell, and ultra-low-barrier tools such as Pump.fun lowered the bar for spinning up new tokens. The result was an explosion in token count and a constant dilution of market attention. The rise of meme coins drove the point home: in this environment, attention is often a stronger driver of price than fundamentals. For new projects, winning attention before TGE has effectively become a hard requirement. Under that pressure, a number of pre-market asset mechanisms started to emerge: Making points tradable led to the rise of OTC points platforms such as Whales Market. Yield-tokenization protocols (such as Pendle) created new financial wrappers for airdrops and yield streams. CEXs and OTC venues began offering pre-market spot trading. Some exchanges launched pre-market perpetual contracts (for example, WLFI pre-launch perps on HTX). Asset vouchers such as BuildKey provided a new way to trade token subscription rights. Taken together, these mechanisms built a market that used to exist only behind closed doors between VCs and exchanges: the “in-between layer” sitting between primary and secondary markets. That layer has gradually evolved into what many now call the 1.5-level market, or simply the Pre-Market. This is not a phenomenon unique to crypto. In mid-2024, for instance, Robinhood announced that it would offer EU users on-chain, tokenized exposure to private company equity such as OpenAI and SpaceX [1] , reflecting strong retail demand for early-stage assets. In essence, the growth of the pre-market is a restructuring of what used to be a very closed capital flow chain. As a result, pre-TGE trading is no longer a side show or a temporary gimmick. It has become a clearly defined layer of the market. Its influence goes far beyond “more ways to speculate”: it changes how projects launch, it reshapes token distribution over time, it alters the listing pathways on exchanges, and it rewrites the logic of how early liquidity is created. Against this backdrop, this report focuses on a few core questions: Is pre-market trading reshaping the way projects issue tokens? Is it changing how exchanges design their listing systems? Does the pre-market have the ingredients to become a scalable, standalone “new market”? Can users realistically achieve measurable risk–return profiles at an earlier stage? The following sections explore these questions and offer some forward-looking observations. II. Three Value-Anchoring Paths for Pre-Market Assets Assets that trade before TGE do not come in a single, neat format. They form a layered structure built from different sources, logics and settlement methods. Without some systematic classification, it becomes very hard to discuss price formation, settlement, project incentives and participant behavior within a coherent framework. Rather than slicing everything up purely by “product type”, this report groups pre-market assets into three broad categories based on how their future value is anchored. That perspective tracks more closely with how trades actually work in practice and makes it easier to understand what each type of asset is doing during the pre-market phase. Token-value-anchored assets These revolve around future token value and include pre-market OTC deals, pre-market spot and pre-market perpetual contracts. In all of these, the underlying exposure ultimately points to either the token itself or its expected price after listing. Among pre-market assets, this group has the most direct link to the future spot market. Points-anchored assets These are built around points systems, which later become the basis for airdrops. They include the points themselves, the tradability of those points, and the additional claims that appear when yields are split and mapped back to points (for example, “points-mapped yield rights”). Under today’s airdrop-driven tokenomics, this category carries user contribution, behavioral incentives and airdrop expectations, and is often the earliest expression of assetized expectations in the pre-market. Rights-anchored assets These focus on future rights and typically show up as NFTs, access passes, or BuildKey-style vouchers. They package non-standard entitlements—whitelist spots, testing slots, early access, or future token allocations—into tradable units. What they represent is not yield or token exposure directly, but a set of future redeemable rights that have been clearly assigned. Compared with a more traditional “by product” classification, this three-way split better highlights how the pre-market spans multiple chains: a token-value chain that concentrates price discovery, a points chain that drives user growth and early incentives, and a rights chain that handles distribution logic and entitlement assignment from the project’s perspective. Once this basic structure is in place, we can go a level deeper. In the next section, each category is examined in turn: how it came about, how it trades, how prices are formed, and what typical examples look like. III. Three Classic Pre-Market Trading Types and Case Studies Section II outlined a way to think about pre-market assets based on the way their future value is anchored. Building on that, this section looks at the mechanics. Starting from representative products, it breaks down: how each type of asset is generated, how the trading structure works, how prices are formed, and how risk is transmitted. Real cases are used to show how these assets behave in the wild and how “marketized” they actually are, giving a clearer view of what the pre-market looks like in the current cycle. 1. Token-Type Pre-Market Assets: Trading on Future Tokens and Future Prices Within the pre-market ecosystem, the chain centered on future token value is the most liquid, the closest to genuine price discovery, and the most directly linked to a project’s performance after listing. Based on how trades are carried out and the state of the token at the time, this category usually includes: OTC transactions, pre-market spot directed by exchanges (for example, Binance pre-market spot and Gate Pre-Token), and pre-market perpetual futures What they all have in common is that the underlying exposure ultimately points to the token or its expected post-listing price. Using different matching, margin and collateral setups, they effectively pull the future spot market forward into the pre-market window. (1) Pre-Market OTC Pre-market OTC trades behave a lot like conventional OTC deals: they are peer-to-peer transactions with a platform standing in the middle as guarantor. There are both centralized and decentralized versions. On the decentralized side, Whales.Market has become one of the main venues; on the centralized side, CEXs dominate. By late 2025, several exchanges including Bitget, MEXC and Gate had launched their own pre-market OTC offerings. Volumes tended to concentrate in large airdrop projects and hot narrative assets—for example, earlier WLFI trading and popular TON mini-game tokens. Figure 2: Market Size of the Pre-Market OTC Trading Segment, Source: Compiled from Official Platform Data, 8 Dec, 2025 The heart of this model is the collateral arrangement. Both sides must lock up some assets before an order goes live, so that settlement can actually be enforced: When a buyer submits an order, an equivalent amount of stablecoins is frozen in their account until settlement is finished. The seller must lock the future deliverable tokens or equivalent assets according to the platform’s specified collateral rate. Once an order is matched, it moves into a settlement phase. In that window, sellers must transfer the agreed tokens to buyers, and buyers must pay on time. If a seller misses the deadline, all or part of their collateral may be confiscated and paid out to the buyer. In a scenario where the token lists at a much higher price than the pre-market level, the buyer’s theoretical maximum upside is roughly 100% (before fees). The platform usually spells out key timings in advance: when pre-market trading ends, when settlement begins and when spot trading officially opens. Participants who do not have the necessary assets ready by those cut-off times risk having collateral deducted for failing to settle. In other words, buyers in pre-market spot are typically exposed to a maximum gain/loss of around 100% (ignoring fees), while sellers can use the mechanism to lock in profits ahead of listing—or, in extreme cases, choose to walk away from the contract if the economics justify a default. (2) Pre-Market Spot Trading Pre-market spot is essentially regular spot trading shifted forward in time, with a few extra guardrails such as position limits and staking requirements. At present, it is mainly seen on Binance and Gate.io. Binance – Pre-Market Spot Binance has run pre-market spot trading for at least two projects: Scroll (SCR) and Usual (USUAL). Scroll, a zkEVM rollup, was valued at around USD 1.8 billion in 2023, and 5.5% of its total token supply was allocated through Launchpool. On 11 October, at 18:00, Binance opened pre-market trading in SCR and capped individual positions at 2,500 SCR (about 5 BNB). From one hour before pre-market trading began until after it ended, deposits and internal transfers for SCR were paused. Normal deposit/transfer functions were restored only once pre-market spot closed, and withdrawals opened 24 hours after SCR went live on the Binance spot market [2] . In practical terms, aside from these limits, the trading experience was nearly indistinguishable from standard spot. During the 10-day pre-market window, first-day volume exceeded USD 40 million. After that, activity slowed materially, and most days saw volume of about USD 2 million. Figure 3: SCR Price K-Line Chart, Source: Binance, 8 Dec, 2025 The second case, USUAL, allocated 7.5% of total supply via Launchpool. Pre-market trading opened on 19 November 2024 at 18:00 (ten hours after Launchpool ended) and closed on 17 December 2024 at 17:00. Price action followed a similar pattern: an initial uptrend in price followed by weaker trading volumes. Figure 4: USUAL Price Trend K-Line Chart, Source: Binance, 8 Dec, 2025 Importantly, while Binance was running pre-market spot for these assets, other CEXs did not list spot pairs for them. In practice, Binance became the only venue where larger capital could gain spot exposure to these tokens. With a very large user base and relatively small float, pre-market pricing leaned heavily in favor of sellers, as tight supply and intense attention pushed prices higher. It is also clear that this is not a model that every exchange can copy. The product is possible only because of Binance’s dominant position and strong leverage in listing negotiations. From the price charts, users who entered via Launchpool and sold into pre-market spot had a relatively high chance of making a profit. For projects and broader communities, however, pre-market spot is not necessarily ideal: Prices can easily be bid up in a thin-float, high-attention environment, setting the stage for a “spike then fade” pattern after listing. Pre-market sets expectations early, leaving less narrative room before TGE. The mechanism tends to favor Launchpool participants and larger holders, rather than regular community users, making expectation management harder. It may be for these reasons that Binance has so far only experimented with pre-market spot on a very limited set of projects. Gate – Pre-Token Gate’s Pre-Token approach is conceptually similar but implemented differently. It is a stake-and-mint system. Users stake USDT to mint Pre-Tokens, which represent claims in pre-market trading. These Pre-Tokens cannot be deposited, withdrawn or transferred on-chain, but they can be freely traded in Gate’s spot market. Users who prefer not to mint can simply buy them from others. Before pre-market trading ends, Gate shuts down both minting and the pre-market spot market. At that point, the system takes a snapshot of all Pre-Token holders, clears out token balances and moves into settlement. For minters: they must acquire and deliver the real tokens during the settlement window. Once they have delivered successfully, the USDT they staked is returned to their spot or unified account. Failure to deliver results in a loss of the staked USDT. For traders: they can sell their Pre-Tokens before the market closes to lock in profits or hold them through to settlement. After settlement, the system distributes the real tokens delivered by minters, plus a proportional share of any collateral from minters who failed to deliver [3] . By early December 2025, Gate had supported 19 projects through Pre-Token. For most of them, the number of minters was in the hundreds. Telegram mini-game tokens have been particularly popular: for example, HMSTR attracted about 1,400 minters and more than USD 5.4 million in staked USDT, while DOGS reached nearly USD 10 million in stake from 1,331 minters [4] . Because not all tokens are always delivered in full, the undelivered portion is pooled as a default collateral pool, which the system distributes to Pre-Token holders. In practice, this often means a holder ends up with slightly fewer real tokens than the number of Pre-Tokens they held, but receives extra stablecoins as compensation. Figure 5: Gate’s Pre-Market DOGS Settlement Page, Source: Gate Gate’s design offers buyers a basic guarantee that “there will be tokens”, while giving projects and large holders a convenient way to conduct something very close to a pre-spot listing entirely within the exchange, without the friction of moving to external platforms. (3) Pre-Market Perpetual Futures Pre-market perpetuals (often called pre-launch futures) are another step along the same path: they allow users to trade a token’s price before it appears on spot markets. Instead of being anchored to live spot prices, these contracts reference a future spot price, and are traded via margin and limited leverage. HTX ’s WLFI/USDT linear perpetual was one such example. It gave users a way to position ahead of WLFI’s listing and express a view on its eventual price and liquidity. These contracts are usually listed in the days or weeks before TGE is expected to take place. Compared with more mature perpetual markets, pre-market perps rely more on expectations, available liquidity and order book depth. Funding rates often stay relatively fixed, and exchanges tend to cap leverage in the 3x–10x range to constrain risk. Figure 6: Basic Rules for WLFI Pre-Market Contracts, Source: HTX Before listing, these instruments can, in theory, provide a strong price discovery signal. In practice, however, they also come with higher information risk, liquidity risk and settlement uncertainty. Monad—a recently launched L1—is a good example. Across several platforms, MON’s pre-market perp volumes and depth did not reflect its status as a flagship L1. Relative to blue-chip perp markets on the same exchanges, and compared with its volumes after spot listing, pre-market liquidity remained thin. That “underwhelming reality” points to a ceiling on how much pre-market perps can realistically do at this stage. Figure 7: MON Trading Volume Across Selected CEXs and Decentralized Derivatives Platforms, Source: Compiled from Official Sources There have also been clear instances of manipulation. On Hyperliquid, for example, XPL–USDC perps were listed with up to 3x leverage and priced via an internal oracle with no external reference or strict open interest caps. On 26 August, a single whale market-bought around 15.2 million XPL, wiping out the order book and pushing the price from USD 0.60 to USD 1.80 in one move. Hyperliquid’s mark price followed the internal oracle up to USD 1.80, while external markets still traded at USD 0.60. The 200% gap triggered mass liquidations on the short side, with estimated losses around USD 50 million [5] . It was a sharp lesson in how fragile ill-designed pre-market derivative venues can be. Figure 8: XPL Price K-Line Chart and Abnormal Volatility, Source: Hyperliquid Official Website, 8 Dec 2025 2. Points-Type Pre-Market Assets: User Behavior Points and Their Financial Offshoots Because points are inherently quantifiable, early trading of points often started in small, closed communities with third-party escrow. As appetite grew, platforms like Whales Market began using smart contracts to hold collateral and match orders, gradually forming a standardized points OTC market. In this setup, both sides typically settle in stablecoins, and after TGE the platform distributes whatever airdrop rewards are due to buyers based on the project’s official rules. The central problem is that points do not map linearly to value. How much they’re “worth” depends heavily on the final airdrop formula. If the project uses thresholds or multiplier tiers, the points sold in a trade might not correspond one-to-one with actual rewards. For example: User A has 200,000 points and sells 50,000. The rules say: rewards start at 100,000 points; 200,000 points earn double rewards. In that case, should the buyer’s 50,000 points be treated as: below the minimum threshold (so no reward), or part of the “double” tranche that previously belonged to User A? That ambiguity makes pricing extremely difficult. Figure 9: Whales Market Points Trading Mechanism, Source: Tiger Research Pendle offers an elegant workaround. Pendle itself doesn’t airdrop tokens or directly trade points, but its yield-tokenization design—especially the YT (Yield Token)—fits naturally with other projects’ points/airdrop schemes, effectively creating a kind of “airdrop leverage”. Here’s how it works in practice: Users deposit yield-bearing assets (such as stETH, eETH, rsETH) into Pendle. These are wrapped into standardized SY (standardized yield tokens). SY is then split into: PT (Principal Token) – representing the principal, and YT (Yield Token) – representing future yield. In many newer protocols that rely on points-based airdrops—for example Ether.fi, Renzo and Karak—on-chain “yield-generating behavior” is one of the main metrics used to assign points. That means addresses holding YT are often treated as contributors, and are rewarded with points or airdrops based on how much YT they hold and for how long. In simple terms, if you hold YT: you still receive yield from the underlying asset, and you may also earn extra airdrop points thanks to that holding behavior. This turns YT into an “airdrop-qualification asset”. Many users buy YT primarily to farm airdrops rather than to harvest yield. As this setup matured, Pendle became an important hub in the pre-market asset ecosystem. It transforms previously closed “yield rights” into tradable, stackable “contribution credentials”, tying together yield, points and liquidity. Figure 10: Pendle Asset Trading Volume and Liquidity Rankings, Source: Pendle Website, 8 Dec 2025 Daily volume data illustrate this quite clearly: trading volume for airdrop-related assets on Pendle frequently exceeds USD 3 million, and in favorable conditions can climb past USD 10 million. The resilience of this liquidity comes from Pendle’s dual liquidity engines: AMM engine – When a yield-bearing SY is split into PT and YT, the AMM pool offers liquidity between PT and SY. Users can trade PT directly or obtain YT through a flash-swap mechanism, all inside a single pool [6] . Order-book engine – This layer complements the AMM by providing better depth and price granularity. Orders can be placed not only at specific prices but also at a desired implied APY, which creates a more nuanced pricing surface [7] . Deep liquidity then feeds into composability. Other protocols can build on top; PT can be traded in pools, used as collateral in lending, or integrated into structured products. Even so, the model has clear limits: It fits best with DeFi-native protocols where user contribution can be mirrored through on-chain financial flows. Many other projects have no natural way to translate “points” into DeFi positions. Regardless of multipliers or reward tiers attached to YT, the final reward still depends on each project’s own airdrop rules. Pendle can smooth the mapping, but it cannot remove the structural uncertainty inherent in points-based assets. Similar protocols have appeared, each with its own twist—RateX adds leverage, Spectra lets communities spin up their own markets, and so on. But in terms of actual usage, liquidity, and brand recognition, Pendle remains the flagship protocol in this niche. Figure 11: Fundamental Data of Yield-Trading Protocols, Source: Compiled from Official Websites and Documentation, 8 Dec 2025 3. Rights-Type Pre-Market Assets: Redeemable Entitlements, Including Future Tokens In many gaming, social and application projects, early NFTs, in-game items or access passes often play a role in airdrop allocation. In other words, these assets are not just cosmetic or functional; they carry implicit future token redemption rights. Because projects rarely define these rules cleanly at the outset, such “early credentials” usually face two recurring problems: Their non-standard nature makes them hard to price and reduces liquidity. Teams may revise the rules later—or in some cases walk back soft promises—leaving the value of these credentials uncertain. From the project’s point of view, the goal of an airdrop is not to “spread tokens evenly”, but to direct scarce resources toward users who are valuable over the long term. Traditional NFTs or one-off “task passes” aren’t very good at expressing this; they’re too coarse to distinguish between genuine contributors and opportunists, and they rarely give the market a clear, early signal of value. Aspecta addresses this by abstracting those early, messy credentials into a more standardized, tradable unit: the BuildKey. In this model, NFTs, pre-TGE passes and similar objects are wrapped into on-chain vouchers that can trade in a transparent, liquid environment. For pre-market trading, this amounts to tokenizing airdrop expectations—letting “future rights to yield” enter price discovery in advance. Aspecta’s BuildKey system is built around four core modules: Pricing & Trading Supports multiple methods—bonding curves, order books, auctions—enabling genuine on-chain price discovery early on. What used to be a hazy OTC quote becomes a verifiable, traceable price formation process. Gated Distribution & KYC Lets teams set different eligibility layers during issuance. They can segment KYC’d users, developers, KOLs and core contributors; issue publicly or via whitelists; and balance compliance requirements with the need to reward early adopters. Customized Utility Through programmable contracts, BuildKeys can carry more than just a future redemption right. They can embed governance, staking hooks, access control, or ecosystem-point functionality. That gives them intrinsic utility even before tokens exist. Shared Liquidity for Multiple Assets Allows several projects to share the same liquidity pool. This improves capital efficiency and allows a degree of cross-asset price discovery, mitigating the distortions caused by very shallow, project-specific pools. As of 8 December 2025, Aspecta had listed 29 assets. Apart from River, which amassed roughly USD 110.41 million in trading liquidity, most assets see volumes in the USD 1–3 million range—already ahead of many traditional pre-market OTC venues. In effect, BuildKeys have given rise to a standalone pre-market trading venue with a reasonably scalable asset structure [8] . Figure 12: Aspecta Asset Trading Volume, Source: Compiled from Official Website, 8 Dec 2025 They have also produced noticeable wealth effects. Sphere X has seen returns above 11,000%, while even the weakest performer, Pandatitan, posted gains above 140%. Community discussions on X and in various groups suggest that many participants now treat Aspecta as a kind of early-stage launchpad, where they rush to buy BuildKeys in initial offerings. Figure 13: Partial Dataset of Listed Assets on Aspecta, Source: Aspecta Official Website, 8 Dec 2025 Since BuildKey offerings usually disclose—in advance—the range of tokens each voucher will be redeemable for (subject to later adjustment), there is real price competition in the pre-market phase. That, however, naturally pulls in speculative flows. In summary, entitlement vouchers currently form the most broadly applicable pre-market mechanism. They work for both large and small teams, and their advantages are clear: relatively unified structure high composability improved liquidity better alignment between what projects want and what users are looking for That said, the industry has not yet converged on a single standard. Different projects define “redeemable rights” in different ways. Aspecta’s BuildKey is one promising template, but whether it becomes a shared standard is still an open question. On the business side, Aspecta charges a 2.5% trading fee on BuildKey transactions [9] , with discounts in some cases, while its pricing framework for project teams remains somewhat flexible. In effect, teams are trading underpriced token rights today for: earlier, market-based price discovery, broader and faster community reach, and stronger wealth effects around their launch. This trade-off helps explain why the model continues to draw both issuers and traders. 4. An Emerging Front: Prediction Markets in Pre-Market Trading Prediction markets are arguably the most experimental part of the current pre-market stack. Unlike voucher models (presales, BuildKeys) that focus on rights, prediction markets use event outcomes as the underlying asset. Participants bet on things like: listing dates, FDV bands, airdrop sizes, unlock schedules, and so on. They do not trade tokens or vouchers directly, but instead express views on future valuation and timing via probabilities and capital flows.That makes them particularly useful for very early-stage projects where tokenomics are still undefined and valuation is fluid. On the time axis, most of the pre-market mechanisms discussed so far appear in the mid-to-late stage of a project, often close to TGE. Prediction markets push price discovery much earlier. While the project is still in the concept or fundraising stage, events can already be created around it, and capital can begin to cluster there. Figure 14: Prediction Events on Monad’s Launch Across Polymarket and Kalshi, Source: Polymarket Analytics, 8 Dec, 2025 Platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi have already listed events tied to high-profile projects like Monad: when they’ll launch and what FDV they might achieve. Both platforms now maintain Pre-Market sections within their crypto categories, focusing on airdrop schedules, TGE timing and valuation bands. One of the most active examples on Polymarket is a market predicting Lighter’s FDV on the day after listing. As of 8 December 2025, cumulative volume in that market had reached about USD 16 million, with the probability of “FDV > USD 1 billion” around 70%, and “FDV > USD 4 billion” roughly 37% [10] . The way capital is distributed across these brackets effectively draws an early valuation curve for the project. From a project team perspective, prediction markets offer a way to collect genuine market signals without having to issue tokens or NFTs. These signals can inform: internal valuation ranges, how much liquidity to seed, and when and how aggressively to run marketing. From a user perspective, prediction markets offer a way to participate in the pre-market without holding any vouchers. Users can express a view on valuation, hedge risk, or position for a potential payoff long before tokens exist. For that reason, prediction markets can be seen as the front-most layer of pre-market trading. Their structures are light-weight, barriers to entry are relatively low, and they bring forward the moment when the market begins to “price” the project. However, they are also highly dependent on oracles and event resolution. Outcomes usually rely on third-party data or team announcements, and in some cases, the same party that creates or promotes an event has influence over its resolution. That opens the door to manipulation and sharp information asymmetries. Recent examples shared by HTX Research highlight this: In November 2025, a rumor spread on X that OpenSea would launch a token before 31 December. The probability of that outcome on Polymarket surged from under 2% to above 30%, only to crash back into single digits after the team denied the rumor. Traders who chased the move based purely on social media headlines suffered heavy losses. In another case, decisions by the Monad team—such as opening the airdrop portal and postponing TGE—directly reshaped market odds, underlining how much control teams have over the underlying events. Some prediction markets also use ambiguous rules. Terms like “launch”, the choice of reference venue for price, or how FDV is calculated can be interpreted multiple ways. Skilled traders can sometimes exploit these grey areas. MetaDAO’s prediction around Solomon’s fundraising size, for example, saw large early bets and abrupt shifts in the final outcome, sparking debate about whether some participants had an information edge. Taken together, these cases suggest that prediction markets today are not yet full-fledged “truth machines” for events. They’re closer to highly specialized betting arenas where those with better information or deeper pockets often have the upper hand. For ordinary participants, that means: carefully checking who created the event and who stands to benefit, reading the rules and resolution criteria in detail, cross-checking information across platforms, and watching on-chain wallet behavior and liquidity flows, before placing sizeable bets. Prediction markets are still valuable as a forward-looking participation channel in the pre-market, but the reliability of their signals will depend on more transparent oracles and gradually more robust governance [11] . IV. Can the Pre-Market Ecosystem Scale? 1. How Big Can It Get? At this point, pre-market trading is no longer a niche corner of the crypto market. It is evolving into a stable and fast-growing segment. Current data indicate that the largest volumes come from three main areas: pre-market perpetual contracts, pre-market spot markets (especially on Binance), and yield-trading protocols that are tightly tied to airdrops (such as Pendle). The most flexible and broadly applicable mechanism remains pre-market OTC, while Aspecta’s rights-voucher model has already exceeded many traditional OTC platforms in both trading volume and wealth effects, making it a new center of growth. Figure 15: Overview of Pre-Market Trading Ecosystem Data, Source: Compiled from Official Websites and Multiple Channels, 16 Nov 2025 According to RootData, between 1 January 2023 and 8 December 2025 there were: 1,351 fundraising rounds of at least USD 3 million for projects that had not yet issued tokens, of which 540 were deals of at least USD 10 million. After removing repeat rounds, there are still hundreds of medium-to-large projects and several dozen true “flagships” (such as Monad) waiting to launch [12] . If we combine those figures with the trading behavior we see in representative names, a big project can easily generate around USD 100 million in pre-market trading. For the very top tier, such as WLFI or Monad, total pre-market turnover can exceed USD 1 billion. In other words, the pre-market has already become a multi-billion-dollar market in its own right, with clear room to expand. Whether it can grow into the tens or hundreds of billions depends less on the number of projects and more on how far it can go along the path of institutionalization and standardization. 2. What Makes Scaling Difficult? Project count alone does not determine how far the pre-market can grow. To move from a few billion dollars in activity to a much larger, durable market, the ecosystem needs to address a more fundamental question: Does the existing pre-market model have enough capacity to bear risk? Looking back across the cases discussed, we find that nearly all pre-market trading structures concentrate risk in two main areas: Market structure risk, and Settlement and information asymmetry. Each of these affects users, project teams, platforms (CEXs, OTC desks, protocols) and market makers in different ways. Type 1: Market Structure Risk By design, pre-market venues tend to have: thinner liquidity, shallower order books, fewer mature market makers, and less robust, multi-source pricing. Prices therefore lean heavily on expectations, not on a well-balanced supply–demand equilibrium. A single large order can move the market, making large swings, slippage spikes and outright manipulation more likely. The Hyperliquid XPL event—where a single whale trade blew the order book out and triggered mass liquidations—is a textbook case. Implications: For users – It becomes harder to judge what a “fair” price is. In violent moves, users can be stopped out or forced to add margin at very unfavorable levels. For project teams – Extreme pricing distorts expectations, can provoke community backlash, and may damage how the project is perceived once it lists. For platforms – Sharp volatility amplifies the strain on risk engines, funding mechanisms and reputational capital. For market makers – Shallow depth and noisy information make it hard to run stable strategies; capital requirements and risk are higher than on established spot or perp markets. Type 2: Settlement Risk and Information Asymmetry The eventual realization of pre-market assets rests, almost entirely, on project teams. Parameters like TGE timing, first-day circulating supply, airdrop rules and distribution pace are often not fully locked in—and may change. Implications: For users – Points, vouchers or pre-market positions that looked promising can suddenly lose value if rules are tweaked, deadlines moved or mechanics rewritten. For project teams – Changing the rules or dragging out settlement can rapidly erode trust, complicate listing negotiations and weaken long-term community cohesion. For platforms – Any default, delay or abrupt rule change by a project is immediately externalized onto the platform. Exchanges or protocols must deal with compensation, PR, risk management and user expectations. For market makers – Because teams hold privileged information about institutional allocations, market-making deals and circulating supply, market makers can be blindsided by sudden changes that alter their risk exposure. It’s also clear that no single actor can fix this—for example, a CEX can’t solve it alone, nor can any one project or user cohort. For pre-market trading to become truly institutional, the industry needs some form of shared governance framework in the pre-issuance phase. In the context of Web3, that is not easy. Openness and pseudonymity give project teams a lot of freedom, and without stronger norms or incentives, soft rugs and last-minute rule changes are likely to persist. Information asymmetry is almost baked into the system. This is why pre-market risk is, at its core, a governance and incentive problem, not just a technical one. Project teams have little natural incentive to accept strict constraints, platforms lack unified standards, and users typically sit at a disadvantage in terms of information. Even so, as pre-market trading continues to move in a more professional direction, a basic consensus is emerging: only when projects, exchanges, on-chain infra providers and market makers work together to establish: clear, verifiable disclosure standards, traceable pricing mechanisms, and enforceable settlement rules can the pre-market evolve from a “black box of trust” into something more structurally transparent. It is a difficult transition, but in the long run, strong economic incentives make it hard to avoid. V. Outlook and Conclusion With funding tougher to secure, TGE timelines stretching out and points-based operations turning into standard practice, the pre-issuance phase is fast becoming a central battleground for project teams, users, and trading platforms. The expansion of the pre-market ecosystem can be read as the overlap of three forces in the same time window: Projects want to raise earlier and build a user base before launch. Users want to lock in upside or manage risk earlier. Platforms and market makers want new entry points for liquidity and price discovery. From a structural angle, the pre-market is evolving along three visible lines: Liquidity and price discovery are shifting earlier in time. For hot projects, pre-market trading volumes, position structures and price gaps are already strong enough to influence first-day performance. In many cases, pre-market prices now function as a de facto opening level, while listing has become primarily a liquidity event. Pre-market assets are becoming more layered and systematized. Products tied to future token value (OTC, pre-market spot, pre-market perps) concentrate price discovery. Points trading and yield-splitting systems carry user incentives and help filter contributions. Voucherized entitlements convert whitelists, allocations and access rights into tradable claims. Collectively, these three paths create a front-loaded market structure that covers: · value validation, · participation stratification, · expectation management, and · early liquidity anchoring. The function of exchanges is being rewritten. Pre-market activity gradually externalizes what used to be the exclusive domain of CEXs—first price, first liquidity, first access—onto on-chain venues, OTC markets and derivative platforms. For exchanges that adapt, this is less a loss of power and more an opportunity to extend their value chain forward into the pre-issuance stage, rather than just competing at listing. Returning to the four guiding questions from the beginning, we can now offer a more concrete set of answers: 1) Is pre-market trading reshaping how projects issue tokens? Answer: Yes—structurally, and likely irreversibly. With funding under pressure, points-based operation becoming the norm and TGE cycles lengthening, projects are moving from a model of “launch token, then start building” to one that looks more like: incentivize → price → issue Pre-market trading lets teams complete user screening, market-based pricing and liquidity warm-up before TGE. Issuance is no longer a single moment but part of a staged process. Launch paths are evolving from one-step issuance into a phased “points → pre-market → TGE” structure. 2) Is pre-market trading changing how exchanges design their listing systems? Answer: Yes—but more by extending them than by replacing them. Pre-market mechanisms do erode exchanges’ exclusive grip on initial price discovery. At the same time, they create space for exchanges to move into earlier stages—the points phase, the voucher phase and the pre-market itself. For CEXs that choose to participate, the pre-market is not simply a threat. It is a way to build a longer value chain, spanning: early user engagement, pre-market matching and risk management, and final settlement and listing. Listing starts to look less like the birth of liquidity and more like a node where prior expectations are crystallized. 3) Does the pre-market have the ingredients to become a scalable “new market”? Answer: The basic shape is there; whether it breaks the scale ceiling depends on institutionalization. Structurally, the pre-market has already moved beyond a single product category: one chain around token expectations, one around assetized points, and one around voucherized rights. Data show that major projects can generate USD 100 million to 1 billion in pre-market trading individually. With hundreds of projects yet to issue, the pre-market is already a stable multi-billion-dollar market. Breaking through into a much larger, durable segment will hinge on building a cross-entity trust framework that can support higher levels of risk. 4) Can users achieve measurable risk–return profiles at earlier stages? Answer: They can—but only if they understand the specific risks of each pre-market product and their own tolerance. Pre-market perps, OTC deals, yield-tokenization (PT/YT) and BuildKey vouchers all allow users to take explicit positions before TGE. Through: price differentials, yield rights, and redemption rights, users can construct quantifiable early exposures rather than relying on vague promises or lottery-style airdrops. This is a big step forward from earlier cycles, where participation before TGE was mostly about interactions or “points farming” with uncertain payoff. Of course, the trade-off is that users must also bear: market structure risk, counterparty and settlement risk, and information asymmetry. Those who understand these trade-offs, size positions carefully and choose venues with stronger governance are better placed to benefit from the shift. Final Thoughts The pre-market is not just another speculative gimmick that will vanish with the next cycle. It is shaping up to be a foundational layer of the Web3 market structure—sitting between primary and secondary, and increasingly integrated into both. It is: reshaping how projects think about launching and distributing tokens, pushing exchanges to rethink their product stacks and timelines, and giving users new ways to participate, for better or worse, earlier in the lifecycle. As standards mature and more robust governance is put in place, it is reasonable to expect the pre-market to evolve from today’s patchwork of platforms and products into a more cohesive, institutionalized “Pre-market” that will be a fixture of the next crypto cycle rather than a footnote.

As a result, Bitcoin is projected to become less volatile, even indicating that it has demonstrated lower volatility than tech giant Nvidia throughout 2025. The report also expresses strong optimism for Ethereum and Solana, particularly contingent upon the passing of the CLARITY Act. Bitwise believes that the growth of stablecoins and tokenization represents significant “megatrends,” with both Ethereum and Solana positioned to be the primary beneficiaries of this trend. ETFs To Acquire New Market Supply Institutional demand is forecasted to surge, with ETFs expected to acquire more than 100% of the new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. By 2026, Bitwise expects that most institutional investors will have access to crypto ETFs. As Bitwise projects the new supply hitting the market, estimates indicate roughly 166,000 Bitcoin valued at $15.3 billion, 960,000 Ethereum around $3.0 billion, and 23 million Solana coins amounting to $3.2 billion. However, the firm anticipates that ETFs will likely purchase even more than these figures suggest. The report further highlights that crypto equities are expected to outperform traditional tech stocks. While tech shares have surged by 140% over the past three years, crypto equities have significantly outpaced them. The Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, which tracks companies providing crucial infrastructure and services for crypto assets, has rocketed by 585% during the same time frame. Bitwise believes this momentum will persist into 2026, driven by potential revenue growth, mergers and acquisitions, and a favorable regulatory landscape. Stablecoins As Scapegoats For Economic Woes As stablecoins gain traction, Bitwise cautions that they may become scapegoats for destabilizing emerging market currencies. Currently valued at nearly $300 billion, the market for stablecoins, which include tokenized versions of the US dollar like USDT and USDC, is predicted to reach $500 billion by the end of 2026. With this rise, it’s anticipated that one or two countries may blame stablecoins for their financial troubles, despite the reality that people would not turn to stablecoins if their local currencies were stable.

This regulatory clarity sets the stage for what Bitwise dubs “ETF-palooza” in 2026. Lastly, the firm predicts that half of Ivy League endowments will likely invest in cryptocurrencies, and that on-chain vault assets under management will double in the coming years. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $86,165, having recorded major losses of 2% and almost 7% over the past 24 hours and seven days respectively. Currently, the leading crypto is trading 31.8% below its all-time high of $126,000.

According to Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer at Arca, this is precisely the situation with Bitcoin investment today. While decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenization transform finance, Wall Street maintains a surprisingly narrow focus. Why Is Bitcoin Investment Wall Street’s Sole Crypto Focus? Jeff Dorman identifies a significant disconnect in how traditional finance views blockchain technology. He notes that Wall Street and fintech firms actively participate in issuing new digital assets like stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. However, they treat these as fee-generating products rather than investment opportunities. The actual Bitcoin investment conversation dominates institutional discussions, leaving other blockchain sectors virtually ignored. This creates a curious paradox. Financial giants build infrastructure for a broader crypto ecosystem while their capital remains concentrated in one asset. Dorman explains that large banks and institutional investors aren’t even asking which other tokens might hold value. Research and investment solicitation for assets beyond Bitcoin barely exist in traditional finance circles. What Growth Sectors Are Institutions Missing? While institutions maintain their Bitcoin investment focus, several blockchain sectors demonstrate remarkable expansion: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Protocols enabling lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: Converting physical assets like real estate and commodities into digital tokens Stablecoin Ecosystems: Dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies facilitating global payments and settlements These sectors aren’t just theoretical concepts. They’re experiencing what Dorman calls “explosive growth” with real adoption metrics and revenue generation. Yet institutional capital remains largely absent from direct investment in these areas. How Does This Focus Impact Crypto Markets? The institutional Bitcoin investment concentration creates several market dynamics. First, it means Bitcoin receives disproportionate attention and capital compared to other crypto assets. This can lead to valuation disparities where Bitcoin’s market dominance doesn’t necessarily reflect relative utility or growth potential. Second, it creates opportunity for early investors in other blockchain sectors. While institutions focus solely on Bitcoin, savvy investors can potentially identify value in overlooked areas of the crypto ecosystem. However, this also means these sectors develop with less institutional oversight and potentially greater volatility. What Could Change Wall Street’s Perspective? Several developments might broaden institutional Bitcoin investment focus: Regulatory clarity for non-Bitcoin crypto assets Demonstrable returns from DeFi and tokenization investments Mainstream adoption forcing institutions to engage with broader crypto ecosystems Educational initiatives highlighting diversification benefits within blockchain Dorman suggests that currently, institutions view Bitcoin as a “safe” crypto exposure while considering other blockchain investments too complex or risky. This mindset may shift as these technologies mature and demonstrate sustained value creation. Conclusion: Beyond the Bitcoin Investment Mindset The Arca CIO’s observations reveal a crucial inflection point for cryptocurrency adoption. While Bitcoin serves as a gateway for institutional crypto exposure, it represents just one facet of blockchain’s transformative potential. The growing disconnect between Bitcoin-focused investment strategies and the broader industry’s development suggests either a massive oversight or a timing discrepancy in institutional adoption. As DeFi, tokenization, and stablecoins continue their explosive growth, pressure may build for Wall Street to expand its crypto perspective. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin has investment merit, but whether institutions can afford to ignore the rest of the blockchain revolution while focusing exclusively on one digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions Why do institutions focus only on Bitcoin investment? Institutions view Bitcoin as a simpler, more established crypto asset with clearer regulatory treatment. They often consider other blockchain investments too complex or risky for their current frameworks. What sectors are growing despite being ignored by Wall Street? Decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset tokenization, and stablecoin ecosystems are experiencing explosive growth with minimal institutional investment participation. How does this Bitcoin investment focus affect crypto markets? It creates valuation disparities and opportunity for early investors in overlooked sectors. Bitcoin receives disproportionate capital while other innovations develop with less institutional oversight. Could Wall Street’s perspective change? Yes, regulatory clarity, demonstrated returns from other blockchain sectors, and mainstream adoption could broaden institutional investment beyond Bitcoin. What should investors consider given this situation? Investors might benefit from researching blockchain sectors beyond Bitcoin while recognizing that institutional focus could shift, potentially affecting valuations across the crypto ecosystem. Is Bitcoin still a good investment despite this narrow focus? Bitcoin remains a significant crypto asset, but investors should understand that institutional concentration creates both stability and potential blind spots regarding broader blockchain innovation.

A car accident can have both immediate and far-reaching consequences. It can bring physical injuries, mental and emotional stress, loss of finances, and complications in insurance and legal matters. While seeking medical attention and reporting to the police are the first steps in the first few hours following an accident, the following process involves contacting your insurance provider to determine the best course of action to obtain help and justice. Between enormous paperwork and phone calls, it is common for most claimants to make mistakes that turn out to be grave in the long run. Here’s how to deal with your insurance provider smartly and get the most out of your claim. Report the Accident Promptly Understandably, you need some time to get out of the confusion and anxiety an accident leaves you with. However, it is also crucial to report the accident promptly and accurately. The longer you delay, the greater the risk to your claim will be. Also, ensure that you stick to the basic facts as accurately as possible. These are the when, where, and how of the accident. Avoid disclosing unnecessary details, as this can lead to disputes about who is at fault. Do Not Rush into Recording a Statement Know for sure that the insurance adjusters will ask you to record your statement. While this is not wrong and might be a part of their routine task, a recording done in haste or when you are not mentally stable can be turned against you. It can be used to minimize your claim. Remember that you can politely decline to record the statement until you understand the situation fully or have one of the best car accident attorneys San Diego to defend your claim. Record Every Detail There is no doubt that the insurance providers are there to help you out. However, it is also your responsibility to ensure that the details of every interaction are accurately recorded. Note things like the dates and times of calls and emails, the names of the insurance adjusters you speak with, and even copies of letters, repair estimates, and medical bills. This paper trail will help you as well as your lawyer in strengthening your claim, especially when there is a dispute. Do Not Settle Too Quickly Claiming insurance, legal processes, and the trauma of an accident can make you feel tired. In such a situation, you might just feel like closing the deal with whatever early settlements you are offered. But, often, these will not be enough to cover your medical expenses, car repair costs, loss of pay, and most importantly, emotional distress. Having professionals from agencies like the hhjtrialattorneys.com will help you stay calm and not settle for anything less. Last but not least, protect your peace of mind when you get into this process with the insurance providers. The calmer you are, the higher your potential to deal with the crisis and come out victorious. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As many as 400,000 mining machines have already gone offline, causing a slump in hashrates. Bitcoin is going down because selling pressure is stronger and coming from deeper sources, said analyst Bull Theory on Wednesday. “One major reason is China’s mining crackdown coming back into focus,” they added . Network hashrate has dropped by around 8%, which is a large move considering that China still controls roughly 14% of global hash power, they observed. Asian Whales Selling BTC The analyst added that Asian OG holders likely began selling weeks ago in anticipation of renewed restrictions, and on-chain data confirms increased long-term holder selling over the past couple of months. There has also been a miner capitulation as closed mining farms must sell BTC reserves and equipment to cover their losses. Additionally, Asian exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX show consistent net spot selling through Q4, while US exchanges such as Coinbase show continued net buying, they added. “This is not panic selling. This is supply changing hands. And price usually stays weak until that pressure is gone.” WHY IS BITCOIN STILL DUMPING WHILE INSTITUTIONS ARE MAKING BILLION DOLLAR BUYS? Bitcoin is not going down because fundamentals are weak. It is going down because selling pressure is stronger and coming from deeper sources. One major reason is China’s mining crackdown coming… pic.twitter.com/QBAG8PKAKh — Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio) December 17, 2025 Bitcoin’s hashrate has dropped 10% from around 1,160 EH/s in October to ~1,045 EH/s in December, marking three consecutive negative difficulty adjustments, reported Luxor on Wednesday. They noted that the trend was driven by three factors: “Declining Bitcoin prices pushing legacy hardware into negative margins, regional enforcement actions removing capacity from major mining regions, and rising winter energy costs triggering seasonal curtailment across North America.” This decline in hashrate is driven by a convergence of price compression, seasonal energy costs, and targeted regulatory pressure, which are all squeezing marginal miners simultaneously. Additionally, hashprice, which quantifies the amount a miner can expect to earn from a specific quantity of hashrate, is at an all-time low of $0.036 per terahash per second per day, according to Luxor. Diminishing returns and increasing costs put more pressure on miners to sell. BTC Continues to Fall Bitcoin is bearing the brunt of this hashrate slump as it continues to weaken. Aside from another manipulated pump-and-dump by derivatives degens, the asset is down on the day, having failed to reclaim $87,000.

In a series of recent statements on X, Buterin underscored that while Ethereum operates without centralized control, its growing architectural complexity risks placing implicit trust in a small circle of experts rather than in the protocol itself. “An important and underrated form of trustlessness is increasing the number of people who can actually understand the whole protocol from top to bottom,” he wrote. Traditionally, blockchain trustlessness means that users don’t have to place faith in intermediaries — such as servers or developers — because the rules are enforced by open-source code and decentralized consensus. However, Buterin warns that if only a handful of developers can genuinely grasp the full stack, users still end up trusting that inner circle. To address this, developers are also exploring technologically “stateless clients” and node-lightening schemes, allowing participants to engage without storing any portion of the entire blockchain state, thereby reducing the hardware barrier to participation and centralization. Buterin advocates for radical simplification and trustless design Buterin is calling for radical simplification and trustless design, which can be strengthened by reducing its dependency on specialized mechanisms and standardized key protocol features that can be audited and modified by new entrants. Just last year, Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation published an on-chain “Trustless Manifesto” that explicitly asserts a reluctance for developers to sacrifice decentralization for the sake of convenience. The manifesto also issues a warning that benevolent shortcuts, such as default reliance on hosted nodes or centralized relayers, will, over time, gradually erode the integrity of a permissionless network. It calls on builders to create systems in which everyone can verify protocol rules, and no one holds crucial secrets or assumes the role of an irreplaceable intermediary. The conversations in the industry are not limited to Layer‑2 designs either. Buterin suggests that developers optimize Layer-2 protocols by heavily relying on Ethereum’s base layer for security and decentralization, without reusing complex logic from one chain to another. By minimizing their efforts in this way, much of the system’s complexity is simplified, and the performance overhead falls dramatically. Ethereum roadmap boosts usability and simplifies the network Ethereum’s official roadmap supports these simplification goals with scaling and usability evolution. That said, evolving smart contract wallets that hide gas fees and key management are helping the network connections more closely resemble what a web-based app looks like. The players in the market have also been focusing on similar upgrades, such as enhancing blob throughput and implementing Peer-to-Peer Data Availability Sampling ( PeerDAS ), which increases the throughput of transactions for nodes, thereby improving the transaction throughput performance over a node. From a usability perspective, “stateless” client structures and lightweight protocol components could lower the costs associated with running nodes (which are an essential aspect of decentralization). While pure statelessness remains a foreseeable project, milestones such as Verkle Trees and data compression techniques are already being tested and implemented. They could eventually lighten some of the load on node operators, allowing more participants to verify the blockchain autonomously.

Founder Hayden Adams has announced the final Uniswap governance vote on a proposal that could reshape the token’s future. This historic vote, dubbed “UNIFICation,” centers on burning a massive 100 million UNI and activating a new fee mechanism. For UNI holders and DeFi enthusiasts, this is a pivotal moment that demands attention. What Does the Final Uniswap Governance Vote Entail? The proposal now before voters contains two critical components. First, it authorizes the immediate burning of 100 million UNI tokens from the treasury. Second, it activates a fee switch on the Ethereum mainnet Uniswap protocol. This mechanism would collect fees, which would then also be destined for burning. The voting window is tight, running from 1:30 a.m. UTC on December 20 until December 25. Why Is This UNI Burn Proposal So Significant? This Uniswap governance vote represents a major shift in tokenomics. Burning 100 million UNI reduces the total supply, a move often associated with creating scarcity. Furthermore, the perpetual fee-burning mechanism aims to align the protocol’s revenue more directly with token value. The community’s approval would signal a strong desire for a more deflationary and value-accruing model for the UNI token. However, the decision is not without debate. Proponents argue it makes UNI more valuable for holders. Critics may question the reduction of the treasury or the potential impacts of the fee switch. This final vote is the culmination of extensive community discussion, making it a true test of decentralized governance. How Could This Vote Impact UNI Holders and DeFi? The outcome of this Uniswap governance vote carries weight for several reasons: Token Scarcity: Burning a large portion of the supply could positively influence UNI’s price over the long term by reducing sell pressure. Protocol Sustainability: Activating fees creates a new revenue model, potentially funding future development and grants. Governance Precedent: A successful vote reinforces Uniswap’s role as a leader in decentralized, community-led decision-making. Market Sentiment: The crypto market often views token burns as a bullish signal, which could improve overall sentiment around UNI. This vote is more than a single decision; it’s a statement about the future direction of the world’s largest decentralized exchange. The community’s choice will set a powerful precedent for how DeFi protocols manage their treasuries and create value for token holders. What’s Next After the Uniswap Governance Vote? Once the vote concludes on December 25, the focus will shift to implementation. If passed, the Uniswap team will execute the burn and deploy the necessary smart contract changes to activate the fee mechanism. The entire process will be transparent and on-chain, allowing anyone to verify the actions. This event will likely be studied as a landmark case in DAO governance and tokenomics design for years to come. In conclusion, the final Uniswap governance vote on burning 100 million UNI is a defining moment. It demonstrates the power of decentralized communities to steer major financial protocols. The decision will influence not just UNI’s value, but also the broader narrative around utility and value accrual in governance tokens. All eyes are now on the Uniswap community as they cast their historic votes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the “UNIFICation” proposal? The UNIFICation proposal is a Uniswap governance initiative to burn 100 million UNI tokens from the treasury and activate a fee-collection mechanism on the mainnet, with collected fees also being burned. Who can participate in the Uniswap governance vote? Any address holding UNI tokens can delegate them to vote on the proposal. The voting power is proportional to the amount of UNI delegated. When does the voting period end? The final vote runs from 1:30 a.m. UTC on December 20, 2023, and concludes on December 25, 2023. What happens if the proposal passes? If passed, the 100 million UNI burn will be executed, and the fee switch will be activated on the Ethereum mainnet, creating a new, continuous burning mechanism for protocol fees. How does burning tokens affect UNI’s price? Burning tokens reduces the total circulating supply. In theory, if demand remains constant or increases, this scarcity can create upward pressure on the token’s price over time. Where can I track the live results of the vote? You can track the vote live on the official Uniswap governance portal or on various blockchain explorers and DeFi analytics websites that monitor governance proposals.

According to live market data from Bitcoin World, BTC has surged above $87,000 , trading at this level on major exchanges like Binance. This significant Bitcoin price surge marks a pivotal moment, capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide. What’s driving this powerful rally, and what could it mean for the future? Let’s dive in. What’s Behind the Latest Bitcoin Price Surge? The jump past $87,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to fuel this upward momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to build a stronger foundation for Bitcoin. Major financial firms are integrating crypto services, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value. Finally, positive sentiment across the broader crypto ecosystem creates a tailwind for the entire market. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a combination of technical strength and fundamental confidence. The market has broken through previous resistance levels, which can trigger further buying from algorithmic traders and momentum investors. Moreover, the network’s underlying security and limited supply of 21 million coins provide a compelling long-term narrative that supports price appreciation during periods of high demand. How Significant is the $87,000 Level for BTC? Reaching and holding above $87,000 is psychologically and technically important for Bitcoin. It represents a new zone in its price discovery phase, moving beyond previous all-time highs. For traders, this level acts as a key benchmark. A sustained move above it could open the path toward the next major targets, while a failure to hold might indicate a period of consolidation. Consider the immediate implications of this Bitcoin price surge: Investor Confidence: New highs often renew interest and attract capital from both retail and institutional players. Market Sentiment: A bullish breakout improves overall sentiment across altcoins and the DeFi sector. Media Attention: Mainstream financial news coverage increases, bringing Bitcoin to a wider audience. What Should Investors Consider Now? While the current Bitcoin price surge is exhilarating, a prudent approach is essential. Markets move in cycles, and volatility remains a defining characteristic of cryptocurrency. Investors should assess their own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Is this a short-term trade or part of a long-term holding strategy? Diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investing, even within the crypto asset class. For those watching this Bitcoin price surge, here are actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price movement or hype. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for significant price swings in both directions. Secure Your Assets: If you hold BTC, ensure it’s stored in a secure wallet, not just on an exchange. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin The breakthrough above $87,000 sets a new stage for Bitcoin. The focus now shifts to whether it can consolidate these gains and build support at higher levels. Key developments to watch include regulatory clarity from major economies, further institutional product launches like spot Bitcoin ETFs, and advancements in the Bitcoin network itself, such as the ongoing development of layer-2 solutions. Each of these factors can influence the next chapter of the Bitcoin price surge narrative. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent past $87,000 is a powerful testament to its growing role in the global financial landscape. This Bitcoin price surge highlights the asset’s resilience and its increasing adoption. However, the journey is far from over. The crypto market is dynamic, and staying informed is crucial for navigating its opportunities and challenges. This milestone is a significant marker on a much longer road. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused Bitcoin to rise above $87,000? The rally is likely driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional investment, positive market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets, and technical breakout momentum. Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after this price surge? Investment timing is personal and depends on your strategy. While buying at all-time highs carries risk, many investors use dollar-cost averaging (investing fixed amounts regularly) to mitigate timing risk over the long term. Could the price drop back down quickly? Yes, cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Sharp rallies can be followed by corrections. Investors should be prepared for potential downside and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Where is the best place to track the Bitcoin price? Reputable cryptocurrency data websites and exchanges like Binance, CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko provide real-time price tracking and market analysis. Does this price surge affect other cryptocurrencies? Often, yes. A strong Bitcoin rally can lift the entire crypto market, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” However, altcoins can also decouple and move independently based on their own news and developments. What’s the next major price target for BTC? Market analysts watch various resistance levels. While some may look toward $90,000 or $100,000 as psychological barriers, predictions vary widely and the market is ultimately unpredictable. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price surge helpful?

Find Out Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-investors-rough-week-ahead-find-out-why/,"Crypto commentator Austin Hilton has outlined a restrained outlook for XRP in the days ahead, emphasizing that broader macroeconomic developments are likely to dominate market behavior rather than any asset-specific catalyst. According to his assessment, the week is unlikely to deliver meaningful upside for XRP and may instead be characterized by mild downside pressure. He explained that current conditions point to limited price movement as traders and institutions wait for key economic signals before making decisive moves. Hilton noted that XRP has recently been trading around the $1.98 to $1.99 range and appears to have established support at that level. In his view, unless an unexpected negative event occurs, the asset is not showing signs of structural weakness. However, this stability does not suggest that a near-term rally is likely, as overall market conditions are expected to keep risk-taking limited in the short term. XRP – Rough Week Ahead. Find Out Why… pic.twitter.com/pv4R6o1Vzl — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 15, 2025 Impact of U.S. Economic Data Releases A major factor contributing to this cautious outlook is the release of several U.S. government economic reports scheduled for the early part of the week. Hilton highlighted employment data and the Consumer Price Index as particularly important, noting that markets tend to remain hesitant ahead of such releases. These reports, some of which were delayed due to a prior government shutdown, are expected to shape short-term sentiment across both traditional and digital asset markets. Until clarity emerges from these data points, Hilton suggested that the cryptocurrency market, including XRP, is likely to experience modest volatility with a slight bearish bias. In his assessment, traders are unlikely to commit to aggressive positions before understanding how inflation and labor market trends may influence monetary policy expectations. Bank of Japan Decision and Global Liquidity Concerns Looking beyond midweek data, Hilton identified the Bank of Japan’s policy decision scheduled for Friday, December 19, as the most significant event on the horizon. He drew attention to the potential adjustment of Japanese interest rates and implications for the yen carry trade, a long-standing strategy that has historically provided liquidity to global risk markets. He explained that borrowing at near-zero rates in Japan and reallocating capital into higher-yielding assets such as equities and crypto has been common for decades. A rate increase would effectively reverse part of this process, forcing some investors to exit positions and raise liquidity. Hilton referenced July 2024, when a similar policy move coincided with a sharp decline across digital assets, including XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The magnitude of any rate hike, whether 25, 50, or 75 basis points, was presented as a critical variable. A larger increase would, in his view, heighten the risk of sell-offs across both Wall Street and crypto markets. Potential Downside and Investor Positioning While acknowledging the possibility of XRP declining toward the mid-$1 range if broader selling pressure emerges, Hilton stressed that such a move would be driven by macro-induced liquidation rather than weaknesses specific to XRP itself. He framed any sharp pullback as a reaction to global liquidity shifts rather than a reassessment of the asset’s longer-term outlook. Overall, Hilton characterized the coming days as a period of patience rather than action, urging close attention to economic developments that are likely to shape short-term price behavior.

According to the Nasdaq-listed company’s press statement released Tuesday, its digital asset arm, Vivo Federation, entered into a definitive joint venture agreement with Lean Ventures, a licensed South Korean asset manager headquartered in Seoul. The agreement will see Lean Ventures arrange the creation of a dedicated investment vehicle to acquire and hold an initial target of $300 million worth of private Ripple Labs shares. The vehicle is reportedly meant for institutional and qualified retail investors in the XRP-favored South Korean crypto market. VivoPower said Lean Ventures has already canvassed interest among potential investors in the country. That outreach may include K-Weather, a South Korean firm that entered into a heads-of-agreement with VivoPower in early November to acquire an initial 20% stake. The sustainable energy B corporation told reporters it is in the final stages of due diligence on that transaction. VivoPower Lean Ventures’ joint venture plan for XRP-linked exposure In its statement , VivoPower explained that the proposed investment vehicle will not directly purchase XRP tokens, although it will hold equity in Ripple Labs, whose business and balance sheet are affiliated with the XRP ecosystem. Based on current XRP prices, VivoPower estimates that the planned $300 million Ripple Labs share position is equivalent to roughly 450 million XRP tokens, which could translate to a valuation of about $900 million at prevailing market conditions. Lean Ventures is expected to source the Ripple Labs shares through Vivo Federation. VivoPower said it has already received approval from Ripple to acquire an initial tranche of preferred shares and is negotiating for more purchases from existing institutional shareholders. “We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with Lean Ventures, given its established status and reputation in South Korea. As we have noted previously, South Korea is a highly strategic market for Vivo Federation, given that it is the largest holder by value and number of XRP tokens in the world.” Adam Traidman, chairman of VivoPower’s advisory council Traidman continued to say that the vehicle will help South Koreans acquire Ripple Labs shares and, by extension, XRP at a discount. “With this dedicated investment vehicle, qualifying South Korean institutional and retail investors can gain exposure to Ripple Labs shares and, in turn, XRP at a material discount to the spot price,” he concluded. Managing partner of Lean Ventures Chris Kim reiterated that the demand for such exposure has been building over the years, owing to the growing appetite South Korea has for Ripple’s products. In June, VivoPower raised $121 million in a private placement led by Saudi investor Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud. The funding made the company one of the first listed firms to base its treasury on XRP instead of popular choices Bitcoin or Ether. The energy solutions firm has deployed XRP into yield-generating structures, including a $100 million allocation through Flare’s FAssets system, and has also adopted Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for its treasury operations. Ripple expands footprint in Asia and Europe Away from VivoPower’s XRP treasury and Ripple Labs stock ambitions, SBI Ripple Asia signed a memorandum of understanding with Doppler Finance on Wednesday to become an institutional custodian of the token’s segregated custody for its clients’ assets. SBI Ripple Asia, which is regulated by Singapore’s Monetary Authority, said it would add XRP-based yield products and real-world asset tokenization on the XRP Ledger as part of the collaboration. “This collaboration is about expanding XRP’s role beyond payments and positioning it as a productive, yield-bearing asset.” Doppler’s head of institutions. An SBI Ripple Asia spokesperson said the partnership could speed up the development of secure and transparent yield infrastructure on the XRPL by combining Doppler’s on-chain framework with SBI’s experience in digital asset adoption for Asian markets. Cryptopolitan also reported earlier this week that Ripple has partnered with Amina Bank AG, a Swiss institution regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. Amina Bank will become the first European bank to use Ripple’s licensed end-to-end payments network.

According to Ripple Executive Jack McDonald, “I’m excited to celebrate the one-year anniversary of $RLUSD – we’ve gone from 0 to a top 5 USD stablecoin in record time.” The journey so far has been defined by strong adoption, regulatory milestones, and innovative institutional integrations. $1 Billion Market Cap Milestone In November 2025, RLUSD crossed a $1 billion market cap, marking one of the fastest rises among regulated stablecoins. This milestone highlights strong market confidence and growing demand for a compliant, reliable digital dollar. Investors and institutions increasingly rely on RLUSD as a stable, secure, and scalable medium for digital transactions. Compliance as a Core Pillar Compliance is central to RLUSD’s strategy. With conditional approval from the OCC and an existing NYDFS license, RLUSD operates under dual regulatory oversight, positioning it as an enterprise-grade stablecoin for institutional adoption. By combining regulatory rigor with transparency, Ripple is redefining standards for the next generation of digital assets. Bridging Real-World Assets (RWAs) RLUSD is redefining institutional finance by serving as a 24/7 off-ramp for tokenized assets like BlackRock BUIDL and VanEck VBILL via Securitize, boosting liquidity and efficiency for large-scale investors. Partnerships with DBS Bank and Franklin Templeton facilitate repo trades for tokenized money market funds, bridging traditional capital markets and blockchain solutions. RLUSD is proving itself not just as a stablecoin, but as a functional gateway to the next generation of institutional finance. Looking Ahead As RLUSD marks this milestone, it doubles down on innovation, regulatory compliance, and broadening its utility for retail and institutional users. Its rapid first-year growth underscores the stablecoin’s potential to transform global digital dollar usage. Anchored in trust, transparency, and technology, RLUSD sets a new standard for regulated stablecoins and paves the way for mainstream adoption. Conclusion In its first year, RLUSD has surpassed a $1 billion market cap, entered the top-5 stablecoins, and forged key institutional partnerships, setting a new benchmark for regulated digital finance. By blending compliance, trust, and real-world utility, RLUSD is proving that stablecoins are more than payment tools, they’re bridges between traditional markets and the blockchain economy. With this foundation, RLUSD is poised to accelerate mainstream adoption, transform institutional engagement with digital assets, and shape the future of global finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-18 09:04:28

The clearance follows months of regulatory review and deepens Coinbase’s partnership with India’s largest digital asset platform. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal called the approval an “ important regulatory milestone ” that strengthens Coinbase’s long-term commitment to CoinDCX, which now serves over 20.4 million users across India and the UAE with more than $1.2 billion in assets under custody. The investment builds on Coinbase’s initial backing of CoinDCX in 2020 and comes after the Indian exchange faced significant security challenges earlier this year. We appreciate the Competition Commission of India approval of our proposal to acquire a minority stake in @CoinDCX , marking an important regulatory milestone and deepening Coinbase’s long-term partnership with one of India’s most established and trusted digital asset platforms. pic.twitter.com/IzTmJkyO7u — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 17, 2025 Recovery Following $44 Million Security Breach The approval arrives seven months after CoinDCX suffered a major hack that compromised $44 million from an internal liquidity account. Cybersecurity firm Cyvers linked the July incident to North Korea’s Lazarus Group , noting the attack followed the same pattern as the $234 million WazirX breach that occurred exactly one year earlier. Hackers executed the theft in just five minutes across seven rapid transactions, siphoning funds after conducting test transactions days earlier. Indian police later arrested a CoinDCX software engineer whose compromised credentials allegedly enabled the breach. However, the employee claimed that hackers exploited his system while he worked as a freelancer using company equipment. CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta confirmed customer funds remained secure throughout the incident and launched a recovery bounty program offering up to 25% of retrieved assets, potentially worth $11 million. Coinbase explicitly referenced the breach in its investment statement, writing that CoinDCX’s response to challenges “ only strengthened our conviction in their team and platform. “ Strategic Positioning in Key Growth Markets The investment reinforces Coinbase’s presence in India and the Middle East, following CoinDCX’s acquisition of Dubai-based BitOasis last year. Coinbase described both regions as “ top regions for crypto growth ” driven by high adoption rates, supportive regulation, and substantial economic potential. Gupta said the fresh capital would accelerate new product launches across the Web3 ecosystem while enabling market expansion and enhanced security infrastructure. He called the investment “ more than just capital ,” adding that “ it’s a deep vote of confidence in our mission, approach, and team. “ The funding comes as Coinbase simultaneously reopened direct operations in India following a two-year hiatus, now offering crypto-to-crypto trading with plans to integrate rupee deposits by 2026. Coinbase returns to India after two-year absence, with plans to introduce rupee deposits and fiat trading by 2026. #Coinbase #India https://t.co/xTgnD4Ux9I — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 8, 2025 The company’s return required full regulatory compliance after suspending services in 2023, when payment processors blocked its access to the Unified Payments Interface. John O’Loghlen, Coinbase’s Asia-Pacific director, explained that forcing existing customers to close their accounts ran counter to typical business strategy but established a clean regulatory slate. Coinbase subsequently secured Financial Intelligence Unit registration alongside competitors, including Binance, KuCoin, and Bybit, all of which faced similar regulatory obstacles before paying penalties and resuming operations. Broader Strategic Expansion Beyond India The CoinDCX deal strengthens Coinbase’s foothold in a market where citizens hold approximately $4.5 billion in digital assets , despite restrictive tax policies, including a 30% profit levy and a mandatory 1% transaction tax. India consistently ranks among the top countries in global crypto adoption indices, though the Reserve Bank continues to oppose cryptocurrencies due to financial stability concerns. Coinbase now employs over 500 people across India while continuing to hire for both domestic and international operations. Grewal recently joined the US-India Business Council board to strengthen bilateral commercial relationships. The CoinDCX investment aligns with Coinbase’s broader expansion into new product categories and markets.

According to a December 17 announcement , Coinbase has introduced a number of new features, including stock trading and access to prediction markets, among other additions. Stock trading goes live on the Coinbase app Stock trading is initially being rolled out to US users, who can buy, sell, and manage individual stocks alongside exchange-traded funds directly on the app using both US dollars and USDC. Coinbase users will have the option to use either fiat or USDC directly from their existing Coinbase account. The offering features zero trading commissions and lets users buy and sell stocks five days a week, even outside traditional market hours. Initially, the platform will support a limited number of stocks, and the exchange plans to add thousands of additional stocks over the coming months, the announcement said. “This is a major milestone in our plan to enable 24/7 trading of stocks and ETFs from anywhere in the world, powered by crypto,” Coinbase head of consumer and business products Max Branzburg said while announcing the rollout during its year-end conference held the same day. As part of future plans, Coinbase intends to enable 24/7 tokenized equity exposure through Coinbase Tokenize, a new institutional platform, while there are also plans to introduce stock-linked perpetual contracts set for early next year. Predictions market and other updates Coinbase also rolled out a prediction market powered by Kalshi that will allow users to trade outcomes of real-world events directly from the main app. Users will have access to event contracts for topics such as elections, sports, and macroeconomic data, with plans to support additional platforms in the future. Besides these, Coinbase has also added other advanced trading features like futures and perpetual futures under a simplified interface integrated into the core app. Further, Solana-based token swaps are now available on Coinbase’s main app as part of the exchange’s DEX trading expansion. To support this, Coinbase has integrated Jupiter, Solana’s leading DEX aggregator, allowing users to swap Solana tokens securely without leaving the app. Simultaneously, Coinbase Business, a crypto-native financial suite for startups and small businesses, has been made available in the US and Singapore. Coinbase shares initially closed down more than 3 percent but recovered slightly in after-hours trading as markets digested the broader rollout. These recent launches fit directly into Coinbase’s strategy to evolve into an “everything app” that can eventually replace traditional financial institutions. CEO Brian Armstrong has reiterated on several occasions that the company ultimately wants to “be a bank replacement for people.” Coinbase expands in India Against this backdrop, Coinbase has continued to expand its global footprint and recently sharpened its focus on the Indian market. After nearly two years of regulatory pause , the exchange reopened access for Indian users earlier this month. It has also made a fresh investment in CoinDCX and was recently given the green light by India’s competition regulator to proceed with its minority stake acquisition.

A significant on-chain movement has caught the attention of cryptocurrency analysts. The Sign team deposits a substantial $9.3 million worth of SIGN tokens to Binance, according to data from Onchain School. This transaction, occurring amidst an 8% price surge, raises critical questions about the team’s intentions and the token’s immediate future. Let’s decode what this major move could signal for the market. What Do the Sign Team Deposits to Binance Actually Mean? When a project team moves a large volume of tokens to an exchange, the market often interprets it as a potential prelude to selling. This is because exchanges provide the liquidity needed to convert tokens into other cryptocurrencies or fiat money. However, it’s not always a straightforward sell signal. The Sign team deposits could also represent preparation for: Liquidity Provision: Adding tokens to exchange pools to improve trading depth. Ecosystem Funding: Allocating resources for partnerships, marketing, or development expenses. Vesting Schedule: Releasing tokens according to a pre-planned, transparent unlock timetable. Therefore, while caution is warranted, context is king. The transaction’s timing, relative to the token’s vesting schedule and recent project announcements, is crucial for accurate interpretation. Analyzing the Market Context of the SIGN Token The deposit news broke as SIGN’s price showed notable strength, trading at $0.03202—an increase of over 8% according to CoinMarketCap. This creates a fascinating juxtaposition: bullish price action alongside a potentially bearish on-chain signal. Such divergence often leads to increased market volatility as traders weigh short-term momentum against long-term supply concerns. For retail investors, this highlights the importance of monitoring both price charts and blockchain explorers. A team’s wallet activity can provide early clues about future price pressure that may not yet be reflected in the order books. How Should Investors Respond to Major Team Deposits? Navigating news of large Sign team deposits requires a balanced strategy. First, avoid panic selling based solely on this single data point. Instead, investigate the project’s official communication channels for any statements regarding treasury management or token unlocks. Second, review the token’s overall circulating supply. A $9.3 million deposit is more significant for a low-market-cap token than for a top-tier asset. Finally, consider setting prudent stop-loss orders if you are holding SIGN, as exchange inflows can sometimes precede short-term price corrections, even in a broader uptrend. The Bigger Picture: Transparency and Trust in Crypto This event underscores a central tenet of cryptocurrency investing: transparency builds trust. Projects that proactively communicate their treasury strategies and token release schedules typically foster stronger, more resilient communities. When a team makes a major move like the recent Sign team deposits , a clear, timely explanation can mitigate uncertainty and speculative fear. For the Sign project, this is a pivotal moment. How they address community questions about this deposit will be just as important as the transaction itself. Proactive communication can turn a potential negative into a demonstration of responsible governance. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Information The Sign team deposits of $9.3 million to Binance is a significant on-chain event that demands attention but not alarm. While exchange deposits can indicate upcoming selling pressure, they are not a guaranteed sell signal. Savvy investors will use this information as one piece of a larger puzzle, combining it with project fundamentals, market trends, and official communications. In the dynamic world of crypto, informed caution consistently outperforms reactive fear. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does a team deposit to an exchange always mean they will sell? A: Not always. While it is a common precursor to selling, teams also deposit tokens for liquidity provision, operational expenses, or to fulfill vesting schedules. Context from official announcements is key. Q: Why did the SIGN price go up if this is potentially bearish news? A> Cryptocurrency markets can react to multiple factors simultaneously. The price increase may be driven by broader market trends, positive project developments, or short-term trading activity that hasn’t yet factored in the deposit news. Q: Where can I track these kinds of on-chain transactions myself? A> You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan (for Ethereum-based tokens) or BscScan (for BNB Chain) to track wallet activity. Analytics platforms like Nansen, Arkham, and services like Onchain School also aggregate and report these movements. Q: What is the best course of action for a SIGN holder now? A> Conduct further research. Look for official statements from the Sign team, review the token’s vesting schedule, and assess your own risk tolerance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on a single piece of information.

55975575,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92658,1766050060,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Monthly RSI: Bull vs Bear Scenarios,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-monthly-rsi-bull-vs-bear-scenarios/,"Egrag Crypto has published a detailed technical assessment of XRP’s monthly Relative Strength Index, outlining why the current cycle is diverging from prior historical patterns. The analysis centers on the RSI’s relationship with its moving average, a dynamic that previously acted as a reliable continuation signal during major bullish phases. In earlier cycles, XRP’s RSI respected this moving average, rebounding from it before resuming higher momentum. According to Egrag Crypto, that behavior has now changed in a meaningful way. The latest monthly structure shows the RSI breaking below its moving average without producing a bounce. This absence of a recovery is presented as a clear shift in momentum characteristics rather than a routine pullback. While this development introduces additional risk, the analyst emphasizes that it does not automatically confirm the start of a bear market. Instead, it signals that momentum conditions now require further validation before any sustained upside can be assumed. #XRP Monthly RSI – Bull vs Bear Scenarios: This cycle is different. In the last two cycles, RSI bounced off its MA and continued higher. This time, RSI broke below the MA with no bounce, a real momentum shift. Bullish case (~55–60%): This break does not automatically mean… pic.twitter.com/EjQbj3VFCT — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 16, 2025 Bullish Interpretation Hinges on Structural Support Under the bullish framework, Egrag Crypto assigns a slightly higher probability to the view that the RSI breakdown represents a deeper reset within an ongoing cycle. Central to this interpretation is the 44–50 RSI zone, which the analyst describes as a long-term structural support region. As long as the RSI remains above this range, the analyst’s bullish view remains intact, but delayed. For this scenario to gain credibility, several conditions must align. The RSI would need to stabilize within the 44–50 zone, reclaim its moving average, and establish a higher low without printing new momentum lows. A clean turn upward from that structure would suggest that the current weakness is a mid-cycle momentum washout rather than a terminal top. In that case, the broader cycle could extend further, though with a slower and more selective progression. Bearish Risks Linked to Persistent Rejection The bearish scenario, which Egrag Crypto places slightly below the bullish probability, focuses on the consequences of a failed recovery. If the RSI remains below its moving average and continues to lose traction around the 50 level, momentum would likely shift into a distribution phase. Repeated rejections near 50 combined with lower RSI highs would reinforce the bearish scenario. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If that plays out, XRP would be expected to enter a prolonged corrective or consolidative period. Rallies would be viewed as countertrend moves rather than the start of a sustained uptrend. The analyst notes that, under this outcome, time becomes a defining factor, with extended sideways action exerting pressure on market participants. Momentum Now Demands Confirmation Egrag Crypto’s conclusion is deliberately measured. The current RSI structure does not confirm a definitive cycle top, but it removes the assumption of automatic continuation. With the RSI having lost its historical support behavior, the next major move depends on confirmation rather than expectation. Until that confirmation appears, XRP remains in a technically sensitive phase where momentum, not price alone, will determine the prevailing trend.

Retail absence has also pushed Ethereum into a low-activity regime. But similar conditions in the past have often appeared near structural bottoms. Ethereum’s Retail Users Have Gone Quiet According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis, Ethereum’s network activity has fallen to a one-year low, showing a clear absence of retail participation. Active sending addresses have dropped toward the 170,000 level. In previous instances, this range indicated that retail traders have either exited the market or are unwilling to transact. The decline often follows extended periods of volatility and corrective price action, which tend to weaken short-term confidence and engagement among smaller participants. From an on-chain perspective, such low activity levels are commonly associated with seller exhaustion, where selling pressure begins to fade, but fresh demand has yet to emerge. While this environment limits short-term upside, since retail flows usually help drive momentum during early recoveries, it has also frequently identified phases where larger, long-term participants start accumulating ETH quietly. CryptoQuant explained that price action alone will not be enough to confirm a recovery. Instead, a meaningful signal would come from a steady increase in active sending addresses alongside price stabilization, which indicates returning demand and improving network usage. If address activity continues to decline or remains stagnant for an extended period, the risk of Ethereum entering a deeper consolidation or demand-destruction phase increases. Market Remains Cautious Not everyone is bullish on ETH’s recovery. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez, for one, warned in a recent tweet that if ETH closes December below $2,930, the market could face a sharper decline. Failing to hold this crucial level may push the altcoin down to $2,000, and in a worst-case scenario, even as low as $1,100. On the institutional side as well, spot Ethereum ETFs saw significant outflows this week as investors reduced exposure amid market uncertainty. On Monday, nearly $225 million left these funds, driven by renewed US equity volatility and unclear global monetary policy. Data compiled by SoSoValue found that Tuesday saw similar selling, while Wednesday’s outflow was smaller, at $22.3 million.

The largest moves tend to begin when growth becomes evident but little attention has been given. With Q1 around the corner, the opportunist investor is searching for altcoins that are already performing, but cheap enough to provide substantial returns. Such a search is actually becoming targeted at a single Ethereum-based DeFi project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been picking up steam under the radar, and its recent rise is now compelling it to make a broader comparison to earlier success stories of early-stage winners. The Presale Gathers Ground In early 2025, Mutuum Finance successfully rolled out its token sale. It started with a token value of $0.01 before, it is now valued at $0.035 in presale. The jump alone represents a 250% rise to date, without any trading publicly. The presale will consist of consecutive phases, the price of which increases with the number, and the number of allotments is minimal. Agglomeration of Phase 6 is over 99% allocated and that would imply access at the existing price is virtually lost. The following step will push the token price up by an approximate of 20% and will bring MUTM one step closer to its official price of $0.06. The same has been the case with capital and participation. Mutuum Finance is a recently-established company raised with more than $19.4M and over 18.5K holders. Over 820M of the tokens have been sold, of a total of 4B. Approximately 45.5% of that supply was held back to be distributed at the beginning, and this indicates how much of the early window has already been occupied. What Mutuum Finance Is Developing There is one goal of Mutuum Finance. Installing an egalitarian lending mechanism that ties the value of tokens to their actual employment. Rather than seeking attention, the protocol is aimed at gaining demand by doing. This platform is developing two market lending as capital flows where the demand meets and predictability in the rules. Users obtain mtTokens in case they provide assets. This is reflected in these tokens who increase in value as proportions of the interest are earned. This design leads to the incentive design of the protocol. Open market bought MUTM is redistributed to the users that have staked the mtTokens in the safety module. The greater the lending activity, the greater the protocol revenue and market demand comes subsequently. This links token performance to usage, but not headlines. Security has received a priority right at the beginning. Mutuum Finance has also undergone a CertiK Token Scan with a score of 90/100. Halborn Security is also in process of conducting an independent audit over finalized lending and borrowing contracts. Another confidence is that they have a bug bounty on code vulnerabilities of up to $50k. Stablecoin and Oracles Beyond the launch, there is a roadmap with infrastructure that will be used over time. A stablecoin based on the interest of borrowers is one of the major factors. This adds a less volatile asset to the ecosystem and increases the way users experience the protocol in varying market states. Lending systems must be properly priced. Mutuum Finance is intended to use high-quality oracle infrastructure, which includes Chainlink data feeds. Fallback as well as aggregated sources are also taken into consideration as a way of sustaining fair valuations amid the volatility. According to these dynamics, other commentators think that MUTM could be very good in growth profile as long as it adopts as per the roadmap. On the bullish side, it is estimated that there could be 10x-20x growth of what is presently in place in the long run. Such crypto forecasts are based on actions and market, rather than assurances. V1 Launch and the Importance of Timing Official V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol, designated as V1, is planned to launch in the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 as indicated by the official statements by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team about it on X. The first supported assets will be ETH and USDT, and such products will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. This milestone is important since it will transform MUTM into a usage phase, rather than a build phase. In reality agents tend to initiate trading in a different manner when actual trading can be observed. An urgency is also mounting as far as supply goes. Phase 6 is almost complete and whale allocations are already beginning to emerge as access becomes restricted. The bigger purchases close to the final stages are commonly construed as a positioning before a change of visibility. Timing is a big factor when it comes to investors who pose a question of which crypto to buy at the current time, below $0.10. Mutuum Finance is at the intersection of early-price, high participation and future utility.

According to Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish, Bitcoin long-term holders are not just selling—they’re accelerating their sales volume. This trend represents a significant shift in market dynamics that every crypto investor should understand. Let’s explore what’s driving this behavior and what it means for the future of BTC. Why Are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Suddenly Selling? Traditionally, Bitcoin long-term holders have been the bedrock of market stability. These investors typically hold their BTC for years, weathering market cycles with remarkable patience. However, recent data shows a concerning pattern: these steadfast holders are increasing their selling pressure. Glassnode’s analysis reveals this isn’t isolated profit-taking but a sustained trend amid persistent market challenges. Several factors might explain this shift: Profit realization after previous accumulation phases Response to macroeconomic uncertainty and interest rate concerns Portfolio rebalancing strategies Addressing liquidity needs in a changing financial landscape How Does This Selling Pressure Impact Bitcoin’s Price? When Bitcoin long-term holders increase their selling, the market experiences immediate effects. These investors typically hold substantial amounts of BTC, meaning their transactions can significantly influence supply and demand dynamics. The increased selling pressure creates additional supply in the market, potentially suppressing price growth in the short term. However, this situation isn’t entirely negative. Historical patterns show that when long-term holders distribute coins, it often leads to healthier market conditions in the longer run. The coins move from strong hands to new investors, potentially increasing market participation and liquidity. The key question remains: are we seeing strategic distribution or panic selling? What Can Investors Learn From This Trend? Understanding the behavior of Bitcoin long-term holders provides valuable insights for all market participants. These investors have historically demonstrated excellent timing, often accumulating during bear markets and distributing during bullish periods. Their increased selling might indicate several possibilities: Market topping signals: Long-term holders often sell near market peaks Risk management: Taking profits to secure gains amid uncertainty Portfolio optimization: Reallocating to other assets or opportunities Liquidity events: Addressing personal or institutional cash needs For retail investors, this trend suggests the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics and understanding market cycles. While following the actions of Bitcoin long-term holders can be informative, each investor must consider their own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Actionable Insights for Navigating Current Market Conditions Given the increased selling pressure from Bitcoin long-term holders , what should investors do? First, avoid panic reactions. Market cycles naturally include distribution phases. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging to navigate volatility. Third, maintain a long-term perspective—Bitcoin has weathered numerous similar cycles before. Remember that increased selling from long-term holders doesn’t necessarily predict a market crash. Often, it represents healthy profit-taking and wealth transfer. The crucial factor is whether new demand can absorb this increased supply. Monitoring exchange inflows and outflows alongside holder behavior provides a more complete picture. The Bottom Line: Strategic Patience in Volatile Times The increased selling pressure from Bitcoin long-term holders represents a normal market phase rather than a crisis. These experienced investors are likely executing planned strategies rather than reacting to fear. For the broader market, this distribution phase could establish stronger support levels and prepare the foundation for future growth. Successful investing requires understanding market psychology and on-chain dynamics. While Bitcoin long-term holders are increasing their selling now, history shows they will likely become accumulators again when conditions change. The key is maintaining perspective and avoiding emotional decisions during these transitional periods. Frequently Asked Questions Who exactly are Bitcoin long-term holders? Bitcoin long-term holders are addresses that have held their BTC for at least 155 days. These investors typically demonstrate strong conviction and often accumulate during bear markets. Is this selling pressure a bear market signal? Not necessarily. While increased selling from long-term holders often occurs near market tops, it can also represent healthy profit-taking within an ongoing bull market. Context matters significantly. How can I track Bitcoin long-term holder behavior? Platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant provide on-chain metrics tracking holder behavior, including the Long-Term Holder Supply metric and spent output age bands. Should I sell my Bitcoin because long-term holders are selling? Investment decisions should align with your personal strategy and risk tolerance. While monitoring holder behavior is useful, it shouldn’t override your planned investment approach. What happens after long-term holders finish selling? Historically, after distribution phases, markets often consolidate before the next accumulation phase begins. This can create buying opportunities for patient investors. How does this affect Bitcoin’s long-term prospects? Distribution phases are normal and healthy for markets. They transfer coins to new holders and can establish stronger support levels, potentially benefiting long-term network growth.

Peter Brandt Flags XRP Double Top Pattern Brandt posted the chart to X on Dec. 17 and didn’t bother softening the message for XRP’s online faithful. “I know in advance that all you Riplosts $XRP will forever remind me of this post — ask me if I care,” he wrote, before adding: “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does. But for now this has bearish implications. Love it or not — you need to deal with it.” The chart shows XRP-USDT on Binance in weekly bars, with two highs clustered around $3.40 and $3.66 and a clearly marked support shelf near $2.00. In classical chart terms, that $2 region functions as the neckline: lose it with follow-through, and the market is no longer in “pullback inside a range” territory — it’s in “failed structure” territory. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? That distinction matters because double tops tend to be less about the second peak itself and more about what happens at the midpoint low between the two peaks. Brandt’s framing reflects that: the pattern is “potential” until either support holds and price reclaims prior levels, or the neckline breaks and the market accepts lower. In this case, Brandt’s chart is already showing XRP trading below the $2.00 line, with the most recent marker around $1.8859. That puts the focus squarely on whether the breakdown becomes a sustained weekly close-and-hold below support, or whether the move gets reversed quickly enough to treat it as a bear trap. Or Is The XRP Bottom In? Not everyone reading the same tape is leaning into the bearish conclusion. Trader Cryptollica posted a separate XRP/USD weekly chart (Bitstamp) on Dec. 15 highlighting the weekly RSI at roughly 33, accompanied by the comment: “$XRP WEEKLY RSI : 33 💥”. The chart highlights that, in the past five cases, similarly low readings in XRP’s weekly RSI have tended to occur around market bottoming zones. Brandt was receptive to the conditional logic — specifically, the idea that a failed double top can flip from bearish to bullish if the breakdown doesn’t stick. Responding, he wrote: “Yea, if this dbl top fails then this could become exciting. I agree. I am not championing a bear case — just showing charts for what they are.” Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels That exchange captures the actual tension here. Momentum measures like RSI can identify stretched conditions and recurring historical zones, but they do not, on their own, invalidate a price-structure breakdown. Notably, Brandt did not provide a price target in his comment. But the chart he shared contains enough structure to infer the standard “textbook” projection many technicians would use. With peaks near $3.60 and a neckline near $2.00, the pattern height is about $1.60. The conventional measured move subtracts that height from the neckline after a break, implying a target in the neighborhood of $0.40 if the setup fully plays out. That is not a forecast, and it’s not a promise the market will cooperate — it’s simply the arithmetic implied by the pattern Brandt is pointing at. The more immediate question is whether XRP can reclaim the $2.00 area decisively enough to turn the breakdown into a failed move. If it can’t, the chart conversation shifts from “potential double top” to “confirmed break,” and the downside math stops being hypothetical in traders’ positioning models. At press time, XRP traded at $1.83.

55976230,646461,1766050252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55976230.jpeg,XRP Ledger Adds Military-Grade Security Via Payments Engine Standard,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-military-grade-security/,"Ripple has published the first formal specification of the XRP Ledger’s Payment Engine, positioning it as a foundational upgrade for protocol safety as XRPL moves into a more feature-dense era. The document was released in partnership with formal methods firm Common Prefix and is intended to become a canonical reference for how payments and cross-asset value transfer behave on-ledger. The motivation is straightforward, and Ripple does not sugarcoat it. XRPL has operated for more than a decade without downtime, but the team argues that a long track record is still not the same as provable correctness. In the DEV Community post published Dec. 17 under the RippleX Developers banner, the authors write that “to prepare the ledger for the next generation of complex features, we must move beyond empirical success to mathematical certainty.” A Turning Point For XRP Ledger Security That is the tone throughout: less victory lap, more engineering debt disclosure. For much of XRPL’s life, the C++ implementation (xrpld) has effectively acted as the only definitive source of truth for core behavior. Ripple’s post calls out a practical problem with that model: “The code tells us, in very precise C++ terms, what it does. It does not always tell us why.” In other words, when code is the spec, it becomes difficult to separate intentional design choices from historical behavior that simply persisted because nothing broke. That gap starts to matter more as new amendments arrive. Ripple points directly to a pipeline of complex features — including lending, DEX-related work tied to Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs), batch transactions, and permissioned DEX concepts — and warns that the number of possible system states expands quickly as new modules “weave into the decades-old logic of the ledger.” The published specification is hosted on GitHub and labeled as work in progress, but it is already framed as a serious technical artifact: “a technical specification document intended for developers implementing or verifying XRPL payment system behavior.” It also spells out the heart of the system in plain language: the Payment Engine is what “figures out how value should travel and then carries out those moves,” enabling payments to draw across “ trust lines , MPTs, order books, AMMs , and direct XRP.” The deeper point, though, is what this enables next. Ripple’s post lays out a two-part target. First, a human-readable specification that reduces ambiguity and becomes the canonical reference for builders and researchers. Second, a machine-verifiable model — a mathematical representation of the spec — that can support mechanical proofs about system properties and whether proposed changes violate core safety guarantees. It is also explicit about scope discipline. Ripple argues that specifying the entire ledger in one shot is not realistic: “It would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to specify the entire system at once.” So the work focuses on what it describes as the two most critical and complex components: the Payment Engine and the Consensus Protocol. Consensus, in particular, is framed as non-negotiable infrastructure. Ripple describes it as “the heart of the ledger,” adding: “Its correctness is non-negotiable and underpins the safety and liveness of the entire network.” The stated objective is to formally model the mechanism to prove properties such as liveness, safety, and finality. On timing, Ripple is clear that this is the starting line, not the finish. After publishing the Payment Engine specification, the team says it intends to begin formal verification work on the Payment Engine and the Consensus Protocol in 2026. The closing line captures the direction of travel: “The shift from code-as-truth to mathematics-as-truth is underway.” In the XRP community, the announcement landed with predictable euphoria. “Absolute freaking game changer! … Aerospace & military grade security incoming,” wrote XRPL validator and community member Vet, adding: “The XRP Ledger is receiving its first formal specification for the payments engine. By mathematically specifying key protocol components Basically, this is the enabler for the endboss of audits AND for other things like complex features or client diversity .” At press time, XRP traded at $1.83.",XRP|ripple|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-18 09:30:52

The current selling has been ongoing for 73 days since the recent all-time high. BTC is still trading with highly fearful sentiment, and has not staged a recovery despite the expectations for a year-end rally. The current market climate puts BTC at the most oversold level since the 2023 bear market. BTC is entering deeply oversold territory, after 73 days of sliding since its all-time high. | Source: Bitbo . As of December 18, BTC traded at $86,948.17, with a dominance of 57.6%. The leading coin is just $10,000 above the yearly lows at around $76,000, raising comments that the market’s bullish momentum was wiped out in the latest crash. The October 10 crash and liquidations have a lasting effect for over two months. Historically, BTC and crypto have taken at least three months to recover liquidity and speculative open interest. The recent slides below $90,000 further solidify the beliefs that BTC may take longer to recover for a new bull market. In the past months, BTC saw a mix of selling and re-accumulation to different wallets. Derivative trading sentiment remains fearful, with low enthusiasm for an imminent rally. BTC is pressured by ETF selling, while some traders are trying to protect their earnings from an eventual prolonged bear cycle. Can BTC reverse course? BTC has shown indications of becoming an oversold asset for the past two months. However, this was not enough to re-spark the price rally. The market is still vulnerable to liquidations, attacking long positions whenever there is more liquidity accumulated. There are also indicators of traders protecting from ongoing dips in the $80,000 range. BTC open interest is down to $27.4B, remaining at a six-month low. The drawdown continued since the yearly peak at over $44B as of October 6. Spot trading has also been insufficient to stop the slide. Episodes of rapid selling have also shown their ability to stop any attempts at breakout rallies. As Cryptopolitan reported , BTC recovered to $90,000, only to crash to $85,000 in minutes. Additional Glassnode data shows holders are still distributing their BTC holdings. Based on options market positioning, traders may become more bullish above $90,000. At prices below that, traders opened more put options to protect from further downside. BTC shows signs of local bottom Based on the current metrics, BTC is showing signs of reaching a local low for its price. However, the markets are anticipating more dips, with downside protection for a slide under $80,000. BTC is setting expectations for ending December in the red, while logging a net yearly loss. Only around 64% of the BTC supply is in profit , once again sinking to levels not seen since 2023. For now, whales have realized enough gains, but BTC may see further selling at other capitulation levels. The net unrealized profit and loss still shows there are multiple wallets in profit even at thee $86,000 price range. The metric may indicate that there are still confident holders. On the other hand, an ongoing price weakness may mean the BTC capitulation is not over. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The new service allows partners to issue branded stablecoins backed by flexible collateral, including USDC. Significantly, projects such as R2, Flipcash, and Solflare have already signaled interest, with potential launches expected in the coming months. The move reflects Coinbase’s wider strategy to position itself as a single destination for trading, payments, and onchain activity. Besides stablecoins, Coinbase outlined a sweeping update that expands what users can trade and build on the platform. The company framed the rollout as part of its long-term vision to create an always-on financial system. Consequently, the platform now connects traditional markets, crypto assets, and onchain tools inside one unified experience. Custom Stablecoins and Payments Infrastructure Custom Stablecoins aim to give companies more control over how value moves through their ecosystems. Partners can embed branding directly into transactions while relying on Coinbase-managed issuance and compliance. Moreover, the stablecoins can earn rewards on balances, creating new incentives for user adoption. Coinbase also highlighted progress in payment infrastructure for developers and businesses. Its APIs now support custody, payments, trading, and stablecoins at scale. Additionally, stablecoin wallets can be embedded into third-party platforms, enabling direct checkout payments. Shopify has already launched stablecoin checkout, while other payment providers plan integrations in 2026. Hence, Coinbase appears focused on making stablecoins practical for everyday commerce. Expanding Markets: Stocks, Derivatives, and Predictions Coinbase has started rolling out stock trading for U.S. users, allowing equities and ETFs to sit alongside crypto holdings. Traders can buy and sell with USD or USDC and trade outside traditional market hours. Moreover, the company plans to extend stock perpetuals internationally, offering 24/7 exposure through derivatives. Prediction markets have also entered the Coinbase app through an initial partnership with Kalshi. Users can trade outcomes tied to real-world events, starting with small positions. Significantly, Coinbase plans to add more prediction platforms, widening access to event-driven markets. Onchain Access and the Base App Coinbase has expanded decentralized exchange access by integrating Solana trading through Jupiter. Consequently, users can swap newly launched tokens directly in the main app. The Base App now operates in more than 140 countries, combining social feeds, trading, and payments.

This crucial update, effective from 9:00 a.m. UTC on December 22, is a standard security and maintenance procedure, but understanding the details is key for any investor. Let’s break down what this Upbit INIT deposits and withdrawals suspension means for you and why it’s happening. What Does the Upbit INIT Suspension Mean for Traders? First, don’t panic. A temporary suspension of Upbit INIT deposits and withdrawals is a common practice in the crypto world for network upgrades or wallet maintenance. However, it’s vital to know exactly what is and isn’t affected. During this period, you will not be able to move INIT tokens into or out of your Upbit wallet. Crucially, this suspension typically does not affect trading of INIT against other pairs like KRW or BTC on the exchange’s spot market. You can likely still buy, sell, and hold INIT within your Upbit account. Why Would Upbit Halt INIT Transactions? Exchanges like Upbit prioritize security and stability above all. Therefore, there are several responsible reasons for this action. The most common include: Network Upgrades: The Initia blockchain itself might be undergoing a scheduled hard fork or major update. Pausing transactions prevents funds from being lost during the transition. Wallet Maintenance: Upbit could be performing essential security updates or optimizations to its internal INIT wallet systems. Node Synchronization: Sometimes, an exchange’s node needs to catch up with the main blockchain to ensure all transactions are recorded accurately. This proactive measure protects user assets and ensures a seamless experience once services resume. It’s a sign of a diligent, security-focused exchange. What Should You Do During the Suspension? While you wait for Upbit INIT deposits and withdrawals to resume, here are some actionable steps. First, check the official Upbit announcement page for the exact resumption time. Do not rely on third-party sources. Second, if you had planned a transfer, simply reschedule it for after the maintenance window. Finally, use this time to review your overall portfolio strategy. Remember, patience is a virtue in cryptocurrency; these brief pauses are designed for long-term safety. When Will Upbit Resume INIT Services? Upbit has stated the suspension begins on December 22 at 9:00 a.m. UTC. The announcement is for a temporary halt, but it does not specify an end time. This is standard. The resumption will be announced separately once all checks are complete. Historically, Upbit completes such maintenance within hours or a couple of days. Keep an eye on their official notices for the “Service Resumption” announcement. Never attempt to send funds to your deposit address during a suspension, as this could lead to loss of assets. Conclusion: A Standard Step for Security In summary, the temporary halt on Upbit INIT deposits and withdrawals is a routine operational procedure. It underscores the exchange’s commitment to safeguarding user funds and ensuring network integrity. While momentarily inconvenient, such measures are far preferable to the risks of operating during unstable conditions. For INIT holders, this is a short-term pause, not a cause for alarm. The key takeaway is to stay informed through official channels and plan your transactions accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Can I still trade INIT on Upbit during the suspension? In most cases, yes. Suspensions typically affect only the movement of tokens to and from the exchange (deposits/withdrawals). Spot trading of INIT on the Upbit order book usually continues uninterrupted. Always confirm in the latest announcement. How long will the Upbit INIT deposit suspension last? Upbit has not specified an end time. These maintenance windows can last from a few hours to a day or two. The exchange will publish a follow-up notice as soon as services are restored. Is my INIT safe on Upbit during this time? Yes. The suspension is a protective measure. Your INIT holdings in your Upbit wallet remain secure. The action is taken to prevent potential issues during a network update or system upgrade, not because of a security breach. What happens if I send INIT to my Upbit deposit address during the suspension? Do not do this. Transactions sent during a suspension may not be credited automatically and could be lost. Always wait for the official service resumption notice before making any deposits. Will this suspension affect the price of INIT? While any exchange action can cause minor market volatility, routine maintenance suspensions like this one rarely have a significant, long-term impact on an asset’s price. The effect, if any, is usually temporary. Where can I get official updates on this situation? The only source you should trust is the official Upbit announcement page or their verified social media channels. Avoid speculation from unofficial forums or groups. Found this guide helpful?

On-chain data reveals a staggering ETH long position now worth approximately $577 million. This bold maneuver by a veteran investor raises critical questions about market sentiment and the high-stakes world of leveraged crypto trading. What Does This Massive ETH Long Position Entail? According to data from the analytics platform Lookonchain, the investor, identified by the wallet address “1011short,” recently purchased an additional 12,406 ETH. This purchase increased their total leveraged holding to 203,341 ETH. The position carries a 5x leverage, meaning the trader has borrowed funds to amplify potential gains—and losses. The average entry price for this enormous ETH long position is $3,147.39. However, this high-reward strategy comes with substantial risk. The current liquidation price for the position is $2,132.82. If Ethereum’s price falls to this level, the position could be automatically closed, resulting in significant losses. At the time of the report, the position was already carrying an unrealized loss of $1.39 million, highlighting the volatile nature of such leveraged bets. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Bet Big on Ethereum? This action is particularly noteworthy because the investor is recognized as a “Bitcoin OG”—an early adopter of Bitcoin. Their pivot to a major ETH long position signals a compelling narrative. It suggests that even veterans of the original cryptocurrency see substantial value and potential in Ethereum’s ecosystem. This could be based on several factors: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s network of decentralized applications, DeFi, and NFTs. Upcoming Upgrades: Continued development and improvements to the protocol. Portfolio Diversification: A strategic move to balance a crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin. The scale of this investment acts as a powerful signal of confidence, potentially influencing retail and institutional perception. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a single, highly leveraged trade, not a guaranteed market forecast. Understanding the Risks of a Leveraged ETH Long Position While the size of the bet is impressive, the risks are equally monumental. Leverage magnifies everything. A 5x ETH long position means that for every 1% move in ETH’s price, the position’s value changes by roughly 5%. This can lead to rapid profits or devastating losses. The proximity of the liquidation price ($2,132) to potential market prices is a key concern. A sharp, sudden market downturn—common in crypto—could trigger liquidation. Therefore, this trade exemplifies the extreme risk tolerance of some large-scale investors, often called “whales.” For the average investor, mimicking such a highly leveraged ETH long position is exceptionally dangerous. Key Takeaways and Market Implications This event provides several actionable insights for observers and traders. First, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data from whales, as their moves can indicate sentiment shifts. Second, it’s a stark reminder of the severe risks associated with leverage. Finally, it highlights the ongoing interplay between Bitcoin and Ethereum as the two leading crypto assets. The decision by a Bitcoin pioneer to increase a massive ETH long position to $577 million is a fascinating chapter in crypto market dynamics. It reflects a calculated, high-conviction bet on Ethereum’s future, backed by a staggering amount of capital. While the trade currently shows a paper loss, its very existence speaks volumes about the confidence some of the most experienced players have in the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the investor behind this large ETH trade? A1: The investor is identified by the on-chain wallet address “1011short” and is known within the crypto community as a Bitcoin early adopter or “OG.” Their exact identity remains pseudonymous. Q2: What does a 5x leveraged long position mean? A2: It means the investor has used borrowed funds to control a position five times larger than their own capital. It amplifies both potential profits and potential losses. Q3: What happens if ETH hits the $2,132 liquidation price? A3: If Ethereum’s price falls to $2,132.82, the exchange will automatically sell (liquidate) the position to repay the borrowed funds, likely resulting in a total loss of the investor’s collateral. Q4: Should I follow this whale and open a similar ETH long position? A4: Absolutely not. Whale trades involve extreme risk and capital sizes that most cannot afford to lose. Copying high-leverage trades without deep understanding is a recipe for significant financial loss. Q5: Where can I track such large on-chain transactions? A5: Analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Etherscan provide tools to track whale wallets and large transactions, offering valuable market intelligence. Q6: Does this guarantee Ethereum’s price will go up? A6: No. A single trade, no matter how large, does not guarantee future price movement. It is merely one data point reflecting one investor’s high-risk conviction. Join the Conversation Was this deep dive into the $577 million ETH long position helpful?

This movement comes at a pivotal moment when European central banks face mounting pressure to adjust their monetary policies. For cryptocurrency investors watching traditional finance, these developments signal potential ripple effects across all asset classes. Why the Dollar Strengthens Before CPI Data The US Dollar has edged higher against major currencies as market participants position themselves ahead of the inflation report. This cautious optimism reflects expectations that the Federal Reserve might maintain its current policy stance if inflation shows signs of cooling. The CPI release serves as a critical barometer for future interest rate decisions, directly impacting currency valuations worldwide. European Central Banks Under Microscope While the Federal Reserve dominates headlines, European central banks face their own challenges. The European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Swiss National Bank must navigate complex economic landscapes with varying inflation rates and growth prospects. Their upcoming decisions could create significant volatility in forex markets , particularly for EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs. Forex Markets React to Global Uncertainty Current forex markets demonstrate heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators. The relationship between traditional currencies and digital assets becomes increasingly important as institutional investors diversify portfolios. Key factors influencing market movements include: Diverging monetary policies between the US and Europe Geopolitical tensions affecting trade flows Energy price fluctuations impacting inflation expectations Central bank communication and forward guidance Inflation Data: The Ultimate Market Mover The upcoming inflation data represents more than just numbers—it’s a signal about the global economy’s health. Higher-than-expected inflation could force central banks to maintain hawkish stances, while cooler numbers might prompt earlier rate cuts. This data point influences everything from bond yields to cryptocurrency prices as investors reassess risk across all asset classes. Key Central Bank Meetings This Week Central Bank Meeting Date Expected Action Market Impact European Central Bank Thursday Hold rates at 4.5% EUR volatility expected Bank of England Thursday Potential hold at 5.25% GBP sensitivity high Swiss National Bank Thursday Possible rate cut CHF weakness possible Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Navigating this volatile environment requires strategic thinking. Consider these approaches: Monitor correlation between traditional forex pairs and major cryptocurrencies Watch for divergence between Fed and ECB policy statements Prepare for increased volatility around data releases Consider hedging strategies across currency and crypto portfolios The Ripple Effect on Global Finance The interconnected nature of modern finance means developments in traditional forex markets inevitably affect digital assets. As the Dollar strengthens or weakens based on CPI release outcomes, cryptocurrency markets often experience parallel movements. This relationship underscores the importance of monitoring traditional economic indicators even for dedicated crypto investors. FAQs: Understanding the Current Financial Landscape What is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)? The Consumer Price Index measures average price changes for consumer goods and services, serving as a primary inflation gauge. The Federal Reserve closely watches this data when making monetary policy decisions. Which European central banks are most important right now? The European Central Bank ( ECB ) leads monetary policy for the Eurozone, while the Bank of England ( BOE ) determines UK policy. Both institutions face challenging decisions balancing inflation control with economic growth. How does CPI data affect cryptocurrency markets? CPI data influences Federal Reserve policy, which affects the US Dollar’s strength. Since Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies often move inversely to the Dollar, inflation reports can trigger significant crypto market movements. Who leads the Federal Reserve’s decision-making? Chair Jerome Powell ( Federal Reserve bio ) guides the Federal Open Market Committee in setting US monetary policy. His statements following CPI releases significantly impact global markets. What’s the connection between forex and crypto trading? Both markets respond to similar macroeconomic factors including interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events. Many institutional investors treat Bitcoin as a digital alternative to traditional safe-haven assets during currency volatility. The convergence of traditional finance and digital assets creates unprecedented opportunities for informed investors. By understanding how CPI release data influences the Dollar and how European central banks respond, traders can navigate both forex markets and cryptocurrency spaces with greater confidence. The coming days will test whether current inflation data supports continued economic stability or signals needed policy adjustments.

Blockchain security firm PeckShield issued an alert on X on Thursday, reporting that the whale had been hacked for roughly $27.3 million. The stolen funds are being funneled through on-chain privacy tool Tornado Cash in batches of 100 ETH, according to data from Etherscan. #PeckShieldAlert A whale's Multisig was drained of ~$27.3M due to a private key compromise. The drainer has laundered $12.6M (4,100 $ETH ) via #TornadoCash and retains ~$2M in liquid assets. The drainer also controls the victim's multisig, which maintains a leveraged long… pic.twitter.com/1Ulk4X7bkl — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) December 18, 2025 PeckShield said the attacker took control of the private key and made themselves the sole signatory of the multisig wallet. Once access was obtained, the drainer began systematically extracting assets and laundering them on-chain. Multisig wallet hacker still holds $2 million of the stolen funds According to PeckShield, the attacker, who is using the address 0x1fCf…367d23Ac, has already laundered about $12.6 million, equivalent to 4,100 Ether, through Tornado Cash. The security firm added that the drainer still holds around $2 million in liquid assets, based on wallet balances observed at the time of reporting. Several security analysts believe the attacker is in control of the victim’s multisig wallet, which is actively holding a large leveraged position on Aave. The wallet reportedly has about $25 million worth of Ether supplied as collateral against roughly $12.3 million borrowed in DAI. The attacker’s address, which PeckShield shared publicly, holds Ether, Wrapped Ether, OKB, Trust Wallet Token, Bitfinex LEO, Fetch, and Nexo. They have so far made deposits of stolen Ether into Tornado Cash in equal-sized batches totaling 4,100 Ether, split into 41 transactions of 100 Ether each. Late Wednesday, on-chain investigator Specter issued more details on the breach by publishing a breakdown of the attack sequence. The blockchain analyst mentioned that a victim’s private key compromise had pushed the total losses from the incident closer to $38 million. According to Specter, the victim created a multisignature wallet configured as a 1-of-1 system on April 11, 2025, at 07:48:11. Shortly after moving funds into the wallet, the main wallet, designated as the signer, experienced a massive outflow at 08:23:23. While the precise cause of the breach remains unclear, Specter suggested that the private key may have been leaked during the multisignature setup process. Another possibility raised was that the victim relied on a malicious actor for assistance while creating the multisig wallet. Whale 0xde5f44…b051e965 had suffered notable losses in May, per the tracking of analytics platform Onchainlens, which found that the investor withdrew 2,520.5 Ether, valued at about $4.52 million at the time, from OKX and staked it with Kiln Finance. Over the course of the year, the whale reportedly staked a total of 9,918 Ether, worth $22.58 million at around July. Despite earning 105.5 Ether in staking rewards, the investor still faced a net loss of around $4.26 million before the latest exploit occurred. Multisig wallets can be hacked without the necessary signatory threshold Most members of the crypto community believe in multisig wallets security because they require approvals from two or more entities before executing a transaction. Some configurations in these types of wallets include systems like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, where the first number in the system represents the keyholder threshold that must approve a swap or trade. However, configurations such as 1-of-1, where only one signer is required, undermine the primary benefit of multisignature protection. In such cases, the compromise of a single key can lead to total loss, as appears to have happened in whale 0xde5f44…b051e965’s case. In a separate case seen in September this year, an unidentified crypto investor lost over $3 million after unknowingly authorizing a malicious contract. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged that incident on his Telegram channel, revealing that the victim’s wallet was drained of $3.047 million in USDC and swapped for Ether to be routed through Tornado Cash. SlowMist founder Yu Xian later explained that the compromised address in that case was a 2-of-4 Safe multisig wallet. He continued to say the fraudulent contract mimicked the first and last characters of the real address, making the deception difficult to detect. The attacker also exploited the Safe Multi Send mechanism, hiding the malicious approval inside a routine authorization. “This abnormal authorization was hard to detect because it wasn’t a standard approval,” Xian wrote on X.

This aggressive accumulation, valued at approximately $1.945 billion, cements the company’s status as the world’s preeminent corporate holder of the digital asset. Let’s delve into the details of this bold strategy and what it signals for the broader market. What Are the Staggering Numbers Behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Purchase? According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, MicroStrategy’s relentless acquisition strategy has been nothing short of extraordinary in 2024. The company’s most recent disclosed buy occurred on December 15th, adding 10,645 BTC to its vault. This latest transaction is part of a consistent pattern that has defined the firm’s corporate identity. Therefore, understanding the scale is crucial for any market observer. The cumulative effect of this year’s activity brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to a jaw-dropping 671,268 BTC. The company’s average purchase price for its entire stash now stands at $74,972 per Bitcoin. This figure provides critical context for evaluating the firm’s long-term financial positioning relative to current market prices. Why Is This Massive Bitcoin Purchase So Significant? MicroStrategy’s strategy transcends simple investment; it represents a fundamental corporate thesis. Under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company has positioned Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This move is a direct challenge to traditional corporate finance models that rely on cash or bonds. The benefits of this approach, as championed by the firm, include: Inflation Hedge: Protecting shareholder value against currency devaluation. Capital Appreciation: Betting on the long-term growth of the Bitcoin network. Strategic Differentiation: Creating a unique and talked-about corporate identity. However, this path is not without its challenges. The strategy exposes the company to significant volatility and requires unwavering conviction from leadership and shareholders, especially during market downturns. How Does MicroStrategy’s Strategy Impact the Broader Crypto Market? MicroStrategy’s monumental Bitcoin purchase acts as a powerful bellwether for institutional sentiment. Each announcement often provides a short-term boost to market confidence, demonstrating that large, publicly-traded companies are willing to make billion-dollar bets on digital assets. Moreover, it sets a precedent that other corporations may follow, potentially leading to wider adoption. The company’s transparent reporting and frequent purchases create a consistent narrative of institutional accumulation. This narrative can influence retail investor behavior and provide a counterbalance to selling pressure. For market analysts, MicroStrategy’s buying patterns offer actionable insights into how a major player views price levels and long-term value. What’s the Future Outlook After This $1.9 Billion Bet? Looking ahead, the key question is sustainability. Can MicroStrategy continue its aggressive Bitcoin purchase strategy? The answer likely depends on several factors: its operating cash flow, ability to raise capital through debt or equity (a tactic it has used before), and the prevailing price of Bitcoin itself. The company has shown remarkable resilience and creativity in funding its acquisitions, suggesting the strategy may continue as long as its core thesis holds.

While assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB) captured attention during earlier hype cycles, the current environment is increasingly favoring DeFi crypto platforms that deliver measurable value and long-term revenue potential. At the center of this transition is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly emerging protocol that many analysts now describe as the best crypto to buy at this stage of the market. Priced at just $0.035 during Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has already drawn over 18,520 investors and raised nearly $20 million, underscoring strong confidence in its roadmap. Built around a decentralized lending-and-borrowing framework with interest-bearing tokens and yield-driven incentives, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a viral DeFi crypto not because of hype, but due to accelerating adoption, clear product milestones, and the upcoming V1 testnet launch, key factors that are reshaping where smart money is choosing to deploy capital today. Shiba Inu Struggles Near Key Support as Selling Pressure Persists Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently hovering just above the 0.0000080 support level after facing a sharp rejection from mid-range resistance, a move that has reinforced the prevailing bearish momentum. While a modest rebound attempt has emerged, the lack of strong follow-through suggests that sellers remain firmly in control, keeping upside progress limited. A clean break below this support could open the door to another leg lower, extending the ongoing corrective phase. For any short-term relief to materialize, SHIB would need to reclaim its descending trendline, a signal that has yet to appear. As traders reassess risk and momentum in meme-driven assets, attention is gradually shifting toward projects built around tangible utility and structured growth models, paving the way for increasing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto to buy. MUTM Presale Nears Full Capacity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly establishing itself as a leading DeFi crypto project of 2025. Phase 6 of its presale is approaching full subscription, with over 18,520 participants contributing more than $19.5 million. Tokens are currently available at $0.035, representing one of the final opportunities for early investors before Phase 7, when the price will increase by 20% to $0.04. The strong performance of the presale highlights MUTM’s appeal as a cryptocurrency with both growth potential and practical DeFi utility. Unlike many altcoins that rely heavily on speculative trading, Mutuum Finance prioritizes real-world adoption and functional applications. Its emphasis on transparency, structured lending mechanisms, and utility-driven tokenomics positions MUTM as the DeFi crypto with significant long-term prospects. Robust Collateral Management and Risk Mitigation Mutuum Finance employs a comprehensive risk management framework designed to safeguard both the protocol and its users. The platform enforces collateralization targets and lending and deposit caps to maintain systemic stability. Positions that fall below required collateral levels are systematically liquidated, with penalties and liquidation guarantees applied to minimize risk exposure. Collateral efficiency is optimized through careful management of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly in highly collateralized lending scenarios. Additionally, reserve provisioning is used to hedge against abnormal market conditions, allocating excess reserves to high-volatility assets to offset potential fluctuations. These measures collectively enhance the security, stability, and operational efficiency of the Mutuum Finance platform. As meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) face selling pressure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the top DeFi crypto opportunity. Phase 6 of its presale is nearly full, with over 18,520 holders contributing $19.5 million, and tokens priced at $0.035 before Phase 7 rises to $0.04. Its decentralized lending, interest-bearing tokens, and robust risk management offer tangible utility and long-term growth potential. Secure early exposure now to the best crypto to buy before broader market attention drives prices higher.

While XRP appears inactive to many observers, the analyst maintains that underlying technical conditions suggest the market is approaching a decisive phase. According to the assessment shared alongside a detailed video update, XRP is not displaying weakness due to a lack of structure, but rather because it is trading within a tightly compressed range that historically precedes significant price movement. This Is Why #XRP Looks Dead Right Now pic.twitter.com/9XXvXeEzk4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 16, 2025 Weekly Compression and Structural Support On the weekly timeframe, XRP is positioned firmly within a long-established support zone that has been monitored for months. Price action is confined between descending resistance and ascending support lines, creating a narrowing structure that indicates compression. The analyst emphasizes that such formations rarely persist indefinitely. While acknowledging that outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty, the analysis highlights that XRP is consolidating above support during a period marked by elevated fear and minimal retail engagement. From a probabilistic standpoint, the analyst views these conditions as more consistent with a potential upside reaction than an extended breakdown. Daily RSI Divergence Signals Waning Sell Pressure Further insight is drawn from the daily chart, where the Relative Strength Index is forming higher lows despite XRP printing lower lows in price . This bullish divergence is described as an uncommon occurrence on XRP’s daily timeframe. The analyst notes that a similar setup last emerged during the 2022 bear market low, after which XRP stabilized and later advanced sharply. Such divergences are interpreted as early indications that selling momentum is weakening while buyer interest is gradually rebuilding, even if price action has yet to reflect that shift. Relative Strength Against Bitcoin Gains Attention The analysis also extends to XRP’s performance against Bitcoin . A multi-year resistance level on the XRP/BTC chart, which had repeatedly rejected prices since 2017, was broken earlier in the year and is now being retested as potential support. If this level holds, the analyst suggests XRP could continue to strengthen relative to Bitcoin, challenging the assumption that its price movements are entirely dependent on Bitcoin’s direction. Macro Risks and Conflicting Signals Despite constructive technical signals, several risk factors remain. XRP is still trading below its 50-week simple moving average, a condition that previously coincided with further downside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, planned policy actions by the Bank of Japan , including ETF unwinding and potential rate hikes, are cited as historically unfavorable for risk assets. However, the analyst notes that, unlike prior instances, markets have already declined ahead of these developments, reducing the likelihood of a severe follow-up move. Assessing the Broader Outlook Taken together, STEPHISCRYPTO concludes that XRP is more likely approaching a market floor than a peak. While bearish scenarios, such as a double-bottom structure, remain possible, the prevailing technical evidence suggests an advanced stage of consolidation rather than structural failure. The period ahead is framed as critical, with price compression suggesting that prolonged inactivity is unlikely to persist.

Notably, SpaceX currently holds just over 8,000 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $687.6 million, according to on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham . The aerospace company’s BTC holdings reached an estimated all-time high value of around $1.03 billion on October 7, when Bitcoin was trading at significantly higher levels. SpaceX’s Bitcoin treasury decline reflects a drop of more than $300 million in the dollar value of aerospace giant’s BTC position, despite no evidence of large-scale selling from the company’s known wallets. Arkham data shows that SpaceX’s Bitcoin balance remains broadly unchanged, indicating the drawdown is driven by price movements rather than distribution. SPACEX IS DOWN $300M SpaceX is down over $300M from their BTC holdings ATH value on 7th October, $1.03B. SpaceX currently holds just over 8,000 BTC, worth $687.59M. pic.twitter.com/IOS54OY2sM — Arkham (@arkham) December 17, 2025 The portfolio is down around 2.3% over the past 24 hours, in line with broader Bitcoin market weakness during the same period. SpaceX has been associated with Bitcoin holdings since disclosures linked to Elon Musk’s broader corporate ecosystem, although the company does not regularly comment publicly on its digital asset strategy, and latest data reinforces how large corporate treasuries remain highly sensitive to short-term price volatility, even when holdings are unchanged. Despite the pullback, SpaceX’s Bitcoin position remains one of the largest known corporate BTC holdings outside of publicly disclosed treasury leaders. The company’s current Bitcoin balance still represents a substantial long-term allocation relative to most private firms.

Key Takeaways: A malware-laced fake game test drained more than $100,000 in crypto from an experienced Web3 investor within 24 hours. A polished website, active Discord and responsive team helped the scam bypass early suspicion. The incident highlights rising malware threats and the risks of keeping seed phrases in browser-based wallets. Mark Koh, founder of victim-support organization RektSurvivor, shared details of the incident in an interview with Chinese-language outlet Lianhe Zaobao and in a LinkedIn post . According to Koh, the scam began on Dec. 5, when he encountered a beta testing opportunity on Telegram for an online game called MetaToy. Polished Website and Active Discord Helped Lure Victim Into Crypto Scam Koh said he was convinced the project was legitimate due to its polished website, an active Discord server, and responsive team members. As someone who has invested in and evaluated multiple Web3 projects, he said the setup did not initially raise red flags. The situation changed after he downloaded MetaToy’s game launcher. Koh said the installer quietly uploaded malware onto his computer. Although his Norton antivirus software flagged suspicious activity, Koh attempted to contain the issue by running full system scans, removing suspicious files and registries, and reinstalling Windows 11. Despite those efforts, the damage had already been done. Within 24 hours, every software wallet connected to his Rabby and Phantom browser extensions was drained. In total, Koh lost 14,189 USDT, or roughly 100,000 yuan, representing crypto he had accumulated over eight years.

He advised users to remove seed phrases from browser-based wallets when not actively in use and to consider using private keys instead of seed phrases to limit exposure across derivative wallets. The fraud has been reported to Singapore police, which confirmed to Lianhe Zaobao that it has received a corresponding report. The MetaToy incident comes amid a broader rise in malware campaigns targeting crypto users. In October, McAfee warned that hackers were abusing GitHub repositories to keep banking malware connected to new servers. This year has also seen fake AI tools, malicious Captchas and compromised Ethereum code extensions used to spread crypto-stealing malware. Investor Loses $3M in Crypto Phishing Scam In August, a cryptocurrency investor fell victim to a phishing scam , losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction. The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders. The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

The move comes as Wyoming-chartered Custodia pursues a full-court appeal of its master account denial, while regulatory agencies expose widespread debanking practices that systematically excluded crypto firms from traditional banking services between 2020 and 2023. Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said the policy shift creates pathways for responsible innovation while maintaining safety standards. “ New technologies offer efficiencies to banks and improved products and services to bank customers, ” she said. The original 2023 guidance had limited state member banks to activities permitted under other federal banking regulations, but evolving financial systems and improved regulatory understanding rendered those restrictions obsolete. NEW: Big news from the @federalreserve today: It’s withdrawing its 2023 guidance that effectively blocked uninsured banks from becoming Fed members and engaging in crypto. This guidance underpinned the Fed’s denial of @custodiabank ’s master account. pic.twitter.com/2qlFqhnPAv — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 17, 2025 Custodia Escalates Legal Battle After Years of Regulatory Roadblocks Custodia filed a petition with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 15, requesting en banc review of the Fed’s denial of its master account after a three-judge panel upheld the rejection in October. The bank argues the decision violates the Monetary Control Act’s mandate that payment services “ shall be available ” to eligible depository institutions, creating unconstitutional veto power over state banking charters. Without master account access, Custodia cannot use Federal Reserve wire transfers or automated clearinghouse systems despite meeting all statutory requirements under Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institution framework, which requires 100% reserve backing and prohibits lending to reduce risk. The petition raises federalism concerns about federal regulators effectively overriding Wyoming’s 2020 charter decision, which was designed to attract digital asset companies within stringent safety parameters. Back in November, Judge Timothy Tymkovich’s dissent highlighted that granting unreviewable discretion to regional Reserve Bank presidents raises constitutional questions, since those officials are selected by private bank directors rather than appropriately appointed as federal officers. Custodia Bank petitions full appeals court to review Federal Reserve's master account denial, citing constitutional concerns and federal law violations. #Crypto #Bank #Fed https://t.co/KyM8MlA1WC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 16, 2025 The dissent created a 2-2 split among circuit judges on whether the Monetary Control Act mandates master account access, with Tymkovich writing that the Fed’s interpretation grants unreviewable discretion while contradicting the statute’s plain language. The Kansas City Fed denied Custodia’s application in January 2023 after 27 months, citing crypto-asset risks despite internal documents showing staff deemed the bank’s capital adequate and its executive team impressive. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has since acknowledged the Fed possesses sufficient tools to manage risks through tailored account structures without resorting to blanket denials. His October remarks undermined the necessity argument that regulators used to justify rejecting Custodia’s application, while broader investigations revealed systematic exclusionary practices across major banks. Banking Giants Exposed for Inappropriate Crypto Restrictions The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released findings showing all nine largest national banks imposed inappropriate restrictions on lawful businesses, including digital asset companies, between 2020 and 2023. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Capital One, PNC, TD Bank, and BMO maintained internal policies requiring escalated approvals or blanket restrictions on sectors conflicting with institutional values. The review examined thousands of debanking complaints after President Trump signed an August executive order intended to prevent account closures based solely on crypto activity. OCC Comptroller Jonathan Gould said the practices were widespread and represented improper use of national bank charters. Some users claimed their accounts were abruptly closed under vague references to concerning activity, fueling allegations of coordinated exclusion similar to Operation Chokepoint. Banks insisted they did not discriminate, but many restrictive policies were publicly visible throughout the investigation period. The regulatory shift extends beyond debanking investigations. The OCC has conditionally approved five crypto firms, including @Circle and @Ripple , to launch national trust banks. #Ripple #Circle https://t.co/wCeTNrhOQZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 13, 2025 The OCC conditionally approved five crypto firms , including Circle and Ripple, to launch national trust banks in December, giving digital asset companies access to federal banking charters with single-rulebook oversight instead of navigating state-by-state regulations. Paxos received federal supervision to issue stablecoins, while Ripple’s charter excludes RLUSD issuance but allows custody and settlement services without deposit-taking or lending activities. The approved firms have 18 months to raise capital, assemble staff, and build compliant infrastructure before facing final OCC examination.

Source: BitcoinForCorporation The consultation closes December 31, with a final decision expected January 15, 2026, targeting firms whose digital asset holdings exceed 50% of total assets, with implementation scheduled for February’s Index Review. Strategy Inc. formally challenged the proposal in a December 10 letter , signed by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor and CEO Phong Le, calling the move “ misguided ” and “ profoundly harmful consequences ” to capital markets and U.S. digital asset leadership. The company argued that the proposal conflicts with the current administration’s pro-innovation digital asset agenda, including initiatives such as a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and efforts to expand retirement plan access to digital assets. Operating Companies Face Investment Fund Classification Strategy’s core argument centers on distinguishing operating businesses from passive investment vehicles. The company emphasized that it runs a Bitcoin-backed corporate treasury and capital markets program, issuing equity and fixed-income instruments with varying levels of Bitcoin exposure.

Yet, it has never excluded operating companies based on their treasury asset composition. Strategy warned MSCI’s 50% threshold is arbitrary, noting crypto volatility and divergent accounting standards could cause companies to “ whipsaw on and off ” indices as valuations fluctuate. Industry Coalition Challenges Methodology Strive Asset Management also submitted opposition on December 6 , with CEO Matt Cole arguing that the proposal misunderstands the role of Bitcoin-focused firms in AI infrastructure. Miners, including MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8, are retooling data centers for high-intensity AI workloads. “ Many analysts argue that the AI race is increasingly limited by access to power, not semiconductors, ” Cole wrote. Strive proposed a parallel “ex-digital asset treasury” index version, allowing selective avoidance while maintaining full market exposure for others. For now, BitcoinForCorporations’ petition opposing the exclusion has gathered over 1,000 signatures, while Bitwise Asset Management has also voiced its support for the strategy, arguing “ the power of a great index lies in its neutrality .” Bitwise supports @Strategy inclusion in MSCI's Global Investable Market Indexes. https://t.co/TXtKb8SvAN pic.twitter.com/sOa4v6sCyh — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 11, 2025 Financial Impact Analysis Reveals Concentrated Risk Before now, JPMorgan analysts have previously estimated that Strategy alone could face $2.8 billion in outflows, with $9 billion of its market capitalization held by passive funds. BitcoinForCorporations’ analysis projects total forced selling between $10 billion and $15 billion, with tracking error ranging from 15 to 150 basis points, depending on volatility, particularly harmful to institutional mandates with 20 to 50 basis point tracking tolerances. Source: BitcoinForCorporation The preliminary list includes 18 current constituents representing $98 billion in float-adjusted market capitalization facing immediate removal, accounting for 87% of total capital impact. An additional 21 non-constituents, worth $15 billion, face permanent exclusion, representing massive pre-emptive blocking in MSCI’s methodology. Strategy accounts for 74.5% of the total impacted market cap at $84.1 billion. Implementation costs are estimated between $50 million and $225 million across index families, with turnover costs ranging from 5 to 25 basis points. The MSCI ACWI faces the highest estimated impact, ranging from $55 million to $225 million. Speaking with Cryptonews, Farzam Ehsani, Co-founder and CEO of VALR, explained that markets are pricing in potential forced flows. “ The market is assessing not only the likelihood of a decline in stock prices of companies whose balance sheets are tied to Bitcoin’s movements, but also potential chain reactions within funds using these indices as benchmarks, ” Ehsani said. Affected companies collectively hold over $137 billion in digital assets. The industry awaits MSCI’s January 15 decision. Strategy urged MSCI to reject the proposal, stating “ the wiser course is for MSCI to remain neutral and let the markets decide the course of DATs. “ The post MSCI Index Changes Could Force $15B Crypto Treasury Selloff appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-18 11:27:35

The project that yields the most gains at times is not the one that shouts loudly, but it grows in the silence when everybody seems to be searching other places. When the movement continues growing without significant scandals, it can become indicative of something greater in action. Such has been happening now. A fresh DeFi crypto has been on a consistent 300% run that it doesn’t go unnoticed by top altcoin traders, who now inquire as to why the action is weathering stronger than others do. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been developing in its initial phase with abnormal regularity. The token sale commenced in 2025 at the start of the year at $0.01 and has gone through stages in a structured manner. MUTM is priced at $0.035 in presale which is a 2.5x increase compared to its initial value. Early entrants at the first stage are placed to see MUTM by up to 500% appreciation at the formal launch price of $0.06. Involvement has increased with advance in price. It has raised more than $19.4M, employed over 18,500 holders and already close to 820M tokens have been dispatched. The portion allocated to early distribution out of a set 4B total supply amounts to 45.5% meaning that this portion of the early window has already been filled at a huge percentage. The allocation of Phase 6 is already over 99% which indicates that demand has not diminished, instead, it has increased. These numbers have behind them an articulate product objective. Mutuum finance is a decentralized lending protocol that is developing on utility. The platform will enable users to provide assets, receive yield and borrow in conditions that are flexible and adapt to market requirements. It is not a rapid buildup that has led to growth, but a consistent participation. V1 Launch and The Token Model In official statements made on X by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team, a lending and borrowing protocol is to be launched in L1 with V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia testnet in the fourth quarter of 2025. Some of the features that come with this release are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and a bot liquidator. ETH and USDT will be the initial assets supported. Value moves via the system with the help of the mTokens. Upon providing assets, users are given mtTokens which increase in value with the accumulation of interest. These mtTokens are stackable in the safety module and participation is directly linked to protocol incentives. Projections in a bullish environment reveal that MUTM could be overriding its Launch value of $0.06 when it reaches V1 and has been put to use. Next Growth Phase Further into the future, Mutuum Finance will have long-term expansion infrastructure according to the official roadmap. Borrower interest-backed stablecoin is considered one of the major elements. This introduces a less volatile asset into the ecosystem and helps the activity under various market conditions. Price accurateness is crucial to lending. The roadmap of Mutuum Finance suggests a strong oracle infrastructure, Chainlink data feeds, and fallback and aggregated ones. The instruments assist in ensuring fair prices, reasonable overcollateralisation and systematic liquidations. Expansion of layer-2 will also take place. The key to scaling the lending activity is lower fees and quicker transactions. Market commentators believe that protocols which have a readiness to layer-2 integration tend to have more advantage when crypto investment is more cost-conscious. According to these developments, the further rise of 300-400% above current increases could also be projected in the same line as per the projections of some analysts in case of its further adoption into 2026. Such crypto projections presuppose a consistent implementation and market enlargement. It has been evident that security preparation has existed since the period of development. Mutuum Finance has a score on CertiK Token Scan of 90/100. Halborn Security is now undertaking an independent audit of final loan and borrowing contracts. Another review is the existence of a 50k bug bounty depending on the vulnerability of the code. It has also been a factor of community engagement. Mutual understanding facilitated within a 24-hour leaderboard, where the most active contributor daily wins $500 of MUTM. This maintains high activity as the project reaches the next milestone. The Reason Investors are Paying Attention Now The 300% run spurred on has been a little surprise to many since it has not been an aspect of noise. It has been motivated by the consistent demand, observable improvement, and roadmap. With the largest cap assets faced with a lack of momentum and growth, investors are paying closer attention to new cryptocurrency projects that are yet to grow. And related to crypto news-followers and the question of which crypto to purchase now, Mutuum Finance is one example of a place where it already grows, yet the primary usage stage will be on the second level. It is that mixture that is attracting the attention of the best altcoin investors and why investors are closely observing this run as the market surveys the next cycle.

Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.) said U.S. Democrats plan to introduce a discharge petition early next year to force action on a bill banning Congress members from stock trading. The effort came as House Democrats rallied against a bipartisan bill that would prohibit lawmakers and their immediate family members from trading stocks. House Democrats rallied against a bill introduced by Magaziner and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), dubbed the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which prohibits only lawmakers (excluding the executive branch) and their immediate families from trading stocks. Magaziner mentioned that he has already introduced legislation similar to his bill with Roy that also extends to the president and his deputy. The bill is backed by Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the House minority leader. However, it still remains unclear whether the discharge petition bill will gain support from Republicans. Meanwhile, only five Republicans will be needed to reach the 218-signature mark, even if all 213 Democrats ultimately support the petition. Magaziner says House minority leader backs bill Magaziner said he has introduced a bill similar to the one he proposed with Roy, which extends to the President and his deputy. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backs the bill, although it remains unclear whether the discharge of Bitcoin is open to the public. Magaziner also pointed out that the bill he introduced may not gain enough support from Republicans. “I don’t want to speak for them, but I will say, in general, I think it is possible that some Republicans could support a discharge petition for a bill that also includes the president and the vice president. I would not rule out that possibility.” – Seth Magaziner, U.S. representative for Rhode Island However, Magaziner still believes that it is a possibility, especially towards the end of the year when most Republican representatives get past their primaries. He also noted that most Republican members are retiring and headed for the exit. Luna introduces discharge petition to force action on Magaziner’s bill Rep. Anna Luna (R-Fla) also introduced a bill to force action on Magaziner and Roy’s bill. However, Democrats have remained divided on endorsing it, with only 57 members signing on as of Wednesday. Approximately 15 Republicans have already signed on to it. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) blasted Luna’s effort last week, arguing that any ban needs to be extended to the executive branch of the government. He noted that she should be interested in addressing corruption or taking action against the ongoing crime scene at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. However, Jeffries emphasized that the executive branch should be included in the stock ban . Meanwhile, Magaziner said on Wednesday that he supports both bills and urged everyone to sign them both. Democrats at odds over the Republican-led discharge petition House Democrats are reportedly at odds over the Republican-led discharge petition to ban stock trading by members of Congress. However, some representatives believe that any petition to ban stock trading by Congress members should also apply to the executive branch. Jeffries supports both discharge petitions and urges everyone to sign them. Meanwhile, Democrats have remained divided on endorsing the newly introduced bill, with only 57 users having signed on as well. Jeffries believes that Luna and her colleagues should support extending the ban to the executive branch, which includes President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and perhaps the Supreme Court. On the other hand, lawmakers in both parties agree on the need for reforms regarding stock trading, despite differing on its approach. A discharge petition is typically viewed as a challenge to the House leadership, with a successful effort likely requiring the support of a majority of Democrats. The main question is whether Republicans have the will to partner with Democrats in a bipartisan way.

The partnership is designed to bring institutional-grade protection, independent code review, and continuous security oversight to Tokenizer.Estate’s real estate tokenization infrastructure, giving issuers and investors more confidence in on-chain property deals. What the partnership includes The cooperation between Tokenizer.Estate and Hacken rests on three main pillars. Successfully completed security audit Tokenizer.Estate’s core smart contracts and key components have undergone a dedicated security review by Hacken. The objective of this audit was to ensure that the technology stack used to create and manage tokenized real estate products is robust, predictable, and suitable for institutional use. Any issues identified during the review are addressed by the Tokenizer.Estate team and then re-tested as part of a structured remediation process. Long-term security and compliance partnership Beyond a one-time code check, Tokenizer.Estate and Hacken are establishing an ongoing working relationship. Hacken will act as a security and compliance advisor for future upgrades and product launches, providing: - regular smart contract audits for new modules and releases; - penetration testing for critical o-chain components; - guidance on security best practices for RWA platforms; - support in communicating the platform’s security posture to institutional Stakeholders. For Tokenizer.Estate users, this transforms security from a one-o milestone into a continuous process embedded in the product roadmap. Legal and regulatory advisory for Tokenizer.Estate clients As part of the collaboration, Tokenizer.Estate clients also gain access to legal and regulatory advisory through Hacken’s advisory practice and its partner network. This includes support with licensing, legal structuring, and tax for RWA and tokenization projects — from jurisdiction and SPV selection to aligning deals with evolving regulatory frameworks. By combining technical security audits with legal and compliance support, the partnership is designed to help issuers structure real estate tokenization projects that are both secure and regulator-ready. About Tokenizer.Estate Tokenizer.Estate is a white-label platform for real estate tokenization and analytics, built for property developers, real estate firms, investment funds, high-net-worth individuals, and financial institutions. It combines legal structuring, blockchain-based tokenization, and investor onboarding in a single workflow. Tokenizer.Estate supports the full lifecycle of tokenized real estate — from structuring and issuing digital ownership interests to managing investors, secondary transfers, and ongoing reporting. Issuers can fractionalize assets, onboard global investors under compliant processes, and maintain transparent ownership records in one place. The partnership and its broader context in the RWA market were originally explored in more detail on news.tokenizer.estate . About Hacken Hacken is a blockchain security company providing security services for Web3 and digital-asset projects, including audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. Founded in 2017, the firm positions itself as a long-term security partner focused on making Web3 safer for users, builders, and institutions. Its core services span smart contract and protocol audits for DeFi, L1/L2 networks, RWA and tokenization projects, as well as dApp and infrastructure penetration testing and compliance-oriented Advisory. Why Security Is Critical for Real Estate Tokenization Real estate tokenization is one of the fastest-growing RWA segments, but because tokens are ultimately tied to real buildings, legal structures, tenants and cash flows, the bar for security and compliance is extremely high. Any weakness in smart contracts, access controls or data flows can lead to misallocated ownership, failed redemptions and serious regulatory or reputational damage. As institutional investors and regulated funds move into the space, independent audits and continuous monitoring are becoming a basic requirement — and the Tokenizer.Estate–Hacken partnership is designed to meet that standard and raise the security bar for real estate tokenization platforms.

The move expands the practical use of digital assets for enterprise-level operations, enabling real-time, low-cost, and secure transactions. In its press release published on Thursday, BNB Chain announced its partnership with AWS, signed earlier this year, will include a BNB payment system, which now provides companies with an alternative to traditional banking methods. Binance and AWS are helping organizations bypass costly third-party payment processors through BNB payments, reducing transaction fees by up to 70% and offering near-instant settlements. BPN’s architecture enables secure, transparent, and programmable settlement that will be integrated directly into AWS billing workflows for businesses globally. Rica Fu, founder of BPN, revealed that the network tests the scalability of digital assets in enterprise payments, which has proven to be viable enough for AWS users. “BPN delivers secure transaction processing designed specifically for institutional and retail businesses operating at high volumes,” the BPN CEO said. Head of Business Development at BNB Chain, Sarah Song, supported Fu’s comments, saying: “Through this integration, AWS customers gain access to fast, low-cost payments with global reach, while BNB strengthens its presence as a practical payment asset used in crypto-native and mainstream enterprise environments. This opens the door for more companies to integrate on-chain payments into their operations.” The integration comes two months after BPN secured $50 million in seed funding to develop a global stablecoin payment platform on BNB Chain . The investment round was led by YZi Labs, formerly known as Binance Labs, and included participation from several undisclosed financial and blockchain investors. BNB integration builds on AWS partnerships in crypto and AI The BPN adoption by AWS adds on to a collaborative effort in October last year, when Binance announced it would use AWS cloud services to improve its user onboarding, customer support, and internal automated diagnostics. Amazon Bedrock and Amazon ECS, both part of the service’s features, were integrated into Binance’s generative AI (GenAI) applications and containerized programs. Amazon Bedrock makes foundation models for building AI applications easily accessible, while Amazon ECS helps users deploy containerized services without scalability issues. At the end of October last year, Binance implemented a GenAI-powered Know Your Customer (KYC) solution, which automates user data entry, performs proof-of-address checks, and speeds up World-Check screenings. A few months after adopting the AWS services, Binance was boasting a 95% recognition rate for user information, an 80% reduction in optical character recognition costs, a 6% uptick in PoA approval rates from more than 100 countries, and a 30% reduction in manual World-Check review time. During the collaboration’s announcement, which came during the AWS-sponsored Binance Blockchain Week 2024, Director of Cloud and AI Innovation Arni Raghvender explained that the crypto exchange had made a transformative choice to integrate generative AI with the Amazon service’s comprehensive cloud services in a complex. “Amazon Bedrock, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Lambda will help Binance to pioneer new approaches to system optimization and automated problem-solving,” Raghvender said. AWS security team discovers crypto mining exploit While AWS adds to its crypto-related offerings, Amazon’s GuardDuty team recently found an ongoing crypto-mining campaign targeting its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Elastic Container Service (ECS). The operation has reportedly been active since November and has so far compromised credentials for Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts. The attackers deployed a Docker Hub image, created in late October and downloaded more than 100,000 times, containing a cryptominer known as SBRMiner-MULTI. According to the GuardDuty researchers, the image automatically launched mining operations when containers were started. After the launch, the hackers begin mining while reviewing EC2 quotas and IAM permissions to maximize resource utilization. Amazon mentioned that the campaign used a persistence mechanism, including the “ModifyInstanceAttribute” command in EC2 instances to disable API termination. While termination protection prevented accidental shutdowns, it complicated incident response and disrupted automated remediation controls. Speaking to Bleeping Computer, AWS representatives said the web service took proactive measures to detect the mining exploit and notified affected customers of the threat. The malicious Docker Hub image has been removed from the platform; however, Amazon notes that hackers could still create similar images under different names or publisher accounts.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-and-hbar-are-now-institution-safe-assets-heres-the-latest/,"A recent statement from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been interpreted by crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull as a meaningful turning point for institutional engagement with digital assets, particularly XRP and Hedera’s HBAR. According to the commentary, the significance lies not in policy speculation or market optimism, but in the language now being used by the country’s primary securities regulator when addressing public blockchain infrastructure. The assessment focuses on comments made by SEC Chair Paul Atkins in an accompanying video, where he stated that public blockchains provide a level of transparency that surpasses traditional financial systems. He explained that every movement of value on these networks is permanently recorded on ledgers that are open to public verification. According to X Finance Bull, the SEC Chair’s comment marks a clear shift away from the regulator’s historically cautious approach toward blockchain-based systems. If you understand what the SEC just said, you realize $XRP and $HBAR are now institution-safe assets! The SEC didn’t just approve blockchain. They endorsed it over Wall Street. Chair Atkins just called blockchains “more transparent than any legacy financial system ever… pic.twitter.com/uFlw01KGG8 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 16, 2025 From Regulatory Skepticism to Institutional Viability X Finance Bull characterizes the remarks as an implicit validation of blockchain technology rather than a neutral observation. In the analysis, the acknowledgment of superior transparency is viewed as removing a longstanding barrier that has limited institutional participation: regulatory skepticism. Once that skepticism begins to soften, the justification institutions require to engage with certain networks becomes easier to establish internally. Within this context, the XRP Ledger and the Hedera network are highlighted as beneficiaries of the changing stance. X Finance Bull contends that building on these networks can now be presented as aligned with compliance standards and regulatory expectations. This, in turn, alters how risk committees, legal teams, and capital allocators may evaluate exposure to these ecosystems. Capital Readiness and Infrastructure Implications The commentary places particular emphasis on the distinction between market sentiment and infrastructure readiness. Rather than framing the situation as a price-driven development, X Finance Bull suggests that the implications are structural. When a regulator publicly acknowledges the transparency advantages of public blockchains, the conditions for institutional capital deployment change at a foundational level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The argument further asserts that markets have historically reacted strongly to signals less explicit than this one. In that light, the SEC chair’s remarks are presented as a clear indicator that regulatory attitudes toward blockchain-based settlement and record-keeping are evolving, with direct consequences for networks positioned around enterprise use cases. X Finance Bull concludes that the shift may not be gradual. Institutional transitions, once regulatory cover is established, often occur rapidly. From this perspective, the current environment represents a limited period during which positioning can take place before broader adoption accelerates. For XRP and HBAR , the analysis suggests that the conversation has moved beyond legitimacy into execution. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On December 17, YoungHoon Kim, who is widely cited as having the world’s highest recorded IQ at 276, said he believes XRP could surpass Ethereum’s market capitalization by 2026. The statement comes as XRP regains relevance following regulatory clarity, renewed institutional interest, and expanding network integrations. “In my view, XRP could surpass the market cap of ETH by 2026,” Kim wrote on X, formerly Twitter, adding a disclaimer that the view was not financial advice and encouraged independent research. In my view, #XRP could surpass the market cap of #ETH by 2026. (NFA / DYOR) — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 17, 2025 XRP price At the time of publication on December 18, XRP was trading at $1.87, giving the token a market capitalization of approximately $113 billion.

He noted that interoperability and expanding use cases could play a key role in altering long-standing market dynamics between major layer one networks. The prediction also marks a notable change in Kim’s public stance on digital assets. Previously aligned with Bitcoin ( BTC ) maximalist views, he has since become increasingly vocal about XRP’s potential, framing the token as structurally undervalued relative to its utility and regulatory positioning, saying the token could “reach $100 over the next 5 years.” The post World’s highest IQ predicts XRP to flip Ethereum’s market cap by 2026 appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-12-18 11:48:54

While most users focus on collateral and liquidation risk, the choice between fixed and floating rates often determines whether a loan remains manageable over time. Understanding how these models work—and how platforms implement them—is key to borrowing efficiently. Clapp.Finance approaches this question differently, combining a flexible credit-line structure with a rate model designed around actual capital usage rather than static loans. Fixed Rates: Cost Certainty A fixed interest rate stays unchanged for the duration of a loan. Once you borrow, the rate is locked in, regardless of shifts in market demand or liquidity. This model offers predictability. Borrowers know exactly how much interest they will pay and can plan long-term strategies without worrying about rate spikes. The trade-off is cost. Fixed rates are usually set higher to compensate lenders for taking on market risk, and borrowers do not benefit if broader rates fall. In crypto lending, fixed rates are often paired with rigid loan terms, including predefined repayment schedules and limited flexibility once the loan is active. Floating Rates: Market-Driven Pricing Floating rates adjust dynamically based on supply, demand, and platform utilization. When liquidity is abundant, rates tend to fall. When demand rises, they increase. This model can reduce borrowing costs, especially in calm market conditions. At the same time, it requires more attention. Rates can change quickly, and borrowers must be comfortable managing variability in their interest expenses. Floating rates in crypto lending align pricing more closely with real market conditions, but without proper structure, they can introduce uncertainty. How Clapp Applies Floating Rates Differently Clapp does not operate with traditional fixed-term crypto loans. Instead, it uses a credit-line model. Users secure a borrowing limit with their collateral, but interest accrues only on the amount actually withdrawn, not on the full credit line. Any unused portion of the limit carries 0% APR, and repaid amounts immediately restore available credit. The annual rate is floating and depends on LTV, yet it remains among the lowest in the market. This structure keeps pricing transparent and directly tied to risk, without charging users for idle liquidity. Flexibility Beyond Rates Clapp’s model extends beyond interest mechanics. Borrowers can combine up to 19 different assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins—into a single credit line. There is no fixed repayment schedule, and funds can be drawn or released at any time directly from the Clapp Wallet. This means liquidity is available 24/7, collateral remains accessible, and borrowing adapts to real needs rather than predefined loan terms. Fixed vs Floating, Reframed In traditional crypto lending, fixed versus floating rates is a binary choice between predictability and flexibility. Clapp reframes this by separating access to credit from interest accrual. You secure liquidity upfront but pay only when you actually use it. The result is a borrowing framework designed around borrower control. Interest reflects real usage, risk is managed through LTV, and capital remains fluid rather than locked. Final Thoughts The crypto lending landscape increasingly values transparency, efficiency, and user autonomy. Among current providers, Clapp stands out with its credit-line structure, pay-as-you-use interest model, low LTV-based rates, and multi-collateral flexibility. For users seeking liquidity without forced selling, rigid repayment schedules, or unnecessary interest costs, this approach offers a practical and cost-efficient alternative to standard crypto loans.

While short-term market movements continue to capture attention, deeper on-chain signals are beginning to suggest a change in how holders are positioning themselves. Historically, such developments tend to emerge before meaningful volatility, not after it. This evolving trend was recently highlighted by Xaif, whose on-chain observation has drawn renewed focus to XRP balances on Binance . As the largest exchange by trading volume, Binance often provides early insight into broader market behavior, making changes in its reserves particularly significant. XRP Reserves on Binance Hit Multi-Month Lows Recent on-chain data indicate that XRP reserves on Binance have dropped to their lowest levels in several months . This decline is not the result of a single outflow event, but rather a steady reduction over time. Such a pattern points to intentional withdrawals rather than short-term trading repositioning. BINANCE XRP RESERVES ARE DRAINING XRP on Binance just hit multi-month low exchange reserves Supply leaving exchanges Coins moving to cold wallets Less sell pressure = supply shock setup Last time reserves dropped this hard… XRP didn’t stay quiet for long https://t.co/jPMsE0gn21 pic.twitter.com/o6zoG6A7F9 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 18, 2025 When a major exchange sees reserves drop, it reflects a shift in holder intent. Instead of preparing assets for sale, investors appear to be moving XRP into private custody, signaling reduced willingness to sell at current price levels. Supply Leaving Exchanges Alters Market Dynamics Exchange reserves play a critical role in determining immediate sell pressure. Tokens held on exchanges can be sold instantly, while those moved to cold wallets are effectively removed from near-term circulation. As reserves decline, available supply tightens, increasing the market’s sensitivity to changes in demand. This behavior is often associated with accumulation phases, where holders anticipate future appreciation or choose to wait out broader market uncertainty. Over time, reduced exchange liquidity can create conditions that favor sharper price movements. Why Falling Reserves Raise Supply Shock Discussions A supply shock occurs when demand rises against a backdrop of limited available supply. While declining reserves alone do not guarantee price increases, they reshape the market environment. With fewer XRP tokens readily accessible on Binance, even moderate buying pressure can produce amplified price responses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Declining XRP exchange reserves often precede volatility, not prolonged consolidation. Traders closely monitor reserve data because these phases usually end with sharp price moves. Placing the Trend Within XRP’s Broader Outlook The timing of this reserve decline is notable. XRP has recently faced technical pressure , while long-term fundamentals remain a topic of debate. In such conditions, on-chain data often provides clarity when price action sends mixed signals. What the data currently confirms is behavior, not certainty. Holders are withdrawing XRP from exchanges, reducing immediate sell-side availability, and reshaping liquidity conditions across the market. What Comes Next for XRP Moving forward, demand will determine how this setup resolves. If buying interest strengthens while exchange reserves remain low, volatility could return quickly. If demand remains muted, the impact of reduced supply may unfold more gradually. For now, the continued drain of XRP from Binance suggests declining sell pressure and growing holder conviction. As past market cycles have shown, XRP rarely stays inactive for long once liquidity dynamics begin to shift in this direction.

Traditional bank loans remain slow, bureaucratic, and dependent on credit scores—systems that often fail to reflect the financial reality of digital-asset holders. In 2026, crypto credit lines are becoming a streamlined alternative, offering instant loans with no credit checks and full control over repayment. These borrowing tools allow users to unlock stablecoin or fiat liquidity using their crypto as collateral while maintaining exposure to long-term market growth. The model is simple, efficient, and built around transparent collateral management rather than traditional underwriting. This article explains how crypto credit lines work , why they differ from standard loans, and which platforms in 2026 offer the most reliable, flexible borrowing experience. What Is a Crypto Credit Line? A crypto credit line is a revolving credit facility backed by digital assets such as BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, or stablecoins. Instead of receiving a fixed loan, borrowers receive a credit limit they can draw from any time. Unlike bank loans: No credit score or income verification is required Approval is near-instant once collateral is deposited Interest applies only to what you actually borrow No fixed repayment schedule is imposed The result is an on-demand liquidity tool that adapts to the borrower’s needs, not the other way around. How Crypto Credit Lines Work The mechanics are straightforward: Deposit Collateral Users transfer supported crypto assets to the platform. The platform calculates a credit limit using a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Withdraw Instantly Borrowers can draw funds in stablecoins or fiat whenever needed. There is no obligation to use the entire limit. Pay Interest Only on Withdrawn Amounts Unused credit sits at 0% APR on platforms like Clapp that supports pay-as-you-use models. Repay Anytime Borrowers can repay partially or fully at any time. Once repaid, the credit becomes instantly available again. Retrieve Collateral When the outstanding balance is zero, collateral can be withdrawn. This revolving structure gives borrowers flexibility that does not exist in traditional loans. Clapp: A Leading Example of Modern Crypto Credit Lines Among credit-line providers, Clapp stands out for delivering one of the most flexible and cost-efficient borrowing solutions in 2026. No Credit Checks Required Clapp’s onboarding is entirely collateral-based. Users secure their limit with USDT, BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, or other supported assets—no credit score, income documents, or lengthy verification cycles. Pay-As-You-Use Interest Interest is charged only on the amount withdrawn, while unused credit carries 0% APR. With a low annual interest rate, Clapp is competitive even against traditional bank financing. Instant Liquidity in USDT, USDC, or EUR Funds are available around the clock, and European users benefit from native EUR withdrawals without conversion friction. Multi-Collateral Support Clapp supports 19 different collateral assets, allowing borrowers to diversify and optimize their collateral portfolio in a single credit line. No Repayment Deadlines Borrowers choose how and when to repay. Once a payment is made, the credit line refreshes instantly. Clapp’s combination of speed, flexibility, low cost, and multi-asset collateral makes it one of the strongest credit-line providers in Europe and beyond. When Crypto Credit Lines Are the Right Solution Crypto credit lines are ideal when borrowers: need instant, frictionless liquidity want to avoid selling crypto during volatile markets prefer flexible repayment without deadlines want to control borrowing costs through pay-as-you-use interest require ongoing access to stablecoins or EUR aim to manage taxes efficiently by avoiding asset sales They are especially useful for long-term holders, traders, business operators, and anyone who prioritizes flexibility and speed. Final Thoughts In 2026, crypto credit lines have evolved into a reliable, mainstream alternative to traditional loans. Their speed, simplicity, and borrower-centric structure—combined with no credit checks and flexible repayment—make them one of the most effective liquidity tools for digital-asset holders. Platforms like Clapp demonstrate how modern credit lines can deliver instant, low-cost financing backed by crypto without forcing users to sell their long-term investments.

MSTY's covered-call strategy on MSTR exposes investors to leveraged Bitcoin volatility, with a -45% total return over the past year. Distributions are largely return of capital, not sustainable income, and the ETF's structure risks ongoing book value destruction. I recommend selling MSTY, as its excessive yield is unsustainable and the risk/reward profile is unattractive for most investors. My Sell Thesis For The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is part of a family of covered-call ETFs that offer you a stellar distribution yield, currently of 110.69% (this is the published distribution yield on the website of YieldMax. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is part of a new group of high-yield, weekly-paying ETFs that invest basically only into one company, or build a long position in a business via structured products, like Swaps and other derivatives. MSTY is a highly risky ETF tool with which you can bet big on Strategy ( MSTR ), although the performance record shows that this is not necessarily what you should be doing. Strategy is a business that is building a major Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury that recently consisted of as much as 650,000 Bitcoin. The devastating net asset value decline in the last year and high Bitcoin volatility itself, however, preclude me from seeing MSTY as a reasonable investment. Strategy-Related Investment With 100% Distribution Yield The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF rises far above the shoulders of other ETFs, as it has become a popular vehicle for some to invest in Strategy and Bitcoin. If you take into consideration that an S&P 500 investment in the long-run returned an average of between 10-12% annually, the yield is almost too good to be true. And if you factor in total returns, including BV losses, then MSTY becomes quite a bad investment. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF allows you to benefit from a long position in Strategy which is a significant holder of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Strategy has become notorious for making debt-financed Bitcoin purchases using billions of dollars in the last couple of years. Strategy’s unprecedented spending spree on this cryptocurrency has left the business with a treasure including 650,000 Bitcoin which Strategy has said is equal to 3.1% of the outstanding Bitcoin supply. As of 09/30/2025 the holdings in the crypto realm were worth $73.2 billion to Strategy, though this fair value could be either much higher or much lower, depending on where the crypto market heads next. Digital Assets (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF) Strategy is not only the biggest corporate owner of Bitcoin, but the business is among the top five companies by size of their treasuries. Strategy has a bigger treasury, thanks to its Bitcoin holdings, than some of the most profitable companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple or Meta. Strategy's Bitcoin Holdings (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF) Strategy is one of the biggest acquirers of Bitcoin and the business, due to the inherent price volatility of the cryptocurrency, is going to see considerable earnings and share price volatility in the future which will make MSTY an investment that will experience sharp valuation upside and downside depending on the prevailing moods in the cryptocurrency market. It is worth noting that the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF does not own Strategy shares, but rather owns a large position in U.S. Treasuries and then sells call options or call spreads on Strategy. The main purposes of employing this covered-call strategy is to procure income from selling options while giving you exposure to Strategy’s shares. MSTY’s and MSTR’s performances since inception are compared below. As you can easily see, an investment in Strategy (the blue line) widely and consistently outperformed an investment in MSTY (the red line) on a total return basis. In plain words: if you wanted to have MSTR exposure in the past, you would have done significantly better simply owning MSTR instead of seeking exposure via MSTY. Total Return Chart (Totalrealreturns.com) High Potential For Capital Loss While the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF earned an early investor 52% since inception in February 2024, the one-year return is significantly worse at -45%. Bitcoin has pulled back from recent highs, pulling down values for MSTR and MSTY down with it. Since Strategy buys Bitcoin’s mostly with debt, an investment in Strategy is essentially a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. The high BV loss potential for MSTY is related to the ETF writing covered-call options for income and risking paying out more money than MSTY actually earns. This exposes you to the risk of potentially severe future capital losses. NAV Performance (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF) High-yield, covered-call ETFs write call options aggressively in order to lock in premium income. This income is paid to the ETF’s shareowners as a dividend, and in the case of the MSTY each week. However, a large portion of the distributed cash counts as a return of capital and is not actual distribution income for investors. The problem with YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, and ETFs that deploy a similar investment strategy, is that in the long-term the fund’s book value erodes which reduces the substance of the ETF. The inevitable consequence is that 100% distribution yields, like the one that MSTY offers, are ultimately not sustainable and will have to get down-sized. Suitability, High Risk Of NAV Losses The MSTY is only for hardcore investors that understand the risk and inherent volatility of such an aggressively structured ETF. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has a sad performance chart, to be frank, losing about 45% in the last year. Single-name, covered-call ETFs are not a really strong products, in my opinion, and suitable only for very few people that have strong market timing skills and want to use MSTY as a vehicle to earn excess income at the risk of consistent BV erosion. Considering that MSTY is losing money on a NAV basis, I believe the value proposition itself is not particularly attractive. My Verdict: Don’t Fall For The Yield, Sell YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is part of an increasingly popular group of single-name ETFs that adopt aggressively covered-call strategies in order to create income out of their underlying long position. While the ETF indeed advertises its 100% yield on its website, a closer look at the total return performance highlights that the ETF is not nearly as successful as the yield may make it seem. MSTY’s total return on BV in the last year was -45% which is not exactly a performance to be proud of. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, in my opinion, should be avoided as a high-risk ETF as it relies on structured products and has the potential to introduce significant volatility in your portfolio, especially if Bitcoin starts to tank and hits new lows. MSTY’s covered-call income is not sustainable, in my opinion, and its excessive yield will ultimately force the ETF to continue to risk the erosion of its book value. The logical consequence is that the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF may have a distribution yield of 100%, but the yield may prove to be much more fantastical than fantastic when the ETF inevitably lower its dividend income.",MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-18 12:08:47

Optimistic Rollups, ZK Rollups, major Layer 1 upgrades like The Merge and The Dencun upgrade (EIP-4844), and other Layer 2 scaling solutions have helped transform Ethereum from a congested base layer into the core of a rapidly growing multi-layer ecosystem. The question is no longer if scaling for Ethereum will be possible, but what type of scaling will be implemented next? Which implementation will affect where developers build? How will rollup economics affect liquidity and value flows on-chain? Let’s take a look at some key predictions that will accelerate Layer 2 adoption and define the next wave of Ethereum scaling in 2026. Why 2026 is a critical year for Ethereum scaling Surge in L2 adoption from 2023 to 2025 Layer 2 Total Value Locked has grown sharply since 2023. At the time, L2s collectively held just under $4 billion in value. By October 2025, that figure had climbed to roughly $47 billion. Daily transactions on L2s have followed suit, recording as high as 1.9 million transactions per day in 2025, eclipsing the Ethereum mainnet. The trend observed between 2023 and 2025 tells one story: a major shift is underway. Developers and users are increasingly turning to L2s for high-throughput use cases. Ethereum hits mainstream payment & consumer applications Between 2024 and 2025, Ethereum L2s experienced a surge in real-world use cases, with Base emerging as Coinbase’s consumer-focused rollup and a dominant network for Farcaster and lightweight SocialFi experiences. Likewise, gaming studios such as Atari, Lotte Group, Nexon, and Sky Mavis have adopted app-specific chains to reduce fees and enhance execution performance. This is not limited to gaming studios. Prediction markets, stablecoin payments, and tokenized real-world assets have also found sustainable homes on rollups, where gas costs no longer prohibit experimentation. Bottlenecks Despite the growth of Layer 2 solutions, which has resulted in improved transaction speeds and lower costs, certain scaling bottlenecks, such as data availability (DA), bridging efficiency, and price fragmentation, remain. The process of storing data required for transaction verification, in comparison to execution, is expensive, creating a scenario where many are shopping for cheaper data availability layers. Likewise, liquidity movement across Layer 2 bridges can often be subject to delays or require extra trust in third-party providers, which can sometimes complicate the process or expose users to risk. Ever heard about the same assets, like ETH, BTC, and USDT, existing on different chains, and with variable pricing? That’s liquidity fragmentation – an occurrence that reduces capital efficiency, spreads liquidity thin, and increases slippage, often forcing users to hop from one network to another, hunting for the best price. These bottlenecks form the backdrop for the major predictions ahead. The current state of layer 2s Total L2 TVL According to data from L2BEAT , the total L2 TVL at the start of 2025 was about $44B. It peaked at $49B in October, and in December, the value is at about $38B. Arbitrum One leads the pack with approximately 44% of L2 total value locked, followed by Base Chain at 33%, OP Mainnet at 6%, and Lighter at 3.5%. The remaining TVL is distributed across ZKsync Era and emerging chains like Linea, Ink, Katana, and Starknet. Collectively, these networks support millions of daily active users. Rise of consumer appchains Consumer-focused appchains are emerging. They are designed and optimized around user experience, rather than strict decentralization trade-offs. Ethereum L2s like Base, Mantle, Blast, and Linea focus on simplified onboarding, low fees, and fast finality. Base, in particular, has become a general-purpose consumer chain and a soft entry point for non-crypto audiences. It leverages Coinbase’s infrastructure and integrates seamlessly with its 100 million+ users. Modular L2 ecosystem expansion As rollups scale, the modular blockchain thesis has gained traction, emphasizing the separation of execution, settlement, and data availability. Dedicated DA layers emerged as rollups sought alternatives to Ethereum’s limited and expensive DA capacity. Celestia, the first purpose-built data availability blockchain, offers significantly lower costs than Ethereum by focusing exclusively on DA and leveraging data availability sampling. EigenDA approaches the problem differently by using Ethereum restaking to create a scalable DA layer secured by economic guarantees rather than native execution. This model enables a more flexible DA marketplace while maintaining close alignment with Ethereum’s security assumptions. By 2025, additional DA solutions such as Near DA and Avail expanded the ecosystem, giving rollups a growing menu of DA options optimized for lower costs, higher throughput, and varying trust tradeoffs. Starknet & zkSync’s progress Zero-knowledge rollups have matured significantly. Starknet improved throughput via Volition, Cairo optimizations, and compressed proofs. It also proved to be production-ready for complex applications, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming. Likewise, zkSync expanded with Hyperchains, scaled to handle over 100 transactions per second with sub-cent fees, and enabled L3 networks to deploy with customizable execution environments. OP Superchain vision rollout The Superchain is a long-term vision for Optimism to create a network of OP Stack blockchains that are connected, interoperable, and share standards, infrastructure, and governance. The idea is to get multiple isolated chains to behave like a single ecosystem. Networks like Base, Zora, Frax, and Mode are part of the evolving ecosystem. Also, developers can now build rollups that are compatible with Superchain standards. It is important to note that not all OP Stack chains are fully integrated with every Superchain feature. Many are at different stages and not yet configured for messaging or shared sequencing. Also, certain interoperability features are not yet fully realized. By 2026, this vision could converge further into practical interoperability. Prediction #1 — ZK Rollups become the default for high-value transactions Lower proving costs By design, Zero-knowledge rollups offer better privacy, security, and faster finality when compared to Optimistic rollups. However, proving on ZK rollups is complex and computationally expensive. This means ZK rollups, at the moment, are not an economically viable option for low-value transfers and high-frequency consumer transactions. Having said that, several implementations are already underway to reduce ZK’s costs. These include decentralized proving marketplaces, algorithmic improvements to reduce compute per transaction, a shift to hardware acceleration (GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs), and parallelized proving that splits proof generation across multiple machines. Additionally, a major structural unlock, such as recursive ZK proofs, is also in the works. A full-scale implementation of these approaches by 2026 is expected to narrow the cost gap, making ZK rollups economically competitive for a wider range of applications, including low-value and high-throughput transactions. Faster finality Optimistic rollups (ORs), by design, assume transaction validity and rely on a fraud-proof system with a 7-day dispute window. While this execution seems simple and cheap, finality takes a long time, and withdrawals are delayed. ZK rollups, on the other hand, offer instant finality and quick withdrawals, albeit at a higher computational cost at the moment. However, the speed of finality offered by ZK rollups will be a competitive advantage, especially for institutional settlements, cross-chain transfers, and high-value DeFi operations. zkEVM maturity With multiple zkEVM implementations expected to reach production maturity in 2026, the execution gap between zkEVMs and native EVM chains is expected to narrow even further. Scroll matures into a stable, production-ready zkEVM with strong developer mindshare. Polygon zkEVM integrates deeply with the Polygon AggLayer architecture. zkSync Era runs a robust L2 with expanding L3 deployments. Institutional adoption of ZK-based L2s Zero-knowledge Layer 2 scaling solution offers security, privacy, settlement certainty, easier proof-based auditing, and lower bridging risks. Institutions that prioritize these features will increasingly look to zk-based systems. Big banks, mainstream payment processors, and even asset managers fall into this category and will likely take decisive steps towards building core applications on Zk-based Layer 2s. Prediction #2 — Massive growth in L3s and app-specific rollups Why apps prefer owning the full stack By 2026, a lot of successful decentralized applications will launch their own app-specific Layer 3s, in a bid to “own the full stack.” In simple terms, “owning the full stack” means that applications have direct control over fees, performance, and are not dependent on shared Layer 2s. They can abstract or subsidize gas, use stablecoins or custom tokens for payments, isolate themselves from network congestion, and capture all sequencer fees. For high-volume applications like games, prediction markets, and decentralized social protocols, a migration to OP Stack L3s or Arbitrum Orbit is likely. On-chain gaming L3s, DeFi-specific rollups Layer 3s are generally understood as app-specific rollups that live on top of L2s. They grant developers the ability to make specific changes to execution environments, adjust fee models, and tune performance. All of these are ideal for use cases where extreme throughput, predictable execution, and custom logic are required. For instance, an on-chain massive multiplayer role-playing video game or MMORPG requires frequent micro-interactions and executes thousands of state updates every second. A Layer 3 can batch and optimize these actions efficiently. But on a general-purpose L2, such workloads will struggle with network congestion, variable fees, and competition for blockspace. Similarly, high-performance DeFi protocols like RFQ systems, options, and perpetual exchanges have needs that general Layer 2 networks, at the moment, do not optimize for, but L3s can facilitate. These needs include predictable execution, flexible liquidation logic, more control over transaction ordering, and the ability to capture MEV internally. Arbitrum Orbit, OP Stack, zkSync Hyperchains Arbitrum Orbit allows developers to create tailored chains that settle to Arbitrum, inheriting its security and tooling. The OP Stack already powers dozens of chains beyond Optimism itself, enabling networks like Base to emerge quickly and scale fast. zkSync Hyperchains offer a ZK-powered path for deploying app-specific rollups with strong security guarantees. Together, these frameworks lower the complexity of launching new chains. By 2026, launching a rollup may approach the simplicity of deploying a smart contract, potentially sparking an explosion of specialized chains built for DeFi, gaming, RWAs, AI agents, high-speed trading, and more. EVM standardization for L3 development As new Layer 3 networks emerge, those already adhering to EVM standards will likely remain compatible with existing developer and user tooling. This means that developers can deploy Vyper or Solidity smart contracts without having to rewrite code. They can use existing tool stacks like MetaMask, Foundry, and The Graph, and rely on familiar workflows. In the case of users, it simply means the same wallet works across chains, transactions feel familiar, and there is no steep learning curve every time they try a new network. By reducing the barrier to development and adoption, Ethereum Virtual Machine standardization for Layer 3s increases the likelihood that they will scale and integrate smoothly into the broader Ethereum environment. Prediction #3 — Data availability wars intensify Celestia vs EigenDA vs Ethereum’s Danksharding By 2026, data availability is likely to become a competitive market. Celestia is projected to gain traction due to its low cost and modular data availability, which is favored by gaming L3s. On the other hand, EigenDA’s competitive advantage will be its Ethereum-aligned security guarantees via restaking. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s danksharding roadmap continues to add more DA capacity, which in turn lowers costs while still retaining Ethereum’s security. The result is a multi-tier DA landscape in which rollups select DA solutions based on their specific cost, security, and performance requirements rather than relying on a single provider. Cost differences drive L2 migration Data availability represents 90% of L2 operating costs post-EIP-4844. We expect rollups to increasingly choose DA layers not based on ideology but economics. In other words: Lower DA cost = lower rollup fees = more users. This leads to the first major migrations between DA providers. DA becomes the new scaling bottleneck For rollups, batching will improve, execution will become more cost-effective, and fees are expected to decrease in 2026. Which means there will be more rollups posted back to Ethereum . The outcome of this? Blockspaces are quickly used up because Ethereum data availability (DA) is finite and expensive. Hence, DA becomes the new bottleneck limiting the efficiency of rollup operations. This constraint will drive innovation towards better data compression and validity proof schemes that minimize DA requirements. Modular blockchains evolve into DA marketplaces By late 2026, Data Availability no longer behaves like a static service, but it operates like a cloud computing marketplace. We’ll see variable demand-based pricing, competing fee schedules, different latency, trust, and security profiles. And the implication? Rollups will be able to select DA providers the same way developers choose between AWS, Google Cloud, or Cloudflare, based on cost, performance, and reliability. Prediction #4 — The Superchain / unified liquidity vision gets real OP Superchain goes live across multiple chains The Superchain is Optimism’s vision of getting many independent L2 chains to operate as a coordinated system. Layer 2 networks like Mode, Base, Metal, and the OP Mainnet are built on the OP Stack, which means that core components like messaging, execution, and upgrades are standardized across the board. The fact that shared standards exist means that these chains can coordinate governance decisions, adopt common interoperability layers, and eventually move towards shared security and sequencing models. As this coordination improves, cross-chain liquidity is expected to deepen, and bridges become less visible to users. Shared sequencing By 2026, shared sequencing could enable atomic actions across multiple chains within a single transaction flow. A user could swap on Base, add liquidity on Optimism, and open a position on Mode, all at once, with every step succeeding or reverting together. This brings back Ethereum’s synchronous feel across the Superchain and removes the fragmentation that has slowed multi-chain DeFi . Liquidity fragmentation reduces The biggest user experience failure of 2024-2025 was fragmentation. Users have ETH on Base but can’t buy an NFT on Optimism without bridging. With the OP Superchain and similar shared architectures, liquidity becomes pooled across member chains. Market makers can deploy capital once and serve multiple networks, while traders tap into unified order books no matter which chain they’re on. Coinbase/Base plays a major role Base is expected to become the most widely used Layer 2 solution by 2026. Its massive Coinbase-powered user base and strong compliance profile make it the biggest onboarding funnel into the Ethereum ecosystem. Base also gains significant influence in Superchain governance and becomes the main hub for regulated, consumer-facing applications. As millions of new users enter through Coinbase, Base’s role in shaping the broader L2 landscape grows even more dominant. Prediction #5 — AI agents drive huge on-chain activity Autonomous agents using L2s for microtransactions As Layer 2 fees continue to fall, they become ideal rails for autonomous agents. Machine-operated systems will be able to make constant microtransactions, pay for APIs, purchase model outputs, verify computations, and coordinate with other agents, all without human involvement. With cheap, permissionless payments and verifiable execution, L2s will emerge as the default economic layer for large-scale multi-agent networks. zk rollups become preferred rails for AI AI systems need verifiable results, privacy-preserving interactions, deterministic settlement, and predictable costs. ZK rollups offer all of these benefits, making them the ideal environment for autonomous agents. As AI-driven applications continue to grow, ZK-based networks will become the preferred execution layer for machine-to-machine transactions and verifiable computing. AI-to-AI payments and coordination systems Interaction between autonomous software agents, especially in the aspects of on-chain transactions, market making, and trading, is already underway today in decentralized finance systems. These AI-to-AI interactions are increasingly extending beyond trading to include participation in governance and payment for data or model access, all without requiring continuous human input. What is currently driving these sorts of interactions? Factors such as fast settlement, programmable execution, and low fees; requirements that are clearly within the capabilities of Layer 2 networks. By 2026, AI-to-AI payments and coordination systems are expected to expand even further. We can expect a growing share of on-chain activity likely to be handled by autonomous systems acting on behalf of users, organizations, and protocols. Early examples: Autonolas, Fetch.ai, Ritual Projects like Autonolas, Fetch.ai, Grass, and Ritual represent early building blocks for machine-to-machine coordination on the blockchain. For instance, Autonolas or Olas is a decentralized platform that facilitates the building, deployment and management of self-acting software entities, otherwise known as autonomous agents, for dApps, DAOs and off-chain services. Fetch.ai also builds networks of autonomous economic agents capable of negotiating, transacting and optimizing outcomes across markets like finance, supply chain and energy. Ritual, meanwhile, focuses on bringing verifiable AI inference on-chain, such that smart contracts are able to trust the output of artificial intelligence models without the need for off-chain processes. While still evolving, these systems collectively highlight a growing trend, which is that blockchain is increasingly becoming a coordination and settlement layer for AI systems – more of which will be seen in 2026. Prediction #6 — Consumer L2s explode Farcaster frames + Base ecosystem Farcaster frames are interactive components embedded in Farcaster posts. Farcaster itself is a decentralized social network. And Base? That’s a leading consumer-focused Layer 2 network. So, what’s the link? Farcaster frames are able to host a variety of mini-applications like quizzes, polls, and live updates for games and products. Other than those, Frames also features the ability to integrate Web3 functionalities directly in social feeds, such that users can mint NFTs, tip creators, check airdrops, and make crypto payments, all within the same UI. For this model to scale, the underlying network needs to be cheap, fast, and reliable. That’s where Base comes in. It makes the in-feed actions on Farcaster feel instant and seamless. Users can smoothly transition between social actions and on-chain transactions without having to interface with the complexities of the blockchain. The market can anticipate the emergence of more of this sort of integration that blurs the lines between financial activity and social interaction in 2026. On-chain games using appchains/L3s Games built fully on-chain require more throughput than what general-purpose Layer-2s currently offer. Elements that demand real-time processing, such as game-state updates, player actions, and asset transfer, often put pressure on shared networks. Application-specific L3s fix this by giving each game its own dedicated blockspace, while allowing developers to customize execution and even subsidize player fees. In 2026, on-chain games are expected to run on their own appchains/L3s, built specifically for high-speed, deeply interactive gameplay. L2s with near-zero fees attract mobile users Fees on Layer 2 are expected to approach zero in 2026. What does this mean for mobile users? Complex on-chain actions become affordable, further driving L2s toward becoming the default platform for global mobile adoption. With advances in compression, proof systems, and sequencing, social interactions, tipping, loyalty rewards, and micro-payments will become everyday on-chain behaviors. UX improvements for non-crypto audiences The goal remains to get users to interact with L2 apps without even knowing what a seed phrase or gas fees mean. Improvements in account abstraction, embedded wallets, and fiat on-ramps in 2026 will make the user experience with Layer 2 apps simpler and more intuitive, akin to a typical Web2 app, with seamless logins and instant actions. Prediction #7 — Ethereum becomes a settlement layer, not a user layer Rollup-centric roadmap fully realized If Vitalik Buterin’s rollup-centric vision approaches full-scale actualization in 2026, the Ethereum mainnet will continue to remain the base layer for security, DA, and settlement, while day-to-day user activity happens on Layer 2 networks . This clear separation lets each layer operate more efficiently. The Ethereum mainnet serves as a settlement layer, while L2s, on the other hand, deliver a fast and low-cost experience. 99% of user activity moves to L2s Almost all everyday activities are expected to shift to Layer 2 networks as they continue to outpace the Ethereum mainnet in terms of transactions, users, and developer deployments. This trend is already visible today and is accelerating quickly. Using Ethereum L1 directly becomes something reserved for large settlements, important governance decisions, or major protocol upgrades. That doesn’t mean Ethereum is failing. In fact, it means the opposite. L1 finally evolves into the secure foundation of the ecosystem, much like the internet’s base protocols that no one interacts with directly. ETH used as gas via EIP-4844 integration Even as user activities are predicted to shift completely to Layer 2s, this does not replace the role of the Ethereum mainnet as the underlying infrastructure. Layer 2s still rely on Ethereum for security and DA. They also post transaction data back to Ethereum for settlement, and pay for execution in ETH. Likewise, validators and sequencers still hold ETH to pay DA fees, submit batches, and settle on L1. It does not matter whether a rollup abstracts gas fees, uses stablecoins, or its own tokens; at its core, it still relies on ETH to operate. This continues to fuel the demand for ETH at the infrastructure level, making it the “reserve asset” of Ethereum’s scaling stack. Institutions settle on Ethereum, transact on L2s An approach to expect will be financial institutions adopting a split model when using Ethereum. What does this mean? In simple terms, every day operations such as internal transfers, small payments, and similar activities that would be too slow or expensive for Layer 1s move to Layer 2s. On the other side, final settlement, balance reconciliation, custody, and similar high-value activities remain on Ethereum, where finality, decentralization, and security are strongest. This gives institutions what they want, which is the security of Layer 1s, the execution of Layer 2s, and predictable compliance frameworks. The split between settling on Ethereum and operating on L2s will become the standard architecture for institutional blockchain use. Prediction #8 — Layer 2 revenue models evolve Sequencer profits grow The role of sequencers is to order, bundle, and ensure that transactions are submitted to Layer 2 networks. In other words, L2 transactions pass through sequencers, which means, by nature, they sit at the center of MEV capture and fee collection. Hence, as Layer 2 adoption accelerates and monthly transaction volumes grow exponentially, sequencers are positioned to grow profit. MEV markets mature Maximal Extractable Value or MEV is the additional value that can be captured by controlling the inclusion, ordering, and exclusion of transactions in a block. This is an area that will see more structure to it in 2026. Naturally, new transaction ordering mechanisms and faster block times will result in more MEV opportunities, albeit requiring coordination and democratization, which platforms like Flashbots already do. Stakeholders can expect an open, transparent and competitive transaction ordering market driven by cross chain MEV auctions and shared sequencers. A mature MEV market will ensure that value extraction aligns well with protocols and users. Additionally, the openness, transparency, and democratization of the market will lead to benefits such as fairer fees and, where applicable, user rebates. Shared revenue with builders Optimism’s retroactive public goods funding model is expected to spread across the L2 ecosystem. More networks are beginning to direct a portion of sequencer revenue back to builders, rewarding teams based on the impact of their work. This ensures steady funding for open-source infrastructure, developer tools, and high-value community projects. By 2026, several L2s are predicted to adopt formal revenue-sharing systems that support L3 builders, service providers, and major protocol teams, strengthening the entire ecosystem. L2 tokens: shift from “governance” to real cashflow assets By design, most Layer 2 tokens were intended as governance tokens used to decentralize decision-making. L2 tokens are, however, expected to do more than just be governance tools and begin capturing real economic value. Today, rollups already generate revenue from DA costs, sequencing fees, and MEV, tying native L2 tokens to real cash flow. By 2026, more networks will introduce revenue-sharing models, sequencer profit distribution, and yield tied to actual network usage. Governance will still matter, no doubt, but cash flow will be a significant part of what gives L2 tokens long-term value. Prediction #9 — L2 interoperability becomes safe and native Trust-minimized bridges One of the drawbacks of early cross-chain bridges that creates a major security concern is their reliance on trusted validators or multisigs. This means that users trust a group of operators to confirm transactions. And if these parties are compromised or act maliciously, the transaction could be at risk. Trust-minimized ZK bridges are shifting the narrative, with solutions like Succinct’s Telepathy already promoting L2 interoperability by utilising validity proofs to cryptographically verify state changes across chains without the need for trusted intermediaries. This approach is expected to become mainstream as it will make bridging faster, permissionless, reliable, and more secure. Cross-chain intents Intent-based systems like Anoma and Radius are expected to remove the complexity of choosing chains or handling bridges. Instead of telling the network how to execute a transaction, users simply state what they want, such as swapping tokens at the best price, moving liquidity to the highest-yield chain, or getting a specific amount of USDC on Arbitrum. Solver networks then figure out the optimal cross-chain route and execute it behind the scenes. Shared blockspace To further drive the goal of L2 interoperability, individual L2s like Arbitrum, OP, etc., will no longer order transactions, but shared sequencers will coordinate and finalize the process across multiple L2s simultaneously and instantaneously. On the user side, wallets display a single combined balance and unified transaction history, while apps automatically route transactions through the most suitable chain. In practice, users do not get to interact with the complexities; everything happens seamlessly in the background. Prediction #10 — Regulation pushes U.S. builders toward L2s Base emerges as the compliant L2 for U.S. teams Base will emerge as the preferred L2 for US teams due to the strong regulatory standing and compliance-driven nature of Coinbase, its parent infrastructure. The link between Coinbase and Base means that the latter enjoys transaction monitoring, easy onboarding, built-in Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML support, and most importantly, a clearly spelled out legal and operational framework. These are the sort of features suited to fintech integrations, enterprise deployments, and consumer applications. Stablecoin payments flow into L2s As regulatory clarity continues to unfold for the already thriving stablecoins ecosystem, in terms of what can be issued and how they can be used, payment companies gain confidence to transition on-chain, especially to Ethereum L2s. But why Layer 2 networks? L2s become an attractive option because of their Ethereum-grade security, near-instant finality, and low fees. These are a combination of features that appeal to teams handling high-volume payments, cross-border transfers, and payroll. Everyday payments are not left out. Compliance-driven stablecoins like USDC and PYUSD are predicted to move across L2s in the background, completing transactions worth billions of dollars monthly, while wallets abstract the complexity of the process (bridges, chain selection, and gas fees). What could slow Layer 2 adoption? Security assumptions around L3s Layer 3s depend on the security architecture of the Layer 2s they are built on. Likewise, Layer 2s rely on the security of the Ethereum (L1) mainnet. The cascading trust model could create a major security risk. Should a major L2 fail occur, the dependent L3s are similarly affected. Sequencer centralization Most Layer 2 scaling solutions still use centralized sequencers run by their core teams. With centralization comes censorship risks, a single point of failure, and exposure to regulatory pressure. If meaningful progress toward sequencer decentralization doesn’t happen by 2026, it could weaken the core value proposition of L2s and limit their long-term trust and resilience. DA layer failures or outages Data availability layers ensure that rollups make transaction data available at a reasonable cost. To achieve this, some DA layers rely on a different or, in some cases, weaker security architecture than Ethereum’s. This introduces a reliability risk, such that if a cheaper DA experiences a network outage or consensus failure, the dependent rollups face data fragmentation and eventual state inconsistency. Liquidity fragmentation returning Five L2s launch today, and two L3s launch a couple of days after. While this in itself provides users with variety, it’s a precursor to liquidity fragmentation. Instead of funds being concentrated in one place, they are spread across several networks, making trading less efficient and increasing borrowing costs. Even with shared sequencing and Superchain-style coordination, incentives can still pull capital in different directions, making liquidity fragmentation an ongoing risk. U.S. regulatory ambiguity Crypto regulation in the US is often regarded as ambiguous. Why? Multiple state regulators and agencies always have something to say, from the SEC to the CFTC, Treasury, and FinCEN. Also, the rules around crypto in general, Layer 2 tokens, and stablecoins remain unclear. For developers and enterprises, enforcement risks remain difficult to assess, creating operational and legal uncertainty. The outcome? Adoption slows down, builders are forced to adapt via a compliance-first design, restrict features in the US, or shift efforts toward other jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks. What does 2026 look like for Ethereum scaling? A multi-L2 world dominated by Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync In the coming months, the Ethereum L2 ecosystem is expected to experience less fragmentation and consolidate around a few dominant players. First would be Base, an L2 that has positioned itself strategically as the hub for consumer-focused applications. Base’s integration with Coinbase and its hundreds of millions of users simplifies crypto onboarding for a non-crypto audience, guarantees fiat access, and regulatory oversight. This is attractive to mainstream applications. Arbitrum will likely continue to hold its base as the home of DeFi and gaming due to its deep liquidity, solid developer community, and mature tooling. It is also renowned for its complex financial applications and high-throughput use cases. Optimism’s Superchain and enterprise rollups are also expected to thrive, becoming the backbone for interoperable application ecosystems. The fourth, zkSync, which anchors ZK-based Layer 2s and Layer 3s, will take the lead in high-value transactions, institutional use cases, and privacy-sensitive applications. Ethereum as a global settlement, DA + rollups as execution Ethereum’s role evolves into a global settlement and data availability layer, securing billions of transactions happening on L2s. Direct user activity on the mainnet becomes minimal, while rollups handle day-to-day activities, such as consumer apps, trading, payments, gaming, and AI interactions. This architecture delivers massive scale while keeping Ethereum’s core security and decentralization intact. Millions of daily active users across L2s Taking a cue from the growth observed in user and daily transactions as of 2025, the numbers are expected to surpass current levels by 2026. Ecosystems like Base and Arbitrum will process millions of transactions daily, with users onboarded from around the world: DeFi traders in Asia, gamers in Europe, payment users in Latin America, and global social media participants. Rollups become the new app stores Rollups will evolve from just being a tool to cut down fees and scale Ethereum into a holistic platform that hosts ecosystems of applications, as is the case with today’s app stores. Beyond just bundling transactions off-chain and posting them back to Layer 1, rollups will host decentralized applications, help users discover them, provide built-in tools and liquidity, and handle execution in the background. Additionally, as L3 frameworks grow on top of L2 rollups, these networks begin to feel less like a single-purpose scaling layer and more like a full application ecosystem where distribution, monetization, and execution are coordinated at the platform level.",Cryptocurrency Guides|ARB|Base|EIGEN|ETH|OP|STRK|TIA|ZK,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|OP|ZK|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 12:10:10

MSTY's recent share price decline is attributed to MSTR and Bitcoin corrections, not structural NAV erosion, suggesting strong rebound potential with underlying recovery. Covered call upside caps refer to option premium limitations, not direct share price ceilings; MSTY's income and price will rise if MSTR and Bitcoin rebound. MSTY should be a small, tactical income portfolio allocation due to volatility, with risk from prolonged Bitcoin/MSTR corrections and potential distribution declines. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is the largest, as measured by assets under management, of the ultra high-yield covered call ETFs available. It's also among the most well known and popular of them. In the early months of the inception of the ETF, it had an enormous amount of positive sentiment attached to it, primarily because it was new and a novelty, and the distributions paid out were extraordinary be historical standards, and paid out very well and consistently, well over $1.00 per unit or share. It has as an underlying Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ), which had also been viewed very favorably by the market, until it wasn't. All of that was associated with the growth trajectory of Bitcoin, which soared to an all-time high before pulling back to where it is today, trading under $86,000 as I write. Since MSTR is considered a proxy for Bitcoin, it of course corrected with it, and by extension, so did MSTY, as the chart below confirms. In this article I want to take a look at why I believe MSTY's current performance is more than likely a temporary weakness, and when Bitcoin and MSTR rebound, it will do so also, even with some of the upside limitations of a covered call strategy. Seeking Alpha First, by the charts The chart above shows Bitcoin, MSTR, and MSTY and how they performed over the last year in general, as well as in relationship to one another. Of major importance is MSTY is trading almost in direct correlation to MSTR and Bitcoin. One exception is Bitcoin, from early August 2025 through its high in early October 2025, was able to maintain more of a sideways trajectory during that time, while MSTY and MSTR were slightly down in comparison. But once the top came in, all three of them have dropped pretty much in unison with one another, with MSTY holding its own. It's also significant that the stairsteps down on the chart that MSTY had, was also mirrored by Bitcoin and MSTR, meaning it was moving up and down primarily based upon the underlying. As a matter of fact, MSTY started moderating more after the top, as compared to Bitcoin and MSTR. What that means is MSTY isn't doing near as bad as many may think because it was moving on the basis of the performance of MSTR. NAV erosion and share price movement An ongoing misunderstanding of how MSTY works in relationship to NAV erosion is in regard to the share price movement related to MSTR. The key is in defining what NAV erosion actually is. First, what it isn't is the up and down movement of its share price in correlation to the price movement of MSTR. That has little or nothing to do with NAV erosion. I mention this because to this day many investors and financial writers still don't know the difference. If the share price of MSTY or any other covered call ETF falls, the assumption is the only thing causing that is NAV erosion, rather than the strong probability it's nothing more than the performance of the underlying. What NAV erosion is is when the revenue from option premiums doesn't reach the level of the distribution being paid out. The result can be that the share price of MSTY drops, but it's from real NAV erosion and not the performance of MSTR. Why is that important to understand? If the drop in share price in MSTY is coming primarily from NAV erosion and not the performance of the underlying, than it'll struggle to bounce back once Bitcoin and MSTR bounce back. If it's nothing more than MSTR's performance, than once it reverses course so will MSTY. On the other hand, if it's primarily NAV erosion, it'll struggle to get the bounce it would get from its direct correlation with MSTR. This is the heart of my thesis why I believe MSTY isn't doing nearly as bad as it appears to be because of its decline in share price, which I knew was inevitable once Bitcoin reached a new high. On the other hand, I believe it's just as inevitable that it'll enjoy the bounce of MSTR once it comes. Capping the upside Another misunderstanding associated with covered call ETFs like MSTY is when thinking in terms of the upside being capped. I've observed a number of investors think that is has something to do with the share price of MSTY, when in reality it's a reference to the limitations that a covered call premium will generate. I know most readers know this, but I've seen some investors think the cap is directly related to the share price of MSTY, rather than the capped upside of the covered call option. After all, the stock market is where we place bids on MSTY, and what any one investor thinks it is worth is what the bid will be. It has nothing to do with the cap associated with covered calls. That doesn't mean investors won't be influenced by the limitations in relationship to what they bid, but it's a decision an investor makes that has nothing to do with the cap. MSTR and Bitcoin I want to briefly point out that MSTR and not Bitcoin is the underlying of MSTY. While MSTR is considered a Bitcoin proxy, it's still not the same. That's why in the charts above Bitcoin traded sideways for a time while MSTR and MSTY were declining in share price. Even so, over time, how Bitcoin goes so will go MSTR, even if there are brief periods of time when they slightly deviate in price movement correlation. With that in mind, if an investor is interested in taking a position in or adding to a position in MSTY, there needs to be a firm belief in the future growth of Bitcoin. That's significant because if one doesn't understand and believe in Bitcoin and MSTR, it will be easy to exit a position and experience potentially large unrealized losses that they may regret in the months and years ahead. I'm not suggesting holding forever, as I've bought and sold MSTY in the past, but my primary reason for selling was because I had made a nice total return, and when Bitcoin achieved its all-time high, I suspected that we could go through a season where it corrected, along with MSTR, which is exactly what happened. My thinking there is I didn't want to continue holding on when sitting on solid profits, so I sold with the idea of taking another position once I think the correction is over and the rebound is underway. Risk The key risk for MSTY will be if there is a longer period of correction in Bitcoin and MSTR than I think there will be. Under that scenario there will likely be the emergence of even more of a fear trade, and the share price could drop much further than it already has. That would also mean a further decline in distributions, which would make risk-reward must less attractive. Another risk would be concerning those that may not have a strategy in place concerning their income portfolio. In other words, if an investor had, say, a goal of generating $2,000 a month in income from their covered call ETF portfolio, but didn't put an income goal in place that was significantly above that when times of corrections happen, then their income expectations could be in jeopardy if it fell below what was desired and/or needed to live on. For example, with $2,000 as a goal, it would mean one would want to have a lot more coming in than that to cover these types of situations. If there isn't income leeway in place, it means the income needed would be in danger. One potential other risk would be if MSCI delisting were to occur. I think this is more posturing than anything else, but you can never be 100% sure. I'm not going to make any decision on investing in MSTY because of this, but it's something to be aware of and follow. Conclusion Since I see this being a temporary correction that was primarily the result of MSTR dropping in response to the weakness in Bitcoin, I believe MSTY has a very good chance of experiencing a nice rebound along with MSTR when that happens. Not only does that mean that the share price of MSTY will climb once again, but the distributions will be driven higher as a result of that. As mentioned earlier, I don't see the price correction of MSTY being primarily from NAV erosion, but from the performance of MSTR. That's why I'm bullish on the long-term performance of MSTY. These are times that will test anyone's thesis concerning MSTR as an underlying, but nothing has really changed other than the price correction that was expected. MSTY, for the best results, should be a small part of an income portfolio, and not the foundational base of one, as some were suggesting earlier in 2025. That would be a big mistake, even if and when MSTR and MSTY rebound. The reason why is that isn't best practices, and will one day catch up with anyone playing with fire. I see a lot of potential upside for MSTY in its share price and distribution levels. While I would be totally content for MSTY to trade sideways for a long time even as it pays out a high distribution on a consistent basis, it wouldn't bother me if there was some growth included with it.",MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-18 12:14:54

Midnight (NIGHT) is next with a 3.9% rise, now trading at $0.06385. Bitcoin’s volatility becoming more restrained, decreasing below the volatility of Nvidia shares in 2025, Bitwise says. According to the analysts, this shifts reflects a maturing and more diversified investor base. Bitcoin’s price swings are becoming more restrained, with the cryptocurrency now showing lower volatility than @Nvidia shares in 2025. #Bitcoin #Nvidia https://t.co/REoVJjlqVc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 18, 2025 Meanwhile, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets , affirmed a strict ban on payments using crypto in the country. “We must understand that cryptocurrencies will never become money within our country,” he said. “They can only be used as an investment instrument. If payment is required, it will only be in rubles.” BTC Hitting $140,000 in 180 Days Fadi Aboualfa, Head of Research at Cooper , commented that Bitcoin has shown the same repeatable pattern in 2024 and 2025. Price hits all-time highs, corrects sharply, and “then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.” “Institutions are not ‘staking sats’,” Aboualfa says. In fact, he argues, “most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.” Notably, without rebalancing, a modest 2% BTC moves to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. “A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.” “With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.” Moreover, Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , noted that markets continue to slide as we head into the New Year, “with prices sitting on a knife’s edge amid mixed U.S. economic data and persistent macro uncertainty.” He says that BTC positioning remains decisively bearish. Traders are pricing continued downside risk through Q1 and Q2, as ongoing sell pressure from previously inactive wallets weighs on spot prices. “Looking into the December 26 expiry, positioning is increasingly polarised. On the upside, there is a notable build-up of calls at the $100K and $120K strikes, suggesting some traders are still holding out for a sharp relief rally. On the downside, bears have accumulated substantial put exposure at the $85K strike, pointing to expectations of BTC sliding below $85K in the near term.” The probability of NTC reaching $100,000 is now near 30%, while the chance of reclaiming ATHs sits at around 10%, Forster says. “ETH tells a more nuanced story,” he says. Signals show a far more balanced outlook into the end of Q2 next year compared to BTC’s persistent bearish bias. There’s a 45% chance that ETH reclaims $3,000 by the end of Q1 next year. Also, there’s a 25% chance it surpasses $4,000 over the same period. Overall, Forster says, “volatility remains elevated and positioning is defensive, but upside tails have not been fully abandoned as markets brace for a volatile start to the year.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $86,722. The day began with $87,011, trading relatively sideways before briefly jumping to the intraday high of $90,164. It quickly plunged to the intraday low, however, of $85,373. It’s been trading sideways again since. Bitcoin could further decrease towards $84,000, followed by the $82,300-83,200 range. A higher drop would pull the price below $80,000. On the other hand, a rise may see BTC reclaim 90,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $2,834. Initially, it went up from about $2,906 to the high of $3,021. It then plunged to the intraday low of $2,796. Like BTC, it has traded sideways up until the time of writing. If the price continues falling, ETH may see a pullback to the $2,700 level, followed by $2,630. A market uptick could push it upwards to regain the $3,000, if it manages to hold it. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment continues decreasing within the fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 22 today , compared to 25 yesterday. It is moving towards the extreme fear zone. The fear and uncertainty is increasing as the market continues trending downward. Analysts argue that this may continue in the short- and mid-term at least.

The EU’s evolving digital-asset framework—combined with stricter oversight around custody, security, and consumer protection—means that licensed crypto lenders now stand apart from unregulated competitors. In 2026, trusted borrowing platforms must demonstrate regulatory clarity, transparent risk controls, institutional-grade asset security, and borrower-friendly structures. Below is a review of the most reliable licensed crypto lenders in Europe . 1. Clapp — Licensed VASP with Institutional-Grade Custody and Flexible Credit Lines Clapp ranks first among licensed European crypto lenders due to its combination of regulatory credentials, strong security infrastructure, and efficient borrowing model. Regulatory Status: Licensed in the EU Clapp holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic, confirming it operates legally as a licensed crypto exchange under EU oversight. This licensing framework enforces AML/CTF standards, customer verification processes, and operational transparency—key markers of trust for European users. Institutional-Grade Security with Fireblocks All assets on Clapp are safeguarded through Fireblocks, a world-recognized custody infrastructure used by banks, fintech platforms, and digital-asset institutions. Fireblocks’ MPC technology reduces single-point-of-failure risk and provides secure asset transfer, storage, and transaction authorization. Revolving Credit Line Model Unlike traditional loan providers, Clapp offers a revolving crypto credit line rather than fixed-term loans. Borrowers secure a credit limit with USDT, BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, or any of its 19 supported assets. They can withdraw funds in USDT, USDC, or EUR at any time. Key advantages: Interest only on withdrawn amounts 0% APR on unused credit No fixed repayment schedule Instant EUR withdrawals for EU users Clapp combines regulatory assurance with a borrower-centric structure—making it the strongest choice for users who want licensed, low-cost, flexible crypto-backed liquidity in Europe. 2. CoinLoan (EU-Regulated Where Operating) CoinLoan historically operated under European regulatory frameworks and offered crypto-backed loans with fiat support. While its availability has varied, it remains one of the few platforms with an established licensing footprint. Strengths European regulatory alignment Support for multiple fiat currencies including EUR Straightforward loan products Considerations CoinLoan operates under a traditional loan structure that charges interest on the full borrowed amount and includes fixed repayment terms. 3. Nexo — Global Lender with EU Licensing and Custodial Safeguards Nexo maintains a strong presence in Europe with various registrations, local regulatory approvals, and insurance-backed custodial partnerships. Users can deposit BTC, ETH, or stablecoins to borrow EUR, USDT, or USDC. Strengths Established CeFi provider with regulatory oversight in multiple jurisdictions Insured custody and external risk audits User-friendly platform Considerations Nexo follows a classical loan model, meaning interest applies to the full principal from day one and repayment schedules are more structured than flexible credit lines. 4. YouHodler — EU-Based Operations with High-LTV Lending YouHodler operates in Europe with regulatory registrations and compliance processes that meet financial service requirements for digital assets. It supports USDT and BTC collateral for fiat and stablecoin loans. Strengths High loan-to-value ratios Fast onboarding and approvals Simple borrowing experience Considerations Borrowers must commit to fixed-term loans, and interest accrues immediately on the entire borrowed sum. 5. Aave (DeFi with Institutional Whitelists & Regulated Gateways) While Aave operates as a decentralized protocol rather than a licensed CeFi lender, several institutional and regulated gateways allow compliant access for European users. Borrowing against WBTC or other assets is done directly through audited smart contracts. Strengths Transparency and on-chain execution No centralized custody risk Widely audited protocol Considerations Users must understand liquidation mechanics, smart-contract risk, and gas-fee dynamics. Aave is best for advanced borrowers who want decentralization rather than a regulated CeFi experience. Which Licensed Crypto Lender Is Best in Europe for 2026? For European users, the leading criteria include: Verified regulatory status Secure asset custody Predictable and low borrowing costs Flexible loan or credit-line structure Direct access to EUR liquidity Based on these factors, Clapp offers the strongest all-around solution. Its EU VASP license, Fireblocks-secured custody, and revolving credit-line model make it a standout choice for borrowers seeking both regulatory assurance and operational flexibility. Users who prefer classical loan structures may find Nexo or YouHodler suitable, while DeFi-native borrowers may gravitate toward Aave. Still, for individuals and businesses wanting licensed, low-complexity borrowing against crypto, Clapp remains the most compelling platform in 2026.

The memory chip maker posted numbers Wednesday evening that were nothing short of remarkable. Sales hit $13.6 billion for its fiscal first quarter, up 57% from the same time last year. Operating income also broke company records. What Micron told investors about the coming months is even more eye-opening. Revenue will reach $18.7 billion in the quarter ending February, more than double what the company brought in a year earlier. Adjusted operating income? That’s expected to surge more than five times to $11.3 billion. Wall Street knew the numbers would be strong. They just didn’t know how strong. Micron’s revenue forecast landed 31% higher than what analysts predicted. That’s the biggest miss by experts in at least five years, FactSet data seen by WSJ shows. Investors loved it. The stock jumped 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday. It had already more than doubled over the past year. Here’s the problem, though. All this great news for Micron spells trouble for the rest of us. Artificial intelligence is eating up memory chips . Companies building AI systems need specialized memory, and they’re buying massive quantities. That leaves less supply for everything else—your laptop, your phone, your tablet, even gaming consoles. All these devices need memory chips just to work. The numbers don’t lie. A standard dynamic random-access memory module now costs more than 60% higher than it did six months ago, according to Trendforce. Next quarter, the price will hit $500. Last year at this time? About half that. New factories won’t help soon Building more chip factories would help. But these plants don’t pop up overnight. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said Wednesday the company will break ground on a new facility in upstate New York early next year. Don’t hold your breath waiting for chips from that plant, though. They won’t roll off the line until 2030. Micron is spending big to increase production elsewhere. The company plans to drop a record $20 billion this fiscal year on expanding capacity. Over the past five years, they averaged just over $10 billion annually. Still not enough. Mehrotra doesn’t think even this massive spending spree will satisfy demand for the high-bandwidth memory AI needs. “We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future,” he said on the call. Tech companies sound the alarm Computer makers see what’s coming. Jeff Clarke, Dell’s Chief Operating Officer, addressed the situation last month. “We’re going to do everything we can to minimize the impact,” he said. “But the fact is the cost basis is going up across all products.” HP issued its own warning last month. Rising memory costs could push operating profits to the low end of their long-term range for the current fiscal year, executives told investors. So consumers will pay the price? Well, Someone has to pay for all this. The smartphone industry already sees trouble ahead. Counterpoint Research changed its forecast earlier this week. The firm now expects smartphone sales to drop 2.1% next year. They had previously predicted a slight increase. High-end phones with AI features are in a particularly tough spot since they need more memory. Even video games are caught up in this mess. Nintendo’s stock has dropped 18% over the past month. Doug Creutz, an analyst at TD Cowen, says worries about memory prices are mostly to blame. He ran the numbers. If memory costs add $40 to each Switch 2 console, it would slash about 20% off his pretax earnings forecast for Nintendo’s fiscal year ending March 2027. His guess? Nintendo might raise the Switch 2 price by $50 instead to cover the cost. Mario fans won’t be happy about that. But for Micron, basic economics is working in its favor. Supply and demand are pushing the company toward record profits.

New data reveals a troubling trend: a sharp FDV drop is hitting these tokens hard after their Token Generation Event (TGE). This pattern raises serious questions for investors about early-stage crypto valuations and post-launch performance. What is the Kaito Kickstarter FDV Drop? According to a report from Wu Blockchain citing CoinGecko data, most projects launched via Kaito’s Kickstarter incubator have seen their Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) collapse after their tokens go live. The Kaito Kickstarter FDV drop is not an isolated incident but a widespread phenomenon affecting multiple ventures. This trend suggests a significant gap between pre-launch hype and post-launch market reality. Stark Examples of the Valuation Plunge Let’s look at the numbers, which tell a clear story of decline. The data highlights how severe this Kaito Kickstarter FDV drop can be for individual projects. PlayAI (PLAI): This Web3 AI gaming company had a pre-TGE valuation of $50 million. Following its token launch, its FDV has plummeted to approximately $2.1 million. Hana Network (HANA): Similarly, HANA’s valuation fell from around $40 million to a current FDV of about $10.5 million. The report confirms that other projects from the program are also trading at FDVs far below their pre-TGE levels. This consistent pattern points to systemic issues rather than bad luck for one or two teams. Why Does This Kaito Kickstarter FDV Drop Happen? Understanding the ‘why’ behind this trend is crucial for any crypto investor. Several factors likely contribute to this sharp Kaito Kickstarter FDV drop . First, pre-TGE valuations are often set during private funding rounds in a bullish market. When the token finally hits public exchanges, market conditions may have cooled. Second, there’s typically a large unlock of tokens for early investors and team members post-TGE. If these holders sell immediately, it creates massive sell-side pressure. Finally, the initial hype fades, and the project must now deliver real utility and adoption to justify its price. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This trend offers vital lessons. The dramatic Kaito Kickstarter FDV drop serves as a powerful reminder of the risks in early-stage crypto investing. Scrutinize Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV): A high FDV before any tokens are liquid can be a major red flag. It sets unrealistic expectations for growth. Research Tokenomics & Unlocks: Always check the vesting schedule. A cliff of tokens unlocking at TGE can drown the price. Look Beyond the Hype: Incubator backing is not a guarantee of success. Independent research into the project’s fundamentals, team, and product roadmap is non-negotiable. Conclusion: Navigating the Post-TGE Landscape The pattern of a Kaito Kickstarter FDV drop post-TGE is a cautionary tale for the entire crypto ecosystem. It highlights the volatility and speculative nature of early-stage token launches. For investors, the imperative is clear: conduct deep due diligence, understand token supply dynamics, and manage expectations. The true test of a project begins after the fanfare of its launch fades. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Kaito Kickstarter? A: Kaito Kickstarter is an incubator or launchpad program designed to support and fund early-stage cryptocurrency and Web3 projects before they publicly launch their tokens. Q: What does FDV mean? A: FDV stands for Fully Diluted Valuation. It represents a cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization if all its tokens (including those not yet in circulation) were issued and traded at the current price. Q: Why is a post-TGE FDV drop bad? A> A sharp drop often indicates the initial valuation was inflated, early investors are selling (dumping), and market demand is lower than expected. It can damage long-term project credibility and investor returns. Q: Should I avoid all Kaito Kickstarter projects? A> Not necessarily. This trend highlights the need for extreme caution and deeper research, not a blanket avoidance. Evaluate each project’s tokenomics, utility, and team independently. Q: How can I protect myself from such valuation crashes? A> Focus on projects with reasonable valuations, staggered token unlock schedules, strong fundamentals, and active communities. Avoid investing based solely on launchpad hype. Found this analysis of the Kaito Kickstarter FDV drop insightful?

Stablecoin issuer United Stables has officially launched its integrated United Stables stablecoin , named U, on the BNB Chain. This launch marks a strategic shift from competition to collaboration within the stablecoin ecosystem. Instead of creating another standalone asset, U aims to unify the market by integrating major existing stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and USD1 as its foundational collateral. This innovative approach directly tackles one of DeFi’s most persistent challenges: liquidity fragmentation. What Makes the United Stables Stablecoin U Different? Unlike most new stablecoin projects that compete for market share, the United Stables stablecoin takes a cooperative path. Its core mission is integration. Think of U not as a replacement, but as a unifying layer. It uses a basket of established, trusted stablecoins as its reserve. Therefore, when you hold U, you are effectively holding a diversified portfolio of the top stable assets in the market. This design inherently reduces reliance on any single issuer’s stability and spreads risk. Moreover, by building on the BNB Chain, United Stables taps into a high-speed, low-cost network with a massive existing user base, ensuring the stablecoin is accessible and practical from day one. How Does U Solve the Liquidity Fragmentation Problem? Liquidity fragmentation occurs when value is scattered across too many similar assets, making no single pool deep enough for efficient large trades. This leads to slippage and inefficiency. The United Stables stablecoin addresses this by acting as a liquidity aggregator. Here’s how it works: Unified Collateral: U is backed by a mix of USDT, USDC, and USD1, pooling their liquidity. Single Trading Pair: DEXs and protocols can list U as a primary pair, creating one deep liquidity pool instead of several shallow ones. Reduced Complexity: For users and developers, managing one integrated stablecoin is simpler than juggling multiple ones. This model could streamline the entire DeFi experience on BNB Chain and beyond, making transactions smoother and more capital-efficient for everyone. What Future Features Does United Stables Promise? The launch is just the beginning. United Stables has outlined a roadmap filled with user-centric innovations designed to push the boundaries of what a stablecoin can do. Two announced features stand out for their potential to drive mainstream adoption: Gas-Free Transfers: The team plans to implement a system where sending U does not require the user to pay network gas fees. This removes a major barrier for new users unfamiliar with crypto transaction costs. AI-Powered Autonomous Payments: Future updates may include smart, AI-driven payment streams. Imagine setting up a recurring subscription or a conditional payment that executes automatically based on predefined data triggers. These features position the United Stables stablecoin not just as a store of value, but as an active, intelligent financial tool. Why is Binance Wallet Support a Major Boost? Adoption is critical for any new digital asset. The immediate integration of the United Stables stablecoin U into Binance Wallet provides a powerful launchpad. Binance Wallet is a widely used, trusted gateway for millions into the BNB Chain ecosystem. This support means users can easily store, send, and receive U without needing to navigate complex third-party setups. It signals strong ecosystem backing and provides instant legitimacy and accessibility, significantly shortening the path from launch to real-world use. Conclusion: A Step Toward a Unified Financial Future The launch of U by United Stables represents a mature evolution in the stablecoin sector. By choosing integration over isolation, the project addresses a core infrastructural flaw in DeFi. Its presence on BNB Chain, coupled with promised features like gas-free transfers and the crucial Binance Wallet support, creates a compelling package. While the long-term success of any stablecoin depends on sustained trust, transparency, and adoption, U’s collaborative foundation offers a promising blueprint for a less fragmented and more efficient digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the United Stables stablecoin U? U is a new stablecoin launched on BNB Chain that is uniquely backed by a basket of other major stablecoins like USDT and USDC, aiming to unify liquidity rather than compete with existing assets. How is U different from USDT or USDC? Unlike USDT or USDC, which are single-issuer stablecoins, U aggregates the value of several top stablecoins into one token. It’s designed to reduce fragmentation and provide a more diversified stable asset. On which blockchain is U available? The United Stables stablecoin U is primarily launched on the BNB Chain, known for its high transaction speed and low costs. Can I store U in Binance Wallet? Yes. Binance Wallet has already added support for the U stablecoin, allowing users to easily store and manage it alongside other assets. What does “gas-free transfers” mean? It’s a planned future feature where users may be able to send U tokens without paying the typical blockchain network fee (gas), making transactions simpler and more predictable. What are AI-powered autonomous payments? This proposed feature would use artificial intelligence to automate complex payment conditions, like releasing funds when certain real-world events occur, enabling smarter financial agreements.

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.38, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00000444, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00000519. Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000279, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000183. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced strong selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra low around $0.0000039. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000004 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps indicates that nearly one-third of Pepe’s initial token supply was controlled by a single wallet, contradicting the project’s “for the people” launch narrative. The cluster allegedly sold $2 million in PEPE the day after launch, creating sell pressure that analysts say hindered the token’s early growth. this is $PEPE at launch with time nodes on 30% bundled you were lied to https://t.co/Fsv4hXdurj pic.twitter.com/ha8pHXcss9 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 10, 2025 PEPE Price Prediction December 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000004 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.00001. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) December 2025 0.000004 0.00001 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000004. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

The clock is ticking on a significant token distribution event. The decentralized perpetuals exchange, Aster, has officially announced that its highly anticipated Phase 4 airdrop will conclude on December 21. This marks a pivotal moment for participants and the Aster ecosystem. If you’ve been involved, you need to understand the critical timeline and the unique claim choices that await you. What Are the Key Dates for the Aster Airdrop? Mark your calendars because the schedule is precise. The opportunity to be part of this Aster airdrop phase ends at 11:59 p.m. UTC on Friday, December 21. However, the process doesn’t stop there. The team will launch an airdrop checker on January 14, 2024, allowing you to verify your eligibility. Most importantly, the claim window itself opens two weeks later on January 28. How Much ASTER is Being Distributed? Aster has allocated a substantial portion of its total token supply for this community reward. Specifically, 1.5% of the entire ASTER supply is dedicated to Phase 4 participants. This demonstrates a strong commitment to decentralizing ownership and rewarding early supporters. However, there’s a crucial detail: all tokens from this Aster airdrop are subject to a three-month lock-up period. What Are Your Claim Options for the Airdrop? This is where it gets interesting. Aster offers participants a strategic choice on January 28, presenting a classic trade-off between immediate access and maximum reward. Option 1: Claim 50% Immediately – You can choose to claim half of your allocated tokens right away. The consequence? The remaining 50% will be permanently burned, reducing the overall supply but forfeiting that portion of your reward. Option 2: Wait for the Full 100% – If you exercise patience, you can wait for the three-month lock-up period to end in late April. By doing so, you become eligible to claim the entirety of your allocated tokens, receiving the full reward. This mechanism is designed to give users control while potentially benefiting the long-term token economics through voluntary burning. Why Is This Aster Airdrop Phase Important? Beyond the free tokens, this event is a key milestone for Aster’s growth. Airdrops are powerful tools for bootstrapping a decentralized community and ensuring fair token distribution. By concluding this phase and moving towards claims, Aster is solidifying its user base and transitioning to a new stage of ecosystem development. The lock-up period also helps promote stability post-distribution. Final Summary: Act Before the Deadline In conclusion, the Aster Phase 4 airdrop is a structured event with clear deadlines and meaningful choices. The December 21 conclusion is your final call for eligibility. Remember to check your status in mid-January and carefully weigh your claim strategy later that month. Whether you prioritize immediate liquidity or maximum token receipt, understanding these details is crucial for capitalizing on this Aster airdrop opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What happens if I miss the December 21 deadline? A: The December 21 deadline is for the airdrop qualification/snapshot. Missing it likely means you will not be eligible for tokens in this specific Phase 4 distribution. Q2: Where will the airdrop checker be available on January 14? A: The checker will be available on Aster’s official website. Always use official links from their verified social media channels to avoid scams. Q3: Is there a cost or gas fee to claim my Aster airdrop tokens? A: Typically, claiming tokens requires paying a network gas fee on the blockchain Aster uses. Ensure you have a small amount of the native currency (like ETH if on Ethereum) in your wallet to cover this. Q4: Can I change my claim choice after January 28? A: Based on the announcement, your choice at the time of claim is likely final. Decide carefully between the 50% immediate claim and the 100% locked claim. Q5: What is a perpetuals exchange? A: A perpetuals exchange allows trading of derivative contracts (perpetual swaps) that have no expiry date, similar to futures but designed to track an asset’s spot price. Q6: Where can I find the official announcement? A: The announcement was made on Aster’s official X (formerly Twitter) account. Refer only to official sources for information.

As previously reported , the current week was expected to be highly volatile due to the release of key economic data in several countries. One of the most important was scheduled for today in the US – the Consumer Price Index figures for November. Expectations were quite high. The regular CPI was anticipated to be at 3.1%, while the Core CPI, which excludes more volatile sectors like food and energy, was at 3%. In reality, both of those figures for November were much lower – the regular CPI sits at 2.7%, while the Core is at 2.6%.

Namely, as indicated by the latest Cexplorer data on Thursday, December 18, over 133,000 Cardano transactions now contain NIGHT tokens. Midnight is now the 56th largest crypto in the world according to market cap, worth $1.07 billion at press time. NIGHT market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Trading at $0.06488 at the time of writing, NIGHT is up nearly 2% on the day, and a massive 50% on the weekly chart. As such, it is one of the dozen or so cryptocurrencies to outperform the market today, outpacing the already established privacy coin Zcash ( ZEC ) and sitting just behind Monero ( XMR ), which currently occupies spot number four in terms of 24-hour gains. Midnight token boosts the Cardano network Late on December 17, the network founder, Charles Hoskinson, summed up the launch as “incredible success,” adding that he was proud of the community for achieving so much in so little time. “The launch of NIGHT has been an incredible success. It’s amazing how well the ecosystem is developing and holding up. It’s on its way to be the first true 4th generation cryptocurrency and bring in a new era to our industry. I’m so proud of everyone!” wrote Hoskinson on X. The launch of Night has been an incredible success. It's amazing how well the ecosystem is developing and holding up. It's on it's way to be the first true 4th generation cryptocurrency and bring in a new era to our industry. I'm so proud of everyone! — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 18, 2025 The unprecedented activity surrounding the NIGHT token is redirecting capital back into the Cardano ecosystem, at one point sustaining over $1 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Hoskinson’s reaction thus appears to reflect the strength of early network performance rather than short-term price action, and his comments about NIGHT as “the first true 4th generation cryptocurrency” corroborate that. Positioned as a privacy-focused execution network, Midnight has already produced 2.96 million blocks and processed more than 408,000 transactions, as per the latest figures on Midnight Explorer , with an average block time of approximately six seconds, signaling stable and consistent operation shortly after launch. With the statistics and Hoskinson’s comments in mind, the “new ADA” label seems fitting, as the ecosystem is on the path to potentially becoming one of the most active recent projects.

Here’s What It Means,https://cryptopotato.com/is-pi-networks-pi-set-to-benefit-from-the-current-market-dip-heres-what-it-means/,"The cryptocurrency markets have started to retreat again this week, and yesterday’s brief pump-and-dump only intensified the pressure on most altcoins. However, Pi Network’s native token is among the few alts that have managed to defy the overall correction and sits above $0.20. Interestingly, this is not the first time this has happened in the past few months. PI to Defy This Correction, too? October and November were quite brutal for the broader cryptocurrency market. In times when BTC and ETH were charting double-digit weekly (and on a few occasions, daily) losses, though, PI managed to defy the overall crash and soared from $0.20 to almost $0.30. However, the landscape around Pi Network’s native coin started to worsen in early December when the rest of the market rebounded. As BTC challenged and exceeded $90,000, PI dropped below $0.25 and under $0.20 earlier this week. The past 24 hours have been different once again. As reported earlier today, many altcoins have posted notable price declines, with LEO, HYPE, and PUMP leading the pack south. However, PI and a few others have shown impressive resistance, and the asset has bounced above $0.20. This begs the question of whether PI has the ability to be a hedge against crypto market corrections. But also, whether it fails to produce impressive gains when the rest of its altcoin cohort is surging. What Could Drive PI Forward? One of the main drivers behind PI’s October-November defiance was the continued updates from the team in regards to the overall ecosystem growth. However, what seems to be impacting the token the most is actually rumors and speculations . Its price has recorded the most significant gains (and subsequent crashes) after someone with status hinted that big news is coming. Months ago, it was a potential listing on Binance, which never materialized. Then, there were rumors about some new development, which sent PI flying, but once it was announced , a $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund, it led to a violent correction. It’s worth noting that despite each pump following some speculation, the subsequent rejection and price drop are much harsher, and PI tends to underperform in the long run. After all, it has plunged by more than 93% since its all-time high in late February, and every rebound appears like a dead-cat bounce on the higher timeframes.

ETOR’s AUM reached a record $20.8B (up 76% y/y), with total funded accounts growing 16% y/y, signaling strong ecosystem stickiness. Crypto revenue diversification has reduced earnings fragility, with Q3 net contribution up to $129M and crypto asset revenue surging 229% y/y. Valuation has compressed to 13x forward PE, supported by a $150M buyback (~5% of market cap), presenting an attractive entry point. Investment action I had a hold rating for eToro Group ( ETOR ) previously, as I thought the valuation was not attractive, especially considering the volatile earnings profile from its crypto exposure and competitive landscape. Since then, the setup has changed. The stock has derated materially, while fundamentals have improved, and ETOR has directly addressed my earlier concerns. US traction is showing, the ecosystem looks stickier than expected, and the earnings profile is proving more resilient. I upgrade my rating to buy. US Expansion and Ecosystem Stickiness In my earlier work on ETOR, the main bullish argument I made was that its social investing model was differentiated, but I also questioned whether it would work given the heavy competitive landscape. This model worked well in Europe, but I wasn’t sure it could work in the US. Specifically, I was worried whether ETOR could monetize this model in a market dominated by Interactive Brokers ( IBKR ) and Robinhood ( HOOD ). What changed my view isn’t just that growth is actually happening, but how it’s happening. We have hard data points to anchor the narrative. In the Q3 call, management confirmed that new funded accounts in the US year-to-date have already exceeded the total for all of FY2024. That effectively dismissed my worry that ETOR cannot gain traction in the face of IBKR and HOOD competition. It validates the model’s ability to funnel in users and eventually convert them into funded accounts. It sure does seem like the rollout of CopyTrading in the US, paired with a broader crypto offering, has given ETOR an “edge” to capture a part of the market. While we do not know the engagement metrics split by region, we can get a good sense that things are going very well on an overall basis. The first metric to track is Assets Under Administration [AUM], which has reached a record of $20.8 billion, up 76% y/y. But the real focus is the sequential increase. In Q2, it was up $2.7 billion sequentially, but in Q3, it was up $3.3 billion. The second metric is total funded accounts, which grew 16% y/y. It suggests more people are coming into the platform, and they are putting more capital into it (delta between AUM and funded accounts). In my view, this data definitively proves that the social investing moat is portable (can work in other regions) and also that the US market can be penetrated (this helps with the long-term growth narrative). The ""Crypto Winter"" Hedge One of the main reasons for my hold rating in July was earnings volatility. My fear was that ETOR dependence on trading activity (especially crypto) made results hard to forecast and would expose the business to sharp drawdowns if another crypto winter hit. I still believe that concern was reasonable at the time, but ETOR has proved me wrong. The Q3 data showed strength on this front. While revenue from equities and commodities was weak due to market volatility, and if it were a traditional brokerage, ETOR would have delivered a poor set of results, But no, ETOR saw net contribution (crypto + Equities + Commodities + Currencies) grow to $129 million, primarily driven by a 229% y/y increase in crypto asset revenue. Unlike what I thought about crypto being a weakness, it actually helped with diversification. This dynamic really changed my mind. I now believe that ETOR’s revenue stream is less fragile than I initially thought. The right framing should be that ETOR isn’t exposed to a volatile asset class, but that it benefits from whichever asset class is attractive at a given time. I think there is a “moat” element in here that makes this possible. While other brokers like IBKR and HOOD also allow trading of crypto and stocks on the same platform, the decision-making process for users is different. On a standard brokerage app, a user must independently decide to stop trading a stock (say, Nvidia) and start trading crypto (say, Bitcoin), and for most retail investors, they have no idea which crypto to buy (or which stock to sell). This often leads to inaction. On ETOR, that decision is often outsourced because the investors may be copying a ""popular investor,"" and when that investor rotates their portfolio from stocks to crypto, the user’s capital moves automatically (i.e., the trade happens). Valuation Bloomberg I previously noted that at 25x forward PE, ETOR was not cheap, in that the valuation already reflected a lot of good news, leaving little margin for error. Things have changed today. Despite the positive points discussed above (US traction and a diversified model that works), ETOR’s multiple has compressed down to just 13x as of the time of writing. This is also despite consensus upgrading their earnings estimates substantially, suggesting that the overall market is still not catching up on the positive developments ETOR has shown, and I think this gives investors a good entry point. The capital return story adds another layer of positive to the ETOR equity story. In the latest earnings, management announced a $150 million share repurchase program, which is ~5% of current market cap. Beyond the yield, the importance of this buyback is that it tells the market management believes the stock is undervalued, and that serves as a valuation floor. On a relative basis, ETOR still trades at a substantial discount to IBKR and HOOD, which are at 27x and 46x, respectively. If ETOR can continue to show resilient growth and continue penetrating the US market, growth should accelerate, and I expect this relative multiple gap to close. Risk There are risks to consider. For instance, the 44% growth in net interest income is likely turning into a headwind as central banks cut rates, which could drag down near-term earnings that make the headline look bad. Also, a mix shift toward lower-margin equity trading caused core non-crypto revenue to decline 21% y/y in Q3, which could continue if derivative volumes do not recover. Finally, the US bull case relies on securing an RIA license by 1H 2026 to fully monetize the ""Popular Investor"" program. Regulatory delays there could delay this growth catalyst. Conclusion I give a buy rating. My previous concerns have largely been resolved. ETOR is showing that its social investing model can scale and that crypto acts as a diversification rather than a liability. With the stock now trading at a much cheaper multiple, supported by a $150 million buyback, I see a favorable setup.",ETOR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-18 13:49:38

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, the world’s leading digital asset is currently trading at $88,064.13. This Bitcoin price surge marks a significant milestone, fueling discussions about the potential for a renewed bull market. But what’s really driving this impressive climb? Let’s break down the factors behind this rally and explore what it could mean for your portfolio. What’s Fueling the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? The jump above $88,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several converging factors are creating a perfect storm of bullish sentiment. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not just holding Bitcoin; they are actively integrating it into their investment products and services. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions are playing a key role. With concerns about inflation persisting in many economies, investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a potential store of value, much like digital gold. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a growing vote of confidence in its long-term proposition. Key Levels and Market Sentiment to Watch Breaking through such a major psychological level is a technically significant event. Traders are now closely watching to see if Bitcoin can consolidate above $88,000 and use it as a new support base. The market sentiment has shifted notably from cautious optimism to outright excitement. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are volatile. While the trend is currently positive, healthy markets experience pullbacks. Therefore, consider these points: Support Levels: The previous resistance near $85,000 may now act as a key support zone. Trading Volume: Sustained high volume confirms the strength of the move. On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange outflows can indicate whether investors are moving coins to long-term storage. What Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Mean for Investors? For long-term holders, this rally is a welcome validation of their strategy. It reinforces the importance of patience and conviction in the face of market cycles. For new investors, the move presents both an opportunity and a reminder to proceed with education and caution. The principle of ‘buying the dip’ becomes more challenging during a strong Bitcoin price surge , but dollar-cost averaging remains a prudent strategy to mitigate timing risk. The current atmosphere underscores why having a clear plan is more important than ever. Looking Ahead: The Road to $100,000? Naturally, all eyes are now on the next big target: the $100,000 mark. Each major resistance break builds momentum and attracts more attention from the broader financial world. This Bitcoin price surge could be the precursor to an even larger market cycle if current catalysts, like spot ETF inflows and favorable regulatory clarity, continue. However, the path is unlikely to be a straight line. Expect volatility, but view it as a feature of the market, not a bug. The underlying technology and adoption narrative for Bitcoin remain stronger than ever. Conclusion: A Milestone Moment Bitcoin trading above $88,000 is more than just a number on a screen. It represents a major vote of confidence in the resilience and future of decentralized digital assets. This Bitcoin price surge highlights the asset’s growing maturity and its undeniable impact on the global financial landscape. While past performance never guarantees future results, this milestone provides a compelling chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin suddenly rise above $88,000? A1: The surge is likely due to a combination of factors, including positive institutional investment flows, broader macroeconomic trends favoring alternative assets, and strong technical buying momentum after key resistance levels were broken. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin now? A2: “Too late” is relative in crypto markets. While buying at lower prices is ideal, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to enter markets at various price points, reducing the risk of buying a single peak. Q3: Could the price drop back down quickly? A3> Yes, volatility is inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Sharp rallies can be followed by corrections. Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations and avoid investing more than they can afford to lose. Q4: What’s the next major price target for Bitcoin? A4: The psychological $100,000 level is the most widely watched next target. However, the market must first establish $88,000 as a stable support zone. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A5> A strong Bitcoin often leads to increased overall market confidence, which can benefit major altcoins. However, capital may also rotate from alts into Bitcoin during its dominant rallies. Q6: Where can I track the Bitcoin price reliably? A6> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price data. Always cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources.

55974507,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/why-chipforge-might-become-the-home-of-the-next-generation-of-edge-ai-chips,1766066232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/55974507.jpeg,Why ChipForge Might Become the Home of the Next Generation of Edge-AI Chips,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/why-chipforge-might-become-the-home-of-the-next-generation-of-edge-ai-chips,"A quick look at the semiconductor landscape today and one can see that the sector is dominated by a few players, making custom chip design an arena of sky-high costs and long timelines. In fact, designing a sophisticated AI system-on-chip (SoC) today easily requires hundreds of millions of dollars alongside years of R&D, with one analysis estimating that the development of a large 2 nm chip development can approach $725 million, while even a “relatively sophisticated” 5 nm SoC can cost well over $500 million. ChipForge , the world’s first decentralized chip design project, powered by the TATSU ecosystem aims to break this mold by opening up the realm of chip design to a global community of contributors, primarily via the fusing of blockchain-style incentives with open-source hardware (thus turning chip development into a competitive yet collaborative game). As part of its core offering, “miners” can submit hardware designs for defined challenges, following which peer validators can use industrial EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools to check functionality, timing, power and area. The result is a crowdsourced innovation marketplace, where engineers worldwide can co-create and refine open-source chip components. Even more crucially, this networked approach addresses the “Edge AI” conundrum where devices from phones to IoT sensors are increasingly in the lookout for smarter, more efficient AI chips. Decentralized by design At its core, ChipForge offers a blockchain-based subnet (Subnet SN84 on Bittensor), enabling miners to compete in designing real silicon components. In practical terms, this means the platform issues periodic challenges (for example, an ALU block or a neural accelerator) for which interested participants can download specifications and submit RTL (Verilog) designs. Validators, equipped with containerized EDA toolchains (Verilator, Yosys, OpenLane), can subsequently synthesize, simulate and perform place-and-route on each submission, computing standardized metrics for functionality, performance, area and power (with only the top-scoring design winning rewards in the form of alpha tokens). As a result, ChipForge guarantees global accessibility wherein any qualified developer can join a challenge and design a new chip module, breaking the geographic and institutional barriers of traditional silicon R&D. And because every submission is evaluated on identical criteria, only truly optimized designs advance. The results speak for themselves Though still young, ChipForge has already posted impressive milestones with the network’s first major success having been the completion of a full RISC-V processor core replete with cryptographic capabilities. It included a base 32-bit integer ISA plus M (multiply/divide), C (compressed instructions), and K (crypto) extensions (alongside built-in AES encryption/decryption and SHA hashing). In addition to this, the project has also successfully established a robust development infrastructure. The team recently deployed a “production-ready platform supporting concurrent challenge execution” and containerized EDA servers, ensuring all designs pass through industry-standard pipelines. Importantly enough, ChipForge’s tokenomics only reward the very top designs, so mining teams are made to focus on lean and efficient solutions, an ethos that has given birth to a community-first design loop. Accelerating ‘Edge-AI’ innovation The timing of ChipForge’s emergence could hardly be better as the demand for Edge AI (i.e. tech where machine learning algorithms are processed directly on-device) has surged to a whopping $733 billion. Even leading cloud and device companies have all bet on bespoke silicon solutions with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and NVIDIA having embraced open ISAs. Thus for billions of edge-enabled smartphones, wearables, autonomous robots and cameras, ChipForge has addressed lingering issues pertaining to power efficiency and latency while simultaneously gearing up for more ambitious goals in the near term. For starters, the company is looking to move designs from FPGA prototypes to actual silicon (leveraging programs like Google’s OpenMPW shuttles) while extending its security features into the post-quantum era. To this point, its current RISC-V core have already integrated critical crypto functions (AES, SHA), with the team planning to add quantum-safe encryption to future designs. Therefore with AI chip sales climbing to more than 15% annually over the next 3 years, ChipForge’s model could very well become the “home” of next-generation on-device AI processors, thereby bridging the gap between the ongoing open-source movement and the cutting edge of silicon technology.

Falcon Finance’s synthetic dollar is now live on @base . This expansion introduces Falcon's $2.1 billion market cap synthetic dollar, backed by a diverse mix of crypto blue chips and tokenized RWAs, to a cost-effective, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 that has become a leading hub… pic.twitter.com/g813beBEsf — Falcon Finance (@falconfinance) December 18, 2025 The integration allows users to bridge USDf from Ethereum to Base and access some of the most competitive yields among major yield-bearing stable assets, as onchain activity across the network reaches record levels. The launch comes as Base continues to consolidate its position as a core hub for decentralized finance and onchain payments, with infrastructure increasingly designed to support both crypto-native and mainstream financial use cases. Base Activity Surges Following Fusaka Upgrade The deployment coincides with a pivotal month for Base following the activation of Ethereum’s Fusaka hard fork, which expanded Layer 2 capacity by approximately eight times. Since the upgrade, Base said it has recorded a sharp rise in network performance, with monthly transactions surpassing an all-time high of more than 452 million. Lower transaction fees and expanded gas limits have improved the economics of onchain activity, enabling more complex DeFi strategies and high-frequency use cases such as micropayments. The improved scalability has also strengthened Base’s appeal to developers and institutions seeking reliable, cost-efficient settlement infrastructure. A Multi-Asset Approach to Stable Value Unlike traditional fiat-backed stablecoins, USDf is overcollateralized by a diversified basket of assets that includes crypto blue chips such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, alongside tokenized U.S. Treasuries, sovereign bonds, equities and gold. This structure brings more than $2.3 billion in reserves onchain, positioning USDf among the top ten stable assets by backing and making it a distinct addition to Base’s liquidity layer. Falcon Finance has also been expanding USDf beyond purely crypto-based collateral. Most recently, the protocol added tokenized Mexican sovereign bills (CETES), introducing emerging-market sovereign yield into its onchain reserve mix. Yield Mechanics and DeFi Integration The integration introduces new yield opportunities for Base users through Falcon’s yield-bearing token, sUSDf. Since launch, sUSDf has distributed more than $19.1 million in cumulative yield, including nearly $1 million over the past 30 days. Returns are generated through diversified strategies such as funding rate arbitrage, cross-exchange price arbitrage, options-based strategies and native altcoin staking. “Expanding USDf to Base is part of a larger shift we’re seeing across onchain markets,” said Fiona Ma, VP of Growth at Falcon Finance. “Stable assets need to be more flexible, more composable, and available across the networks where people are actually building. Base is one of those places.” Base users can now bridge USDf, stake for yield, provide liquidity on platforms such as Aerodrome, and tap into the network’s expanding DeFi stack. For Base, the arrival of a multi-asset-backed synthetic dollar adds another core financial primitive as the network increasingly positions itself as a settlement layer for both decentralized and traditional finance rails.

Most major tokens have fallen in the past 24 hours, yet privacy coins have bucked the overall trend, particularly after Canton and Zcash each announced partnerships, with DTCC and ShapeShift, respectively. With the market still largely subdued after several months of sideways movement and losses, it’s now arguable that a breakout is becoming increasingly overdue and increasingly likely. We’ve therefore chosen the best meme coin to buy today that could 100x in 2026, with our pick – Ethereum-based trading token Maxi Doge ($DOGE) – having the potential to rally strongly when it lists in the next few weeks. Best Meme Coin To Buy Today That Could 100x in 2026 – 18 December 2025 Maxi Doge is a Doge-themed token with a twist, with the ERC-20 coin leaning into a perma-bull trading theme in which investors are encouraged to push things to the max. Its website proudly boasts that Maxi Doge “ trades on 1000x leverage ,” tapping into the desire to make big gains rather than play it safe. Wake up. Read charts. Check profit. GM. pic.twitter.com/3pCjCSqB4E — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) December 9, 2025 This emphasis on trading isn’t purely cosmetic, since Maxi Doge has also launched a Telegram channel in which it’s growing a community of likeminded traders. Not only will investors be able to share tips and coordinate strategies in this channel, but they will also be able to take part in regular trading competitions. Best-performing participants will rank on a global leaderboard, and will receive rewards in the form of MAXI tokens, something which should boost engagement. By developing a community in this way, Maxi Doge is already transforming itself into something more than another run-of-the-mill meme coin. This strategy seems to be working already, since the coin has raised more than $4.3 million in its ongoing presale. This is a strong indicator of how far it could go once it launches, with the coin set to list on exchanges in the New Year. How to Buy Maxi Doge Before It Lists: Could It Be the Next Big Doge Token? As an Ethereum token, holders will also be able to stake Maxi Doge, with the coin currently paying out a yield of 71% APY. The coin will have a maximum supply of 150.24 billion MAXI, which it will share between marketing, development, liquidity and staking. In fact, 25% of its total supply will go to its Maxi Fund, a treasury that will fund marketing campaigns and partnerships, helping to keep the token in the public eye. This all gives Maxi Doge strong prospects for success, which is why it’s our best meme coin to buy today that could 100x in 2026. Investors can buy it now by going to the Maxi Doge website and connecting a suitable wallet, with the coin now available at $0.0002735. This price will rise again tomorrow, and will continue to rise until the sale ends. Interested parties should therefore act quickly, with MAXI’s launch potentially coinciding with a big market-wide recovery.

By 2028, the maximum ELON price might reach $0.0000001400. The price of Dogelon Mars is expected to reach a maximum level of $0.0000004600 in 2031. Dogelon Mars (ELON) is a meme cryptocurrency launched on April 23, 2021, during the height of the meme coin boom. Built on Ethereum and Polygon, it’s a blend of Dogecoin-themed jokes, Elon Musk-style hype, and the classic “to Mars” narrative. Even though Elon Musk does not have any formal relationship to the project, the price of ELON has historically been highly responsive to trends on social media and to that of broader market sentiment. Despite its joke branding, Dogelon Mars has built a large and active community, with over 300,000 followers on X (Twitter) and more than 84,000 on Telegram. The founders of the project remain anonymous, common among meme coins, though the fact that ELON has been in the market over a period of years reduces the chance of it being a temporary scam. Its price stability and awareness are still among the strongest because of the community involvement. Historically, ELON soared over 50x soon after launch and hit an all-time high of $0.00003263 in July 2021, and declined more than 99% as the meme coin market phase faded. In this Dogelon Mars price prediction, we examine ELON’s price history, market sentiment, and key catalysts to assess its investment potential and possible price direction from 2025 to 2031.

ELON posted a small decline as buyers failed to defend current price levels. Immediate support is forming near $0.0000000480, while resistance stands around $0.0000000520. On December 18, 2025, Dogelon Mars’ price analysis indicated continued downside pressure. The meme coin is currently trading around $0.0000000498, having fallen slightly over the past 24 hours. The Overall momentum remains weak, as sellers continue to dominate and volume remains low, limiting any meaningful recovery attempts with immediate support forming near $0.0000000480 and key resistance standing around $0.0000000520, at which point the selling pressure has consistently suppressed any upward action. Dogelon Mars 1-day chart The daily price chart for Dogelon Mars confirms a prolonged bearish trend. The price continues to post lower highs and lower lows, with the price trading well below key moving averages. Recent candles show minor stabilization near current levels, but there are no confirmed reversal signals. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating reduced volatility and growing price compression. The upper Bollinger Band, acting as resistance, is positioned near $0.0000000550, while the lower band provides support around $0.0000000480. ELON/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI-14) is currently at 33.64, remaining below the neutral 50 mark. This reflects persistent selling pressure, although the indicator approaching oversold territory suggests downside momentum may be gradually weakening. The MACD on the daily chart remains bearish, with the MACD line hovering around −0.0000000003 and staying below the signal line near −0.0000000022. The histogram remains negative but is flattening, indicating that bearish momentum persists, though selling pressure is gradually easing as the market consolidates. Dogelon Mars 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Dogelon Mars is trading around $0.0000000499, showing continued short-term weakness after failing to sustain earlier recovery attempts. Price action reflects a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming that sellers remain in control as buying interest stays limited near current levels. The RSI (14) has dropped sharply into deep oversold territory, with the RSI reading near 22.25, while the RSI signal line is hovering close to 0.00 on the chart. This extreme oversold condition indicates aggressive selling pressure in recent sessions and suggests that while downside momentum is strong, a short-term technical bounce could occur if sellers begin to exhaust. ELON/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD remains firmly bearish, with the MACD line around −0.0000000002, sitting below the signal line near −0.0000000014, and the histogram holding negative values around −0.0000000013. This setup confirms that bearish momentum is still dominant, although the flattening histogram implies that selling pressure may be slowing rather than accelerating.

Dogelon Mars is expected to remain range-bound with a bearish bias, as weak momentum and persistent selling pressure continue to limit upside moves.

Is Dogelon Mars a good investment? Dogelon Mars (ELON) has shown short-term gains, but its long-term outlook remains weak. Despite a 13.93% yearly rise and 239.13% over three years, the token lacks development, utility, and a roadmap, a fact supported by the latest data. Competing meme coins on Ethereum and Solana are gaining ground, and forecasts suggest ELON could lose value after 2025 and fade by 2030.

ELON is experiencing short-term fluctuations, though no confirmed recovery trend has emerged yet. Will ELON reach $1? Reaching a closing price of $1 for Dogelon Mars (ELON) is highly unlikely due to its massive circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalisation required.

Reaching $100 for Dogelon Mars (ELON) is virtually impossible, as it would require a maximum price level that is not feasible given its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate.

Dogelon Mars historic price sentiment Dogelon Mars Price History Dogelon launched and reached its ATH of $0.00003263 in May 2021. In May 2021, it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00003263. This rapid ascent was driven by a combination of market speculation, social media hype, and the broader bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. The downward trend persisted throughout 2022, reflecting a broader correction in the cryptocurrency market. By the end of the year, ELON had lost approximately 99% of its ATH value. The cryptocurrency market faced increased regulatory scrutiny, market saturation with new meme coins, and reduced retail investor interest, all contributing to the decline in ELON’s price. In 2023, ELON started the year on a relatively low note, with its price fluctuating around $0.0000001756. However, there was a notable peak in 2023, when ELON reached $0.0000005196. This spike was likely driven by short-term speculative trading, possible minor endorsements, or temporary positive market sentiment. By the end of 2023, the price had stabilized somewhat but remained much lower than its previous peaks, continuing to fluctuate around $0.0000001756. At the beginning of the year 2024, a broader crypto market spike provided some upward momentum for ELON, pushing its price to $0.000000227. Mid of 2024The crypto market spiked, and pushed ELON to $0.000000227. However, the price has since dropped and now fluctuates around $0.00000018 to $0.00000019. Following the spike, ELON’s price began to decline again, reflecting the coin’s ongoing volatility and the speculative nature of its trading. In October 2024, ELON stayed near $0.000000188 as meme coin interest cooled across Ethereum and Solana. By December 2024, the token hovered around $0.000000182 with little change in trading volume. In January 2025, ELON opened at $0.000000130, showing no strong rebound despite a broader altcoin bounce. March 2025 saw a brief rise from a Bit2Me promo, but the price quickly dropped back near $0.000000128. In May 2025, ELON slipped below its 10-day SMA, closing around $0.000000122 with a weak RSI and bearish MACD. As of June 14, 2025, Dogelon Mars (ELON) is trading at approximately $0.0000001200, reflecting continued bearish pressure and declining investor interest. In 2025, Dogelon Mars (ELON) trended downward overall, falling from around $0.000000130 in January to the $0.00000005–$0.00000006 range by December as bearish pressure persisted.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|ICO|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 14:00:06
55986925,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=247714,1766066412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Robinhood Lists LDO: A Bold Move for Mainstream DeFi Access,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/robinhood-lists-ldo-spot-trading/,"BitcoinWorld Robinhood Lists LDO: A Bold Move for Mainstream DeFi Access In a significant move for decentralized finance, the popular trading platform Robinhood has announced the listing of LDO for spot trading. This decision brings the governance token of the leading Ethereum staking protocol, Lido DAO, directly to millions of retail investors. For the first time, users can seamlessly buy, sell, and hold LDO alongside stocks and other cryptocurrencies on a single, user-friendly app. This integration marks a pivotal step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving world of DeFi. Why Did Robinhood List LDO? Robinhood’s decision to list LDO is not random. It reflects a strategic alignment with growing investor demand for exposure to Ethereum’s ecosystem. Lido Finance is the dominant liquid staking solution, allowing users to stake ETH while receiving stETH, a tradable token representing their stake. The LDO token governs this massive protocol. By making Robinhood lists LDO a reality, the platform taps into several key trends: Institutional and Retail Demand: There is increasing interest in assets that power fundamental DeFi infrastructure. Ethereum’s Post-Merge Landscape: Staking has become a core narrative, and Lido is a central player. Platform Expansion: Robinhood continues to diversify its crypto offerings beyond major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, this listing serves both user interest and Robinhood’s growth strategy in the competitive crypto brokerage space. What Does This Mean for the Average Investor? For the everyday user, the fact that Robinhood lists LDO simplifies access dramatically. Previously, acquiring LDO required using a dedicated cryptocurrency exchange, managing a self-custody wallet, and navigating DeFi interfaces. Now, it’s as straightforward as buying a stock. This lowers the technical barrier to entry, potentially introducing LDO to a vast new audience. However, investors should still understand what they are buying. The LDO token’s value is tied to the success and governance of the Lido DAO, not directly to the price of ETH. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? This listing carries weight for both the platform and the token. The primary benefit is liquidity and accessibility . Millions of Robinhood users now have a frictionless on-ramp to a major DeFi governance token. This could drive significant trading volume and increase mainstream awareness of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). However, challenges exist. Centralized listings like this contrast with the decentralized ethos of DeFi. Users do not hold the private keys to their LDO on Robinhood, meaning they cannot use it to participate in Lido DAO governance directly on-chain. This creates a divide between token ownership and its utility. How Could This Impact LDO and the DeFi Market? The announcement that Robinhood lists LDO is already a positive signal for the market. It validates Lido’s position as a critical piece of crypto infrastructure. Increased accessibility often correlates with increased demand, which could positively influence the token’s market dynamics. Moreover, it sets a precedent. If LDO performs well on Robinhood, we may see the platform list other key DeFi governance tokens, further weaving DeFi into the fabric of mainstream investing. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts If you’re considering this new trading option, here are a few points to ponder: Do Your Research: Understand that LDO is a governance token. Its value proposition differs from a direct asset like Bitcoin. Consider Your Goals: Are you seeking short-term trading or long-term exposure to Ethereum staking growth? Weigh Custody Options: For active governance participation, holding LDO in a self-custody wallet is necessary. Monitor Volume: Watch how trading develops to gauge mainstream adoption. In conclusion, Robinhood’s move to list LDO is a landmark event. It democratizes access to a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, signaling a maturation phase where complex crypto assets enter the mainstream brokerage world. While it introduces some philosophical tensions around custody, the net effect is a powerful boost for visibility and legitimacy. The ease with which millions can now access LDO may well accelerate the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance, making governance tokens a standard part of the modern investment portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is LDO? LDO is the governance token for Lido DAO, the decentralized organization that runs Lido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol for Ethereum. Can I stake my ETH through Robinhood using LDO? No. Listing LDO for trading does not mean Robinhood offers staking services through Lido. You are only trading the LDO governance token itself. If I buy LDO on Robinhood, can I vote in Lido DAO proposals? No. To participate in on-chain governance, you must hold your LDO in a compatible self-custody wallet (like MetaMask) and connect it to Lido’s governance platform. Why is Robinhood listing LDO significant? It brings a major DeFi governance token to a massive, mainstream audience, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and validating the asset class. Are there fees for trading LDO on Robinhood? Robinhood Crypto typically does not charge trading commission fees, but it earns through spread. Always check their latest fee schedule for details. What are the risks of buying LDO? Like all cryptocurrencies, LDO is volatile. Its value is also specifically tied to the usage, success, and governance decisions of the Lido DAO, introducing protocol-specific risks. Found this breakdown of why Robinhood lists LDO helpful?

55986886,646521,1766066432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55986886.jpeg,Jimmy Carr Tells UK To Mine Bitcoin With Wasted Night-Time Power,https://bitcoinist.com/jimmy-carr-uk-mine-bitcoin/,"UK comedian and TV host Jimmy Carr suggested the British state should consider mining bitcoin using electricity that would otherwise go unused overnight, framing the idea as part of a broader push for more “radical” thinking about public finances. Will The UK Mine Bitcoin With Excess Energy? Carr made the comments in a Dec. 11 TRIGGERnometry interview recorded on “the day of the budget,” where he questioned why the UK has never created a sovereign wealth fund and argued that some revenue-generating assets should be treated as collectively owned.“ There are certain things that should belong to everyone,” he said, pointing to “the oil and gas that sit under the UK” and “the wind farms around the coast.” Carr claimed that “all of that money goes to the Crown,” and asked why it shouldn’t accrue more directly to the public. He extended the argument to infrastructure such as “mobile phone masts,” while stressing he wasn’t making a socialist case. “I’m not a socialist. I’m not even for state capitalism,” Carr said, before arguing that some assets “should belong to everyone.” From there, Carr offered bitcoin mining as a concrete example of a non-tax revenue lever the government could explore. “I would not mind it if our government said, yeah, we’re going to mine for Bitcoins,” he said. “Our power stations, they don’t do anything at night, so we’re going to mine for Bitcoins.” He added: “Great. New gold standard. Fine.” Jimmy Carr is the United Kingdom’s most popular comedian and celebrity. Carr says, “I would not mind it if our government mines for bitcoins. Our power stations don’t do anything at night, so we’re going to mine for bitcoins. Great. New gold standard. Fine.” pic.twitter.com/GZRvQT8mua — Documenting ₿itcoin (@DocumentingBTC) December 17, 2025 Carr did not propose a formal policy design, cite figures on spare capacity, or address governance questions around state-run mining. The point, as he presented it, was directional: use underutilized national infrastructure more aggressively and stop treating taxation as the default answer to funding pressures. “Do something radical, something interesting with the finances of the country,” Carr said. “Why does it all have to come from taxation?” While the remarks come from an entertainer rather than a policymaker, the framing is notable for how it positions bitcoin in a nation-state register: not only as a tradable asset, but as something a government could plausibly produce using excess energy capacity, then hold as an alternative form of reserve value. Carr’s “mine with spare power” idea has real-world analogs: Bhutan has quietly built a state-linked bitcoin mining operation powered largely by hydropower, a model often described as a way to monetize seasonal surplus generation. El Salvador has also leaned into the “excess energy” narrative. The country mined nearly 474 BTC over roughly three years using 1.5 MW of geothermal energy from a state-owned plant tied to the Tecapa volcano. And in places like Iceland , miners have long been drawn by plentiful renewable supply (and the economics of cheap, clean power), making it one of the most mining-dense jurisdictions globally.

Key Takeaways: Markets are watching the CPI print closely, as it could shape rate-cut expectations and decide whether risk assets rally into year-end. Bitcoin remains range-bound near $85K as mixed US macro data keeps risk appetite muted. ETF inflows and falling leverage suggest buyers are beginning to defend the $85K level despite broader caution. “Jerome Powell recently said rates are at good levels to wait & observe the data,” crypto analyst Mister Crypto wrote in a recent post on X . He said a hotter-than-expected CPI reading would likely dampen expectations for rate cuts, weighing on both equities and digital assets. A softer print, however, could revive hopes for easier monetary policy and trigger a late-year rally. Bitcoin Stalls Near $85K as Risk-Off Mood Limits Upside, Analyst Says Bitcoin enters the data release on fragile footing. The largest cryptocurrency slipped around 2% on Tuesday to near $85,300 and has traded sideways between $85,000 and $90,000 throughout the week. Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, said the failure to push higher reflects a broader risk-off tone driven by mixed US macro signals. Recent data offered little clarity. Nonfarm payrolls surprised to the upside, unemployment ticked higher, and S&P Global PMI readings missed expectations. “The mixed signal kept bearish momentum intact and limited any immediate upside response,” Hasn said. Still, Bitcoin appears to be finding tentative support near the $85,000 level. Hasn noted early signs of bargain accumulation, with dip buyers stepping in cautiously after weeks of selling pressure. Today’s CPI print is crucial. Jerome Powell recently said rates are at good levels to wait & observe the data. A higher than expected CPI print today would be very bad for markets, as it would make future rate cuts less likely. On the flipside, a lower than expected print… pic.twitter.com/3GIgZ22wxb — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) December 18, 2025 On-chain data from BGeometrics supports that view, showing small increases in whale wallets and retail-sized holders owning between 1 and 100 BTC. At the same time, addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC declined slightly, suggesting a pause in the heavy whale distribution seen in November. ETF flows add another layer of support. Data from SoSo Value shows US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded more than $450 million in inflows on Tuesday, even as futures market activity cooled. Derivatives data points to a continued reduction in speculation. CoinGlass reports that crypto futures open interest has fallen by roughly $11 billion over the past week, nearing its lowest level since June. With leverage being flushed out and spot demand stabilizing, Hasn said the $85,000 area is starting to look less like a trap and more like a level buyers are willing to defend. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Selling May Be Nearing Its End: K33 Bitcoin has seen sustained sell-side pressure from long-term holders since 2024, but that trend may be nearing exhaustion , according to a new report from research and brokerage firm K33. The firm estimates that around 1.6 million BTC, worth roughly $138 billion, has re-entered circulation over the past two years as early investors took profits. K33 head of research Vetle Lunde said the scale of these movements points to deliberate selling rather than technical factors like wallet consolidation or ETF-related transfers. The report notes that 2024 and 2025 rank among the largest years on record for long-term supply reactivation, driven not by speculation, but by direct selling into deeper institutional liquidity.

The Consumer Price Index rose just 2.7% year-over-year, notably cooler than the anticipated 3.1%. For cryptocurrency investors and traders, this economic indicator is a crucial pulse check, often dictating the Federal Reserve’s next move and, consequently, market sentiment. Let’s break down what this softer inflation print really means. What Does the US CPI November Report Actually Say? The U.S. Department of Labor’s report provided clear signals. The headline US CPI November increase of 2.7% year-over-year fell short of the 3.1% forecast. More importantly, Core CPI—which strips out volatile food and energy prices—climbed 2.6%, also below the 3.0% consensus. This suggests the disinflationary trend is broadening beyond just energy price drops. Therefore, the data indicates that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign is finally showing more consistent results in taming price pressures. This is critical context for all asset classes. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Inflation Data? Cryptocurrency markets don’t operate in a vacuum. They are deeply intertwined with macroeconomics. Here’s how the US CPI November data directly impacts digital assets: Interest Rate Expectations: Lower inflation reduces pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates further. High rates make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to yield-bearing, safe assets. Market Liquidity: A dovish Fed pivot could eventually lead to increased liquidity in the financial system, which has historically been a tailwind for cryptocurrency prices. Risk Sentiment: Beating inflation forecasts boosts overall investor confidence. This often leads to a “risk-on” environment where capital flows into stocks and cryptocurrencies. What Are the Immediate Market Implications? Following the release, a sigh of relief swept through financial markets. Treasury yields dipped, and the US dollar weakened slightly—a typical reaction to softer inflation. For Bitcoin and major altcoins, this environment is generally supportive. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The Fed will want to see several months of similar data before declaring victory. Moreover, while the trend is encouraging, inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target. The path forward will require patience. Investors should watch for consistency in future US CPI November follow-up reports. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Strategy How can you use this information? Don’t just react to the headline. Consider these points: Monitor Fed Communication: Listen closely to statements from Fed officials. Their interpretation of this US CPI November data is more important than the number itself. Diversify Your Thesis: While macro is key, also focus on blockchain-specific developments like ETF approvals or protocol upgrades. Avoid Knee-Jerk Reactions: One data point doesn’t make a trend. Use this information to inform your long-term strategy, not for short-term speculation. Conclusion: A Step in the Right Direction The cooler-than-expected US CPI November report is an undeniably positive development. It reinforces the disinflation narrative and increases the likelihood that the Fed’s tightening cycle has peaked. For the cryptocurrency market, this removes a significant macro headwind and opens the door for a more stable foundation for growth. The journey to 2% inflation continues, but this report marks a hopeful milestone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the CPI and why is it important? A: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. It’s the primary gauge of inflation, which directly influences central bank policy and financial markets. Q: How does lower CPI affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? A: Lower inflation data can lead to expectations of lower interest rates or a pause in hikes. This typically weakens the US Dollar and makes high-growth, risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors. Q: Is the inflation fight over based on this report? A> Not yet. While the US CPI November data is encouraging, the Fed targets 2% sustained inflation. They will need to see a series of similar reports before significantly changing policy direction. Q: Should I change my crypto investment strategy based on this? A> Macro data should inform your strategy, not dictate rapid changes. Use it as one factor among many, including on-chain metrics, tokenomics, and your personal investment horizon. Q: When is the next CPI data release? A> The CPI report is typically released monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics around the 13th of each month, covering the previous month’s data. Q: What’s the difference between headline CPI and Core CPI? A> Headline CPI includes all items, notably volatile food and energy prices. Core CPI excludes these to provide a clearer view of underlying, persistent inflation trends. Found this analysis of the US CPI November data helpful?

Here’s What This Means for Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-weekly-rsi-hits-33-heres-what-this-means-for-price-rally/,"Periods of deep market stress often leave subtle clues before sentiment begins to shift. In crypto, these clues rarely come from headlines alone, but from long-term technical indicators that capture sustained momentum. When such indicators approach historically sensitive levels, they tend to attract heightened attention from traders looking for early signs of a trend change. That attention intensified after Abdullah Nassif, host of Good Evening Crypto, highlighted a notable development on XRP’s weekly chart. His observation focuses on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely followed momentum indicator that has now fallen to levels rarely seen without consequence. Understanding the Weekly RSI Signal The Relative Strength Index measures momentum by comparing recent gains to recent losses on a scale from zero to one hundred. On higher timeframes, such as the weekly chart, RSI is especially valuable because it filters out short-term noise and reflects broader market behavior. BREAKING: $XRP WEEKLY RSI HITS 33! Could See A LARGE Bounce From These Ranges… pic.twitter.com/HbCFBaZdKR — Good Evening Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) December 18, 2025 An RSI reading near 33 indicates sustained bearish momentum, though it remains just above the traditional oversold threshold of 30. Historically, weekly RSI values in this range suggest that selling pressure has been dominant for an extended period, often coinciding with late-stage corrections rather than the beginning of fresh declines. Why Weekly RSI Levels Matter More Unlike daily indicators, weekly RSI moves slowly and only reaches extreme levels after prolonged trends. When it approaches the low 30s, it signals that bearish momentum may be losing strength. In previous market cycles, similar conditions have often preceded stabilization phases or sharp relief rallies once buyers regain confidence. This does not imply an automatic reversal. Instead, it highlights a zone where risk-to-reward dynamics begin to shift, especially for traders and investors monitoring longer-term setups. Historical Behavior Around Low RSI Zones Across multiple crypto assets, extended periods of low weekly RSI have frequently aligned with accumulation phases. During these periods, the price may continue to move sideways or remain volatile, but aggressive downside momentum tends to fade. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For XRP specifically, past instances of deeply compressed momentum have been followed by strong rebounds once broader market sentiment improved. While history does not guarantee repetition, it provides important context for interpreting current conditions. Technical Confirmation Still Matters Despite the significance of the RSI reading, it should not be viewed in isolation. Sustainable rallies typically require confirmation from other factors, including reclaiming key price levels, improving volume, and shifts in market structure. Without these, RSI can remain suppressed longer than expected. Abdullah Nassif’s observation highlights potential, not certainty. The indicator suggests that XRP may be nearing a zone where a meaningful bounce becomes technically plausible , but confirmation remains essential. What This Means for XRP Going Forward The weekly RSI at 33 places XRP at a critical juncture. It reflects exhaustion in bearish momentum rather than confirmed bullish reversal. If demand strengthens and broader market conditions stabilize, a strong reaction from these levels would not be unusual. For now, the signal serves as a reminder that XRP is approaching historically sensitive territory. Whether this leads to a large bounce or extended consolidation will depend on how price responds in the weeks ahead.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,004.3. This surge marks a significant psychological and technical milestone, capturing the attention of traders and investors worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive rally, and is the momentum sustainable? What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? Several key factors are converging to push the BTC price to new heights. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their offerings, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Finally, positive sentiment around upcoming network developments and regulatory clarity in certain regions is creating a bullish environment. Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking the $89,000 level is more than just a number. It represents a crucial resistance point that traders have been watching closely. A sustained hold above this level could open the path toward testing even higher thresholds. Market sentiment, as measured by various fear and greed indices, has shifted notably into ‘greed’ or ‘extreme greed’ territory, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, this also suggests the market may be due for a short-term pullback as some investors take profits. What Should Investors Consider Now? For anyone tracking the BTC price , this rally presents both opportunity and risk. Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor Volume: Ensure the price increase is supported by high trading volume, which confirms genuine buying interest. Diversify: Avoid over-concentration in any single asset, even one as strong as Bitcoin. Set Clear Goals: Define your investment strategy—are you trading short-term swings or holding for the long term? Stay Informed: Keep up with news regarding regulations and major institutional moves, as these can cause rapid BTC price shifts. The Road Ahead for the BTC Price While the breakthrough past $89,000 is exhilarating, the cryptocurrency market is famously volatile. The future trajectory of the BTC price will likely depend on a mix of technical factors, broader financial market trends, and crypto-specific developments. Key events to watch include decisions from major central banks and any significant updates from within the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. The current strength suggests bullish confidence, but prudent investors always prepare for potential volatility. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin The surge that has propelled the BTC price above $89,000 is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and growing maturity as a financial asset. It underscores a powerful narrative of adoption and resilience. For the crypto community, this is a moment of validation; for new observers, it’s a compelling reason to pay attention. As always, navigating this landscape requires a blend of optimism for Bitcoin’s potential and a disciplined approach to risk management in its dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused Bitcoin to rise above $89,000? The rally is likely due to a combination of increased institutional investment, positive market sentiment, and Bitcoin’s ongoing perception as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at $89,000? “Too late” is subjective and depends on your investment horizon and strategy. While buying at a local high carries risk, many long-term investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. Could the BTC price drop sharply after this high? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Profit-taking after a strong rally is common, which can lead to corrections. It’s wise to be prepared for price fluctuations. What is the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? If the $89,000 level holds as support, traders often look toward round numbers like $90,000 and then the previous all-time high as the next key resistance levels to watch. How does this price affect the broader crypto market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market.

In a statement released on Dec. 17, 2025, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets said broker-dealers that carry crypto asset securities for customers must maintain exclusive possession of those assets by controlling the private keys used to access and transfer them. Our Division of Trading and Markets issued a staff statement on the custody of crypto asset securities by broker-dealers. https://t.co/5u3mrAGmmu — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) December 17, 2025 Firms that fail to meet this standard may not treat themselves as having custody under federal customer protection rules. Holding Crypto Isn’t Enough—SEC Says Control Is What Counts The statement focuses on paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c3-3, the long-standing customer protection rule that requires broker-dealers to maintain physical possession or control of fully paid and excess margin securities. While the guidance does not introduce a new rule, it explains how the staff believes that requirement can be met when securities exist on a blockchain rather than in traditional form. Under the SEC’s view, a broker-dealer can deem itself to have possession of a crypto asset security only if it has direct access to the asset on the relevant distributed ledger and the technical ability to transfer it. Source: US SEC That access must not be shared, as the staff emphasized that neither customers nor third parties, including affiliates, can hold private keys or otherwise move the asset without the broker-dealer’s authorization. The guidance also requires broker-dealers to formally assess the blockchains and networks on which crypto asset securities operate before taking custody and to repeat those assessments at regular intervals. Also, firms are expected to evaluate performance, security, governance, upgrade processes, and risks such as hard forks, 51% attacks, or protocol changes that could affect ownership records. If a broker-dealer becomes aware of material security or operational weaknesses in a blockchain network, the staff said the firm should not treat itself as having possession of the asset. The focus, according to the statement, is on risks tied directly to custody and transfer, rather than market or reputational concerns. Crypto Custody Was Once Off-Limits; The SEC Now Says Otherwise The statement arrives after several years in which broker-dealers argued that crypto custody was effectively impossible under SEC interpretations. Between 2022 and 2024, the agency’s approach relied heavily on accounting and structural constraints that discouraged traditional firms from entering the space . Firms under the SEC's jurisdiction will receive a notice first ahead of being hit with an enforcement action, Chair Paul Atkins says. #PaulAtkins #SECChair https://t.co/aWBXuDc2pW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 required public companies holding customer crypto to record those assets as balance-sheet liabilities, making custody capital-intensive and, for many banks, commercially impractical. At the same time, the SEC limited crypto custody largely to special-purpose broker-dealers that were barred from operating traditional securities businesses. Large firms declined to pursue that model, citing operational complexity and regulatory uncertainty. Industry lawyers often described the period as a regulatory dead zone in which compliance was required but rarely achievable. The new statement attempts to resolve that standoff by tying compliance to concrete operational controls rather than abstract concerns about blockchain design. The custody clarification follows another notable development at the SEC. On Dec. 13, the agency published a crypto wallet and custody investor bulletin outlining risks and best practices for self-custody and third-party custody. The guide discussed rehypothecation, commingling of assets, and the trade-offs between hot and cold wallets, indicating a more educational posture toward crypto investors. Together, the custody statement and investor guidance suggest a recalibration in how the SEC approaches crypto market infrastructure, with clearer expectations for firms and more explicit protections for customers.

Key Takeaways: xStocks bring tokenized US stocks and ETFs directly into Telegram via TON Wallet. The tokens offer onchain price exposure without share ownership and are restricted by jurisdiction. The launch tests whether mass distribution can drive adoption of tokenized equities. The move brings tokenized equities into one of the world’s largest messaging platforms, potentially expanding their reach beyond traditional crypto trading venues, according to a Thursday announcement . Through the integration, users can buy, hold and transfer onchain representations of assets such as Tesla, Nvidia and the S&P 500 ETF without leaving the Telegram app. xStocks Offer Onchain Price Exposure Without Direct Share Ownership xStocks are designed as fully collateralized products, backed one-to-one by underlying equities and ETFs held through regulated partners. The tokens track the price of the underlying assets but do not confer direct ownership of the shares, offering users price exposure in an onchain format. The service is not available to US users and is restricted to jurisdictions where the tokens can be legally offered. xStocks has not registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, meaning distribution relies on jurisdictional controls. Tokenized equities are not new, but previous attempts struggled to gain traction. Liquidity constraints, regulatory uncertainty and limited distribution often confined earlier offerings to niche crypto platforms. xStocks are going LIVE Available today on @krakenfx , @Bybit_Official and being rolled out on @solana , this is the next step for internet capital markets.

The TON Foundation framed the launch as a step toward bringing real-world assets into everyday digital activity. TON Foundation president and CEO Max Crown said the integration allows users to hold and trade tokenized U.S. equities “with the same ease as sending a message,” while maintaining self-custody through TON Wallet. For Telegram’s wallet ecosystem, the move builds on earlier experiments. Wallet in Telegram previously launched custodial access to stocks and ETFs through its Crypto Wallet product, which saw early demand despite limited geographic availability. Telegram claims more than 900 million global users, while TON Wallet reports close to 100 million users, giving xStocks immediate exposure to a large consumer base. RWA Tokenization Gains Momentum Earlier this month, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails. The fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger. In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .

Jarett Dunn, the Pump.fun developer sentenced to six years behind bars, orchestrated a brazen theft of $2 million in Solana (SOL). However, his story takes a bizarre twist, transforming a simple crime into a modern digital parable that questions motives and morality in the decentralized world. Who is the Pump.fun Developer Sentenced for Theft? Jarett Dunn wasn’t just another anonymous figure in crypto’s shadows. He was a developer with direct access to the inner workings of Pump.fun, a platform known for launching meme coins on the Solana blockchain. According to court reports from the UK, Dunn exploited this privileged position to siphon a massive amount of SOL from the project’s coffers. The initial act was a clear-cut case of digital embezzlement, but what happened next defied all expectations. Why Did He Become the ‘Robin Hood of Crypto’? Instead of fleeing or hiding the stolen funds, Dunn executed a plan that captured the internet’s imagination. He distributed the entire $2 million haul to thousands of random cryptocurrency wallets. This act of seemingly altruistic chaos immediately earned him the nickname ‘the Robin Hood of crypto.’ Public Confession: Dunn didn’t try to hide. He took to social media to publicly admit to the crime. Mass Redistribution: The funds were scattered widely, making recovery nearly impossible. Motive Mystery: His actions suggested a protest or statement, rather than pure greed. This bizarre strategy, however, did not shield him from the long arm of the law. The Pump.fun developer sentenced in a UK court faced justice for the initial breach of trust, regardless of where the money ultimately went. What Does This Sentence Mean for Crypto Security? The six-year prison term for the Pump.fun developer sends a powerful message. It underscores that blockchain transactions are not anonymous shields against prosecution. Authorities can and will trace digital asset movements and hold individuals accountable. This case highlights a critical challenge in decentralized finance: the immense trust placed in developers and platform creators. When that trust is broken, the consequences can be severe and far-reaching, affecting thousands of users and shaking confidence in emerging platforms. Key Takeaways from the Pump.fun Saga The story of the Pump.fun developer sentenced to prison is more than a news headline. It’s a case study with several crucial lessons for the entire crypto ecosystem. Legal Accountability is Real: The ‘code is law’ ethos does not override national criminal law. Developer Access is a Risk: Projects must implement robust, multi-signature controls and transparency measures. Publicity Doesn’t Equal Impunity: A social media confession and populist narrative did not lessen the legal penalty. For investors, this reinforces the need for due diligence. Understanding who builds and controls a platform is as important as auditing its smart contract code. Conclusion: A Landmark Case for Crypto Justice The sentencing of Jarett Dunn marks a significant moment. It proves that the cryptocurrency industry is maturing under the watchful eye of global legal systems. While the ‘Robin Hood’ narrative is captivating, the foundational principle of property rights and contractual trust remains paramount. The severe sentence for the Pump.fun developer serves as a stark deterrent, reminding all participants that innovation must operate within the framework of the law. The era of consequence-free digital crime is rapidly closing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did the Pump.fun developer do? Jarett Dunn, a developer for the Pump.fun platform, exploited his access to steal $2 million worth of Solana (SOL) from the project. He then distributed it to random wallets and confessed on social media. Why was he called the ‘Robin Hood of crypto’? After stealing the funds, he did not keep them. Instead, he distributed the $2 million to thousands of unknown wallets, an act perceived by some as redistributing wealth, akin to the folk hero Robin Hood. Where was the Pump.fun developer sentenced? He was tried and sentenced in the United Kingdom, receiving a six-year prison term for his crimes. Could the stolen SOL be recovered? Due to the nature of the redistribution to countless anonymous addresses, recovering the full $2 million in SOL is considered highly improbable, if not impossible. What does this mean for other crypto developers? This case sets a clear legal precedent. Developers with privileged access are legally accountable for their actions, and theft of digital assets carries serious real-world consequences. Is Pump.fun still operational? While the platform faced a major crisis, reports indicate it has continued its operations, likely implementing stricter security controls following the incident.

55990830,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=880762,1766071880,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55990830.jpeg,Russians hope to mine crypto while charging their EVs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ev-mining-cryptocurrency-patented-in-russia/,"A company based in Russia’s second-largest city has reportedly patented an EV charging station equipped with a crypto mining module. It claims the idea is to help drivers earn some digital cash back as they top up their batteries with electricity, which isn’t as cheap as it once was. Russians hope to mine crypto while charging their EVs A Russian firm incorporated in St. Petersburg is preparing to offer owners of electric vehicles (EVs) a way to receive some digital change while spending rubles on charging. The company that’s pitching the new product, Rozetki SPb, has already filed for a patent, the local business daily Delovoy Peterburg (DP) unveiled this week. The online edition of the regional newspaper, which claims to have acquainted itself with the patent documentation, calls it a “unique idea.” The latter boils down to allowing users to gain digital coins minted by the rig that should be powered by some of the electricity purchased for the EV. The publication added: “The developers estimate that the mined cryptocurrency will partially offset the cost of charging the electric vehicle, which could be beneficial for both individuals and businesses who own electric vehicles.” They also calculate that a used Tesla Model S would need 300 kWh of electricity for a monthly mileage of a little over 900 miles (about 1,500 km). With household electricity rates in Russia currently standing at an average of 6.2 rubles per 1 kWh, the whole thing should cost the owner a total of 2,600 rubles (less than $33). That’s including the running costs for the additional equipment, which the company says is capable of mining 7,200 rubles’ worth of crypto (over $90 at the time of writing). In theory, a Tesla driver should earn more than 4,000 rubles out of all this. But in practice, the full picture might turn out to be a little different. According to a study by the Russian 2GIS local search platform published last year, 1 kWh may cost an electric car owner up to 18.9 rubles. Experts wonder if the wonder charger work Charging stations are now popping up across Russia and around the world, but the project to create a system that mines crypto while charging EVs sounds like a first. Innovators and entrepreneurs alike have been fascinated by ideas to combine mining with other business opportunities. And there are examples of hybrid devices which, for example, use excess heat released in the minting process to heat homes and industrial sites. Sergei Bezdelov, director of the Industrial Mining Association, believes the Rozetki project fits well into this category. He told DP: “Such solutions demonstrate the potential for practical application of mining equipment beyond traditional data centers.” There are a number of challenges ahead, including the need to convince an investor and ensure the necessary infrastructure. Then comes the obligation to comply with Russia’s new mining rules, which would potentially apply to the owners of the EV stations, too. Current regulations require those engaged in the activity to register and pay taxes if their monthly power consumption exceeds 6,000 kWh, as highlighted by Andrey Loboda, economist and communications manager in the field of industrial mining. Experts contacted by RBC have their doubts as well. On Wednesday, the Russian business news outlet published its comments on the developers’ claim that both private owners and organizations will benefit from the proposed integration. The company’s calculations may be accurate only for small home charging stations, as the profitability of the installation has been estimated based on a rate of 6.2 rubles per kWh of electricity. At the same time, the average price of refueling an electric car at a charging station run by any of the networks in Moscow is approximately 18-19 rubles per kWh, per Dmitry Golovin, Technical Director of Punkt E. According to Yuriy Brisov, partner at the Digital & Analogue Partners consultancy, using electricity supplied to residential areas at preferential rates for that alternative purpose will be a problem, as it may result in additional charges and fines. The “free,” or supposedly cheap energy that underpins similar projects abroad is not available for mining in Russia, where the current legislation treats it as an industrial activity, the lawyer explained and elaborated: “The Russian mining law is essentially designed for either very large industrial miners or very small private miners … Only dubious, shadowy schemes thrive in the middle.” Soon after legalizing cryptocurrency mining in 2024, Russian authorities started restricting it in parts of the country where the mining boom is causing growing electricity shortages. Moscow is also waging a war on illegal crypto farms, employing increasingly sophisticated means, while exploring ways to bring more miners out of the shadow economy.

The payments giant announced it will use its PYUSD stablecoin to finance AI infrastructure, marking a pivotal moment for both cryptocurrency adoption and technological advancement. This strategic move signals a major shift in how large corporations can leverage blockchain assets for real-world, high-growth investments. How Is PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin Fueling AI Development? PayPal is channeling its PYUSD stablecoin directly into the AI sector by supporting on-chain funding for a project called USD.AI. According to a CoinDesk report, this initiative creates a direct financial pipeline from the stablecoin to AI computational resources and infrastructure. Essentially, PayPal is using its digital dollar to become a capital provider in one of the world’s most competitive and expensive technological races. This provides a clear, practical utility for the PYUSD stablecoin beyond simple payments, anchoring its value in a tangible, high-demand asset class. What’s the 4.5% Incentive Program All About? To accelerate adoption, PayPal and the USD.AI Foundation are launching a compelling customer incentive program. Starting in early January, the program will run for one year and offer a 4.5% interest rate on deposits. The kicker? This offer stands for deposits of up to $1 billion. This initiative serves a dual purpose: Drives Adoption: It incentivizes both individuals and institutions to hold and use the PYUSD stablecoin by providing a attractive yield. Funds Growth: The pooled capital directly finances the expansion of AI infrastructure, creating a virtuous cycle of investment and innovation. Why Does This PYUSD Stablecoin Move Matter for Crypto? This is not just another corporate crypto experiment. PayPal’s action carries significant weight for the entire digital asset ecosystem. First, it demonstrates a major, legitimate use case for a stablecoin issued by a traditional financial titan. Second, it bridges the worlds of decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream corporate finance in a very public way. By choosing to fund AI—a sector synonymous with the future—PayPal is making a powerful statement about the long-term role of assets like the PYUSD stablecoin . It transforms the stablecoin from a speculative tool into a foundational building block for critical infrastructure. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While promising, this venture is not without its hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny around stablecoins and digital asset offerings remains intense. Furthermore, the success of the USD.AI project itself will be crucial in validating this model. However, the opportunities are immense. If successful, this could blueprint a new model for corporate treasury management and project financing. Other companies might follow suit, using their own digital assets or established PYUSD stablecoins to fund ventures in cleantech, biotech, or other capital-intensive fields. This move could unlock trillions in dormant corporate capital for innovation. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Currency Utility PayPal’s decision to deploy its PYUSD stablecoin for AI infrastructure financing is a masterstroke. It cleverly combines customer incentives with strategic investment in a frontier technology. This initiative provides tangible value, encourages adoption, and positions the PYUSD stablecoin as a serious instrument in the modern financial toolkit. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance will involve digital assets working behind the scenes to build the technologies of tomorrow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the PYUSD stablecoin? The PYUSD stablecoin is a digital currency issued by PayPal. It is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable compared to traditional fiat currency. How does financing AI with a stablecoin work? PayPal is using its PYUSD to provide on-chain funding to the USD.AI project. This means the capital is transferred and managed using blockchain technology, which is then used by USD.AI to purchase, develop, or lease AI hardware and software infrastructure. Who can participate in the 4.5% incentive program? While full details are pending, the program is likely aimed at customers who hold PYUSD in compatible wallets or through participating platforms. Specific eligibility criteria will be announced by PayPal and the USD.AI Foundation. Is my deposit in the incentive program safe? All investments carry risk. While PYUSD is pegged to the dollar and PayPal is a established company, the specific terms, conditions, and counterparty risks associated with the USD.AI funding program should be reviewed carefully before participating. What does this mean for the future of PayPal and crypto? This move strongly indicates PayPal’s commitment to integrating cryptocurrency into its core business services beyond just buying and selling. It positions PayPal as a facilitator of capital flows using blockchain technology. Could this model be used for other industries? Absolutely. If successful, using stablecoins for targeted infrastructure financing could become a model for other sectors like renewable energy, telecommunications, or scientific research.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has issued a stark warning that the growing AI bubble represents the most significant danger to Bitcoin’s price stability in 2026. This surprising revelation comes despite Bitcoin’s strengthening fundamentals and increasing institutional adoption. Why Does the AI Bubble Threaten Bitcoin? Paolo Ardoino explains that Bitcoin remains highly correlated with traditional capital markets. When stock markets experience bubbles, Bitcoin tends to follow similar patterns. The current AI investment frenzy, according to Ardoino, is creating precisely this type of market distortion that could negatively impact cryptocurrency prices. However, there’s an important distinction to understand. The risk isn’t that AI technology itself harms Bitcoin. Instead, the problem lies in how excessive speculation around AI companies might create a stock market bubble. Since Bitcoin still moves somewhat in sync with major market indices, any significant correction in tech stocks could drag Bitcoin down with it. What Makes 2026 Particularly Vulnerable? Ardoino specifically points to 2026 as a critical period for several reasons. First, AI investments are accelerating at an unprecedented pace. Second, market cycles suggest we might be approaching a peak in the current expansion. Third, Bitcoin’s increasing institutional ownership means it’s more connected to traditional finance than ever before. Consider these key factors that create vulnerability: Market correlation : Bitcoin’s price movements still reflect broader market sentiment Speculative excess : AI companies are attracting massive valuations based on future potential Capital flow : Money moving into AI stocks might come from other assets including cryptocurrencies Risk appetite : When investors become risk-averse, they often sell both stocks and crypto Is There Any Good News for Bitcoin Investors? Absolutely. Ardoino emphasizes that beyond the AI bubble risk, he sees no other major threats to Bitcoin’s price in 2026. In fact, he presents several compelling reasons for optimism. The increasing purchases from pension funds and governments provide substantial support for Bitcoin’s long-term value. These institutional buyers typically have longer investment horizons and deeper pockets than retail investors. Ardoino also believes that massive crashes similar to those seen in 2022 or early 2018 are unlikely to repeat. The market has matured significantly, with better infrastructure, more regulated products, and greater understanding of Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. This doesn’t mean volatility will disappear, but extreme downturns may become less severe. How Does Real-World Asset Tokenization Fit In? Interestingly, Ardoino expresses strong optimism about tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). He predicts security tokens and commodities will experience enormous growth. This development could actually benefit Bitcoin by: Increasing overall blockchain adoption and legitimacy Creating more sophisticated financial infrastructure Attracting additional institutional capital to the space Demonstrating practical blockchain applications beyond speculation The growth of RWA tokenization might help decouple Bitcoin from pure speculative movements. As blockchain technology proves its utility in traditional finance, Bitcoin could benefit from increased credibility and reduced correlation with tech stock bubbles. What Should Investors Watch For? Smart investors should monitor several indicators to gauge the AI bubble Bitcoin risk. Watch for excessive valuations in AI companies without corresponding revenue growth. Pay attention to Federal Reserve policies and interest rates, as these affect both tech stocks and cryptocurrency prices. Track Bitcoin’s correlation with major indices like the NASDAQ. Most importantly, maintain a diversified portfolio that can withstand market corrections. Remember that Ardoino’s warning is about a specific, identifiable risk rather than a prediction of certain doom. The AI bubble represents one potential challenge among many factors that will influence Bitcoin’s price in 2026. Other positive developments might outweigh this particular concern. Conclusion: Balanced Perspective on Bitcoin’s Future The Tether CEO’s warning about the AI bubble Bitcoin risk provides valuable insight for cryptocurrency investors. While we must acknowledge the real danger of market correlations, we should also recognize Bitcoin’s strengthening fundamentals. The increasing institutional adoption, growing real-world asset tokenization, and maturing market structure all contribute to Bitcoin’s resilience. Successful investing requires understanding both risks and opportunities. The potential AI bubble represents a significant risk factor for 2026, but it’s not the only story. Bitcoin continues to evolve as an asset class, developing stronger foundations even as it faces new challenges from traditional market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is an AI bubble? An AI bubble refers to a situation where artificial intelligence companies become overvalued due to excessive speculation and hype rather than fundamental business performance. This creates market distortions that can eventually correct sharply. Why would an AI bubble affect Bitcoin? Bitcoin remains correlated with traditional stock markets, particularly technology stocks. If AI companies experience a bubble and subsequent crash, the negative market sentiment and capital outflows could impact Bitcoin prices as well. Does this mean I should sell my Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Ardoino’s warning is about a specific risk factor, not a prediction of Bitcoin’s failure. Many investors maintain positions through market cycles, and Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience over its history. What other risks does Bitcoin face in 2026? Beyond the AI bubble, potential risks include regulatory changes, technological challenges, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and broader economic factors like recession or inflation. How can I protect my investments from this risk? Consider diversification across asset classes, maintain a long-term perspective, avoid over-leveraging, and stay informed about market developments. Dollar-cost averaging can also help mitigate timing risks. What positive factors support Bitcoin’s price? Increasing institutional adoption, the Bitcoin halving cycle, growing recognition as digital gold, limited supply, and technological improvements all provide fundamental support for Bitcoin’s value proposition.

Onchain analysts report that a wallet suspected to belong to the mining giant Bitmain received a staggering 30,075 ETH, worth approximately $88.31 million, from the institutional crypto exchange FalconX. This single move spotlights the continued, quiet accumulation of digital assets by major industry players. But what does this specific Bitmain wallet activity tell us about the broader market? Let’s dive into the details and decode the potential implications. What Exactly Happened with the Suspected Bitmain Wallet? According to data from Onchain-Lense, a previously unidentified wallet address executed a colossal transfer. The source was FalconX, a prime brokerage known for serving large institutions. The destination? A wallet that blockchain sleuths have linked to Bitmain, the world’s dominant manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware. This transaction represents one of the largest single movements of Ethereum linked directly to a major mining entity in recent memory. The sheer size of the transfer—over $88 million—immediately raises questions. It is not a routine operational move. Therefore, analysts are scrutinizing the intent behind this capital allocation. Is this a strategic treasury diversification, a prelude to further ecosystem investment, or simply a secure storage play? The Bitmain wallet activity provides a clear, on-chain signal of significant capital movement. Why Does This Bitmain Transaction Matter for Ethereum? When a titan of the Bitcoin mining industry makes a nine-figure bet on Ethereum, the market pays attention. This move is significant for several key reasons: Institutional Validation: Actions speak louder than words. A major player allocating capital to ETH reinforces its status as a core institutional asset. Market Sentiment: Large accumulations by informed insiders can signal long-term confidence in the asset’s value proposition. Ecosystem Interdependence: It highlights how industry leaders in one crypto segment (mining) are actively participating in others (smart contracts/DeFi). This isn’t just about price. It’s about the evolving narrative of Ethereum as a foundational layer for the digital economy. A transaction of this magnitude from a Bitmain wallet adds substantial weight to that narrative. What Are the Potential Implications of This Move? Beyond the headline number, this acquisition opens up several fascinating avenues for speculation and analysis. The choice to use FalconX, an OTC desk, suggests a desire for minimal market impact and discretion—a hallmark of sophisticated institutional behavior. Could this be part of a broader strategy for Bitmain? The company has historically been anchored in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its ASIC manufacturing. A major foray into Ethereum could indicate: A strategic hedge against Bitcoin’s market cycles. An interest in participating in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, possibly through staking. An allocation to fund development or investments within the Ethereum ecosystem. Tracking the future activity of this specific Bitmain wallet will be crucial. Will the ETH remain dormant, or will it be deployed into staking protocols, DeFi, or further exchanges? The next moves will provide even clearer signals. Key Takeaways from the $88M Bitmain Wallet Acquisition This event is a powerful reminder of the transparency and intrigue of blockchain technology. While the parties involved may seek privacy, their financial movements are permanently recorded and publicly accessible for analysis. The core lesson is that whale watching remains a vital part of crypto market analysis. The activity of major wallets, like this suspected Bitmain wallet , often precedes or confirms broader market trends. For investors, it underscores the importance of paying attention to on-chain data and the strategic moves of industry incumbents. In conclusion, the movement of 30,075 ETH to a wallet tied to Bitmain is more than a large transaction. It is a data point signaling institutional confidence, strategic portfolio diversification, and the deepening interconnection within the cryptocurrency industry. As these giants move, they create waves that shape the market’s current and future landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. How do we know the wallet belongs to Bitmain? Blockchain analysis firms like Onchain-Lense use clustering techniques. They track transaction patterns, interactions with known exchange addresses (like FalconX), and link funds to previously identified wallets associated with Bitmain’s operations. It’s often based on probabilistic attribution, not absolute proof. 2. Why would Bitmain buy so much Ethereum? Potential reasons include diversifying its corporate treasury beyond Bitcoin, earning yield through Ethereum staking, funding projects in the ecosystem, or simply making a long-term strategic investment in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. 3. Does this affect the price of Ethereum? A large OTC purchase like this typically has minimal immediate market impact because the coins are transferred off-exchange. However, it reduces available supply on exchanges, which can be a bullish signal for long-term price stability and sentiment. 4. What is FalconX’s role in this? FalconX is an institutional-grade cryptocurrency prime brokerage. They facilitate large trades for clients like hedge funds, miners, and corporations, offering services like OTC trading with minimal slippage and market disruption. 5. Should I follow what large wallets like this do? While informative, whale activity should be just one factor in your research. Their goals and risk profiles differ greatly from individual investors. Use it as a signal for broader trends, not as direct investment advice. 6. Where can I track such large transactions? You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, Arkham Intelligence, or Glassnode. These tools visualize large transfers, wallet balances, and network activity.

This has pushed the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) all-time haul to over $6 billion. DPRK hack volumes from 2016-2025. Source: Chainanalysis According to the Chainalysis report, hackers stole $681 million more in 2024, representing a 51% year-over-year increase. This brought the total identified haul from crypto theft since 2016 to $6.75 billion. North Korea hackers shift their strategy to fewer but larger attacks The report revealed that the hackers have changed their strategy to fewer but dramatically larger attacks, underpinned by March’s $1.4 billion hack of Bybit. They have achieved these results by embedding IT workers inside crypto services to gain privileged access and enable high‑impact compromises. North Korean groups mainly target large, centralized crypto services, aiming for maximum impact rather than frequency. DPRK-linked actors were responsible for 76% of all service-level compromises in 2025, the most ever recorded. DPRK actors have demonstrated consistency in working with smaller tranches below $500,000, rather than distributing stolen funds in large on-chain transfers in the $1M to $10M+ range, unlike other hackers. This is a sign of increasingly sophisticated operational security. Analysis of post-hack activity reveals a consistent pattern in how these events are associated with the movement of stolen funds throughout the crypto ecosystem. Following major theft events between 2022 and 2025, stolen funds follow a structured, multi-wave laundering pathway that unfolds over approximately 45 days. This is a widow that the law enforcers can use to intercept. Additionally, DPRK-linked wallets rely heavily on Chinese-language guarantee services, brokers, and over-the-counter networks, and extensive use of bridges and mixing services. They largely avoid the DeFi lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and peer-to-peer platforms favored by other criminals. This year, North Korea has used AI in its hacking efforts. They integrate large language models into nearly every stage of their attacks: reconnaissance, phishing, code analysis, and laundering the proceeds. Personal wallet comprises a decline of over 50% Overall, the cryptocurrency industry experienced over $3.4 billion in theft from January to early December 2025. Total theft incidents surged to 158,000 in 2025, nearly triple the 54,000 recorded in 2022. The number of new and unique victims increased from 40,000 in 2022 to at least 80,000 in 2025. This rise is likely due to greater crypto adoption. For instance, Solana, one of the blockchains with the greatest number of active personal wallets, was at the lead with 26,500 victims. When measuring crime rates per 100K wallets in 2025, Ethereum and Tron show the highest rates of theft. Ethereum’s large size is reflected in both high rates of theft and a high victim count. On the other hand, although it has a smaller active wallet base, Tron’s position shows an elevated rate of theft. Personal wallet theft volumes. Source: Chainalysis Personal wallet compromises surged from just 7.3% of total stolen value in 2022 to 44% in 2024. In 2025, they now account for 20% of all value stolen. The total amount stolen from individual victims declined from 2024’s peak of $1.5 billion to $713 million in 2025. However, the share would have been 37% if it weren’t for the outsized impact of the Bybit attack. Centralized services have experienced large losses due to private key compromises. These platforms remain vulnerable because of this security challenge. While such compromises are rare, their scale still drives a significant share of stolen volumes when they do occur. For instance, they accounted for 88% of losses in Q1 2025. For the first time, the ratio between the largest hack and the middle of all cases has exceeded 1,000 times. The amount of money stolen in the biggest attacks is now 1,000 times more than in the average case. It’s even more than the bull market peak in 2021. The top three hacks in 2025 account for 69% of all service losses.

According to live market data, the flagship cryptocurrency has surged above $89,000, trading at $89,005.78 on the Binance USDT market. This significant Bitcoin price surge marks a pivotal moment, capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive climb, and is the rally sustainable? What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent upward movement isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several converging factors are creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s valuation. First, institutional adoption continues to gain steam, with major financial firms increasing their crypto exposure. Second, macroeconomic conditions, including inflation concerns, are pushing investors toward perceived stores of value like Bitcoin. Moreover, positive regulatory developments in key markets are reducing uncertainty and building investor confidence. This combination of factors creates a powerful tailwind. However, it’s crucial to understand that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While the Bitcoin price surge is exciting, it’s essential to look at the broader context. Breaking Down the $89,000 Milestone Crossing the $89,000 threshold is more than just a number. It represents a critical test of market sentiment and technical resistance levels. Analysts often watch these round-number levels closely, as they can act as both support and resistance. The fact that Bitcoin has pushed through this level with apparent strength suggests underlying buying pressure. Let’s examine the immediate implications of this move: Market Confidence: A sustained break above $89,000 signals strong buyer conviction. Technical Outlook: It opens the path for a test of the next major resistance levels, potentially eyeing the $90,000 and even $95,000 zones. Altcoin Effect: A strong Bitcoin often lifts the entire crypto market, but it can also draw capital away from smaller altcoins in the short term. Is This a Sustainable Rally or a Short-Term Spike? This is the million-dollar question every investor is asking. While the current Bitcoin price surge is impressive, sustainability depends on several key elements. Continued institutional inflows are vital for maintaining momentum. Additionally, network fundamentals like hash rate and active addresses remain strong, providing a solid foundation. However, challenges persist. Regulatory headlines can still cause sudden volatility. Furthermore, profit-taking by early investors after such a rapid climb could create temporary pullbacks. Therefore, a measured approach is wise. The market is demonstrating remarkable resilience, but prudent investors always prepare for multiple scenarios. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating a powerful Bitcoin price surge requires a clear strategy. First, avoid making decisions based solely on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Conduct your own research and understand your risk tolerance. Consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate timing risk. Always ensure you use secure wallets and reputable exchanges for any transactions. Most importantly, view Bitcoin as a long-term technological bet, not just a speculative trade. Its value proposition extends far beyond daily price fluctuations. By focusing on the underlying technology and adoption trends, you can make more informed decisions regardless of short-term market noise. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s ascent above $89,000 is a landmark event that reinforces its position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. This Bitcoin price surge reflects growing mainstream acceptance and a shifting financial paradigm. While volatility will always be part of the journey, the long-term trajectory for cryptocurrency continues to point upward. Staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on fundamentals are the keys to navigating this exciting and dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused Bitcoin to rise above $89,000? The rise is attributed to a combination of increased institutional investment, positive macroeconomic sentiment as a hedge against inflation, and encouraging regulatory developments in several countries. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment timing is highly personal. While the trend is positive, Bitcoin remains volatile. Many advisors recommend a strategy like dollar-cost averaging rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Could the price drop back down quickly? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Sharp rallies can be followed by corrections. Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations and only invest what they can afford to lose. What is the next major price target for Bitcoin? Analysts are now watching the $90,000 and $95,000 levels as the next key resistance zones. A sustained break above $89,000 is technically bullish for these higher targets. How does Bitcoin’s rise affect other cryptocurrencies? A strong Bitcoin often has a “rising tide lifts all boats” effect on the broader crypto market. However, capital can sometimes rotate from altcoins into Bitcoin during major rallies. Where can I safely track the Bitcoin price? Use reputable tracking websites and established exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for real-time data. Always double-check URLs to avoid phishing sites.

Solana has declined by about 3.2% in a single day, which is below overall market performance, as it declined by about 2.7%. The overall risk tolerance has been reduced as market participants re-evaluate investment levels in speculative assets despite ongoing improvements within the network fundamentals. Simultaneously, capital has flowed into nascent projects, again sparking interest in the top cryptocurrency most suited for individuals not focused on price actions. Solana Network Catalysts Remain Resilient Amidst Market Pressures Solana has been facing sudden bear pressures while sustaining its leadership position in the crypto networks and growing in institutional adoption. The price movements in the market have been sensitive to broader macro uncertainties and not indicative of project-based weaknesses. Volumes have been growing significantly in the market, with recent spikes hitting almost 40% levels, indicative of repositioning and not capitulation by investors. Network level catalysts are intact. Solana’s recent upgrade, Alpenglow, has been cementing the expectations for the improvement in performance and security on the network. Also, institutional experimentation has been continuing, and the notable development here has been institutional interest on the Solana network, which has cemented its position in the space of tokenization applications. Extra investment opportunities via the CME-linked product offerings have further established the importance of Solana in the regulated financial systems. However, the ETF collapse and leverage unwinding have been dampening the short-term prospects. Mutuum Finance Presale Progress Exudes Long-Term Interest A new player has emerged in the limelight as a long-term option, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , as it approaches a critical level in its presale stage. One can clearly see that the presale has taken a sequentially structured approach, and Phase 6 has already reached 98% capacity, limiting participation at the current level of $0.035. But this has also increased momentum before Phase 7, whereby there shall be a tremendous price rise of 20% to $0.04. Thus, it is entirely redefining the mindset of options for cryptocurrencies, particularly focusing on price growth potential. In a side note, the project has raised a total of $19,500,000 since the presale began, while the total of MUTM token holders since the presale began is 18,520. The current price represents a 250% jump over the entrance price in Phase One for a mere $0.01. Phase 6 has been selling out quickly, and the time to purchase tokens for $0.035 is running short as the start of Phase 7 draws nigh. Launch price has been established at $0.06, placing the current buyers on track for a 380% increase after launch. A Stablecoin Framework Anchors Utility Outlook Mutuum Finance, also known as MUTM, is set to base its long-term strategy on a stablecoin structure. Current development stages suggest that the V1 protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in 2025. Some of the basic elements set to be included within this development include liquidity pools, mtToken, debt tokens, and automated liquidation. ETH and USDT will be the primary assets on which borrowing and lending will be set. This framework is stability-focused and promotes predictable participation in the system. The borrow features will maintain overcollateralization to minimize exposure to volatility while promoting stable usage. For the long-term investor researching a top cryptocurrency buy today to invest in long-term plans, the stability-focused approach of this framework is a refreshing feature in a volatile marketplace. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through its dual lending model, which offers both pooled lending and direct lending options. Peer-to-Contract markets will allow for earnings through shared liquidity pools, while Peer-to-Peer Markets will enable customized lending for assets that require customized terms. Such will enable more individuals to participate regardless of their risk profiles without affecting the security of the protocol. Solana’s sharp price drop highlights that, in the short term, strong fundamentals can be clouded by macro considerations. However, investment is pouring into a well-structured presale with clearly defined pricing and terms, including early market advantage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained favor with investors rethinking which crypto to buy today for enduring ownership as Phase 6 nears completion and pricing uncertainty looms.

According to a report by Walter Bloomberg, the current ECB rate-cutting cycle is almost over. This pivotal moment signals a potential change in direction for the Eurozone’s monetary policy after a period of aggressive easing designed to stimulate the economy. For investors and everyday citizens alike, understanding this transition is key to navigating the financial landscape ahead. What Does the End of the ECB Rate-Cutting Cycle Mean? The statement from ECB officials suggests they believe their primary tool for boosting the economy—lowering interest rates—has nearly run its course. Think of interest rates as the price of borrowing money. When the ECB cuts rates, it becomes cheaper for businesses to get loans for expansion and for consumers to finance big purchases like homes or cars. The goal is to encourage spending and investment. However, announcing the end of this ECB rate-cutting cycle implies policymakers see the economy as stable enough to stand on its own, or they are concerned about the long-term side effects of ultra-low rates, such as inflated asset prices. Why is the ECB Making This Move Now? Central banks like the ECB walk a tightrope. Their decisions balance stimulating growth against controlling inflation. Several factors likely contributed to this decision: Economic Recovery Signs: The Eurozone may be showing enough resilience post-pandemic and energy crisis to warrant a pause in aggressive support. Inflation Concerns: While recent inflation has cooled, the ECB must remain vigilant to prevent it from flaring up again. Ending the cutting cycle is a pre-emptive move. Policy Normalization: After years of extraordinary measures, there is a desire to return monetary policy to a more conventional setting, providing room to maneuver in a future crisis. Therefore, this is not necessarily a sign of immediate rate hikes, but a declaration that the era of consistent, successive cuts is concluding. What Are the Immediate Implications for You? This policy shift will ripple through the economy. For savers, the end of the ECB rate-cutting cycle could mean bank deposit rates may finally stop falling and potentially rise slightly in the future. Conversely, borrowers should prepare for a new environment. Mortgages & Loans: New loans and variable-rate mortgages may not get cheaper and could become more expensive over time. Business Investment: Companies may reassess large investment plans as the cost of capital stabilizes. Currency & Markets: The Euro could strengthen as the policy divergence with other central banks narrows, affecting international trade and investments. Looking Ahead: The ECB’s Next Challenge With the cutting cycle ending, the focus turns to what comes next. The ECB’s communication will become crucial . Officials must manage market expectations to avoid unnecessary volatility. The primary challenge will be sustaining economic growth without the crutch of ever-lower rates. This means other factors, like government fiscal policy and private sector confidence, will need to play a larger role in driving the Eurozone economy forward. The conclusion of this ECB rate-cutting cycle marks the beginning of a more delicate phase of economic stewardship. Conclusion: A Turning Point for European Monetary Policy The signal that the ECB rate-cutting cycle is almost over is a definitive turning point. It reflects cautious optimism about economic stability and a strategic shift towards long-term policy sustainability. While not an immediate tightening, it closes a chapter of intense monetary stimulus. For everyone from policymakers to homeowners, the message is clear: prepare for a new, more stable, and potentially less accommodative financial environment in the Eurozone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this mean interest rates will start rising immediately? A: Not necessarily. The ECB is signaling the end of cutting rates. A pause is likely before any discussion of raising rates begins. The next phase is one of stability and observation. Q2: How will this affect my existing fixed-rate mortgage? A: If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your payments will remain unchanged for the duration of your fixed term. This news primarily impacts new loans and variable-rate products. Q3: Why would the ECB stop cutting rates if the economy still needs help? A: Central banks must look ahead. They may believe further cuts have diminishing returns or could create future risks like asset bubbles. Sometimes, pausing allows previous cuts to fully work through the economy. Q4: What should savers do now? A> Savers should not expect dramatic changes overnight. However, it may be wise to shop around for the best available deposit rates and consider that the downward pressure on savings returns is easing. Q5: How does this impact the value of the Euro (EUR)? A: Typically, ending an easing cycle can strengthen a currency, as it suggests less monetary stimulus flowing into the system. A stronger Euro can make imports cheaper but exports more expensive. Q6: Where can I follow official ECB announcements? A> The best source is the European Central Bank’s official website , which publishes press releases, speeches, and monetary policy meeting accounts.

55991608,646537,1766073617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55991608.jpeg,Top Expert Predicts When XRP Will Flip Ethereum,https://bitcoinist.com/when-xrp-will-flip-ethereum/,"A bold claim circulating within the crypto community opens up questions about the long-term positioning of XRP relative to Ethereum. The discussion was due to a post on the social media platform X from YoungHoon Kim, who publicly stated that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market capitalization by 2026. The prediction was presented as a personal opinion rather than financial advice, but it quickly gained traction due to Kim’s growing visibility in crypto discussions and his recent shift in tone to XRP. The timing of the statement, combined with a series of increasingly bullish remarks about the token, brings attention to whether such a scenario could realistically unfold. XRP Flipping Ethereum By 2026: The Core Prediction At the base of the conversation is Kim’s assertion that XRP could overtake Ethereum’s market cap within the next year. In his post, he directly compared the two assets, stating that XRP could surpass ETH by 2026. According to MarketCapOf, in order for XRP to flip the current market cap of Ethereum, it would require not only a substantial price increase but also a push to new all-time highs at $5.64. This would require a sustained change in capital allocation across the broader market. XRP With The Market Cap Of ETH. Source: MarketCapOf The possibility of XRP’s expanding institutional usage is a factor that could compress the valuation gap to Ethereum over time. Although the claim is speculative, the 2026 timeframe gives investors a clear timeframe through which XRP can meaningfully challenge Ethereum’s altcoin dominance. From Bitcoin Advocacy To Direct XRP Accumulation Kim, who claims to possess the world’s highest recorded IQ of 276, has frequently highlighted this distinction in his public profile. This is a detail that has added to the attention surrounding his recent statements on XRP. Furthermore, his recent comments have been a change from weeks of near-exclusive Bitcoin commentary to a pivot into XRP. In a previous post on December 12, Young Hoon Kim noted that he is only buying XRP from now on. Shortly before that, he also suggested that XRP has a strong chance of reaching a new all-time high before the end of the year. In a separate post, he stated that XRP could reach $100 within the next five years. Although this statement is secondary to the Ethereum comparison, it adds important context to Kim’s broader thesis. A $100 XRP would likely require deep institutional adoption and XRP playing a central role in large-scale financial infrastructure. Some critics view price prediction and the claim of XRP’s market cap overtaking that of Ethereum in 2026 as too optimistic, even some of the most popular XRP analysts. One of the replies came from an X user known as BD, who claims to be the world’s most bullish XRP holder. He warned Kim to be careful of what he is saying. “If you are wrong, you will be the guy with the lowest IQ,” he said.",XRP|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-18 16:00:17

BNB Loses Trendline But Flashes Strong Rebound Signals,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-breakdown-or-bear-trap/,"BNB has slipped below its long-standing bullish trendline, raising fresh concerns about a deeper pullback. However, the selloff is unfolding right into a key support zone, where multiple technical signals hint that buyers may be preparing for a counter-move. With breakdown risk clashing against early rebound signs, BNB now sits at a pivotal moment that could define the next major move. Bullish Trendline Break Signals A Change In BNB Market Character According to crypto analyst Marcus Corvinus, BNB has just experienced a significant structural shift by losing its long-held bullish trendline. This technical break is a critical development that is rapidly changing the market mood from optimism to caution, as a primary support trendline has been invalidated. Related Reading: BNB Rebound Underway? Price Caught Within A Head And Shoulders Pattern The analyst noted that while the price had been respecting this upward trend for a considerable period, this decisive break indicates that buyers are finally losing control. Momentum is visibly cooling off, providing sellers with the necessary opening to press and take command of the short-term price action. Corvinus warned that if the price fails to reclaim the broken trendline, the path will likely open for a much deeper move to the downside. He emphasized that this current behavior appears to be a fundamental shift in market structure rather than just a typical small pullback, suggesting a more prolonged period of weakness. Thus, the market has now entered a caution zone, with the analyst noting that bears are knocking on the door of lower support levels. The next major reaction from the market will be the deciding factor in whether BNB can recover its uptrend or embark on a new, sustained bearish trajectory. Confluence Emerges At Key Support Zone In a recent update shared on X, analyst Batman revealed that BNB is currently carving out a highly attractive long setup. The asset is exhibiting a rare alignment of multiple technical indicators, suggesting that the current price level may serve as a powerful launchpad for the next leg up.

According to a statement issued on Monday, the bipartisan bill aims to establish a federal task force that brings together the Treasury, law enforcement, financial regulators, and private sector experts to detect, monitor, and prevent cryptocurrency fraud. Under the bipartisan bill, the task force’s primary goals would be to examine current trends in digital asset scams and identify practical methods to prevent them. Additionally, the task force is tasked with raising public awareness of typical Bitcoin scams and providing local law enforcement with enhanced investigative tools. Under the bipartisan bill, the task force would be tasked with investigating patterns in a variety of cryptocurrency-related frauds, such as money laundering activities, Ponzi schemes, rug pulls, fraudulent token sales, and financial grooming scams. A cryptocurrency lawyer, Gabriel Shapiro, commented that the SAFE Crypto Act may close an enforcement loophole. Shapiro believes the bill will be helpful, citing that the SEC and CFTC are not particularly concerned about issues like phishing, cyberattacks, and small-scale Ponzi schemes. SAFE Crypto Act strengthens Federal Anti-Fraud coordination LATEST: 🇺🇸 Two US senators have introduced a bipartisan bill called the SAFE Crypto Act that would establish a federal task force to help identify, track and stop crypto fraud. pic.twitter.com/dnjlo9E7yM — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) December 18, 2025 Jerry Moran and Elissa Slotkin noted that the SAFE Crypto Act requires the task force to provide the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees, as well as the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees, with an initial update within one year of its creation. The task force must also submit follow-up reports to those panels on an annual basis. “It’s critical we protect Americans against scams in all industries, but especially cryptocurrency as it becomes more popular. This task force, established by the SAFE Crypto Act, will allow us to draw upon every resource we have to combat fraud in digital assets.” – Elissa Slotkin , U.S. Senator. Sen. Moran mentioned that the SAFE Crypto Act would help combat threats and ensure that all Americans are better protected from bitcoin scams as cryptocurrency becomes more widely used. Ari Redbord, Vice President and Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs, stated that his team has tracked billions of dollars in fraud and scams throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem over the past two years. He emphasized that real-time interruption is necessary to address the issue of crypto fraud. According to Redbord, the law enables public-private partnerships to utilize blockchain intelligence to monitor, disrupt, and dismantle illicit networks as they operate. He noted that combining business and law enforcement can significantly lessen the capacity of criminals to use transformational technologies for malicious purposes. Crypto investment scams increase, targeting senior investors The two U.S. Senators introduced the SAFE Crypto Act at a time when more Americans are falling victim to cryptocurrency-related frauds, with senior investors being especially vulnerable. On April 24, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported Americans lost over $9.3 billion in 2024 as a result of cryptocurrency investment schemes. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report revealed that the $9.3 billion loss represented a 66% increase over the previous year, which had a loss of $5.3 million. “Cryptocurrency has become an enticing means to cheat investors, launder proceeds, and engage in other illicit schemes.” – Chad Yarbrough , Operations Director for the FBI’s Criminal and Cyber Branch. The FBI said that many crypto frauds don’t rely on breaking into cryptocurrency networks. Instead, they mislead people into giving them their money by using techniques like social engineering, posing as someone else, and gradually building trust over time. The agency report emphasized that investment fraud, such as pig slaughtering, is the biggest category of cryptocurrency fraud. Chainalysis’ 2025 Crypto Crime Report revealed that illicit cryptocurrency volume hit $51.3 billion in 2024 as on-chain criminal activity became more varied, confirming the expanding relevance of bitcoin in criminal operations. The report said the centralized services were the “most targeted” in the second and third quarters of last year. Chainalysis also noted that DeFi services accounted for the majority of the stolen funds.

55991804,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92678,1766073915,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What Effectively Makes XRP a Digital Gold,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-effectively-makes-xrp-a-digital-gold/,"In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory clarity and functional utility often determine which assets rise beyond speculation to play a meaningful role in global finance. While many tokens are driven primarily by price narratives, some digital assets distinguish themselves through consistent application, liquidity, and cross-border functionality. XRP is increasingly being recognized as one such asset, whose structure and regulatory positioning give it a role akin to a modern “digital gold.” This perspective was recently highlighted by Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, who emphasized XRP’s unique status following its clearance from securities designation. According to Aljarrah, XRP now falls under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)’s digital commodity framework, which emphasizes value derived from practical use, liquidity, and settlement rather than pure speculation. After XRP was cleared of security status, it fell under the CFTC’s digital commodity framework, where value is driven by utility, liquidity, and settlement. This effectively makes XRP a digital gold, serving as a neutral bridge for moving value between financial systems. pic.twitter.com/FbLJW1iewZ — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 18, 2025 Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Confidence XRP’s shift from securities to digital commodity status marks a fundamental transformation in its legal and functional identity. Under the CFTC’s framework, assets are evaluated based on their utility and transactional capabilities rather than their speculative appeal. This distinction is critical: regulatory certainty reduces barriers to institutional adoption, increases market credibility, and encourages participation from financial entities that might otherwise avoid assets with ambiguous legal status. By establishing XRP as a recognized digital commodity, the CFTC effectively provides a foundation for consistent use in cross-border settlements, bridging traditional finance with the blockchain ecosystem. This clarity strengthens XRP’s case as a long-term utility asset rather than a purely speculative instrument. Utility as a Core Value Driver XRP’s primary strength lies in its practical utility . Designed for rapid, low-cost settlements, XRP facilitates transactions between financial institutions, cross-border payment corridors, and decentralized networks. Its role as a neutral bridge asset allows value to move efficiently between different financial systems, reducing friction, settlement delays, and counterparty risk. Versan Aljarrah draws a compelling analogy between XRP and gold, highlighting that its “digital gold” status comes from consistent utility rather than scarcity. Much like gold historically served as a trusted medium of exchange, XRP provides a reliable, universally accepted mechanism for moving value in the digital economy.

With significant market depth across major exchanges, XRP can be transacted in substantial volumes with minimal price impact. Coupled with near-instant settlement times, this liquidity enables efficient movement of capital and strengthens its role as a dependable bridge asset between financial systems. The combination of liquidity and speed ensures that XRP can operate at an institutional scale, supporting global financial infrastructure without the limitations of slower or less liquid alternatives. XRP’s Role in the Broader Digital Commodity Landscape By merging regulatory clarity, practical utility, liquidity, and settlement efficiency, XRP transcends the typical cryptocurrency model. It functions not just as a tradable token but as a foundational instrument capable of facilitating global financial operations. This aligns with the vision Versan Aljarrah highlights: XRP’s value lies in measurable and repeatable financial functions, offering stability and interoperability comparable to gold in traditional finance. In conclusion, XRP’s position under the CFTC’s digital commodity framework, combined with its utility, liquidity, and settlement efficiency, effectively elevates it to the status of “digital gold.” This unique positioning underscores its potential to serve as a neutral, reliable medium for transferring value across global financial systems.

The findings show that 45% of younger investors already own crypto , compared to just 18% of older generations , and that three-quarters believe their generation faces harder odds of building wealth through conventional means than previous cohorts did. The State of Crypto Q4 2025 report , compiled from a survey of 4,350 US adults, including 2,005 active investors, found younger generations allocating 25% of their portfolios to non-traditional assets, triple the 8% allocation among older investors. Beyond the allocation gap, younger investors demonstrate markedly different attitudes toward digital assets, with four in five viewing crypto as creating financial opportunities that wouldn’t otherwise exist for their generation. Source: Coinbase A Generation Betting Against the Old Playbook Despite reporting greater optimism about broader economic conditions, younger investors don’t believe traditional wealth-building mechanisms work in their favor. The cohort has watched housing affordability deteriorate while student debt mounted and wage growth lagged, driving 73% to conclude that their generation faces steeper wealth-building challenges than 57% of older adults. This perception translates directly into portfolio decisions. While stock ownership rates remain similar across age groups, younger investors add substantially more alternative exposure, actively seeking reward mechanisms beyond conventional stock dividends. The strategy reflects deliberate pursuit of tools and markets that might help close generational wealth gaps rather than passive investment approaches. The crypto allocation isn’t treated as speculative positioning but as a central strategy. Nearly half of younger investors (47%) want access to new crypto assets before general market availability, compared with just 16% of older investors. Four in five younger adults believe cryptocurrency will play a significantly larger role in future financial systems, dropping to three in five among older investors. Risk Appetite Extends Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum The willingness to embrace emerging opportunities doesn’t stop at spot crypto holdings. Four in five younger investors say they’re willing to try new investment opportunities before others, compared with under half of older adults. Interest spans crypto derivatives, prediction markets, round-the-clock stock trading, early-stage token sales, altcoins, and decentralized finance lending products. This pattern marks a clear departure from recent data showing cooling crypto enthusiasm across broader investor populations. A December FINRA Foundation study found crypto consideration among US investors dropped from 33% to 26% between 2021 and 2024, while those viewing digital assets as extremely or very risky rose from 58% to 66%. Source: FINRA Yet that pullback appears concentrated among older demographics rather than the younger cohort driving current adoption. The generational divide extends to trading behavior and information sourcing. Younger investors trade more frequently, take more calculated risks to chase higher returns, and push platforms toward always-on operations that support a wider asset range. US crypto purchase interest falls to 26% from 33% in 2021 as investor risk appetite declines sharply, FINRA study shows. #US #Crypto https://t.co/4mTMJ49hLC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 5, 2025 Notably, social media “ finfluencers ” now guide investment decisions for 61% of investors under 35, with YouTube serving as the dominant platform, and word-of-mouth from friends and family surpassing financial professional recommendations. The Infrastructure for a New Investment Generation The shift toward non-traditional assets among younger investors aligns with separate findings showing institutional adoption bolstering confidence. A November Zerohash survey found that 35% of wealthy young Americans had already moved money away from advisers who did not offer crypto exposure, with more than four-fifths reporting increased confidence as major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley embraced digital assets. Portfolio concentration in volatile assets raises legitimate concerns about long-term financial stability. However, the trend appears durable rather than speculative, with median allocations to non-traditional assets reaching meaningful levels, and younger investors consistently describing crypto as essential to wealth-building strategy rather than an opportunistic position.

This could be the most descriptive phrase for the current state of affairs of the crypto news realm. We can open any aggregator and see the same headline repeated fifty times, slightly reworded, screaming for your attention. We think we have information, but we only have noise. The digital asset industry has produced an “Illusion of abundance,” a “perfect” soup filled to the brim with infinite takes of finite insight, leaving market participants only feeling informed but effectively being functionally blind. This is finally coming across as the structural inevitability of a broken media model that prioritizes the speed of transmission over the validity of the signal. The Incentive Structure The crisis of credibility in our ecosystem is not merely a failure of journalistic ethics; it is the predictable outcome of a systemic arbitrage of information velocity over veracity. This dynamic is reinforced by market cycles and audience behavior, particularly during speculative phases where speed and signal-chasing dominate the collective attention. However, these behaviors are not the cause of the problem—they are the conditions under which weak incentive structures are exposed. When media economics rewards immediacy over insight, even well-intentioned actors are pushed toward velocity-first output. This creates an environment where outlets are structurally rewarded for maximizing short-term volume. It is the “aggregation crisis” in action: a single press release issued at 9:00 AM spawns dozens of identical articles by noon, each adding zero original analysis. We are witnessing a reality where the algorithms governing our attention spans prioritize speed and superficial outrage. In this atmosphere, journalism drifts into punditry, making way for influencer-driven narratives and opinion masquerading as analysis because they are cheap to produce and easy to sell. This narrative arbitrage creates a dangerous feedback loop; as engagement metrics dictate editorial strategy, complexity is suppressed. The result is a “velocity trap” where the only information that survives is surface-level noise. Structural risk diagnosis—the kind that requires long-form explanation and specialized data synthesis—simply does not fit into a 280-character hook or a 200-word clickbait summary. By favoring the speed of transmission over the validity of the signal, the industry is left functionally blind, incapable of the self-diagnosis required to anticipate the next crisis. This narrative arbitrage creates a dangerous feedback loop. As engagement metrics dictate editorial strategy, complexity is suppressed. Structural risk diagnosis demands long-form explanation and specialized data synthesis – things that do not fit into a 280-character hook or a 200-word clickbait summary. Consequently, the only information that survives is surface-level noise, leaving the industry incapable of self-diagnosis. The Capital Cycle We must also confront the uncomfortable truth about how money shapes the narratives. The information layer becomes more vulnerable due to its dependence on volatile market liquidity. Media funding mirrors market liquidity, and this is indicative of an important condition of the current media reality : bear markets kill investigative budgets . During bull runs, the pressure to capture hype often displaces rigor in favor of quick revenue. When the cycle turns and market stress emerges, this is precisely when diagnostic analysis is needed most. Budgets are slashed, and investigative capacity is extinguished. This cyclical defunding guarantees that we enter every subsequent bull cycle without improved informational infrastructure, locking in our susceptibility to future shocks. We are building a financial system on an information layer that collapses exactly when it is needed to bear weight. Systemic Stress Tests and Structural Failures The cost of this “velocity trap” is measured in billions of dollars of lost capital. The collapses of Terra , FTX , and Celsius were not unpredictable black swans; they were structural stress tests that the crypto media failed to anticipate. In virtually every instance, the responses from most media organizations were largely reactive, not preventative – failing to surface, contextualize, and interrogate risk signals before they crystallized into crises. Few outlets explained the structural risk ahead of the collapse. Instead, most amplified hype-driven crypto narratives that allowed dangerous actors to create an illusion of legitimacy. Without rigorous, public structural reports to serve as a non-statutory audit mechanism, fundamental instabilities were masked until the moment of failure. Consider the recent growth of decentralized derivatives exchanges (DEXs). Our research found that DEX futures volume grew 282% year-over-year , compared to only 41% for centralized exchanges . This is a seismic shift in market structure – DEXs are growing at seven times the rate of their centralized counterparts. Yet, generalist media failed to quantify this trend because they report what essentially are daily snapshots without any historical context. The Fragmented Reader For the reader, the investor, the builder, the policymaker, this failure manifests as a profound cognitive dissonance, . The media consumer feels informed but confused , as isolated headlines and fragmented takes lack historical grounding. Readers are bombarded with contradicting, unverified opinions that contribute to what effectively can be called “regulatory uncertainty”. Without a shared, high-fidelity informational baseline, sophistication becomes an excludable luxury good, locked behind paywalls and private commissions at traditional research firms. This imposes a state of information asymmetry on the entire market. The public is left to operate on noise, while institutions pay for long-term clarity substantiated by heavyweight crypto research methods. This gap reduces market efficiency and hinders the sustained institutional participation we all claim to want. We cannot build a mature asset class on immature information. Research as Infrastructure We need durable analytical content that is robust enough to withstand market fluctuations and provide actionable insight. This is how to implement slow thinking in a fast market . True research acts as infrastructure because it provides the “preventative diagnosis” that “breaking news” cannot. It replaces the ephemeral nature of the news cycle with data-anchored frameworks that allow for long-term decision-making. The Cryptopolitan Commitment This is why we launched Cryptopolitan Research . We are redefining our value proposition around three core pillars: Transparency, depth, and access . Model-based independence: We do not shill tokens. We do not accept payment for coverage. Our research is “data-anchored”- when we say a market is growing, we show the receipts. Time horizons: We reject the tyranny of the “breaking news” cycle. Our reports take days to produce, involving primary data collection and expert validation. We prioritize “accuracy and insight over being first”. Accountability via access: We believe high-quality risk assessment should be a universal right, not a luxury. That is why Cryptopolitan Research reports are 100% free . We are tearing down the paywalls to ensure that institution-grade intelligence reaches every participant, minimizing the “Information Asymmetry Tax”. The industry no longer lacks information; it lacks meaning. To mature, we must move from the sugar rush of narrative arbitrage to the solid ground of verified truth. We are building the infrastructure for the next decade of digital assets, and we are doing it in the open. Join us in building the signal.

Nearly half of the network’s XRPL nodes are operating on outdated software, teetering on the edge of being automatically cut off. This isn’t just a technical hiccup; it’s a pressing threat to the network’s integrity and resilience that demands immediate action from node operators. Why Are So Many XRPL Nodes Outdated? According to data from CryptoBasic, approximately 45% of XRPL nodes are still running versions of the rippled server software older than 2.6.2. The XRP Ledger operates on a consensus protocol that requires validators to agree on the state of the ledger. When the network activates new protocol rules—a process known as amendment activation—nodes running outdated software cannot understand or validate transactions under the new rules. Therefore, to protect the network’s consensus, these nodes face automatic disconnection. The primary reasons for this lag in upgrades often include operator oversight, lack of automated update processes, or simply underestimating the urgency. The Simple Fix: Upgrade to Rippled 2.6.2 The solution is straightforward but non-negotiable. Operators of the affected XRPL nodes must upgrade to rippled version 2.6.2 or higher. This version includes critical bug fixes, performance improvements, and support for the latest network amendments. Here is what node operators need to do immediately: Check Current Version: Verify the rippled software version currently running on your server. Follow Official Guides: Use the upgrade instructions provided by RippleX on their official developer portal. Test in Staging: If possible, test the upgrade on a staging server first to ensure compatibility. Schedule Maintenance: Plan for a brief downtime window to perform the update smoothly. Postponing this upgrade is a gamble with the node’s functionality and its contribution to the network. What Happens If Nodes Don’t Upgrade? The consequences of inaction are severe and automatic. Once the network enables a new amendment, any XRPL nodes running incompatible software will be severed from the peer-to-peer network. This disconnection has a ripple effect (no pun intended): Loss of Network Participation: The node can no longer propose, validate, or relay transactions. Reduced Network Health: A significant drop in updated nodes can impact the ledger’s decentralization and fault tolerance. Operational Disruption: Services relying on that node for data or transaction submission will fail. Security Risks: A less diverse node set could theoretically make the network more susceptible to coordinated attacks. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s a built-in network safeguard that will execute without warning. Actionable Insights for Node Operators and the Community This situation highlights the ongoing responsibility of running infrastructure in a decentralized ecosystem. For the network to remain robust, its individual components must be maintained. Beyond the urgent upgrade, here are key takeaways: Set Up Alerts: Subscribe to official XRPL developer channels and GitHub repositories for release notifications. Automate Updates: Where feasible, implement semi-automated processes for applying security and consensus-critical patches. Community Vigilance: The health of the XRPL nodes is a community-wide concern. Experienced operators can help guide others through the process. Proactive maintenance is far simpler than emergency recovery from a disconnection. Conclusion: A Call for Immediate Action The message is clear and urgent. The stability of the XRP Ledger depends on the diligence of its node operators. With 45% of XRPL nodes currently vulnerable, a coordinated upgrade effort is not just recommended; it is essential for the network’s security and performance. By moving swiftly to rippled 2.6.2, operators can secure their place in the network and contribute to a stronger, more resilient XRP Ledger for everyone. Let’s not wait for the disconnect—let’s upgrade. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an XRPL node? An XRPL node is a server running the rippled software that participates in the XRP Ledger network. It stores a copy of the ledger, relays transactions, and, if configured as a validator, helps achieve consensus. How do I check my rippled server version? You can typically check your version by using the server_info command via the command line or the node’s API. The response will include a “build_version” field. Is there a deadline for the upgrade to rippled 2.6.2? There is no fixed calendar date, but the risk triggers immediately upon the activation of a new network amendment. The upgrade should be treated as urgent to avoid unexpected disconnection. What if I’m not a technical operator? If you are running a node but lack technical expertise, consider seeking help from the community forums or the official RippleX developer resources. Using managed node services from reputable providers is also an option. Can a disconnected node be reconnected? Yes, absolutely. Once the node software is upgraded to a compatible version (2.6.2 or higher), it can be restarted and will automatically reconnect to the network. Does this affect XRP holders who use wallets? Not directly. This issue pertains to node operators. However, if many nodes disconnect, it could theoretically slow network performance or reduce its robustness, indirectly affecting all users.

That future is now closer than ever. In a groundbreaking move, Intuit, the powerhouse behind TurboTax and QuickBooks, has announced a partnership with Circle to integrate the USDC stablecoin into its core software products. This Intuit USDC integration marks a pivotal moment for millions of small and medium-sized businesses navigating the complex world of digital assets. What Does the Intuit and Circle Partnership Mean? The Block first reported this strategic alliance. Essentially, Circle will provide its robust blockchain infrastructure and the USDC stablecoin to Intuit’s massive software ecosystem. This ecosystem includes household names like TurboTax for tax filing, QuickBooks for accounting, and Credit Karma for financial management. The goal is clear: to seamlessly weave cryptocurrency, starting with a trusted stablecoin, into the everyday financial operations of mainstream businesses. Why is This Intuit USDC Integration a Game-Changer? For years, crypto users and businesses have faced a significant challenge: reconciling blockchain transactions with traditional accounting and tax frameworks. This integration aims to bridge that gap. Let’s break down the transformative benefits: Simplified Crypto Accounting: Automatically track and record USDC transactions within familiar tools like QuickBooks, reducing manual entry and errors. Streamlined Tax Compliance: TurboTax could potentially calculate gains, losses, and income from USDC activities directly, making crypto tax season far less daunting. Enhanced Financial Visibility: With USDC balances and flows integrated into Credit Karma and QuickBooks, businesses get a unified, real-time view of their entire financial picture. Mainstream Validation: A giant like Intuit adopting crypto infrastructure signals immense trust and accelerates broader institutional adoption. Who Benefits Most from This Move? The primary audience is Intuit’s vast user base of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These businesses are increasingly exploring crypto for payments, treasury management, and accessing global markets. However, they often lack the specialized tools to manage it efficiently. This Intuit USDC integration acts as a powerful on-ramp, allowing them to leverage digital dollars without leaving their trusted software environment. Furthermore, freelancers and gig economy workers who receive payments in USDC can now more easily account for that income and prepare their taxes. The ripple effect of this partnership extends to the entire crypto ecosystem, as it demonstrates a clear, practical use case for stablecoins beyond trading. What Are the Potential Challenges Ahead? While the promise is exciting, the path forward involves careful navigation. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins and crypto taxation remains a evolving landscape in the U.S. Intuit and Circle must ensure their integration complies with current and future regulations from the IRS and other bodies. Additionally, user education will be crucial. Businesses will need guidance on how to use these new features effectively and understand the implications of holding and transacting in USDC. The success of this Intuit USDC integration hinges not just on technology, but on clear communication and support for users taking their first steps into digital asset management. A Compelling Vision for the Future of Finance This partnership is more than a simple feature add-on. It represents a fundamental shift in how traditional finance and digital assets converge. By embedding USDC into the plumbing of everyday business software, Intuit and Circle are making cryptocurrency tangible, manageable, and legitimate for the average entrepreneur. The conclusion is powerful: the era of crypto operating in a silo is ending. The Intuit USDC integration is a masterstroke that brings the efficiency and transparency of blockchain directly to the ledgers and tax returns of Main Street businesses. It’s a confident step toward a future where digital and traditional assets coexist seamlessly in our financial tools.

The partnership was recently reported, and users should watch for official updates from Intuit and Circle regarding the launch timeline. Q: Will this integration support cryptocurrencies other than USDC? A: The initial announcement focuses on USDC. However, starting with a major stablecoin lays the groundwork, and future expansions to other digital assets are a possibility depending on user demand and regulatory developments. Q: Do I need to be a crypto expert to use these new features? A: No, that’s the main point. The integration is designed to simplify crypto accounting and tax within the familiar interfaces of TurboTax and QuickBooks, making it accessible even for those new to digital assets. Q: How will this affect my tax reporting with the IRS? A: The goal is to automate and improve accuracy. By tracking USDC transactions within the software, it should help generate the necessary reports (like Form 8949) for your crypto activities, ensuring you comply with IRS requirements.
