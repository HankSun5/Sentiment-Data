51518301,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804256,1757542980,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51518301.jpeg,Solana Price Today; XRP Latest News & Here Are What Analysts Predict To Rise 30x By December,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-today-xrp-latest-news-here-are-what-analysts-predict-to-rise-30x-by-december/,"Recently, Solana and XRP action has been at center stage as both tokens recorded respectable gains this week. Solana sits above after a 1.75% daily increase, while XRP is picking up steam with a 2.34% increase. But beyond these headline figures, mounting interest is being redirected toward start up projects like Remittix (RTX) , currently worth $0.1050 per token, as investors hunt for the next altcoin star of 2025. XRP, Solana and Pepe Record Daily Gains in Trades XRP reached $3.00 with a market cap of $179.41 billion in the most recent session, supported by a 15.09% increase in volume. Solana climbed to $217.27, recording a market cap of $117.77 billion with a 23.91% increase in volume. Pepe also joined the rally, climbing 5.13% to $0.00001033 with trading volume gaining nearly 80%. While such blue-chip tokens still dominate, investor attention has shifted to upcoming crypto initiatives that are accompanied by real-world applications. Among those, Remittix is not just highlighted for presale popularity but also for the soon-to-be-released Q3 2025 beta wallet. Remittix Presale Achievements and Exchange Listings Remittix (RTX) has emerged as one of the best crypto presale projects of the year within a brief period, with over $24.7 million raised and in excess of 653 million tokens sold to date. Its early success secured two centralized exchange listings — BitMart at the $20 million mark and LBank at $22 million — leveraging liquidity and exposure that most low cap crypto jewels never receive this early. At just $0.1050 per token, RTX is also one of the top crypto under $1 worth watching. The project aims to solve real-world problems in cross-border payments by enabling direct transfers of crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries with minimal gas fees and instant conversion. Such practical design earns it the status of a crypto with real-world utility, as opposed to most speculative projects. Beta Wallet Launch Causes Excitement The most anticipated release is the Remittix beta wallet, coming out September 15th. This wallet will support more than 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies, bridging the gap between ease of use on a decentralized exchange and regular financial needs. Main features are: Real-time FX conversion with open rates Global bank account transfers within seconds Support for freelancers, businesses, and remitters Community Engagement and Giveaway Another reason for RTX’s growth is community support. The current $250,000 Remittix giveaway has maintained high interest, rewarding early birds while promoting exposure throughout crypto communities. Coupled with presale benchmarks, future listings, and wallet integration, such activities solidify RTX as a contender for the fastest growing crypto in 2025. While Solana and XRP remain the talking point of trading in the crypto space, Remittix is quietly establishing itself on a foundation to become a cross-chain DeFi project that addresses actual payment issues and it is predicted to give up to 30x gains by December.

While price action is largely sideways, many top cryptocurrencies appear to have found a solid bottom over the past week – setting the stage for potential breakout moves. In this article, we analyze three major altcoins – XRP, PI, and DOGE – along with a fast-rising low-cap contender that could deliver outsized gains if momentum continues. With a possible Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, these tokens may be poised for substantial gains in the coming days , as bullish sentiment continues to build. Crypto Price Prediction Today 10 September – XRP, Pi Coin, Dogecoin XRP ($XRP): Altcoin Ready to Lead End-of-Year Bull Rally XRP has suffered a 1% decline in the past 24 hours, while its current price of $2.97 also marks a 10% decline in the past month. Recent weeks haven’t been great for XRP (or the rest of the market), but there’s every reason to believe that the alt will lead any market-wide rebound and bull rally. Not only is it up by 450% in the past year, but its fundamentals have only strengthened in the past couple of months, given Ripple’s expansion and the prospect of XRP ETFs. The firm has made important acquisitions and signed new partnerships , and the upshot is that demand for XRP will only increase over time. As we’ve noted before, its chart highlights how it has moved into a very promising position, with its indicators turning bullish after more than a month of bearishness. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) has recently climbed above 50, while its MACD (orange, blue) is about to turn positive, signalling that buyers are returning to its market. Given such moves, we could see the XRP price rise back to $3.50 as soon as the end of this month, while it may top $5 by the end of 2025. Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Altcoin Continues to Slide Despite Efforts to Boost Ecosystem The prize for the most disappointing altcoin of the year may end up going to Pi Network, which has suffered a consistent decline since peaking at $2.99 in February. It’s now languishing at a price of $0.3432, representing a 1% drop in 24 hours, 15% drop in a month, and an 88% decline since the aforementioned ATH. These aren’t inspiring figures, and what’s particularly concerning is that PI continues to fall despite efforts from its team to boost its utility and appeal. This includes the launch of the Pi App Studio in July, as well as of a development fund worth $100 million , both of which have failed to set the market alight. And today, we see that PI remains in a severely oversold position, one which it shows few signs of escaping. If the FOMC does cut rates next week, the resulting market-wide rally could help kickstart PI’s year, potentially sending it back towards $1 . However, because of its recent struggles to gain new listings, and because of industry suspicion surrounding PI , it’s just as possible that it falls further. In that case, the crypto price prediction for PI sees it dropping to $0.30 in the next few weeks, and $0.20 by the end of Q4. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETF Hopes Give Veteran Meme Coin Strong Prospects Despite suffering a slight dip today, Dogecoin’s current price of $0.2405 marks an 11% increase in a week and 3.5% gain in the past month. The meme token has also risen by 130% in the past year, giving it the kind of momentum that will help carry it strongly into any end-of-year bull rally. While there hasn’t recently been any bullish news as far as Dogecoin’s fundamentals go, the token continues to command a considerable community of supporters, who have helped prop up its price in recent weeks. On top of this, there is a good chance that we could see Dogecoin ETFs in the next few months, with Bloomberg analysts giving 3 DOGE ETFs a 90% chance of approval . This is hugely encouraging for the coin, which is moving into an increasingly bullish position, as we see from its chart below. Source: TradingView It has broken out of a bullish pennant in recent days, while its RSI and MACD have turned positive, indicating an increase in buying pressure. Yet the coin is still a long way from being overbought, which means that it can still rise further before suffering a correction. It could reach $0.30 by the end of September, before climbing towards $0.70 by the New Year. Bitcoin Hyper: Bullish Layer-Two Network Raises $14.4 Million in Presale The tokens above could do very well in the event of a rate cut next week, but they won’t be the only coins posting big returns as we enter the final stages of the year. There are also several presale coins preparing to launch very soon, and one of the most exciting is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a layer-two project that has now raised an impressive $14.4 million in its presale. Climb on the $HYPER rocket. The APY is out of this world! pic.twitter.com/U5IH8lcHxR — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 10, 2025 This is a hugely encouraging figure, and the reason for Bitcoin Hyper’s early success is that it will be the first fully fledged layer-two network for Bitcoin. By integrating with Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, Bitcoin Hyper will bring scalability and programmability to the Bitcoin ecosystem, while also cutting down on transaction fees. Users can deposit their Bitcoin with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, which will then provide an equivalent amount of HYPER for use on its L2 platform. The aim is for Bitcoin Hyper to become an important hub for DeFi, something which will enable Bitcoin holders to tap into BTC’s value and make considerable profits. And as the platform’s native token, HYPER is likely to attract big demand, with the coin also available for staking. You can buy the token now as part of the presale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website , where HYPER currently costs $0.012885 This will rise later today, so investors should move now if they want to lock in the biggest possible gains.

This next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin is in presale, offering early entry at $0.0055 per $LBRETT. With an initial staking APY of 812% and a $1 million giveaway, analysts predict Layer Brett could be the next big crypto, poised for explosive bull run gains. Layer Brett is the best presale crypto for the future Layer Brett emerges as the best crypto to buy now, fusing meme appeal with utility. This innovative Layer 2 blockchain surpasses traditional memecoins, boasting 10,000 TPS and ultra-low $0.0001 gas fees. These metrics position $LBRETT as a top-performing crypto, meeting market demand for efficient and scalable solutions. Built on Ethereum, Layer Brett ensures superior scalability and reduced costs, unlike older chains like Sol and PI. Its utility and community energy solidify its status as the next 100x altcoin in the DeFi space. Layer Brett is a groundbreaking Layer 2 crypto project on Ethereum, fusing meme culture with essential blockchain utility, making it a strong contender for the best crypto to buy now. Unlike tokens stuck on slow chains or with zero intrinsic value, Layer Brett operates differently. It’s a fast, scalable, community-powered ecosystem designed to disrupt the meme token landscape. Functioning as an ERC-20 token on its Layer 2 blockchain, Layer Brett liberates users from high gas fees and Ethereum Layer 1’s slowness. How does Layer Brett work? Layer Brett distinguishes itself with unique features prioritizing user rewards and efficiency. Early buyers gain access to substantial staking benefits, with an initial 812% APY via the dApp. This high-yield staking crypto is a cornerstone of its evolving ecosystem, which also includes token rewards and future Layer 2 functionality. Users connect their wallet, select ETH, USDT, or BNB, then buy $LBRETT and immediately start staking. This seamless process, enhanced by Layer 2 scaling, ensures Layer Brett is the best crypto to invest in. Sol and PI price prediction in the current bull cycle Price predictions for market alternatives like Sol and Pi are inherently volatile and unpredictable, swayed mainly by social media rather than technological merit. These tokens often experience rapid price increases followed by steep corrections, making them risky for long-term investors. Without robust utility, a market alternative struggles to sustain value after initial hype, starkly contrasting Layer Brett’s focus on ecosystem growth, making Layer Brett the best crypto to buy now for stability. Layer Brett is the next 100x meme coin With its robust Layer 2 framework, high-speed transactions, and attractive staking rewards, Layer Brett is strongly positioned for significant price appreciation. The ongoing presale offers an early entry for what many consider the best crypto to buy now, projecting exponential growth in the upcoming crypto bull run of 2025. Given its 10 billion token supply and utility focus, $LBRETT is poised to become a top meme coin and potentially a next 100x meme coin. This makes Layer Brett the best long-term crypto to consider. Layer Brett isn’t just a trending cryptocurrency; it signifies a paradigm shift in the meme coin space, combining viral appeal with genuine blockchain innovation. Its presale offers a unique opportunity to acquire $LBRETT early, stake tokens for an initial 812% APY, and participate in a $1 million giveaway. Layer Brett’s smaller market cap and Layer 2 utility promise greater growth potential, establishing it as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Don’t miss this chance to invest; the presale won’t last forever.

51519035,https://cryptonews.com/?p=421716,1757544615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51519035.jpeg,GOP Crypto Bill Faces Setback as Senator Warns “We’re Not Ready”,https://cryptonews.com/news/gop-crypto-bill-faces-setback-as-senator-warns-were-not-ready/,"Senate Republicans are facing fresh internal divisions over digital asset legislation, with a senior member of the Banking Committee signaling that efforts to advance a landmark cryptocurrency market structure bill could stall this month. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said on Wednesday that he does not believe the committee is prepared to move forward, casting doubt over Chairman Tim Scott’s pledge to mark up the bill before the end of September. “I don’t think we’re ready,” Kennedy told reporters. “People that I talk to still have a lot of questions. I know I still have a lot of questions.” His comments represent the clearest sign yet of resistance inside GOP ranks. Kennedy previously expressed concern that the bill, which would divide oversight of digital assets between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), could give the crypto industry too much sway over the legislative process. His warning sets him at odds with Scott and other Republicans who have made completing a market structure bill a top priority. Kennedy Pushback Threatens Scott’s September Deadline for Digital Asset Legislation A spokesperson for Scott emphasized that Banking Committee Republicans believe advancing a bipartisan framework is “long overdue.” Jeff Naft, speaking on behalf of Scott, said lawmakers have been working since June toward a September markup, citing thousands of pages of feedback and consultations with roughly 160 stakeholders. “The House has already acted, and the Senate should not fall behind,” Naft said. The House passed its own version of the legislation, known as the CLARITY Act, in July. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans introduced the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, creating new rules for stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar. But Kennedy dismissed that earlier measure as only a “baby step” compared to the broader market structure overhaul now on the table. “This is a full leap,” he said. “And we’ve got to get it right.” The split within GOP ranks threatens to derail Scott’s self-imposed September 30 deadline . The South Carolina senator, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, has spent months positioning his caucus to move forward. https://t.co/Py35Wl6na4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 27, 2025 In June, Scott and colleagues, including Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), released a set of principles outlining how they want digital assets regulated . The framework called for clear distinctions between securities and commodities , a shared oversight model between the SEC and CFTC, and anti-money laundering provisions designed to be “pro-innovation.” The principles also encouraged regulators to employ tools such as safe harbors and no-action letters to engage with crypto projects. Lummis, who chairs the Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee, warned at the time that the U.S. risked falling behind global peers such as the European Union and Singapore if it did not act quickly. Scott doubled down on the urgency later that month, setting a firm September 30 deadline for completing market structure legislation. Appearing at a Capitol Hill event alongside Lummis and White House adviser Bo Hines, Scott said finalizing the bill by that date was “a realistic expectation.” Hines echoed the commitment in a June 26 social media post, stating, “We are committed to getting market structure done by the end of September. Period.” Crypto industry leaders rallied behind the timetable. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called it “a clear path forward,” while Andreessen Horowitz government affairs head Colin McCune said comprehensive rules have been “sorely needed for years.” The industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying in Washington in hopes of securing long-awaited regulatory clarity. Still, skepticism is not confined to Kennedy. Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.), a Democrat on the Banking panel, said there is “still a lot more work to be done” and warned that marking up the bill this month would be “a mistake.” Democrats who have shown openness to the legislation have likewise urged Republicans to slow the process. The legislation under debate would represent the most sweeping attempt yet to regulate the $2 trillion digital asset market, setting new rules of the road for trading platforms and asset issuers. Its fate could determine how quickly the United States catches up to other jurisdictions with established frameworks. Momentum for CLARITY Act Fades as Democrats Push Rival Crypto Bill Momentum behind the Republican-led CLARITY Act is showing signs of strain despite earlier optimism that bipartisan support could carry it through Congress this year. Senator Tim Scott predicted that 12 out of 18 Democrats may back the CLARITY Act in an appearance on Tuesday. #TimScott #CLARITYAct https://t.co/Z2tBFEDFe7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 At the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in August , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott predicted that 12 of 18 Senate Democrats might ultimately back the legislation. He argued that growing bipartisan interest in setting rules for digital assets could offset resistance from figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been outspoken against loosening oversight. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a co-sponsor of the draft framework, went further, setting a Thanksgiving deadline for passage and promising the measure would reach the president’s desk before year-end. Lummis said the proposal would clarify how securities and commodities laws apply to digital assets, modernize regulatory frameworks, and provide stronger consumer protections. Senator Cynthia Lummis is looking to have digital asset market structure legislation completed before the end of 2025. #CynthiaLummis #cryptolegislation https://t.co/brkZvGtCgH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 21, 2025 Yet resistance within the Democratic Party has hardened in recent weeks. On September 9, a group of 12 Democratic senators unveiled their own crypto regulation framework , the first coordinated stance by the party this year. Their proposal emphasized tighter disclosure standards, mandatory registration of crypto platforms with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and strengthened oversight by both the SEC and CFTC. Notably, it also included provisions designed to limit political conflicts of interest by blocking elected officials and their families from profiting from digital assets. Source: Polymarket That release has altered expectations around the bill’s future. On prediction platform Polymarket, bettors now assign just a 32% chance that the CLARITY Act will be signed into law in 2025, down sharply from nearly 90% in July.

Solana Perp Open Interest Has Spiked Recently As pointed out by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the Solana Open Interest has climbed up as the SOL price has continued to outperform the market recently. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to SOL that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. The metric takes into account for both short and long contracts. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Solana perpetual futures Open Interest over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Open Interest has observed an increase alongside the asset’s push above the $200 mark and has crossed the $7 billion milestone. “Market participation is clearly expanding,” notes the analytics firm. Historically, speculative activity going up in the sector hasn’t been anything unusual during price rallies, as investors tend to find such periods to be exciting, so they become more prone to making moves. An excessive surge in the Open Interest, however, is something that can be worth monitoring. This is because new positions generally imply an increase in leverage for the sector, which is something that can make mass liquidation events more likely to take place. Given that the Solana perpetual futures Open Interest has shot up recently, it’s possible that the price could face instability owing to potential liquidation squeezes. Which way the resulting volatility might take the cryptocurrency in comes down to which side of the market is more dominant. A metric that can be useful for gauging that is the Funding Rate . This indicator measures the amount of periodic fees that perpetual futures users are exchanging with each other right now. When the Funding Rate is positive, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. On the other hand, the metric being below zero suggests bearish bets are more dominant. As the chart below shows, the Solana Funding Rate has been positive recently, indicating that the investors have been betting on a bullish outcome. This could imply that a squeeze may be more probable to affect the long side. Interestingly, though, the Funding Rate hasn’t seen any increase alongside the surge in the Open Interest, a sign that new short and long positions have come in equal parts. “This suggests the build-up is not excessively leveraged, leaving scope for further upside if momentum persists,” explains Glassnode. SOL Price Solana has pulled away from the rest of the sector during the past week with a surge of almost 7% that has taken its price to $224.",Solana|SOL|solana|Solana Funding Rate|Solana Open Interest|Solana Perp Open Interest|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 23:00:04

Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market The transaction, recorded on Ledger #98,741,614, carried a negligible fee of 0.000015 XRP, showcasing the network’s efficiency. While Ripple has not provided an official statement, analysts suggest the move could be tied to liquidity preparation for exchanges, settlement mechanisms, or the expansion of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors. The timing, so close to its courtroom victory, has fueled speculation that Ripple is positioning itself for a new phase of institutional adoption. Whales Watch Closely as XRP Price Slips Despite the optimism around Ripple’s legal clarity, XRP has not been immune to market pressure. Currently, XRP trades at $2.96, down 1.67% in the past 24 hours, with daily trading volume falling over 26% to $4.94 billion. Analysts warn that this decline in both price and volume could signal waning short-term momentum. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Chart data highlights a critical battleground for XRP between $0.65–$0.68 resistance levels and support zones at $0.60 and $0.55. A decisive breakout above $0.70 could push XRP toward $0.80, while failure to hold support risks deeper corrections. Notably, whale activity and institutional interest continue to build, with XRP futures open interest surging to $7.94 billion, underscoring expectations of heightened volatility. ETFs, RLUSD, and the Bigger Picture Crypto analyst Zach Rector recently highlighted that Ripple’s restructuring of institutional XRP sales during its SEC case could shape the framework for potential XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With ETF issuers unable to source XRP directly from Ripple, centralized exchanges and OTC desks may become the main supply channels, creating added pressure on secondary market liquidity. Meanwhile, the adoption of Ripple USD (RLUSD) in Japan, facilitated through a partnership with SBI Group, has strengthened XRP’s fundamentals. RLUSD requires XRP for transaction fees, further boosting on-chain demand. Whale accumulation and growing institutional exposure through platforms like the CME also support a more bullish long-term outlook.

Resistance at $3.05 remains the key breakout test. By Jainam Mehta ​XRP ( XRP-USD ) is regaining traction after weeks of pressure, trading just under $3.00 while testing a descending trendline that has capped its rallies since late July. The move comes as on-chain data shows renewed exchange inflows, suggesting traders are positioning for a decisive breakout attempt. On the 4-hour chart, XRP has rebounded strongly from the $2.75 zone, reclaiming all major exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200 EMA). These averages now converge between $2.90 and $2.94, creating a critical support cluster for maintaining bullish momentum. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The immediate hurdle is the $3.00–$3.05 region, which aligns with the descending trendline and a dense supply zone. A successful breakout above this level would mark a reversal of the medium-term downtrend, opening the path to $3.15 and $3.30. Failure to clear resistance could bring sellers back into play, pushing price toward $2.90 or even $2.75. Exchange flows signal renewed appetite On-chain data highlights the importance of this juncture. Coinglass reported $21.62 million in net spot inflows on September 10, a notable shift from the steady outflows that dominated August. These inflows suggest speculative positioning around the $3 threshold, with traders preparing for either an upside extension or a rejection-driven pullback. Momentum indicators are cautiously supportive. The RSI has improved to 59, showing strengthening momentum without signaling overbought conditions. Meanwhile, higher lows since early September reinforce the view that buyers are steadily building demand ahead of a potential breakout. Outlook hinges on resistance test In the near term, XRP’s ability to hold above the $2.90 EMA cluster will be crucial. Consolidation above this zone could provide the springboard for a break through $3.05, a move that would likely shift sentiment decisively bullish. Conversely, losing the cluster risks reigniting bearish pressure and undermining the recovery effort. The $3.00–$3.05 level remains the battleground. Traders will be watching whether inflows continue and volume expands, as these would confirm that the recovery is more than a speculative bounce. As noted in earlier coverage , XRP has often struggled with sustaining rallies when institutional momentum fades. With the BBVA custody deal recently strengthening the token’s European footprint, investors now want to see if technical resilience aligns with growing utility demand.

Quintenz shared a series of text messages he said he'd exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini — which is set to go public this week — and Winklevoss Capital. Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler's twin brother and co-founder, may have also been in the group chat, which was titled ""tw-cw-bq"" but did not send any messages in the screenshots shared by Quintenz. In the chat, dated July 24, Tyler Winklevoss asked Quintenz if he'd seen a post on X from June 17 where Tyler announced Gemini had filed a complaint with the CFTC's inspector general about Division of Enforcement attorneys who had pursued charges against Gemini. ""I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,"" Quintenz said in his posts, representing a highly unusual move for a nominee in the midst of a federal confirmation process. ""It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts."" Before the Senate left Washington for its August break, Quintenz's nomination was set for what was thought to be an easy procedural step in the Senate Agriculture Committee to advance it to the floor for his final confirmation vote. But the White House halted that vote for reasons it didn't make clear at the time, though Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss had been waging a rhetorical campaign to stop his confirmation. Winklevoss told CoinDesk in an interview in July that he'd been making the case that Quintenz was a bad choice because of the former commissioner's wish to increase the CFTC budget to oversee the crypto industry, his past views on the legal liability for crypto developers and what Winklevoss characterized as Quintenz's improper attempts to influence the CFTC on behalf of prediction market firm Kalshi. Read more: Gemini's Tyler Winklevoss Says Trump CFTC Pick Quintenz Has 'Disqualifying' Views Quintenz's post on Wednesday suggested that, in his view, Winklevoss was upset that Quintenz did not join in criticism of CFTC's enforcement efforts after the agency pursued charges against Gemini that were settled in January . ""I know we had spoken about this in the winter where I recalled my original extreme disappointment at [the Enforcement Division] for pursuing this so aggressively,"" a text from Quintenz said. ""I commit to you to having a fair and reasonable review of the matter and the division and individuals involved to determine if they acted inappropriately."" He went on to say that a ""fully confirmed chair"" should be the person to handle the matter, but that if someone currently employed by the CFTC was ""communicating with"" the Winklevosses, he would have to ""give that careful thought."" Winklevoss asked if Quintenz was saying that Gemini should have waited to file their complaint until after the Senate confirmed the former commissioner, to which Quintenz replied that ""any decision or response to your complaint should be made by and given the full weight of the confirmed chair."" The crypto executive said they had spoken about the CFTC's enforcement effort against Gemini after Quintenz asked for the Winklevoss brothers' endorsement in December. ""Cultural reform, which includes rectifying what happened to us, should be the highest priority,"" Winklevoss said. ""I'd like to understand your thoughts on this and how you plan to align with President Trump and the administration's mandate to end the lawfare and make amends for it."" He added that he would ""be happy to raise the issue with the president himself"" if Quintenz thought he was being undermined by current CFTC employees. Quintenz, Winklevoss and a spokesperson for Gemini did not immediately return requests for comment. CoinDesk could not independently verify the texts' authenticity. In July, a coalition that represented the vast majority of the crypto industry came out to press President Donald Trump to move forward to get Quintenz confirmed, calling him the ""right person at the right time"" to run the CFTC. Though the Senate has been back from break for a while and has returned to its confirmation work for many of Trump's appointees, the committee hasn't yet scheduled a follow-up vote for Quintenz Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has been pressing forward on an industry-friendly ""Project Crypto"" initiative while the temporary chief at the CFTC, Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has been standing in at the sister agency with a similar ""crypto sprint.""

A significant development has emerged with CFTC nominee Quintenz , Brian Quintenz, who is vying for the top spot as chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He has leveled serious accusations against the prominent Gemini co-founders, the Winklevoss brothers, alleging they attempted to derail his confirmation process. What Sparked the Allegations Against CFTC Nominee Quintenz? According to reports from Cointelegraph, Quintenz publicly released text messages on X, detailing the alleged obstruction. These messages reportedly show the Winklevoss brothers expressing deep dissatisfaction with an ongoing civil lawsuit between their company, Gemini, and the CFTC. Their concerns weren’t just about the lawsuit; they reportedly demanded assurances from Quintenz. Specifically, they sought a guarantee that the regulatory agency would not impose what they considered excessive regulations on Gemini. Quintenz, however, claims he firmly refused these demands. This exchange set the stage for a dramatic escalation. Quintenz believes that following his refusal, the Winklevoss brothers then contacted then-President Donald Trump. Their alleged objective? To request that Quintenz’s confirmation be put on hold, directly impacting the future of CFTC nominee Quintenz . How Did This Alleged Obstruction Unfold for CFTC Nominee Quintenz? The timeline of events further underscores the seriousness of these claims. In July, the Senate Agriculture Committee had initially scheduled a confirmation vote for Brian Quintenz. This vote, a crucial step for any CFTC nominee Quintenz , was unexpectedly postponed. The Core Demand: The Winklevoss brothers allegedly sought assurances regarding future regulatory actions on Gemini, especially concerning the civil lawsuit. Quintenz’s Stance: He maintained an independent position, refusing to provide such guarantees. Presidential Intervention Claimed: Quintenz alleges the brothers then reached out to President Trump to halt his confirmation. Confirmation Delay: The Senate vote was indeed postponed at the White House’s request, lending weight to Quintenz’s account. This sequence of events paints a picture of intense lobbying and alleged political maneuvering within the crypto space, directly targeting a key regulatory appointment. Such actions, if proven, could raise significant questions about the integrity of regulatory processes and industry influence. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation and CFTC Nominee Quintenz? This incident, involving a prominent CFTC nominee Quintenz and influential crypto figures, highlights the ongoing tension between the rapidly evolving digital asset industry and the regulatory bodies tasked with overseeing it. It underscores the challenges regulators face in maintaining independence while navigating powerful industry interests. For the broader cryptocurrency market, such disputes can create uncertainty. Investors and market participants often look for clear, consistent regulatory frameworks. Allegations of obstruction, especially involving a high-profile confirmation, can complicate these efforts and potentially delay important policy decisions. Moreover, this situation brings into focus the critical role of the CFTC in shaping the future of crypto derivatives and other digital assets. The integrity of its leadership, represented by figures like CFTC nominee Quintenz , is paramount for maintaining market confidence and ensuring fair practices. The outcome of these allegations and Quintenz’s confirmation process will be closely watched. It could set a precedent for how future interactions between crypto industry leaders and government regulators are perceived and handled. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Regulation The allegations by CFTC nominee Quintenz against the Gemini founders mark a significant moment in the ongoing narrative of crypto regulation. It’s a stark reminder of the high stakes involved when industry interests intersect with government oversight. As this story unfolds, it will undoubtedly influence perceptions of industry conduct and the independence of regulatory appointments, shaping the future landscape for digital assets.

The surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence is fueling the need for more data centers and in turn increasing energy consumption, raising concern from policymakers. U.S. spending on data centers has reached $40B Construction spending on U.S. data centers rose to a record amount of $40B in June, according to a new report from the Bank of America Institute. The increase is due to the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, which require immense computing power. The adoption of AI technology has prompted major technology companies to ramp up investments in digital infrastructure. The figure marks a 30% increase from the same period last year, which experienced a 50% surge. Cloud and technology companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are at the center of this increased spending . These companies are known as “hyperscalers” due to the scale of their global cloud operations. These hyperscalers have invested billions into building and expanding data centers to support the massive computing needs of generative AI tools and machine learning models. The foundation of modern AI applications relies on a vast network of servers and specialized hardware to process enormous datasets. The growth of large scale data centers that can meet those demands has had an effect across the technology industry, especially for chipmakers like Nvidia. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used in a number of AI training and inference tasks due to their high performance, and a good portion of the company’s revenue from sales is linked to the demand from data centers. The Bank of America Institute emphasized that while hyperscalers are driving much of the current demand, they are not the sole force behind it. “Hyperscalers are a big part of the increased demand for power, but they’re not the whole picture,” Bank of America Institute economists led by Liz Everett Krisberg said in the report . Electricity demand concerns With the increase of data center construction, energy consumption within the U.S. is also on the rise. According to the economists at the Bank of America Institute, most of the rise in electricity demand through 2030 is expected to come not just from AI data centers, but also from electric vehicles (EVs), heating systems, industrial reshoring, and the electrification of buildings. This projected surge in power demand poses new challenges for utilities, policymakers, and the energy sector. Data centers are known to consume a significant amount of electricity, as each facility requires large amounts of energy not only to power computing equipment but also to maintain cooling systems. With more of these facilities becoming operational, concerns about the long-term strain on U.S. energy grids are also building. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Wyden accuses Microsoft In the September 10 letter to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Wyden alleged that the tech giant’s “gross cybersecurity negligence” has led to ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure , including U.S. health care organizations, at least partially due to default configurations in the Windows operating system. Wyden likened Microsoft to an “arsonist selling firefighting services to their victims,” and according to him, government agencies and other companies have “no choice” but to use the company’s products because it has “near-monopoly over enterprise IT.” Wyden cited the May 2024 ransomware attack on hospital operator Ascension as a prime example. That case, according to the company, exposed private medical and insurance data of nearly 5.6 million people. He wrote that the hospital operator had informed his staff that a contractor on an Ascension laptop had clicked on a malicious link provided by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Wyden claims Microsoft’s support for outdated encryption technology and default configuration settings led to the Ascension exploit. He also said the firm has yet to properly educate companies about how to mitigate the threat. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that RC4, the encryption standard referenced by Wyden, is indeed old, but it makes up “less than .1%” of the company’s traffic, and it discourages customers from using it. “However, disabling its use completely would break many customer systems,” the spokesperson said, and the company is gradually reducing the extent to which customers can use it while trying to provide warnings and guidance as well. RC4 will be disabled by default in certain Windows products starting the first quarter of 2026, and the company has said it will include “additional mitigations” for existing deployments. Wyden demanded a review of court system’s cybersecurity practices Wyden’s move on Microsoft comes not long after he urged Chief Justice John Roberts to initiate a comprehensive review of the federal court system’s cybersecurity practices. His request came after a significant hack of the electronic case management system, marking the second major breach in five years. The latest breach was recorded in June of this year and has pushed the courts to finally announce the implementation of multifactor authentication, a basic security measure that has been standard in executive branch agencies since 2015. As far as Wyden is concerned, the negligence in court cybersecurity poses serious risks to national security, as sensitive information related to ongoing investigations and federal witnesses could be exploited by foreign adversaries. Sealed court filings located in the case management system often include extremely sensitive information about national security sources and methods, the names of key federal witnesses, or details of ongoing investigations. Such information in the hands of foreign adversaries or criminal cartels could be highly damaging to Americans’ security. It does not help matters that the New York Times has reported that “documents related to criminal activity with overseas ties,” were the target of the most recent hack. Get seen where it counts.

The South Korea newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that the Ministry of SMEs and Startups says the existing ban on crypto firms’ VC funding will end on September 16. The ministry said the State Council, South Korea’s chief executive body and ministerial cabinet has signed off on the move. VC Funding for Crypto Firms: South Korea Scraps 2018 Ban The council has agreed to make a partial amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the Special Act on the Promotion of Venture Businesses. The South Korean Minister of SMEs and Startups Han Seong-sook. (Source: Lee Jae-myung/YouTube) The amendment will effectively scrap the designation of crypto trading and brokerage-providing firms as “a restricted venture business.” The ban has been in place since October 2018. At the time, the government of President Moon Jae-in said it was imposing the ban to help cool an “overheated, speculative” market. The government’s move drew ire from the crypto community. In South Korea, only bars, nightclubs, and licenced gambling venues are subject to similar VC investment restrictions. The ministry explained that the amendment “reflects the changing global status of the cryptoasset industry.” It added that the law now provided a wide range of protection systems for domestic crypto exchange users. The ministry also spoke about the need to “foster” industries in the “digital asset ecosystem.” It made special mention of companies that work with blockchain and cryptography-related technology. This move, the government added, will allow crypto companies with technological prowess and growth potential to apply for VC investment. This, the ministry added, will put them on an even footing with other innovative companies in the IT space. The SMEs Minister Han Seong-sook said: “We will foster a transparent and responsible ecosystem.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-dont-sleep-on-xrp-heres-why/,"A respected market commentator has advised traders to keep a close watch on XRP as the year draws to a close, highlighting a potential breakout setup that could trigger significant gains. XRP has recently shown renewed strength after a period of weakness. The token closed at $2.96 on September 7, marking its highest daily close in two weeks and renewing optimism among traders. Analysts argue that the move positions XRP near a critical level that could decide its trajectory for the remainder of the year. One of the strongest voices in this discussion is Heisenberg, a well-followed analyst who believes XRP’s price structure mirrors past setups that preceded major advances. According to him, the current technical formation could set the stage for XRP to reach double-digit prices before the end of 2025. Don't sleep on $XRP into eoy… pic.twitter.com/lg5zP1BYgZ — Heisenberg (@Mr_Derivatives) September 7, 2025 Reviewing Past Breakouts Historical data shows that XRP has followed a recurring pattern over the past year. For much of 2024, the asset remained below the $1 level in a prolonged consolidation phase. That changed in November following the U.S. elections, when XRP climbed sharply to reach $2.9 in early December. Subsequent price action created a descending trendline that capped movement through late December and early January. A breakout above this resistance fueled another advance, sending XRP to $3.4 by mid-January 2025. The pattern repeated in the first quarter of 2025. After another controlled decline, XRP broke higher again, culminating in its strongest rally of the cycle in late June. That run peaked above $3.6 in July before momentum cooled, as technical indicators signaled overbought conditions. Current Setup Since the July peak, XRP has trended lower within another descending channel. The September 7 close at $2.96 places the asset directly below the upper boundary of this structure. Importantly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reset to 48.86, leaving space for renewed momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts note that a move above $3.05 to $3.20 could confirm a breakout, with potential upside targets ranging between $3.8 and $4.2 in the near term. If buying pressure builds in a manner consistent with prior rallies, Heisenberg argues that XRP could extend toward $10 before the end of the year. For now, the key support zone lies near $2.6, and holding above this level is seen as essential for maintaining the bullish outlook. Broader Market Views Other analysts share similar perspectives. Gordon, a veteran trader, observed that XRP has been consolidating in a tight range for months, which he believes is a prelude to a rapid move toward $6. Meanwhile, Hov has identified two possible paths: either XRP begins a strong third-wave advance in its broader trend, or it remains in a corrective phase, forming a running flat or triangle. He expects a resolution soon. Additionally, CryptoInsightUK has drawn attention to XRP’s performance relative to gold. He pointed to the token’s resilience in holding previous range highs as support, alongside a bullish RSI cross on the daily chart, which he interprets as further evidence of underlying strength. Taken together, the analyses suggest that XRP is approaching a decisive stage. While downside risks remain if support fails, the repeated pattern of breakouts following descending trendlines has encouraged market watchers to expect another significant rally before the year concludes.

Here’s Why People Are Backing Layer Brett,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-for-the-next-50x-crypto-gainer-heres-why-people-are-backing-layer-brett/,"As investors look beyond conventional assets like XRP, the crypto world is abuzz with the arrival of Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , a pioneering Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin that is rapidly gaining traction.

This engagement signifies a crucial step towards defining the future framework for the cryptocurrency market. Why is SEC Engagement on Crypto Regulation So Important? On September 9, the SEC’s specialized crypto task force convened with Mysten Labs to delve into approaches for cryptocurrency market oversight. This discussion, as reported by Cointelegraph, underscores the SEC’s proactive stance in understanding and potentially regulating the rapidly expanding digital asset sector. The SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, a mandate it now extends to the crypto space. The agency’s engagement with industry players like Mysten Labs is vital. It allows regulators to gain direct insights into the technology and operational models of new blockchain projects.

Regulators must balance the need for investor protection with the desire to foster innovation. Overly restrictive rules could stifle growth, while insufficient oversight could expose investors to significant risks. Key challenges include: Defining Digital Assets: Classifying cryptocurrencies as securities, commodities, or a new asset class remains a contentious issue. Jurisdictional Complexity: The global nature of crypto makes consistent international crypto regulation difficult. Technological Understanding: Regulators need to keep pace with rapid technological advancements to craft effective policies. Market Manipulation: Ensuring fair trading practices and preventing illicit activities. These complexities underscore why direct engagement between regulators and innovators is not just beneficial, but absolutely necessary. It helps bridge the knowledge gap and ensures that future crypto regulation is informed and practical. Charting a Path Forward: The Impact of Regulatory Dialogues The meeting between the SEC and Mysten Labs is more than just a single discussion; it’s part of an ongoing global effort to establish a clear framework for digital assets. Such dialogues can lead to more predictable and transparent regulatory environments, which ultimately benefits both investors and developers. When rules are clear, businesses can innovate with greater certainty, and investors can participate with more confidence. The outcomes of these discussions could: Enhance Market Stability: Clear rules can reduce volatility and speculative behavior. Boost Institutional Adoption: More institutions may enter the crypto space with defined guidelines. Promote Innovation: A well-understood regulatory landscape can encourage responsible development. Ultimately, the goal of effective crypto regulation is to create a secure and thriving digital economy. The collaborative spirit shown in these meetings suggests a path towards balanced and forward-thinking policies that could shape the future of finance. The recent engagement between the SEC’s crypto task force and Mysten Labs represents a critical dialogue in the ongoing quest for robust crypto regulation .

Whale Alert recently reported a massive SOL transfer : an astounding 1,611,845 SOL, valued at approximately $361 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly to Coinbase Institutional. This significant Solana movement immediately raises crucial questions about its origins and potential impact on the market. What Does This Massive SOL Transfer Signify? The sheer scale of this SOL transfer is hard to overstate. Moving over 1.6 million Solana tokens in a single transaction highlights the activity of a major player, often referred to as a ‘whale’ in the crypto community. Such large movements can often precede significant market shifts or signal a change in strategy by a substantial holder. Moreover, the destination is particularly noteworthy: Coinbase Institutional. This arm of Coinbase caters specifically to large institutions, hedge funds, and corporate clients. Therefore, this is not a typical retail transaction. It suggests either: A large institution is accumulating SOL. An existing institutional holder is moving funds for custody or an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Funds are being prepared for potential liquidation or rebalancing. Understanding the implications of this particular SOL transfer requires looking beyond the numbers to the entities involved. Unpacking the Implications of Such a Large SOL Transfer Whenever a transfer of this magnitude occurs, the crypto market pays close attention. The movement of $361 million worth of SOL to an institutional platform can have several potential effects. On one hand, it could be a bullish signal if an institution is acquiring Solana for long-term holding, indicating growing institutional confidence in the asset’s future. Conversely, it could signal a move to sell a substantial amount of SOL through an OTC desk, which could potentially impact market liquidity or price in the short term, although OTC deals are designed to minimize direct market impact. The mystery surrounding the ‘unknown wallet’ adds another layer of intrigue. Was it a foundation, an early investor, or a different institutional entity? This particular SOL transfer underscores the dynamic nature of digital asset markets, where large transactions can reveal underlying trends and investor sentiment. It also highlights the increasing role of institutional capital in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape, especially for prominent altcoins like Solana. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After This SOL Transfer? For market participants, observing the aftermath of this significant SOL transfer will be crucial. Will Solana’s price react? Will there be follow-up announcements or further movements? The crypto market is often a game of informed speculation, and events like this provide valuable data points. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Market Reaction: Keep an eye on Solana’s price action and trading volume in the coming days. Research Institutional Interest: This event reinforces the trend of institutions entering the crypto space. Understanding their movements can offer insights. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources for any updates or analyses regarding large whale movements. This enormous SOL transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous evolution and maturation of the cryptocurrency market, driven by both retail and increasingly, institutional players. The transfer of 1,611,845 SOL to Coinbase Institutional is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant indicator of ongoing institutional activity in the Solana ecosystem. While the exact motivations behind this move remain unknown, it undeniably sparks conversation and speculation across the crypto community. As the digital asset space continues to grow, such massive movements will increasingly shape market dynamics and investor perception. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Q2: What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a platform designed for institutional investors, offering advanced trading, custody, and prime brokerage services for large-scale crypto operations. Q3: Does a large SOL transfer automatically mean a price change? Not necessarily. While large transfers can signal potential buying or selling pressure, the actual impact depends on whether the funds are for custody, an OTC deal, or direct market trades. The market often anticipates such moves. Q4: Why is the ‘unknown wallet’ significant? The unknown nature of the wallet means the identity and intentions of the sender are not public, adding an element of mystery and speculation to the transaction’s purpose. Q5: How can I track large crypto transfers like this SOL transfer? Services like Whale Alert (which reported this transaction) and various blockchain explorers allow users to track large cryptocurrency movements on public ledgers.

While the blockchain itself continued to produce blocks, some Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services and validators halted, forcing providers to rewind to the last finalized block and resynchronize. Polygon Executes Emergency Hard Fork to Resolve Finality Bug Polygon engineers confirmed the bug was preventing node progress under certain configurations, though restarting affected nodes resolved the issue for several validators and RPC providers. At the time, Polygonscan, the network’s block explorer, showed no block updates for more than five hours. Polygon later explained that Polygonscan’s nodes had halted after a faulty milestone produced by Heimdall, the project’s consensus engine. A company representative said that the team was working with Polygonscan to switch to functioning nodes that had not halted, stressing that block production remained live. “Checkpoint finality is working as expected within 15 minutes,” the team said in an update at 08:52 UTC, sharing an alternative link where real-time block production could be tracked. Polygon PoS network faces 10-15 minute transaction delays from a node bug as protocols suspend operations and POL drops 3.42%. #Polygon #POS https://t.co/4o0TzV7qVH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 10, 2025 Analysis revealed the problem stemmed from Heimdall’s finality gadget, which is responsible for producing milestones every few seconds. Although checkpoints to Ethereum were still being posted every 20 minutes, milestones, which provide faster, deterministic finality, were not being processed. This left local fast finality delayed even as the main chain continued adding blocks. To address the problem, Polygon rolled out emergency updates: Bor version 2.2.11-beta2 and Heimdall version 0.3.1, the latter requiring a hard fork. The upgrade, executed at 3 p.m. UTC, deleted the faulty milestone and purged it from node databases. Polygon confirmed soon after that the hard fork was successfully completed and that both milestones and checkpoints were once again finalizing normally. Source: Polygonscan “The hard fork has been successfully completed, and milestones are now processing normally along with state sync. Checkpoints are going through, and consensus finalization has been fully restored on Polygon PoS,” the team wrote in a statement on X. UPDATE: The hard fork has been successfully completed, and milestones are now processing normally along with state sync. Checkpoints are going through and consensus finalization has been fully restored on Polygon PoS. We will continue to monitor the network closely to ensure… https://t.co/UwiAYdcKXu — Polygon Foundation (@0xPolygonFdn) September 10, 2025 Polygon Foundation co-founder and CEO Sandeep Nailwal later explained that the disruption originated from a faulty milestone proposal that pushed some Bor nodes onto divergent forks. This triggered short-term instability not accounted for in the system. He emphasized that while checkpoint finality on Ethereum had remained active throughout, local milestone finality was delayed. “Milestones are a lightweight alternative to checkpoints, enabling faster, deterministic finality for transactions, even before a checkpoint is submitted to Ethereum,” Nailwal said. “The root cause came from a faulty milestone proposal. We rolled out fixes on both Heimdall and Bor. Earlier today, Polygon PoS experienced a disruption where checkpoint finality on Ethereum was still active, but local fast finality on the chain (i.e. milestones) were delayed. For context: milestones are a lightweight alternative to checkpoints, enabling faster, deterministic… https://t.co/ulINLtlurV — Sandeep | CEO, Polygon Foundation (※,※) (@sandeepnailwal) September 10, 2025 With these fixes now live, nodes are not stuck, and consensus is finalizing normally.” Nailwal described the event as part of the growing pains of scaling Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain but said each challenge strengthens its resilience. “There will be growing pains with any ambitious upgrade. But each one makes Polygon PoS stronger on our road to GigaGas throughput,” he said, adding that more upgrades are planned to boost capacity and reliability. Polygon engineers continue to monitor the network to ensure stability and are investigating how the faulty milestone was introduced. Despite the temporary setback, the network has resumed normal operations, with blocks, milestones, and checkpoints processing in real time Polygon’s Reliability Questioned After Finality Bug, TVL Down 87% From Peak Polygon developers have deployed a hard fork to fix a bug that temporarily halted block production on its proof-of-stake chain, restoring the network after several hours of disruption. The issue, tied to transaction finality, left exchanges and DeFi protocols unable to process deposits or withdrawals as they waited for confirmation guarantees. The outage drew criticism from Polymarket traders, who argued that a blockchain hosting one of the sector’s largest prediction markets should not face such problems. “It might have gone unnoticed because no one was using it, but this has been going on for about two hours,” one trader posted, pointing to the risk of reversals during the downtime. It might have gone unnoticed because no one was using it, but this has been going on for about 2 hours on @0xPolygon . It's concerning that @Polymarket is still on this network https://t.co/PHW4xYeD48 pic.twitter.com/8KbCrLT2F4 — barnacle (@barnaclebarny) September 10, 2025 TokenPocket, a multichain stablecoin wallet, also paused Polygon transactions after observing that no new blocks had been finalized for over an hour. The incident comes just weeks after Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade , designed to cut finality times to five seconds and improve validator coordination. That update followed the July 1 Bhilai hard fork , which raised throughput to 1,000 transactions per second and integrated Ethereum’s Pectra EIPs . Despite these efforts, network reliability remains a concern, as Polygon’s total value locked has dropped from a $9.43 billion peak in 2021 to $1.2 billion today, per DeFiLlama . The chain’s native token, POL, has fallen 3.4% on the day and is down 30% year-to-date, trading at $0.27. Meanwhile, another Ethereum Layer-2, Linea, faced a separate outage earlier today when its mainnet sequencer stalled, causing a 67-minute pause in block production. While Linea has already deployed a fix , developers are questioning whether the two disruptions are linked. Linea has not disclosed the cause of its downtime. Both events highlight the fragility of scaling networks that have become essential to Ethereum’s broader ecosystem.

51522011,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804812,1757548800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51522011.jpeg,"PepeVandal Launches Presale, Positions Project as “Rebellion” Against Meme Tokens",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepevandal-launches-presale-positions-project-as-rebellion-against-meme-tokens/,"PepeVandal , a new digital asset project blending narrative storytelling with gamified participation, has opened its presale for the $PEDAN token. The initiative frames itself as a cultural response to meme coins, using the language of raids, loot, and rebellion to describe a structured model for community engagement. Origins The project’s narrative centers on a character named Pepe, who is depicted as a long-time participant in meme token markets. According to its lore, Pepe invested in multiple presales, endured high transaction fees, and witnessed repeated failures: founders disappearing, communities going silent, and roadmaps abandoned. The conclusion drawn from this story is that meme tokens are not broken by accident but are designed to prioritize hype over substance. PepeVandal emerges from this realization as an organized “rebellion,” symbolized by graffiti imagery and a recurring green “V.” Mechanics of Participation PepeVandal structures its participation model as a loop: Smash → Loot → Share → Repeat. Target Selection : The community identifies a project or sector to “raid.” Raid Activation : Participants stake $PEDAN to join. They also contribute digital content such as memes, graffiti-style posts, and social campaigns. Vault Discovery : At the end of the raid, a vault is revealed. Rewards may include NFTs or tokenized representations of real-world assets such as property, music royalties, or gold. Loot Distribution : Rewards are distributed proportionally among participants who staked $PEDAN during the raid. Those who did not stake cannot claim. Repeat : The cycle restarts with a new raid. NFTs are central to the system’s utility. “Keys” unlock vaults, “Gear” can boost staking returns, and “Relics” can alter governance outcomes. The approach integrates DeFi mechanics into a narrative framework designed to maintain ongoing engagement. Roadmap in Six Acts Rather than a conventional roadmap, PepeVandal outlines six narrative “Acts”: Act I — Spark in the Sewer : The presale launches, paired with underground campaigns and manifesto drops. Act II — The First Tag : $PEDAN lists on decentralized exchanges, liquidity is locked, and NFTs are minted. Act III — Arm the Army : Release of Gear NFTs and Relics, introducing gamified staking and loyalty systems. Act IV — Vaults & Order : Community governance mechanisms go live. Integrations with real-world asset protocols begin. Act V — The Chainspring : Revenue from tokenized assets flows to $PEDAN stakers. The project expands from narrative into financial infrastructure. Act VI — Encrypted Future : Left intentionally undefined, to be determined by community participation. Each act introduces new mechanics and escalates the project’s level of organization, blending fiction with infrastructure. Tokenomics The project establishes a fixed supply of 333 billion $PEDAN tokens , distributed as follows: 40% Presale 20% Community airdrop for raids, campaigns, and meme activities 20% Ecosystem vault to support loot rewards, NFTs, and partnerships 15% Liquidity pool , locked permanently to mitigate risk of withdrawal 5% Team allocation , subject to a 12-month cliff and gradual release over 24–36 months The project emphasizes that $PEDAN is not designed as a passive holding asset. Instead, it functions as the required entry point for staking, loot eligibility, NFT minting, and governance votes. Presale Structure PepeVandal presale is framed as a recruitment mechanism rather than a fundraising round. Key features include: 30 stages , each lasting three days or until sold out. Pricing begins at $0.0000102 per token in Stage 1. Each subsequent stage increases in price by 5% . Allocation is fixed at 40% of total supply. The team states there are no private sales, no early allocations, and no discounted rounds for venture capital firms. This approach is intended to create equal access for all participants. The staged increase in pricing creates urgency. Participants who wait for later stages face higher costs, while early entrants receive lower-priced allocations. Broader Implications PepeVandal combines elements familiar in the digital asset sector — staged presales, token distributions, staking dashboards, and NFT mechanics — with a narrative designed to differentiate it from other meme projects. Its success will depend on several factors: Whether it can maintain sustained community participation across multiple raids. Whether promised integrations with real-world assets are implemented. Whether its stance against private allocations increases trust in its distribution model. If successful, PepeVandal could demonstrate how narrative-driven design can enhance participation in decentralized ecosystems. If not, it may be seen as another experiment in meme culture that borrowed familiar tools without lasting results.",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|AIRDROP|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-11 00:00:00

According to the analyst, the ongoing shakeout pattern setup may be laying the foundation for another rally that could take Bitcoin above its all-time high and beyond $130,000. The Anatomy Of Bitcoin’s Shakeout Pattern Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours has been highlighted by intense volatility, opening the day just above $113,000 before dipping to $110,800 and quickly rebounding to now trading back above $112,000 at the time of writing. However, expanding the short-term price action into a longer one shows that Bitcoin is trying to break above a consolidation zone with a green weekly candle following a green close last week. Related Reading: Looking For A Good Bitcoin Entry? Crypto Research Firm Reveals The Best Time To Buy BTC Notably, technical analysis of the weekly candlestick timeframe chart from crypto analyst CrypFlow shows that this price action is part of a shakeout pattern that’s characteristic of Bitcoin. According to the analyst, Bitcoin never trends higher in a straight line. Instead, each expansion phase in its market cycle is preceded by two steps of a consolidation and a shakeout. Shakeouts were nothing more than quick downside wicks earlier in this cycle. More recently, however, the corrections have become deeper and longer with full-bodied weekly candlesticks that drove out many investors before the next expansion phase began. The chart below, which was shared by the analyst, shows this repeating pattern of shakeouts in purple circles and expansions in green boxes since the cycle bottom in 2022, with the latest dip in the last week of August slotting neatly into the same framework of a purple shakeout. Why Bitcoin Is Headed Above $130,000 As shown in the chart above, the most recent break below the consolidation box is somewhat shorter than the previous two. Now, Bitcoin is climbing back into its range, and if it follows its previous movements since 2022, it could now be at the cusp of a new uptrend. Related Reading: Fair Value Gap Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Going Higher, But Watch Out For This Crash At the time of writing, the stochastic RSI on the weekly chart has dipped to oversold levels and is on the verge of a bullish cross. If confirmed, this indicator could provide the momentum for Bitcoin’s next continuation of the step-like progression. In terms of a price prediction, the expansion phase highlighted in the analysis projects that Bitcoin may not only retest its current all-time high but also push into new price levels above $130,000. With Bitcoin currently trading around $112,200, reaching $130,000 would translate to a gain of roughly 15.8%. A surge to $130,000 would most likely lift Bitcoin’s support base closer to its current all-time high around $124,000 before the next consolidation and shakeout.

Despite short-term fluctuations, Ethereum (ETH) remains at the center of many bullish projections . The token has declined by 0.24% in the past week, yet analysts continue to expect long-term growth. Pseudonymous trader Whale Guru, known for tracking large-cap assets, argues that ETH could appreciate significantly during the next substantial market uptrend. According to his forecast, Ethereum could rally to $25,000. This figure matches the projection issued by Standard Chartered Bank, which estimated that ETH may achieve this price by 2028, likely in the course of the next bull cycle. Reaching $25,000 from current levels around $4,300 would require a 473% increase, a move that market participants view as possible given Ethereum’s strong ecosystem and role in decentralized finance. IN THE NEXT PUMP → ALTCOIN TARGETS $ETH → $25,000 $SOL → $2,000 $XRP → $300 $DOGE →$5 $SUI → $10 $HYPE → $400 $WLFI → $10 $PENGU → $10 WHAT ELSE AM I MISSING? — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) September 4, 2025 XRP Forecast at $300 In addition to Ethereum, Whale Guru has drawn attention to XRP, offering one of the most optimistic predictions for the asset. He suggests XRP could rise to $300 in the same rally. At present, XRP trades near $3 and has been attempting to establish firm support above this threshold. To reach the projected level, XRP would need to advance by roughly 9,900%. Such growth would also impact the XRP/ETH ratio. If Ethereum were to rise to $25,000 while XRP reached $300, the pair could climb from 0.00068 to approximately 0.012, marking a 1,664% increase. The implications for market capitalization would be profound. With a circulating supply of about 59.61 billion tokens, XRP at $300 would carry a market value of roughly $17.8 trillion, surpassing the combined worth of several leading global corporations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This figure makes the target challenging to achieve in the near term, though analysts at Changelly have also considered this possibility, estimating that XRP might reach $300 by 2040 under more gradual conditions. Broader Altcoin Projections Whale Guru did not limit his analysis to Ethereum and XRP. He also presented forecasts for other major altcoins. Solana (SOL), currently priced around $223 , is expected to potentially rise to $2,000, which would represent a 797% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE), a token long watched for its community-driven rallies, was projected to surpass $1 and eventually touch $5, marking a 1,937% increase from current prices. Sui (SUI), another asset highlighted in the forecast, was given a more conservative outlook. Trading near $3.58 at present, the token could see a rise to $10, which would amount to a 179% increase. While the targets presented by Whale Guru are bold, they reflect the optimism that resurfaces in the market as investors prepare for possible large-scale rallies. Whether these projections are realized in the current cycle or a future one, they underscore the high expectations surrounding Ethereum, XRP, and other leading altcoins.

The leading cryptocurrency has struggled to establish a clear direction, with buyers working to hold the price above the critical $110,000 level while sellers aggressively defend resistance near $113,000. This standoff has left BTC in a narrow range, fueling speculation over whether the next decisive move will be a breakout or a breakdown. Despite the choppy price action, key onchain data from Maartunn paints a more optimistic picture beneath the surface. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain strong and continue to improve, even as price volatility dominates short-term sentiment. Metrics tracking network activity and adoption suggest that the recent swings are more reflective of broader market dynamics—such as liquidity shifts and macroeconomic uncertainty—rather than Bitcoin losing momentum on its own. This divergence highlights the complexity of the current market phase: while the chart shows hesitation, the underlying network signals resilience and long-term growth. As bulls and bears wrestle for control at these levels, Bitcoin’s strengthening foundation could ultimately provide the catalyst for a more sustained move once external pressures ease. Bitcoin Difficulty And Mining Costs Signal Resilient Fundamentals According to Maartunn, Bitcoin’s network remains in remarkable health despite recent price uncertainty. One of the clearest signs of this strength is Bitcoin Difficulty , which continues to push new all-time highs. Difficulty adjusts every two weeks based on the level of mining activity, and consistent increases reflect that miners are dedicating more computational power to secure the network. This persistent climb underscores confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and highlights the resilience of its decentralized infrastructure, even as the market faces turbulence. Alongside this, the average cost of mining a single Bitcoin now stands at approximately $99,100. This figure is important, as it represents the breakeven level for many miners. With BTC currently trading just above $112,000, miners are still operating profitably, but the margin for comfort is narrowing. Should the price dip significantly below $100,000, miner capitulation risks could rise, potentially adding temporary selling pressure to the market. However, network fundamentals continue to suggest strength rather than weakness. The steady climb in Difficulty, combined with sustained miner commitment, indicates that participants are betting on higher prices ahead. Historically, periods where mining costs approach market value have preceded strong upward moves, as Bitcoin tends to rebound to maintain mining incentives. Looking ahead, the combination of rising Difficulty and resilient miner activity supports the case for Bitcoin extending its push higher in the coming months. While short-term volatility may keep traders on edge, the network’s health signals that the foundation for a more sustained uptrend is firmly in place. This dynamic highlights why on-chain fundamentals remain one of the most reliable indicators of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, even when price action appears uncertain. Short-Term Price Consolidation Bitcoin is currently trading near $112,311 after a period of choppy consolidation, as shown in the 4-hour chart. The price has been struggling to gain momentum, oscillating between support around $110,000 and resistance near $114,000. The 50 SMA ($111,272) and 100 SMA ($110,773) are acting as immediate dynamic supports, while the 200 SMA at $113,860 continues to cap upside moves, reinforcing the short-term bearish bias. The chart highlights that BTC remains in a compressed range after its recent decline from local highs above $123,000. Bulls have managed to defend the $110,000 zone multiple times, signaling strong demand at lower levels, yet momentum has not been sufficient to break through key resistance. For a bullish reversal, BTC needs to reclaim and consolidate above the 200 SMA, which would pave the way toward $116,000 and eventually the major resistance at $123,217. A clean break below $110,000 could trigger a sharper correction, exposing $108,000 and possibly lower supports. Overall, the short-term outlook remains neutral to cautious: Bitcoin is holding ground, but until it breaks above the 200 SMA, the risk of continued sideways or downward action persists.

The move comes amid a softer macroeconomic backdrop following the unexpected decline in U.S. producer prices in August. The core Producer Price Index (PPI), which excludes food and energy, dropped 0.1% month-over-month—far below forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Annual core inflation eased to 2.8% from July’s revised 3.4%. For Bitcoin, the weaker wholesale inflation data is fueling hopes of a more accommodative Federal Reserve, while traders keep one eye on the charts for confirmation of a breakout. PPI Surprise and Market Reaction The August PPI release was the first decline in four months, surprising economists who had expected another increase. Headline PPI fell 0.1% month-over-month, compared to July’s upwardly revised 0.7%. On a yearly basis, wholesale inflation cooled to 2.6% from 3.1%. The details underscore the slowdown. Final demand prices for services dropped 0.2% after climbing 0.7% in July, while goods prices edged up only 0.1% compared to last month’s 0.6%. The core PPI for finished goods held at 2.8%, its highest level since late 2023. The softer data eases pressure on the Fed, with markets now leaning toward a more dovish stance in September. For risk assets like Bitcoin, that backdrop is supportive, particularly as inflationary shocks fade. Key points from the PPI release: Headline PPI fell 0.1% in August vs. +0.3% expected Annual PPI slowed to 2.6% from 3.1% in July Core PPI slipped to 2.8%, its lowest since early 2024 Regulatory and Global Shifts Macro data wasn’t the only driver this week. In the U.S., Cboe announced it will launch 10-year Bitcoin and Ethereum futures pending approval. Known as “continuous futures,” these products mimic perpetual swaps commonly found in offshore markets, but are subject to U.S. regulatory oversight. They’ll allow institutions to maintain long-dated exposure without constant rollovers, a structural change likely to boost participation.

All are tailwinds for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin On the charts, Bitcoin is consolidating just beneath a breakout level at $113,800. The two-hour chart displays an ascending triangle pattern, characterized by higher lows that press against flat resistance. The 50-period SMA at $111,896 is trending upward, while the 200-period SMA at $112,738 sits directly below price action, reinforcing support. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The Relative Strength Index holds near 64, reflecting strong but not overheated momentum. Back-to-back bullish candlesticks further confirm buyers remain in control. If Bitcoin can close above $113,800, the path on TradingView projects upside toward $115,400, then $117,150, and $118,617. A sustained breakout could lift BTC toward $125,000 in the medium term. Failure to hold above $112,000 would weaken the bullish case, with risks of a slide back to $111,000, $110,000, and $108,450. Bearish candlestick sequences like an engulfing pattern or three black crows at resistance would confirm such a reversal. Bitcoin is consolidating just under $113.8K resistance within an ascending triangle. A breakout could target $115.4K–$117.1K, while failure risks $112K–$110K support. — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 11, 2025 For traders, the setup is clear: longs are favored on confirmation above $113,800 with stops under $111,000, targeting $117K to $125K. With macro data softening, institutional products expanding, and adoption broadening globally, Bitcoin’s current triangle may be less about short-term noise and more about laying the groundwork for its next major rally. If momentum aligns with these structural shifts, BTC’s march toward $130,000 could come sooner than many expect.

Crypto enthusiasts, the market is buzzing with a significant shift! The Altcoin Season Index has just climbed to 62, marking a notable six-point increase. This jump is more than just a number; it’s a strong indicator that alternative cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum against Bitcoin, potentially heralding the exciting prospect of an Altcoin Season . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric provided by CoinMarketCap, offers a snapshot of the cryptocurrency market’s current sentiment. It meticulously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. These coins are then measured against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. An Altcoin Season is officially declared when a substantial 75% of these top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day period. Conversely, if Bitcoin dominates, we are in a “Bitcoin Season.” A reading closer to 100 strongly suggests that an Altcoin Season is in full swing, indicating broad-based strength across the altcoin market. The recent rise to 62 means we are significantly closer to that 75% threshold. This shift indicates a growing appetite among investors for assets beyond Bitcoin, suggesting a potential rotation of capital into altcoins. Is an Altcoin Season Truly on the Horizon? While the index at 62 isn’t the definitive 75% mark for a full-blown Altcoin Season , it’s a powerful signal. This upward movement suggests that a substantial number of altcoins are already showing stronger performance relative to Bitcoin. Several factors could contribute to this trend: Bitcoin Dominance Shifting: Often, after a period of strong Bitcoin rallies, investors look for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Innovation and Development: Many altcoin projects, especially in sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions, continue to build and release new features, attracting investor interest. Market Sentiment: General positive sentiment in the broader crypto market can encourage speculative investments in altcoins. This period often brings renewed focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Investors often seek out these opportunities, hoping to capitalize on potential parabolic gains. Navigating a Potential Altcoin Season: What Should You Consider? For investors, a rising Altcoin Season Index presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding how to approach this period is crucial for portfolio health. Benefits of an Altcoin Season: High Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can experience significant percentage gains in a short period. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can spread risk and potentially capture growth from different sectors of the crypto market. Innovation Exposure: Participating in altcoins means engaging with the cutting-edge of blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, meaning prices can fluctuate wildly. Research Intensive: Identifying promising altcoins requires extensive research into their technology, team, use case, and community. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio As the market signals a potential shift towards altcoins, here are some practical steps to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any altcoin, thoroughly investigate its whitepaper, development roadmap, team, and community. Understand its value proposition. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your capital into one altcoin, spread your investments across several promising projects in different sectors. Implement Risk Management: Use strategies like setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact the crypto space. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Don’t blindly chase rapidly rising altcoins. Often, the biggest gains are made by those who invest before the hype. The increase in the Altcoin Season Index to 62 is a clear signal that the cryptocurrency landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving. While it doesn’t guarantee a full-blown altcoin bull run, it certainly indicates a period where altcoins are showing significant strength relative to Bitcoin. This makes it an opportune time for informed and strategic decision-making. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping altcoins price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of the Altcoin Season Index reaching 62? A1: A reading of 62 indicates that a significant number of altcoins (62% of the top 100, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. While not yet the 75% threshold for an official Altcoin Season, it suggests a strong shift in market momentum towards altcoins. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: It’s calculated by CoinMarketCap, comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin determines the index score. Q3: Does a high Altcoin Season Index guarantee an altcoin bull run? A3: No, it’s an indicator, not a guarantee. A high index suggests favorable conditions for altcoins and increased investor interest, but market dynamics can change rapidly. It’s crucial to combine this insight with thorough research and risk management. Q4: What types of altcoins typically perform well during an Altcoin Season? A4: Performance varies, but often projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technology (e.g., DeFi, Layer 2, gaming), active development, and growing communities tend to see significant gains. However, speculative smaller-cap altcoins can also experience rapid, albeit risky, pumps. Q5: What should investors do if they believe an Altcoin Season is approaching? A5: Investors should focus on diligent research (DYOR), diversify their portfolios across various promising altcoins, implement strict risk management strategies, and avoid emotional trading decisions like FOMO.

BitMine Absorbs 319,000 ETH In A Week",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-supply-shock/,"BitMine Immersion has reportedly accumulated a staggering 319,000 ETH in just a single week. The massive purchase, worth over a billion dollars, underscores growing conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value among institutions and big players, tightening market liquidity. Could This Trigger An Ethereum Supply Crunch? In a move that highlights the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum, Paul Barron has mentioned on X that BitMine Immersion has just absorbed 319,000 ETH in a single week, which is equivalent to 0.26% of Ethereum’s total supply removed from circulation. Related Reading: BitMine’s Ethereum Treasury Hits New Milestone With 2 Million ETH Holdings Barron extrapolates this acquisition velocity, calculating that at the same rate, BitMine could demand an additional 4.1 million ETH in the 13 weeks remaining in 2025. This demand would be hitting a market where the current liquid supply on exchanges is only around 11 million ETH. He concludes that if just three to four more institutions adopt the Bitmine playbook, the combined demand would cause the market to face a supply crisis that is more severe than in 2021. However, a removal of 319,000 ETH and a staking lockup from the liquid market suggests that deflationary pressure is accelerating. According to Barron, smart money is positioning now. He predicts that while retail investors will only begin to chase ETH at levels above $8,000, Ethereum could reach $15,000 by December, which is “mathematical inevitability” if this institutional FOMO continues to spread. ETH Supply Locked In Staking Reaches Record Levels While a prominent figure is accumulating ETH every week, Ethereum is on the verge of a supply shock, despite appearing bearish on-chain two weeks ago. However, at the end of August, Bull Theory revealed that the on-chain data showed a spike in the validator exit queue to nearly 1 million ETH, the highest in months. Related Reading: Institutional Flows Push Ethereum into Spotlight: Analysts Eye $6K to $12K Targets Ahead The development may signal fear and potential selling pressure, but the narrative has now flipped. Presently, the validator entry queue has climbed back to 787,085 ETH in a 14-day wait to stake, indicating a strong return of confidence and growing demand to stake. Meanwhile, the validator exit queue has dropped sharply to 616,898 ETH in a 10-day wait, a clear sign that its previous peak is fading fast to nearly 1 million ETH. This shift shows that fewer validators are leaving the network, and the pressure from unstaking is diminishing fast. Ethereum has over 1.05 million active validators, with 35.6 million ETH staked, which is equivalent to 29.4% of the total supply, and a steady APR of 2.89%. According to Bull Theory, this is exactly how a supply squeeze unfolds: it starts slowly at first, then all at once, as liquidity tightens and more ETH is locked away.
