51518301,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804256,1757542980,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51518301.jpeg,Solana Price Today; XRP Latest News & Here Are What Analysts Predict To Rise 30x By December,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-today-xrp-latest-news-here-are-what-analysts-predict-to-rise-30x-by-december/,"Recently, Solana and XRP action has been at center stage as both tokens recorded respectable gains this week. Solana sits above after a 1.75% daily increase, while XRP is picking up steam with a 2.34% increase. But beyond these headline figures, mounting interest is being redirected toward start up projects like Remittix (RTX) , currently worth $0.1050 per token, as investors hunt for the next altcoin star of 2025. XRP, Solana and Pepe Record Daily Gains in Trades XRP reached $3.00 with a market cap of $179.41 billion in the most recent session, supported by a 15.09% increase in volume. Solana climbed to $217.27, recording a market cap of $117.77 billion with a 23.91% increase in volume. Pepe also joined the rally, climbing 5.13% to $0.00001033 with trading volume gaining nearly 80%. While such blue-chip tokens still dominate, investor attention has shifted to upcoming crypto initiatives that are accompanied by real-world applications. Among those, Remittix is not just highlighted for presale popularity but also for the soon-to-be-released Q3 2025 beta wallet. Remittix Presale Achievements and Exchange Listings Remittix (RTX) has emerged as one of the best crypto presale projects of the year within a brief period, with over $24.7 million raised and in excess of 653 million tokens sold to date. Its early success secured two centralized exchange listings — BitMart at the $20 million mark and LBank at $22 million — leveraging liquidity and exposure that most low cap crypto jewels never receive this early. At just $0.1050 per token, RTX is also one of the top crypto under $1 worth watching. The project aims to solve real-world problems in cross-border payments by enabling direct transfers of crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries with minimal gas fees and instant conversion. Such practical design earns it the status of a crypto with real-world utility, as opposed to most speculative projects. Beta Wallet Launch Causes Excitement The most anticipated release is the Remittix beta wallet, coming out September 15th. This wallet will support more than 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies, bridging the gap between ease of use on a decentralized exchange and regular financial needs. Main features are: Real-time FX conversion with open rates Global bank account transfers within seconds Support for freelancers, businesses, and remitters Community Engagement and Giveaway Another reason for RTX’s growth is community support. The current $250,000 Remittix giveaway has maintained high interest, rewarding early birds while promoting exposure throughout crypto communities. Coupled with presale benchmarks, future listings, and wallet integration, such activities solidify RTX as a contender for the fastest growing crypto in 2025. While Solana and XRP remain the talking point of trading in the crypto space, Remittix is quietly establishing itself on a foundation to become a cross-chain DeFi project that addresses actual payment issues and it is predicted to give up to 30x gains by December.

While price action is largely sideways, many top cryptocurrencies appear to have found a solid bottom over the past week – setting the stage for potential breakout moves. In this article, we analyze three major altcoins – XRP, PI, and DOGE – along with a fast-rising low-cap contender that could deliver outsized gains if momentum continues. With a possible Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, these tokens may be poised for substantial gains in the coming days , as bullish sentiment continues to build. Crypto Price Prediction Today 10 September – XRP, Pi Coin, Dogecoin XRP ($XRP): Altcoin Ready to Lead End-of-Year Bull Rally XRP has suffered a 1% decline in the past 24 hours, while its current price of $2.97 also marks a 10% decline in the past month. Recent weeks haven’t been great for XRP (or the rest of the market), but there’s every reason to believe that the alt will lead any market-wide rebound and bull rally. Not only is it up by 450% in the past year, but its fundamentals have only strengthened in the past couple of months, given Ripple’s expansion and the prospect of XRP ETFs. The firm has made important acquisitions and signed new partnerships , and the upshot is that demand for XRP will only increase over time. As we’ve noted before, its chart highlights how it has moved into a very promising position, with its indicators turning bullish after more than a month of bearishness. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) has recently climbed above 50, while its MACD (orange, blue) is about to turn positive, signalling that buyers are returning to its market. Given such moves, we could see the XRP price rise back to $3.50 as soon as the end of this month, while it may top $5 by the end of 2025. Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Altcoin Continues to Slide Despite Efforts to Boost Ecosystem The prize for the most disappointing altcoin of the year may end up going to Pi Network, which has suffered a consistent decline since peaking at $2.99 in February. It’s now languishing at a price of $0.3432, representing a 1% drop in 24 hours, 15% drop in a month, and an 88% decline since the aforementioned ATH. These aren’t inspiring figures, and what’s particularly concerning is that PI continues to fall despite efforts from its team to boost its utility and appeal. This includes the launch of the Pi App Studio in July, as well as of a development fund worth $100 million , both of which have failed to set the market alight. And today, we see that PI remains in a severely oversold position, one which it shows few signs of escaping. If the FOMC does cut rates next week, the resulting market-wide rally could help kickstart PI’s year, potentially sending it back towards $1 . However, because of its recent struggles to gain new listings, and because of industry suspicion surrounding PI , it’s just as possible that it falls further. In that case, the crypto price prediction for PI sees it dropping to $0.30 in the next few weeks, and $0.20 by the end of Q4. Crypto Price Prediction: Dogecoin ($DOGE) – ETF Hopes Give Veteran Meme Coin Strong Prospects Despite suffering a slight dip today, Dogecoin’s current price of $0.2405 marks an 11% increase in a week and 3.5% gain in the past month. The meme token has also risen by 130% in the past year, giving it the kind of momentum that will help carry it strongly into any end-of-year bull rally. While there hasn’t recently been any bullish news as far as Dogecoin’s fundamentals go, the token continues to command a considerable community of supporters, who have helped prop up its price in recent weeks. On top of this, there is a good chance that we could see Dogecoin ETFs in the next few months, with Bloomberg analysts giving 3 DOGE ETFs a 90% chance of approval . This is hugely encouraging for the coin, which is moving into an increasingly bullish position, as we see from its chart below. Source: TradingView It has broken out of a bullish pennant in recent days, while its RSI and MACD have turned positive, indicating an increase in buying pressure. Yet the coin is still a long way from being overbought, which means that it can still rise further before suffering a correction. It could reach $0.30 by the end of September, before climbing towards $0.70 by the New Year. Bitcoin Hyper: Bullish Layer-Two Network Raises $14.4 Million in Presale The tokens above could do very well in the event of a rate cut next week, but they won’t be the only coins posting big returns as we enter the final stages of the year. There are also several presale coins preparing to launch very soon, and one of the most exciting is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a layer-two project that has now raised an impressive $14.4 million in its presale. Climb on the $HYPER rocket. The APY is out of this world! pic.twitter.com/U5IH8lcHxR — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 10, 2025 This is a hugely encouraging figure, and the reason for Bitcoin Hyper’s early success is that it will be the first fully fledged layer-two network for Bitcoin. By integrating with Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, Bitcoin Hyper will bring scalability and programmability to the Bitcoin ecosystem, while also cutting down on transaction fees. Users can deposit their Bitcoin with Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contract, which will then provide an equivalent amount of HYPER for use on its L2 platform. The aim is for Bitcoin Hyper to become an important hub for DeFi, something which will enable Bitcoin holders to tap into BTC’s value and make considerable profits. And as the platform’s native token, HYPER is likely to attract big demand, with the coin also available for staking. You can buy the token now as part of the presale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website , where HYPER currently costs $0.012885 This will rise later today, so investors should move now if they want to lock in the biggest possible gains.

This next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin is in presale, offering early entry at $0.0055 per $LBRETT. With an initial staking APY of 812% and a $1 million giveaway, analysts predict Layer Brett could be the next big crypto, poised for explosive bull run gains. Layer Brett is the best presale crypto for the future Layer Brett emerges as the best crypto to buy now, fusing meme appeal with utility. This innovative Layer 2 blockchain surpasses traditional memecoins, boasting 10,000 TPS and ultra-low $0.0001 gas fees. These metrics position $LBRETT as a top-performing crypto, meeting market demand for efficient and scalable solutions. Built on Ethereum, Layer Brett ensures superior scalability and reduced costs, unlike older chains like Sol and PI. Its utility and community energy solidify its status as the next 100x altcoin in the DeFi space. Layer Brett is a groundbreaking Layer 2 crypto project on Ethereum, fusing meme culture with essential blockchain utility, making it a strong contender for the best crypto to buy now. Unlike tokens stuck on slow chains or with zero intrinsic value, Layer Brett operates differently. It’s a fast, scalable, community-powered ecosystem designed to disrupt the meme token landscape. Functioning as an ERC-20 token on its Layer 2 blockchain, Layer Brett liberates users from high gas fees and Ethereum Layer 1’s slowness. How does Layer Brett work? Layer Brett distinguishes itself with unique features prioritizing user rewards and efficiency. Early buyers gain access to substantial staking benefits, with an initial 812% APY via the dApp. This high-yield staking crypto is a cornerstone of its evolving ecosystem, which also includes token rewards and future Layer 2 functionality. Users connect their wallet, select ETH, USDT, or BNB, then buy $LBRETT and immediately start staking. This seamless process, enhanced by Layer 2 scaling, ensures Layer Brett is the best crypto to invest in. Sol and PI price prediction in the current bull cycle Price predictions for market alternatives like Sol and Pi are inherently volatile and unpredictable, swayed mainly by social media rather than technological merit. These tokens often experience rapid price increases followed by steep corrections, making them risky for long-term investors. Without robust utility, a market alternative struggles to sustain value after initial hype, starkly contrasting Layer Brett’s focus on ecosystem growth, making Layer Brett the best crypto to buy now for stability. Layer Brett is the next 100x meme coin With its robust Layer 2 framework, high-speed transactions, and attractive staking rewards, Layer Brett is strongly positioned for significant price appreciation. The ongoing presale offers an early entry for what many consider the best crypto to buy now, projecting exponential growth in the upcoming crypto bull run of 2025. Given its 10 billion token supply and utility focus, $LBRETT is poised to become a top meme coin and potentially a next 100x meme coin. This makes Layer Brett the best long-term crypto to consider. Layer Brett isn’t just a trending cryptocurrency; it signifies a paradigm shift in the meme coin space, combining viral appeal with genuine blockchain innovation. Its presale offers a unique opportunity to acquire $LBRETT early, stake tokens for an initial 812% APY, and participate in a $1 million giveaway. Layer Brett’s smaller market cap and Layer 2 utility promise greater growth potential, establishing it as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Don’t miss this chance to invest; the presale won’t last forever.

51519035,https://cryptonews.com/?p=421716,1757544615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51519035.jpeg,GOP Crypto Bill Faces Setback as Senator Warns “We’re Not Ready”,https://cryptonews.com/news/gop-crypto-bill-faces-setback-as-senator-warns-were-not-ready/,"Senate Republicans are facing fresh internal divisions over digital asset legislation, with a senior member of the Banking Committee signaling that efforts to advance a landmark cryptocurrency market structure bill could stall this month. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said on Wednesday that he does not believe the committee is prepared to move forward, casting doubt over Chairman Tim Scott’s pledge to mark up the bill before the end of September. “I don’t think we’re ready,” Kennedy told reporters. “People that I talk to still have a lot of questions. I know I still have a lot of questions.” His comments represent the clearest sign yet of resistance inside GOP ranks. Kennedy previously expressed concern that the bill, which would divide oversight of digital assets between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), could give the crypto industry too much sway over the legislative process. His warning sets him at odds with Scott and other Republicans who have made completing a market structure bill a top priority. Kennedy Pushback Threatens Scott’s September Deadline for Digital Asset Legislation A spokesperson for Scott emphasized that Banking Committee Republicans believe advancing a bipartisan framework is “long overdue.” Jeff Naft, speaking on behalf of Scott, said lawmakers have been working since June toward a September markup, citing thousands of pages of feedback and consultations with roughly 160 stakeholders. “The House has already acted, and the Senate should not fall behind,” Naft said. The House passed its own version of the legislation, known as the CLARITY Act, in July. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans introduced the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, creating new rules for stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar. But Kennedy dismissed that earlier measure as only a “baby step” compared to the broader market structure overhaul now on the table. “This is a full leap,” he said. “And we’ve got to get it right.” The split within GOP ranks threatens to derail Scott’s self-imposed September 30 deadline . The South Carolina senator, who serves as ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, has spent months positioning his caucus to move forward. https://t.co/Py35Wl6na4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 27, 2025 In June, Scott and colleagues, including Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), released a set of principles outlining how they want digital assets regulated . The framework called for clear distinctions between securities and commodities , a shared oversight model between the SEC and CFTC, and anti-money laundering provisions designed to be “pro-innovation.” The principles also encouraged regulators to employ tools such as safe harbors and no-action letters to engage with crypto projects. Lummis, who chairs the Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee, warned at the time that the U.S. risked falling behind global peers such as the European Union and Singapore if it did not act quickly. Scott doubled down on the urgency later that month, setting a firm September 30 deadline for completing market structure legislation. Appearing at a Capitol Hill event alongside Lummis and White House adviser Bo Hines, Scott said finalizing the bill by that date was “a realistic expectation.” Hines echoed the commitment in a June 26 social media post, stating, “We are committed to getting market structure done by the end of September. Period.” Crypto industry leaders rallied behind the timetable. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called it “a clear path forward,” while Andreessen Horowitz government affairs head Colin McCune said comprehensive rules have been “sorely needed for years.” The industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying in Washington in hopes of securing long-awaited regulatory clarity. Still, skepticism is not confined to Kennedy. Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.), a Democrat on the Banking panel, said there is “still a lot more work to be done” and warned that marking up the bill this month would be “a mistake.” Democrats who have shown openness to the legislation have likewise urged Republicans to slow the process. The legislation under debate would represent the most sweeping attempt yet to regulate the $2 trillion digital asset market, setting new rules of the road for trading platforms and asset issuers. Its fate could determine how quickly the United States catches up to other jurisdictions with established frameworks. Momentum for CLARITY Act Fades as Democrats Push Rival Crypto Bill Momentum behind the Republican-led CLARITY Act is showing signs of strain despite earlier optimism that bipartisan support could carry it through Congress this year. Senator Tim Scott predicted that 12 out of 18 Democrats may back the CLARITY Act in an appearance on Tuesday. #TimScott #CLARITYAct https://t.co/Z2tBFEDFe7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 At the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in August , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott predicted that 12 of 18 Senate Democrats might ultimately back the legislation. He argued that growing bipartisan interest in setting rules for digital assets could offset resistance from figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been outspoken against loosening oversight. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a co-sponsor of the draft framework, went further, setting a Thanksgiving deadline for passage and promising the measure would reach the president’s desk before year-end. Lummis said the proposal would clarify how securities and commodities laws apply to digital assets, modernize regulatory frameworks, and provide stronger consumer protections. Senator Cynthia Lummis is looking to have digital asset market structure legislation completed before the end of 2025. #CynthiaLummis #cryptolegislation https://t.co/brkZvGtCgH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 21, 2025 Yet resistance within the Democratic Party has hardened in recent weeks. On September 9, a group of 12 Democratic senators unveiled their own crypto regulation framework , the first coordinated stance by the party this year. Their proposal emphasized tighter disclosure standards, mandatory registration of crypto platforms with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and strengthened oversight by both the SEC and CFTC. Notably, it also included provisions designed to limit political conflicts of interest by blocking elected officials and their families from profiting from digital assets. Source: Polymarket That release has altered expectations around the bill’s future. On prediction platform Polymarket, bettors now assign just a 32% chance that the CLARITY Act will be signed into law in 2025, down sharply from nearly 90% in July.

Solana Perp Open Interest Has Spiked Recently As pointed out by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the Solana Open Interest has climbed up as the SOL price has continued to outperform the market recently. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of perpetual futures positions related to SOL that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. The metric takes into account for both short and long contracts. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Solana perpetual futures Open Interest over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Open Interest has observed an increase alongside the asset’s push above the $200 mark and has crossed the $7 billion milestone. “Market participation is clearly expanding,” notes the analytics firm. Historically, speculative activity going up in the sector hasn’t been anything unusual during price rallies, as investors tend to find such periods to be exciting, so they become more prone to making moves. An excessive surge in the Open Interest, however, is something that can be worth monitoring. This is because new positions generally imply an increase in leverage for the sector, which is something that can make mass liquidation events more likely to take place. Given that the Solana perpetual futures Open Interest has shot up recently, it’s possible that the price could face instability owing to potential liquidation squeezes. Which way the resulting volatility might take the cryptocurrency in comes down to which side of the market is more dominant. A metric that can be useful for gauging that is the Funding Rate . This indicator measures the amount of periodic fees that perpetual futures users are exchanging with each other right now. When the Funding Rate is positive, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. On the other hand, the metric being below zero suggests bearish bets are more dominant. As the chart below shows, the Solana Funding Rate has been positive recently, indicating that the investors have been betting on a bullish outcome. This could imply that a squeeze may be more probable to affect the long side. Interestingly, though, the Funding Rate hasn’t seen any increase alongside the surge in the Open Interest, a sign that new short and long positions have come in equal parts. “This suggests the build-up is not excessively leveraged, leaving scope for further upside if momentum persists,” explains Glassnode. SOL Price Solana has pulled away from the rest of the sector during the past week with a surge of almost 7% that has taken its price to $224.",Solana|SOL|solana|Solana Funding Rate|Solana Open Interest|Solana Perp Open Interest|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-10 23:00:04

Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market The transaction, recorded on Ledger #98,741,614, carried a negligible fee of 0.000015 XRP, showcasing the network’s efficiency. While Ripple has not provided an official statement, analysts suggest the move could be tied to liquidity preparation for exchanges, settlement mechanisms, or the expansion of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors. The timing, so close to its courtroom victory, has fueled speculation that Ripple is positioning itself for a new phase of institutional adoption. Whales Watch Closely as XRP Price Slips Despite the optimism around Ripple’s legal clarity, XRP has not been immune to market pressure. Currently, XRP trades at $2.96, down 1.67% in the past 24 hours, with daily trading volume falling over 26% to $4.94 billion. Analysts warn that this decline in both price and volume could signal waning short-term momentum. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Chart data highlights a critical battleground for XRP between $0.65–$0.68 resistance levels and support zones at $0.60 and $0.55. A decisive breakout above $0.70 could push XRP toward $0.80, while failure to hold support risks deeper corrections. Notably, whale activity and institutional interest continue to build, with XRP futures open interest surging to $7.94 billion, underscoring expectations of heightened volatility. ETFs, RLUSD, and the Bigger Picture Crypto analyst Zach Rector recently highlighted that Ripple’s restructuring of institutional XRP sales during its SEC case could shape the framework for potential XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With ETF issuers unable to source XRP directly from Ripple, centralized exchanges and OTC desks may become the main supply channels, creating added pressure on secondary market liquidity. Meanwhile, the adoption of Ripple USD (RLUSD) in Japan, facilitated through a partnership with SBI Group, has strengthened XRP’s fundamentals. RLUSD requires XRP for transaction fees, further boosting on-chain demand. Whale accumulation and growing institutional exposure through platforms like the CME also support a more bullish long-term outlook.

Resistance at $3.05 remains the key breakout test. By Jainam Mehta ​XRP ( XRP-USD ) is regaining traction after weeks of pressure, trading just under $3.00 while testing a descending trendline that has capped its rallies since late July. The move comes as on-chain data shows renewed exchange inflows, suggesting traders are positioning for a decisive breakout attempt. On the 4-hour chart, XRP has rebounded strongly from the $2.75 zone, reclaiming all major exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200 EMA). These averages now converge between $2.90 and $2.94, creating a critical support cluster for maintaining bullish momentum. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The immediate hurdle is the $3.00–$3.05 region, which aligns with the descending trendline and a dense supply zone. A successful breakout above this level would mark a reversal of the medium-term downtrend, opening the path to $3.15 and $3.30. Failure to clear resistance could bring sellers back into play, pushing price toward $2.90 or even $2.75. Exchange flows signal renewed appetite On-chain data highlights the importance of this juncture. Coinglass reported $21.62 million in net spot inflows on September 10, a notable shift from the steady outflows that dominated August. These inflows suggest speculative positioning around the $3 threshold, with traders preparing for either an upside extension or a rejection-driven pullback. Momentum indicators are cautiously supportive. The RSI has improved to 59, showing strengthening momentum without signaling overbought conditions. Meanwhile, higher lows since early September reinforce the view that buyers are steadily building demand ahead of a potential breakout. Outlook hinges on resistance test In the near term, XRP’s ability to hold above the $2.90 EMA cluster will be crucial. Consolidation above this zone could provide the springboard for a break through $3.05, a move that would likely shift sentiment decisively bullish. Conversely, losing the cluster risks reigniting bearish pressure and undermining the recovery effort. The $3.00–$3.05 level remains the battleground. Traders will be watching whether inflows continue and volume expands, as these would confirm that the recovery is more than a speculative bounce. As noted in earlier coverage , XRP has often struggled with sustaining rallies when institutional momentum fades. With the BBVA custody deal recently strengthening the token’s European footprint, investors now want to see if technical resilience aligns with growing utility demand.

Quintenz shared a series of text messages he said he'd exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini — which is set to go public this week — and Winklevoss Capital. Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler's twin brother and co-founder, may have also been in the group chat, which was titled ""tw-cw-bq"" but did not send any messages in the screenshots shared by Quintenz. In the chat, dated July 24, Tyler Winklevoss asked Quintenz if he'd seen a post on X from June 17 where Tyler announced Gemini had filed a complaint with the CFTC's inspector general about Division of Enforcement attorneys who had pursued charges against Gemini. ""I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,"" Quintenz said in his posts, representing a highly unusual move for a nominee in the midst of a federal confirmation process. ""It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts."" Before the Senate left Washington for its August break, Quintenz's nomination was set for what was thought to be an easy procedural step in the Senate Agriculture Committee to advance it to the floor for his final confirmation vote. But the White House halted that vote for reasons it didn't make clear at the time, though Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss had been waging a rhetorical campaign to stop his confirmation. Winklevoss told CoinDesk in an interview in July that he'd been making the case that Quintenz was a bad choice because of the former commissioner's wish to increase the CFTC budget to oversee the crypto industry, his past views on the legal liability for crypto developers and what Winklevoss characterized as Quintenz's improper attempts to influence the CFTC on behalf of prediction market firm Kalshi. Read more: Gemini's Tyler Winklevoss Says Trump CFTC Pick Quintenz Has 'Disqualifying' Views Quintenz's post on Wednesday suggested that, in his view, Winklevoss was upset that Quintenz did not join in criticism of CFTC's enforcement efforts after the agency pursued charges against Gemini that were settled in January . ""I know we had spoken about this in the winter where I recalled my original extreme disappointment at [the Enforcement Division] for pursuing this so aggressively,"" a text from Quintenz said. ""I commit to you to having a fair and reasonable review of the matter and the division and individuals involved to determine if they acted inappropriately."" He went on to say that a ""fully confirmed chair"" should be the person to handle the matter, but that if someone currently employed by the CFTC was ""communicating with"" the Winklevosses, he would have to ""give that careful thought."" Winklevoss asked if Quintenz was saying that Gemini should have waited to file their complaint until after the Senate confirmed the former commissioner, to which Quintenz replied that ""any decision or response to your complaint should be made by and given the full weight of the confirmed chair."" The crypto executive said they had spoken about the CFTC's enforcement effort against Gemini after Quintenz asked for the Winklevoss brothers' endorsement in December. ""Cultural reform, which includes rectifying what happened to us, should be the highest priority,"" Winklevoss said. ""I'd like to understand your thoughts on this and how you plan to align with President Trump and the administration's mandate to end the lawfare and make amends for it."" He added that he would ""be happy to raise the issue with the president himself"" if Quintenz thought he was being undermined by current CFTC employees. Quintenz, Winklevoss and a spokesperson for Gemini did not immediately return requests for comment. CoinDesk could not independently verify the texts' authenticity. In July, a coalition that represented the vast majority of the crypto industry came out to press President Donald Trump to move forward to get Quintenz confirmed, calling him the ""right person at the right time"" to run the CFTC. Though the Senate has been back from break for a while and has returned to its confirmation work for many of Trump's appointees, the committee hasn't yet scheduled a follow-up vote for Quintenz Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has been pressing forward on an industry-friendly ""Project Crypto"" initiative while the temporary chief at the CFTC, Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has been standing in at the sister agency with a similar ""crypto sprint.""

A significant development has emerged with CFTC nominee Quintenz , Brian Quintenz, who is vying for the top spot as chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He has leveled serious accusations against the prominent Gemini co-founders, the Winklevoss brothers, alleging they attempted to derail his confirmation process. What Sparked the Allegations Against CFTC Nominee Quintenz? According to reports from Cointelegraph, Quintenz publicly released text messages on X, detailing the alleged obstruction. These messages reportedly show the Winklevoss brothers expressing deep dissatisfaction with an ongoing civil lawsuit between their company, Gemini, and the CFTC. Their concerns weren’t just about the lawsuit; they reportedly demanded assurances from Quintenz. Specifically, they sought a guarantee that the regulatory agency would not impose what they considered excessive regulations on Gemini. Quintenz, however, claims he firmly refused these demands. This exchange set the stage for a dramatic escalation. Quintenz believes that following his refusal, the Winklevoss brothers then contacted then-President Donald Trump. Their alleged objective? To request that Quintenz’s confirmation be put on hold, directly impacting the future of CFTC nominee Quintenz . How Did This Alleged Obstruction Unfold for CFTC Nominee Quintenz? The timeline of events further underscores the seriousness of these claims. In July, the Senate Agriculture Committee had initially scheduled a confirmation vote for Brian Quintenz. This vote, a crucial step for any CFTC nominee Quintenz , was unexpectedly postponed. The Core Demand: The Winklevoss brothers allegedly sought assurances regarding future regulatory actions on Gemini, especially concerning the civil lawsuit. Quintenz’s Stance: He maintained an independent position, refusing to provide such guarantees. Presidential Intervention Claimed: Quintenz alleges the brothers then reached out to President Trump to halt his confirmation. Confirmation Delay: The Senate vote was indeed postponed at the White House’s request, lending weight to Quintenz’s account. This sequence of events paints a picture of intense lobbying and alleged political maneuvering within the crypto space, directly targeting a key regulatory appointment. Such actions, if proven, could raise significant questions about the integrity of regulatory processes and industry influence. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation and CFTC Nominee Quintenz? This incident, involving a prominent CFTC nominee Quintenz and influential crypto figures, highlights the ongoing tension between the rapidly evolving digital asset industry and the regulatory bodies tasked with overseeing it. It underscores the challenges regulators face in maintaining independence while navigating powerful industry interests. For the broader cryptocurrency market, such disputes can create uncertainty. Investors and market participants often look for clear, consistent regulatory frameworks. Allegations of obstruction, especially involving a high-profile confirmation, can complicate these efforts and potentially delay important policy decisions. Moreover, this situation brings into focus the critical role of the CFTC in shaping the future of crypto derivatives and other digital assets. The integrity of its leadership, represented by figures like CFTC nominee Quintenz , is paramount for maintaining market confidence and ensuring fair practices. The outcome of these allegations and Quintenz’s confirmation process will be closely watched. It could set a precedent for how future interactions between crypto industry leaders and government regulators are perceived and handled. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Regulation The allegations by CFTC nominee Quintenz against the Gemini founders mark a significant moment in the ongoing narrative of crypto regulation. It’s a stark reminder of the high stakes involved when industry interests intersect with government oversight. As this story unfolds, it will undoubtedly influence perceptions of industry conduct and the independence of regulatory appointments, shaping the future landscape for digital assets.

The surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence is fueling the need for more data centers and in turn increasing energy consumption, raising concern from policymakers. U.S. spending on data centers has reached $40B Construction spending on U.S. data centers rose to a record amount of $40B in June, according to a new report from the Bank of America Institute. The increase is due to the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, which require immense computing power. The adoption of AI technology has prompted major technology companies to ramp up investments in digital infrastructure. The figure marks a 30% increase from the same period last year, which experienced a 50% surge. Cloud and technology companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are at the center of this increased spending . These companies are known as “hyperscalers” due to the scale of their global cloud operations. These hyperscalers have invested billions into building and expanding data centers to support the massive computing needs of generative AI tools and machine learning models. The foundation of modern AI applications relies on a vast network of servers and specialized hardware to process enormous datasets. The growth of large scale data centers that can meet those demands has had an effect across the technology industry, especially for chipmakers like Nvidia. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used in a number of AI training and inference tasks due to their high performance, and a good portion of the company’s revenue from sales is linked to the demand from data centers. The Bank of America Institute emphasized that while hyperscalers are driving much of the current demand, they are not the sole force behind it. “Hyperscalers are a big part of the increased demand for power, but they’re not the whole picture,” Bank of America Institute economists led by Liz Everett Krisberg said in the report . Electricity demand concerns With the increase of data center construction, energy consumption within the U.S. is also on the rise. According to the economists at the Bank of America Institute, most of the rise in electricity demand through 2030 is expected to come not just from AI data centers, but also from electric vehicles (EVs), heating systems, industrial reshoring, and the electrification of buildings. This projected surge in power demand poses new challenges for utilities, policymakers, and the energy sector. Data centers are known to consume a significant amount of electricity, as each facility requires large amounts of energy not only to power computing equipment but also to maintain cooling systems. With more of these facilities becoming operational, concerns about the long-term strain on U.S. energy grids are also building. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Wyden accuses Microsoft In the September 10 letter to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Wyden alleged that the tech giant’s “gross cybersecurity negligence” has led to ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure , including U.S. health care organizations, at least partially due to default configurations in the Windows operating system. Wyden likened Microsoft to an “arsonist selling firefighting services to their victims,” and according to him, government agencies and other companies have “no choice” but to use the company’s products because it has “near-monopoly over enterprise IT.” Wyden cited the May 2024 ransomware attack on hospital operator Ascension as a prime example. That case, according to the company, exposed private medical and insurance data of nearly 5.6 million people. He wrote that the hospital operator had informed his staff that a contractor on an Ascension laptop had clicked on a malicious link provided by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Wyden claims Microsoft’s support for outdated encryption technology and default configuration settings led to the Ascension exploit. He also said the firm has yet to properly educate companies about how to mitigate the threat. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that RC4, the encryption standard referenced by Wyden, is indeed old, but it makes up “less than .1%” of the company’s traffic, and it discourages customers from using it. “However, disabling its use completely would break many customer systems,” the spokesperson said, and the company is gradually reducing the extent to which customers can use it while trying to provide warnings and guidance as well. RC4 will be disabled by default in certain Windows products starting the first quarter of 2026, and the company has said it will include “additional mitigations” for existing deployments. Wyden demanded a review of court system’s cybersecurity practices Wyden’s move on Microsoft comes not long after he urged Chief Justice John Roberts to initiate a comprehensive review of the federal court system’s cybersecurity practices. His request came after a significant hack of the electronic case management system, marking the second major breach in five years. The latest breach was recorded in June of this year and has pushed the courts to finally announce the implementation of multifactor authentication, a basic security measure that has been standard in executive branch agencies since 2015. As far as Wyden is concerned, the negligence in court cybersecurity poses serious risks to national security, as sensitive information related to ongoing investigations and federal witnesses could be exploited by foreign adversaries. Sealed court filings located in the case management system often include extremely sensitive information about national security sources and methods, the names of key federal witnesses, or details of ongoing investigations. Such information in the hands of foreign adversaries or criminal cartels could be highly damaging to Americans’ security. It does not help matters that the New York Times has reported that “documents related to criminal activity with overseas ties,” were the target of the most recent hack. Get seen where it counts.

The South Korea newspaper Seoul Kyungjae reported that the Ministry of SMEs and Startups says the existing ban on crypto firms’ VC funding will end on September 16. The ministry said the State Council, South Korea’s chief executive body and ministerial cabinet has signed off on the move. VC Funding for Crypto Firms: South Korea Scraps 2018 Ban The council has agreed to make a partial amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the Special Act on the Promotion of Venture Businesses. The South Korean Minister of SMEs and Startups Han Seong-sook. (Source: Lee Jae-myung/YouTube) The amendment will effectively scrap the designation of crypto trading and brokerage-providing firms as “a restricted venture business.” The ban has been in place since October 2018. At the time, the government of President Moon Jae-in said it was imposing the ban to help cool an “overheated, speculative” market. The government’s move drew ire from the crypto community. In South Korea, only bars, nightclubs, and licenced gambling venues are subject to similar VC investment restrictions. The ministry explained that the amendment “reflects the changing global status of the cryptoasset industry.” It added that the law now provided a wide range of protection systems for domestic crypto exchange users. The ministry also spoke about the need to “foster” industries in the “digital asset ecosystem.” It made special mention of companies that work with blockchain and cryptography-related technology. This move, the government added, will allow crypto companies with technological prowess and growth potential to apply for VC investment. This, the ministry added, will put them on an even footing with other innovative companies in the IT space. The SMEs Minister Han Seong-sook said: “We will foster a transparent and responsible ecosystem.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-dont-sleep-on-xrp-heres-why/,"A respected market commentator has advised traders to keep a close watch on XRP as the year draws to a close, highlighting a potential breakout setup that could trigger significant gains. XRP has recently shown renewed strength after a period of weakness. The token closed at $2.96 on September 7, marking its highest daily close in two weeks and renewing optimism among traders. Analysts argue that the move positions XRP near a critical level that could decide its trajectory for the remainder of the year. One of the strongest voices in this discussion is Heisenberg, a well-followed analyst who believes XRP’s price structure mirrors past setups that preceded major advances. According to him, the current technical formation could set the stage for XRP to reach double-digit prices before the end of 2025. Don't sleep on $XRP into eoy… pic.twitter.com/lg5zP1BYgZ — Heisenberg (@Mr_Derivatives) September 7, 2025 Reviewing Past Breakouts Historical data shows that XRP has followed a recurring pattern over the past year. For much of 2024, the asset remained below the $1 level in a prolonged consolidation phase. That changed in November following the U.S. elections, when XRP climbed sharply to reach $2.9 in early December. Subsequent price action created a descending trendline that capped movement through late December and early January. A breakout above this resistance fueled another advance, sending XRP to $3.4 by mid-January 2025. The pattern repeated in the first quarter of 2025. After another controlled decline, XRP broke higher again, culminating in its strongest rally of the cycle in late June. That run peaked above $3.6 in July before momentum cooled, as technical indicators signaled overbought conditions. Current Setup Since the July peak, XRP has trended lower within another descending channel. The September 7 close at $2.96 places the asset directly below the upper boundary of this structure. Importantly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reset to 48.86, leaving space for renewed momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts note that a move above $3.05 to $3.20 could confirm a breakout, with potential upside targets ranging between $3.8 and $4.2 in the near term. If buying pressure builds in a manner consistent with prior rallies, Heisenberg argues that XRP could extend toward $10 before the end of the year. For now, the key support zone lies near $2.6, and holding above this level is seen as essential for maintaining the bullish outlook. Broader Market Views Other analysts share similar perspectives. Gordon, a veteran trader, observed that XRP has been consolidating in a tight range for months, which he believes is a prelude to a rapid move toward $6. Meanwhile, Hov has identified two possible paths: either XRP begins a strong third-wave advance in its broader trend, or it remains in a corrective phase, forming a running flat or triangle. He expects a resolution soon. Additionally, CryptoInsightUK has drawn attention to XRP’s performance relative to gold. He pointed to the token’s resilience in holding previous range highs as support, alongside a bullish RSI cross on the daily chart, which he interprets as further evidence of underlying strength. Taken together, the analyses suggest that XRP is approaching a decisive stage. While downside risks remain if support fails, the repeated pattern of breakouts following descending trendlines has encouraged market watchers to expect another significant rally before the year concludes.

Here’s Why People Are Backing Layer Brett,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-for-the-next-50x-crypto-gainer-heres-why-people-are-backing-layer-brett/,"As investors look beyond conventional assets like XRP, the crypto world is abuzz with the arrival of Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , a pioneering Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin that is rapidly gaining traction.

This engagement signifies a crucial step towards defining the future framework for the cryptocurrency market. Why is SEC Engagement on Crypto Regulation So Important? On September 9, the SEC’s specialized crypto task force convened with Mysten Labs to delve into approaches for cryptocurrency market oversight. This discussion, as reported by Cointelegraph, underscores the SEC’s proactive stance in understanding and potentially regulating the rapidly expanding digital asset sector. The SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, a mandate it now extends to the crypto space. The agency’s engagement with industry players like Mysten Labs is vital. It allows regulators to gain direct insights into the technology and operational models of new blockchain projects.

Regulators must balance the need for investor protection with the desire to foster innovation. Overly restrictive rules could stifle growth, while insufficient oversight could expose investors to significant risks. Key challenges include: Defining Digital Assets: Classifying cryptocurrencies as securities, commodities, or a new asset class remains a contentious issue. Jurisdictional Complexity: The global nature of crypto makes consistent international crypto regulation difficult. Technological Understanding: Regulators need to keep pace with rapid technological advancements to craft effective policies. Market Manipulation: Ensuring fair trading practices and preventing illicit activities. These complexities underscore why direct engagement between regulators and innovators is not just beneficial, but absolutely necessary. It helps bridge the knowledge gap and ensures that future crypto regulation is informed and practical. Charting a Path Forward: The Impact of Regulatory Dialogues The meeting between the SEC and Mysten Labs is more than just a single discussion; it’s part of an ongoing global effort to establish a clear framework for digital assets. Such dialogues can lead to more predictable and transparent regulatory environments, which ultimately benefits both investors and developers. When rules are clear, businesses can innovate with greater certainty, and investors can participate with more confidence. The outcomes of these discussions could: Enhance Market Stability: Clear rules can reduce volatility and speculative behavior. Boost Institutional Adoption: More institutions may enter the crypto space with defined guidelines. Promote Innovation: A well-understood regulatory landscape can encourage responsible development. Ultimately, the goal of effective crypto regulation is to create a secure and thriving digital economy. The collaborative spirit shown in these meetings suggests a path towards balanced and forward-thinking policies that could shape the future of finance. The recent engagement between the SEC’s crypto task force and Mysten Labs represents a critical dialogue in the ongoing quest for robust crypto regulation .

Whale Alert recently reported a massive SOL transfer : an astounding 1,611,845 SOL, valued at approximately $361 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly to Coinbase Institutional. This significant Solana movement immediately raises crucial questions about its origins and potential impact on the market. What Does This Massive SOL Transfer Signify? The sheer scale of this SOL transfer is hard to overstate. Moving over 1.6 million Solana tokens in a single transaction highlights the activity of a major player, often referred to as a ‘whale’ in the crypto community. Such large movements can often precede significant market shifts or signal a change in strategy by a substantial holder. Moreover, the destination is particularly noteworthy: Coinbase Institutional. This arm of Coinbase caters specifically to large institutions, hedge funds, and corporate clients. Therefore, this is not a typical retail transaction. It suggests either: A large institution is accumulating SOL. An existing institutional holder is moving funds for custody or an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Funds are being prepared for potential liquidation or rebalancing. Understanding the implications of this particular SOL transfer requires looking beyond the numbers to the entities involved. Unpacking the Implications of Such a Large SOL Transfer Whenever a transfer of this magnitude occurs, the crypto market pays close attention. The movement of $361 million worth of SOL to an institutional platform can have several potential effects. On one hand, it could be a bullish signal if an institution is acquiring Solana for long-term holding, indicating growing institutional confidence in the asset’s future. Conversely, it could signal a move to sell a substantial amount of SOL through an OTC desk, which could potentially impact market liquidity or price in the short term, although OTC deals are designed to minimize direct market impact. The mystery surrounding the ‘unknown wallet’ adds another layer of intrigue. Was it a foundation, an early investor, or a different institutional entity? This particular SOL transfer underscores the dynamic nature of digital asset markets, where large transactions can reveal underlying trends and investor sentiment. It also highlights the increasing role of institutional capital in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape, especially for prominent altcoins like Solana. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After This SOL Transfer? For market participants, observing the aftermath of this significant SOL transfer will be crucial. Will Solana’s price react? Will there be follow-up announcements or further movements? The crypto market is often a game of informed speculation, and events like this provide valuable data points. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Market Reaction: Keep an eye on Solana’s price action and trading volume in the coming days. Research Institutional Interest: This event reinforces the trend of institutions entering the crypto space. Understanding their movements can offer insights. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources for any updates or analyses regarding large whale movements. This enormous SOL transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the continuous evolution and maturation of the cryptocurrency market, driven by both retail and increasingly, institutional players. The transfer of 1,611,845 SOL to Coinbase Institutional is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant indicator of ongoing institutional activity in the Solana ecosystem. While the exact motivations behind this move remain unknown, it undeniably sparks conversation and speculation across the crypto community. As the digital asset space continues to grow, such massive movements will increasingly shape market dynamics and investor perception. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Q2: What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a platform designed for institutional investors, offering advanced trading, custody, and prime brokerage services for large-scale crypto operations. Q3: Does a large SOL transfer automatically mean a price change? Not necessarily. While large transfers can signal potential buying or selling pressure, the actual impact depends on whether the funds are for custody, an OTC deal, or direct market trades. The market often anticipates such moves. Q4: Why is the ‘unknown wallet’ significant? The unknown nature of the wallet means the identity and intentions of the sender are not public, adding an element of mystery and speculation to the transaction’s purpose. Q5: How can I track large crypto transfers like this SOL transfer? Services like Whale Alert (which reported this transaction) and various blockchain explorers allow users to track large cryptocurrency movements on public ledgers.

While the blockchain itself continued to produce blocks, some Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services and validators halted, forcing providers to rewind to the last finalized block and resynchronize. Polygon Executes Emergency Hard Fork to Resolve Finality Bug Polygon engineers confirmed the bug was preventing node progress under certain configurations, though restarting affected nodes resolved the issue for several validators and RPC providers. At the time, Polygonscan, the network’s block explorer, showed no block updates for more than five hours. Polygon later explained that Polygonscan’s nodes had halted after a faulty milestone produced by Heimdall, the project’s consensus engine. A company representative said that the team was working with Polygonscan to switch to functioning nodes that had not halted, stressing that block production remained live. “Checkpoint finality is working as expected within 15 minutes,” the team said in an update at 08:52 UTC, sharing an alternative link where real-time block production could be tracked. Polygon PoS network faces 10-15 minute transaction delays from a node bug as protocols suspend operations and POL drops 3.42%. #Polygon #POS https://t.co/4o0TzV7qVH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 10, 2025 Analysis revealed the problem stemmed from Heimdall’s finality gadget, which is responsible for producing milestones every few seconds. Although checkpoints to Ethereum were still being posted every 20 minutes, milestones, which provide faster, deterministic finality, were not being processed. This left local fast finality delayed even as the main chain continued adding blocks. To address the problem, Polygon rolled out emergency updates: Bor version 2.2.11-beta2 and Heimdall version 0.3.1, the latter requiring a hard fork. The upgrade, executed at 3 p.m. UTC, deleted the faulty milestone and purged it from node databases. Polygon confirmed soon after that the hard fork was successfully completed and that both milestones and checkpoints were once again finalizing normally. Source: Polygonscan “The hard fork has been successfully completed, and milestones are now processing normally along with state sync. Checkpoints are going through, and consensus finalization has been fully restored on Polygon PoS,” the team wrote in a statement on X. UPDATE: The hard fork has been successfully completed, and milestones are now processing normally along with state sync. Checkpoints are going through and consensus finalization has been fully restored on Polygon PoS. We will continue to monitor the network closely to ensure… https://t.co/UwiAYdcKXu — Polygon Foundation (@0xPolygonFdn) September 10, 2025 Polygon Foundation co-founder and CEO Sandeep Nailwal later explained that the disruption originated from a faulty milestone proposal that pushed some Bor nodes onto divergent forks. This triggered short-term instability not accounted for in the system. He emphasized that while checkpoint finality on Ethereum had remained active throughout, local milestone finality was delayed. “Milestones are a lightweight alternative to checkpoints, enabling faster, deterministic finality for transactions, even before a checkpoint is submitted to Ethereum,” Nailwal said. “The root cause came from a faulty milestone proposal. We rolled out fixes on both Heimdall and Bor. Earlier today, Polygon PoS experienced a disruption where checkpoint finality on Ethereum was still active, but local fast finality on the chain (i.e. milestones) were delayed. For context: milestones are a lightweight alternative to checkpoints, enabling faster, deterministic… https://t.co/ulINLtlurV — Sandeep | CEO, Polygon Foundation (※,※) (@sandeepnailwal) September 10, 2025 With these fixes now live, nodes are not stuck, and consensus is finalizing normally.” Nailwal described the event as part of the growing pains of scaling Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain but said each challenge strengthens its resilience. “There will be growing pains with any ambitious upgrade. But each one makes Polygon PoS stronger on our road to GigaGas throughput,” he said, adding that more upgrades are planned to boost capacity and reliability. Polygon engineers continue to monitor the network to ensure stability and are investigating how the faulty milestone was introduced. Despite the temporary setback, the network has resumed normal operations, with blocks, milestones, and checkpoints processing in real time Polygon’s Reliability Questioned After Finality Bug, TVL Down 87% From Peak Polygon developers have deployed a hard fork to fix a bug that temporarily halted block production on its proof-of-stake chain, restoring the network after several hours of disruption. The issue, tied to transaction finality, left exchanges and DeFi protocols unable to process deposits or withdrawals as they waited for confirmation guarantees. The outage drew criticism from Polymarket traders, who argued that a blockchain hosting one of the sector’s largest prediction markets should not face such problems. “It might have gone unnoticed because no one was using it, but this has been going on for about two hours,” one trader posted, pointing to the risk of reversals during the downtime. It might have gone unnoticed because no one was using it, but this has been going on for about 2 hours on @0xPolygon . It's concerning that @Polymarket is still on this network https://t.co/PHW4xYeD48 pic.twitter.com/8KbCrLT2F4 — barnacle (@barnaclebarny) September 10, 2025 TokenPocket, a multichain stablecoin wallet, also paused Polygon transactions after observing that no new blocks had been finalized for over an hour. The incident comes just weeks after Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade , designed to cut finality times to five seconds and improve validator coordination. That update followed the July 1 Bhilai hard fork , which raised throughput to 1,000 transactions per second and integrated Ethereum’s Pectra EIPs . Despite these efforts, network reliability remains a concern, as Polygon’s total value locked has dropped from a $9.43 billion peak in 2021 to $1.2 billion today, per DeFiLlama . The chain’s native token, POL, has fallen 3.4% on the day and is down 30% year-to-date, trading at $0.27. Meanwhile, another Ethereum Layer-2, Linea, faced a separate outage earlier today when its mainnet sequencer stalled, causing a 67-minute pause in block production. While Linea has already deployed a fix , developers are questioning whether the two disruptions are linked. Linea has not disclosed the cause of its downtime. Both events highlight the fragility of scaling networks that have become essential to Ethereum’s broader ecosystem.

51522011,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=804812,1757548800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51522011.jpeg,"PepeVandal Launches Presale, Positions Project as “Rebellion” Against Meme Tokens",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepevandal-launches-presale-positions-project-as-rebellion-against-meme-tokens/,"PepeVandal , a new digital asset project blending narrative storytelling with gamified participation, has opened its presale for the $PEDAN token. The initiative frames itself as a cultural response to meme coins, using the language of raids, loot, and rebellion to describe a structured model for community engagement. Origins The project’s narrative centers on a character named Pepe, who is depicted as a long-time participant in meme token markets. According to its lore, Pepe invested in multiple presales, endured high transaction fees, and witnessed repeated failures: founders disappearing, communities going silent, and roadmaps abandoned. The conclusion drawn from this story is that meme tokens are not broken by accident but are designed to prioritize hype over substance. PepeVandal emerges from this realization as an organized “rebellion,” symbolized by graffiti imagery and a recurring green “V.” Mechanics of Participation PepeVandal structures its participation model as a loop: Smash → Loot → Share → Repeat. Target Selection : The community identifies a project or sector to “raid.” Raid Activation : Participants stake $PEDAN to join. They also contribute digital content such as memes, graffiti-style posts, and social campaigns. Vault Discovery : At the end of the raid, a vault is revealed. Rewards may include NFTs or tokenized representations of real-world assets such as property, music royalties, or gold. Loot Distribution : Rewards are distributed proportionally among participants who staked $PEDAN during the raid. Those who did not stake cannot claim. Repeat : The cycle restarts with a new raid. NFTs are central to the system’s utility. “Keys” unlock vaults, “Gear” can boost staking returns, and “Relics” can alter governance outcomes. The approach integrates DeFi mechanics into a narrative framework designed to maintain ongoing engagement. Roadmap in Six Acts Rather than a conventional roadmap, PepeVandal outlines six narrative “Acts”: Act I — Spark in the Sewer : The presale launches, paired with underground campaigns and manifesto drops. Act II — The First Tag : $PEDAN lists on decentralized exchanges, liquidity is locked, and NFTs are minted. Act III — Arm the Army : Release of Gear NFTs and Relics, introducing gamified staking and loyalty systems. Act IV — Vaults & Order : Community governance mechanisms go live. Integrations with real-world asset protocols begin. Act V — The Chainspring : Revenue from tokenized assets flows to $PEDAN stakers. The project expands from narrative into financial infrastructure. Act VI — Encrypted Future : Left intentionally undefined, to be determined by community participation. Each act introduces new mechanics and escalates the project’s level of organization, blending fiction with infrastructure. Tokenomics The project establishes a fixed supply of 333 billion $PEDAN tokens , distributed as follows: 40% Presale 20% Community airdrop for raids, campaigns, and meme activities 20% Ecosystem vault to support loot rewards, NFTs, and partnerships 15% Liquidity pool , locked permanently to mitigate risk of withdrawal 5% Team allocation , subject to a 12-month cliff and gradual release over 24–36 months The project emphasizes that $PEDAN is not designed as a passive holding asset. Instead, it functions as the required entry point for staking, loot eligibility, NFT minting, and governance votes. Presale Structure PepeVandal presale is framed as a recruitment mechanism rather than a fundraising round. Key features include: 30 stages , each lasting three days or until sold out. Pricing begins at $0.0000102 per token in Stage 1. Each subsequent stage increases in price by 5% . Allocation is fixed at 40% of total supply. The team states there are no private sales, no early allocations, and no discounted rounds for venture capital firms. This approach is intended to create equal access for all participants. The staged increase in pricing creates urgency. Participants who wait for later stages face higher costs, while early entrants receive lower-priced allocations. Broader Implications PepeVandal combines elements familiar in the digital asset sector — staged presales, token distributions, staking dashboards, and NFT mechanics — with a narrative designed to differentiate it from other meme projects. Its success will depend on several factors: Whether it can maintain sustained community participation across multiple raids. Whether promised integrations with real-world assets are implemented. Whether its stance against private allocations increases trust in its distribution model. If successful, PepeVandal could demonstrate how narrative-driven design can enhance participation in decentralized ecosystems. If not, it may be seen as another experiment in meme culture that borrowed familiar tools without lasting results.",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|AIRDROP|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-11 00:00:00

According to the analyst, the ongoing shakeout pattern setup may be laying the foundation for another rally that could take Bitcoin above its all-time high and beyond $130,000. The Anatomy Of Bitcoin’s Shakeout Pattern Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours has been highlighted by intense volatility, opening the day just above $113,000 before dipping to $110,800 and quickly rebounding to now trading back above $112,000 at the time of writing. However, expanding the short-term price action into a longer one shows that Bitcoin is trying to break above a consolidation zone with a green weekly candle following a green close last week. Related Reading: Looking For A Good Bitcoin Entry? Crypto Research Firm Reveals The Best Time To Buy BTC Notably, technical analysis of the weekly candlestick timeframe chart from crypto analyst CrypFlow shows that this price action is part of a shakeout pattern that’s characteristic of Bitcoin. According to the analyst, Bitcoin never trends higher in a straight line. Instead, each expansion phase in its market cycle is preceded by two steps of a consolidation and a shakeout. Shakeouts were nothing more than quick downside wicks earlier in this cycle. More recently, however, the corrections have become deeper and longer with full-bodied weekly candlesticks that drove out many investors before the next expansion phase began. The chart below, which was shared by the analyst, shows this repeating pattern of shakeouts in purple circles and expansions in green boxes since the cycle bottom in 2022, with the latest dip in the last week of August slotting neatly into the same framework of a purple shakeout. Why Bitcoin Is Headed Above $130,000 As shown in the chart above, the most recent break below the consolidation box is somewhat shorter than the previous two. Now, Bitcoin is climbing back into its range, and if it follows its previous movements since 2022, it could now be at the cusp of a new uptrend. Related Reading: Fair Value Gap Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Going Higher, But Watch Out For This Crash At the time of writing, the stochastic RSI on the weekly chart has dipped to oversold levels and is on the verge of a bullish cross. If confirmed, this indicator could provide the momentum for Bitcoin’s next continuation of the step-like progression. In terms of a price prediction, the expansion phase highlighted in the analysis projects that Bitcoin may not only retest its current all-time high but also push into new price levels above $130,000. With Bitcoin currently trading around $112,200, reaching $130,000 would translate to a gain of roughly 15.8%. A surge to $130,000 would most likely lift Bitcoin’s support base closer to its current all-time high around $124,000 before the next consolidation and shakeout.

Despite short-term fluctuations, Ethereum (ETH) remains at the center of many bullish projections . The token has declined by 0.24% in the past week, yet analysts continue to expect long-term growth. Pseudonymous trader Whale Guru, known for tracking large-cap assets, argues that ETH could appreciate significantly during the next substantial market uptrend. According to his forecast, Ethereum could rally to $25,000. This figure matches the projection issued by Standard Chartered Bank, which estimated that ETH may achieve this price by 2028, likely in the course of the next bull cycle. Reaching $25,000 from current levels around $4,300 would require a 473% increase, a move that market participants view as possible given Ethereum’s strong ecosystem and role in decentralized finance. IN THE NEXT PUMP → ALTCOIN TARGETS $ETH → $25,000 $SOL → $2,000 $XRP → $300 $DOGE →$5 $SUI → $10 $HYPE → $400 $WLFI → $10 $PENGU → $10 WHAT ELSE AM I MISSING? — Whale.Guru (@Whale_Guru) September 4, 2025 XRP Forecast at $300 In addition to Ethereum, Whale Guru has drawn attention to XRP, offering one of the most optimistic predictions for the asset. He suggests XRP could rise to $300 in the same rally. At present, XRP trades near $3 and has been attempting to establish firm support above this threshold. To reach the projected level, XRP would need to advance by roughly 9,900%. Such growth would also impact the XRP/ETH ratio. If Ethereum were to rise to $25,000 while XRP reached $300, the pair could climb from 0.00068 to approximately 0.012, marking a 1,664% increase. The implications for market capitalization would be profound. With a circulating supply of about 59.61 billion tokens, XRP at $300 would carry a market value of roughly $17.8 trillion, surpassing the combined worth of several leading global corporations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This figure makes the target challenging to achieve in the near term, though analysts at Changelly have also considered this possibility, estimating that XRP might reach $300 by 2040 under more gradual conditions. Broader Altcoin Projections Whale Guru did not limit his analysis to Ethereum and XRP. He also presented forecasts for other major altcoins. Solana (SOL), currently priced around $223 , is expected to potentially rise to $2,000, which would represent a 797% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE), a token long watched for its community-driven rallies, was projected to surpass $1 and eventually touch $5, marking a 1,937% increase from current prices. Sui (SUI), another asset highlighted in the forecast, was given a more conservative outlook. Trading near $3.58 at present, the token could see a rise to $10, which would amount to a 179% increase. While the targets presented by Whale Guru are bold, they reflect the optimism that resurfaces in the market as investors prepare for possible large-scale rallies. Whether these projections are realized in the current cycle or a future one, they underscore the high expectations surrounding Ethereum, XRP, and other leading altcoins.

The leading cryptocurrency has struggled to establish a clear direction, with buyers working to hold the price above the critical $110,000 level while sellers aggressively defend resistance near $113,000. This standoff has left BTC in a narrow range, fueling speculation over whether the next decisive move will be a breakout or a breakdown. Despite the choppy price action, key onchain data from Maartunn paints a more optimistic picture beneath the surface. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain strong and continue to improve, even as price volatility dominates short-term sentiment. Metrics tracking network activity and adoption suggest that the recent swings are more reflective of broader market dynamics—such as liquidity shifts and macroeconomic uncertainty—rather than Bitcoin losing momentum on its own. This divergence highlights the complexity of the current market phase: while the chart shows hesitation, the underlying network signals resilience and long-term growth. As bulls and bears wrestle for control at these levels, Bitcoin’s strengthening foundation could ultimately provide the catalyst for a more sustained move once external pressures ease. Bitcoin Difficulty And Mining Costs Signal Resilient Fundamentals According to Maartunn, Bitcoin’s network remains in remarkable health despite recent price uncertainty. One of the clearest signs of this strength is Bitcoin Difficulty , which continues to push new all-time highs. Difficulty adjusts every two weeks based on the level of mining activity, and consistent increases reflect that miners are dedicating more computational power to secure the network. This persistent climb underscores confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and highlights the resilience of its decentralized infrastructure, even as the market faces turbulence. Alongside this, the average cost of mining a single Bitcoin now stands at approximately $99,100. This figure is important, as it represents the breakeven level for many miners. With BTC currently trading just above $112,000, miners are still operating profitably, but the margin for comfort is narrowing. Should the price dip significantly below $100,000, miner capitulation risks could rise, potentially adding temporary selling pressure to the market. However, network fundamentals continue to suggest strength rather than weakness. The steady climb in Difficulty, combined with sustained miner commitment, indicates that participants are betting on higher prices ahead. Historically, periods where mining costs approach market value have preceded strong upward moves, as Bitcoin tends to rebound to maintain mining incentives. Looking ahead, the combination of rising Difficulty and resilient miner activity supports the case for Bitcoin extending its push higher in the coming months. While short-term volatility may keep traders on edge, the network’s health signals that the foundation for a more sustained uptrend is firmly in place. This dynamic highlights why on-chain fundamentals remain one of the most reliable indicators of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, even when price action appears uncertain. Short-Term Price Consolidation Bitcoin is currently trading near $112,311 after a period of choppy consolidation, as shown in the 4-hour chart. The price has been struggling to gain momentum, oscillating between support around $110,000 and resistance near $114,000. The 50 SMA ($111,272) and 100 SMA ($110,773) are acting as immediate dynamic supports, while the 200 SMA at $113,860 continues to cap upside moves, reinforcing the short-term bearish bias. The chart highlights that BTC remains in a compressed range after its recent decline from local highs above $123,000. Bulls have managed to defend the $110,000 zone multiple times, signaling strong demand at lower levels, yet momentum has not been sufficient to break through key resistance. For a bullish reversal, BTC needs to reclaim and consolidate above the 200 SMA, which would pave the way toward $116,000 and eventually the major resistance at $123,217. A clean break below $110,000 could trigger a sharper correction, exposing $108,000 and possibly lower supports. Overall, the short-term outlook remains neutral to cautious: Bitcoin is holding ground, but until it breaks above the 200 SMA, the risk of continued sideways or downward action persists.

The move comes amid a softer macroeconomic backdrop following the unexpected decline in U.S. producer prices in August. The core Producer Price Index (PPI), which excludes food and energy, dropped 0.1% month-over-month—far below forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Annual core inflation eased to 2.8% from July’s revised 3.4%. For Bitcoin, the weaker wholesale inflation data is fueling hopes of a more accommodative Federal Reserve, while traders keep one eye on the charts for confirmation of a breakout. PPI Surprise and Market Reaction The August PPI release was the first decline in four months, surprising economists who had expected another increase. Headline PPI fell 0.1% month-over-month, compared to July’s upwardly revised 0.7%. On a yearly basis, wholesale inflation cooled to 2.6% from 3.1%. The details underscore the slowdown. Final demand prices for services dropped 0.2% after climbing 0.7% in July, while goods prices edged up only 0.1% compared to last month’s 0.6%. The core PPI for finished goods held at 2.8%, its highest level since late 2023. The softer data eases pressure on the Fed, with markets now leaning toward a more dovish stance in September. For risk assets like Bitcoin, that backdrop is supportive, particularly as inflationary shocks fade. Key points from the PPI release: Headline PPI fell 0.1% in August vs. +0.3% expected Annual PPI slowed to 2.6% from 3.1% in July Core PPI slipped to 2.8%, its lowest since early 2024 Regulatory and Global Shifts Macro data wasn’t the only driver this week. In the U.S., Cboe announced it will launch 10-year Bitcoin and Ethereum futures pending approval. Known as “continuous futures,” these products mimic perpetual swaps commonly found in offshore markets, but are subject to U.S. regulatory oversight. They’ll allow institutions to maintain long-dated exposure without constant rollovers, a structural change likely to boost participation.

All are tailwinds for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin On the charts, Bitcoin is consolidating just beneath a breakout level at $113,800. The two-hour chart displays an ascending triangle pattern, characterized by higher lows that press against flat resistance. The 50-period SMA at $111,896 is trending upward, while the 200-period SMA at $112,738 sits directly below price action, reinforcing support. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The Relative Strength Index holds near 64, reflecting strong but not overheated momentum. Back-to-back bullish candlesticks further confirm buyers remain in control. If Bitcoin can close above $113,800, the path on TradingView projects upside toward $115,400, then $117,150, and $118,617. A sustained breakout could lift BTC toward $125,000 in the medium term. Failure to hold above $112,000 would weaken the bullish case, with risks of a slide back to $111,000, $110,000, and $108,450. Bearish candlestick sequences like an engulfing pattern or three black crows at resistance would confirm such a reversal. Bitcoin is consolidating just under $113.8K resistance within an ascending triangle. A breakout could target $115.4K–$117.1K, while failure risks $112K–$110K support. — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 11, 2025 For traders, the setup is clear: longs are favored on confirmation above $113,800 with stops under $111,000, targeting $117K to $125K. With macro data softening, institutional products expanding, and adoption broadening globally, Bitcoin’s current triangle may be less about short-term noise and more about laying the groundwork for its next major rally. If momentum aligns with these structural shifts, BTC’s march toward $130,000 could come sooner than many expect. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

Crypto enthusiasts, the market is buzzing with a significant shift! The Altcoin Season Index has just climbed to 62, marking a notable six-point increase. This jump is more than just a number; it’s a strong indicator that alternative cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum against Bitcoin, potentially heralding the exciting prospect of an Altcoin Season . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric provided by CoinMarketCap, offers a snapshot of the cryptocurrency market’s current sentiment. It meticulously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. These coins are then measured against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. An Altcoin Season is officially declared when a substantial 75% of these top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day period. Conversely, if Bitcoin dominates, we are in a “Bitcoin Season.” A reading closer to 100 strongly suggests that an Altcoin Season is in full swing, indicating broad-based strength across the altcoin market. The recent rise to 62 means we are significantly closer to that 75% threshold. This shift indicates a growing appetite among investors for assets beyond Bitcoin, suggesting a potential rotation of capital into altcoins. Is an Altcoin Season Truly on the Horizon? While the index at 62 isn’t the definitive 75% mark for a full-blown Altcoin Season , it’s a powerful signal. This upward movement suggests that a substantial number of altcoins are already showing stronger performance relative to Bitcoin. Several factors could contribute to this trend: Bitcoin Dominance Shifting: Often, after a period of strong Bitcoin rallies, investors look for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Innovation and Development: Many altcoin projects, especially in sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions, continue to build and release new features, attracting investor interest. Market Sentiment: General positive sentiment in the broader crypto market can encourage speculative investments in altcoins. This period often brings renewed focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Investors often seek out these opportunities, hoping to capitalize on potential parabolic gains. Navigating a Potential Altcoin Season: What Should You Consider? For investors, a rising Altcoin Season Index presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding how to approach this period is crucial for portfolio health. Benefits of an Altcoin Season: High Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can experience significant percentage gains in a short period. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins can spread risk and potentially capture growth from different sectors of the crypto market. Innovation Exposure: Participating in altcoins means engaging with the cutting-edge of blockchain technology and decentralized applications. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, meaning prices can fluctuate wildly. Research Intensive: Identifying promising altcoins requires extensive research into their technology, team, use case, and community. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio As the market signals a potential shift towards altcoins, here are some practical steps to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any altcoin, thoroughly investigate its whitepaper, development roadmap, team, and community. Understand its value proposition. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your capital into one altcoin, spread your investments across several promising projects in different sectors. Implement Risk Management: Use strategies like setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact the crypto space. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Don’t blindly chase rapidly rising altcoins. Often, the biggest gains are made by those who invest before the hype. The increase in the Altcoin Season Index to 62 is a clear signal that the cryptocurrency landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving. While it doesn’t guarantee a full-blown altcoin bull run, it certainly indicates a period where altcoins are showing significant strength relative to Bitcoin. This makes it an opportune time for informed and strategic decision-making. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping altcoins price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of the Altcoin Season Index reaching 62? A1: A reading of 62 indicates that a significant number of altcoins (62% of the top 100, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. While not yet the 75% threshold for an official Altcoin Season, it suggests a strong shift in market momentum towards altcoins. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: It’s calculated by CoinMarketCap, comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The percentage of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin determines the index score. Q3: Does a high Altcoin Season Index guarantee an altcoin bull run? A3: No, it’s an indicator, not a guarantee. A high index suggests favorable conditions for altcoins and increased investor interest, but market dynamics can change rapidly. It’s crucial to combine this insight with thorough research and risk management. Q4: What types of altcoins typically perform well during an Altcoin Season? A4: Performance varies, but often projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technology (e.g., DeFi, Layer 2, gaming), active development, and growing communities tend to see significant gains. However, speculative smaller-cap altcoins can also experience rapid, albeit risky, pumps. Q5: What should investors do if they believe an Altcoin Season is approaching? A5: Investors should focus on diligent research (DYOR), diversify their portfolios across various promising altcoins, implement strict risk management strategies, and avoid emotional trading decisions like FOMO. Staying informed about market trends is also vital. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making headlines with its new lending technologies and community-driven growth strategies, hence becoming a force to reckon in DeFi. This new altcoin, which is currently at a mere $0.035 has seen more than $16,150 interested investors buy it. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sweep-Up Narrows Investor Demand Shiba Inu sits at approximately $0.00001255, with little action during the last trading periods. The token remains to function well in the cryptocurrency market due to a strong community and further ecosystem development. SHIB price action still remains in consolidation phase, with investors watching overall direction and making sure to invest cautiously. In addition, interest is slowly dispersing toward new platforms, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which indicates an interest shift within the cryptocurrency market. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO Investors are now purchasing MUTM tokens at $0.035 in Stage 6 of presale. Waiting for Stage 7 costs an additional 14.3% per token. To date, the coin has been accumulated by over 16,150 supporters and raised over $15.5 million in funds, demonstrating a high level of market interest and demand. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance, in partnership with CertiK, has launched an official $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The developers reward individuals who discover bugs in the project’s codebase on a four-level scale of seriousness: critical, major, minor, and low. The program guarantees any potential bugs are fixed to enhance platform security and protect investors and users. Price Discovery Precise price data is necessary for borrowing, lending, and liquidation to be secure. Mutuum Finance makes use of Chainlink oracles to provide market prices in USD and local tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX to the system. Fallback oracles, combined feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices are also employed by the system to keep valuations as precise under stress market conditions. Managing Volatility and Exposure Market volatility is directly translated into collateral management in the protocol. Mutuum Finance differentiates liquidation points and Loan-to-Value (LTV) according to the stability of every token. More stable, stronger tokens have higher borrowing value and allowances, while riskier tokens have lower values. Reserve multipliers are utilized proportionally between approximately 10% for lower-volatility assets to a maximum of 35% for riskier assets, accumulating a default protection margin without restricting participation diversification. Mutuum Finance is also working on an overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin will be resistant to market sentiment and volatility with zero possibilities of depegging and providing users a stable base for transactions and savings in the long term. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol allows clients to control their capital actively via passive lending and borrowing, with the aim of empowering borrowers to take loans collateraled by stacks of securitised assets. System stabilization algorithm and interest rate optimization algorithms are utilized in the system, with the target of making the system efficient as well as long-term capital utilization. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market liquidity and volatility to facilitate closing of troubled positions. Risk exposure is necessarily maintained within limits established in advance, and liquidation parameters are established. Assets such as ETH and stablecoins can offer larger Loan-to-Value ratios, while riskier assets are supplied with lower ones. Reserve factors are distributed proportionally to all token classes to manage asset opportunity vs. risk to maximize overall protection of the protocol holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the best DeFi players as Shiba Inu (SHIB) stays steady at around $0.00001255. Phase 6 tokens sell for $0.035, and Phase 7 will rise 14.3% to give early investors a pretty good leg up. More than 16,150 holders have signed up, and $15.5M+ raised suggest demand is high. Lock your MUTM tokens up now before Phase 7 gets the price up.

BitMine Absorbs 319,000 ETH In A Week",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-supply-shock/,"BitMine Immersion has reportedly accumulated a staggering 319,000 ETH in just a single week. The massive purchase, worth over a billion dollars, underscores growing conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value among institutions and big players, tightening market liquidity. Could This Trigger An Ethereum Supply Crunch? In a move that highlights the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum, Paul Barron has mentioned on X that BitMine Immersion has just absorbed 319,000 ETH in a single week, which is equivalent to 0.26% of Ethereum’s total supply removed from circulation. Related Reading: BitMine’s Ethereum Treasury Hits New Milestone With 2 Million ETH Holdings Barron extrapolates this acquisition velocity, calculating that at the same rate, BitMine could demand an additional 4.1 million ETH in the 13 weeks remaining in 2025. This demand would be hitting a market where the current liquid supply on exchanges is only around 11 million ETH. He concludes that if just three to four more institutions adopt the Bitmine playbook, the combined demand would cause the market to face a supply crisis that is more severe than in 2021. However, a removal of 319,000 ETH and a staking lockup from the liquid market suggests that deflationary pressure is accelerating. According to Barron, smart money is positioning now. He predicts that while retail investors will only begin to chase ETH at levels above $8,000, Ethereum could reach $15,000 by December, which is “mathematical inevitability” if this institutional FOMO continues to spread. ETH Supply Locked In Staking Reaches Record Levels While a prominent figure is accumulating ETH every week, Ethereum is on the verge of a supply shock, despite appearing bearish on-chain two weeks ago. However, at the end of August, Bull Theory revealed that the on-chain data showed a spike in the validator exit queue to nearly 1 million ETH, the highest in months. Related Reading: Institutional Flows Push Ethereum into Spotlight: Analysts Eye $6K to $12K Targets Ahead The development may signal fear and potential selling pressure, but the narrative has now flipped. Presently, the validator entry queue has climbed back to 787,085 ETH in a 14-day wait to stake, indicating a strong return of confidence and growing demand to stake. Meanwhile, the validator exit queue has dropped sharply to 616,898 ETH in a 10-day wait, a clear sign that its previous peak is fading fast to nearly 1 million ETH. This shift shows that fewer validators are leaving the network, and the pressure from unstaking is diminishing fast. Ethereum has over 1.05 million active validators, with 35.6 million ETH staked, which is equivalent to 29.4% of the total supply, and a steady APR of 2.89%. According to Bull Theory, this is exactly how a supply squeeze unfolds: it starts slowly at first, then all at once, as liquidity tightens and more ETH is locked away.

The extensions apply to proposals from two of the industry’s largest players: BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Per SEC filings , the amendment from Franklin to permit staking within its Ethereum ETF is now pending a decision by November 13. Its Solana and XRP ETFs were delayed a day later on November 14. The review period for this proposed amendment has been reset to October 30 for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. The SEC didn’t indicate whether it prefers to approve or deny the ETF. Instead, it used its authority under the Securities Exchange Act Section 19(b) to take the longest possible extension time. These rules enable the Commission to stall for up to 180 days and occasionally for another 60 days. Franklin Templeton first requested its proposals for Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, with Cboe BZX in March, and Nasdaq submitted BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum staking amendment in July. Every product is designed to offer investors exposure to crypto assets through regulated markets, a factor identified as key to mainstream adoption. SEC extends ETF reviews The language in the SEC filings is clear enough. The delays are not rejections; they are evidence of the Committee’s view that the proposals merit additional scrutiny. Officials say that the agency has to balance factors like market stability , investor protection, and the complexity of staking before issuing final rulings. Staking in particular remains sensitive. These newest extensions are part of a larger drift. The SEC also pushed back its decision on the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF and the Grayscale Hedera ETF to Nov. 12. The summer delivered another spate of postponements. New reviews were extended in August for NYSE Arca’s applications for the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. Those are now due by October 8. The 21Shares and Bitwise Solana ETF was postponed to October 16, and the 21Shares Core XRP Trust to October 19. As reported by Cryptopolitan last month, the regulators delayed deciding on Cboe BZX’s proposal to list the WisdomTree XRP Fund, giving them a new deadline of October 24. Not coincidentally, the PENGU ETF was also delayed until October 12. Still, some analysts believe the regulator could approve all pending XRP ETFs simultaneously, mirroring its approach with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate a 95% chance of approval before year-end. This list of such proposals is getting longer and longer. By the end of August, the SEC had at least 92 crypto-linked ETFs under active review. That encompasses not only money linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also newer altcoins like Solana, Hedera, and XRP, as well as experimental staking products. That piling backlog shows how quickly legacy finance companies move into digital assets. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, and others have all hurried to file products. Each is vying for an early-mover edge in a market that some analysts predict may soon outpace commodity ETFs such as gold. SEC prepares new crypto framework Despite the setbacks, there are signs of progress. Paul Atkins, the Chair of the SEC, has revealed “Project Crypto,” an ambitious effort to overhaul the securities rules that apply to digital assets. The proposal is intended to standardize trading, lending, and staking rules around the crypto world. Speaking at the OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets last week in Paris, Atkins said that crypto’s time had come and added that the SEC would establish a framework to protect investors while providing clarity for issuers seeking to launch new ETFs. The agency is working on a generic listing proposal for ETFs based on tokens. If approved, it could pave the way for some crypto ETFs to get up and running without going through long, individual rule changes. Though staking and altcoin ETFs are still on hold, some products are advancing more quickly. The REX-Osprey has filed several crypto funds under the 1940 Act, a separate regulatory track. These ETFs track the performance of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and XRP.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with the latest move from BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. A significant Arthur Hayes ENA withdrawal from Binance has caught the attention of market observers, sparking discussions about his strategy and the future of the Ethena (ENA) token. This isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a move that often carries deeper implications in the volatile crypto landscape. What’s Behind the Arthur Hayes ENA Withdrawal? According to insights from on-chain analyst Onchain Lens, Arthur Hayes recently withdrew a substantial 579,000 ENA tokens from Binance. This amount is valued at approximately $467,000, executed over the past ten hours. Such a move from a prominent figure like Hayes naturally piques interest and invites speculation within the crypto community. This particular Arthur Hayes ENA withdrawal adds to his already significant portfolio. He now reportedly holds a total of 5.02 million ENA, an impressive sum currently valued at around $3.91 million. Understanding the rationale behind such a strategic shift is key to interpreting its potential market impact. Why Do Withdrawals Matter in Crypto? When an investor moves a large quantity of assets off an exchange, it’s often more than just a logistical decision. These actions are widely interpreted as a signal of intent. But what exactly does this signal imply? Typically, a withdrawal from a centralized exchange suggests several key possibilities: Long-Term Holding: The investor intends to hold the asset for an extended period, rather than trading it actively. This reduces immediate selling pressure. Enhanced Security: Moving funds to a personal wallet (cold storage or a self-custodial hot wallet) offers greater control and protection against exchange-specific risks. Participation in Staking/DeFi: The assets might be intended for use in decentralized finance protocols, staking, or other yield-generating activities outside the exchange’s direct purview. Therefore, the Arthur Hayes ENA withdrawal could be a strong indicator of his confidence in ENA’s long-term potential, or his plans to engage with the Ethena ecosystem more directly. Arthur Hayes’ ENA Holdings: A Deeper Dive into His Strategy Arthur Hayes is well-known for his insightful, often provocative, views on the crypto market and macroeconomics. His public support and involvement with Ethena (ENA) have been consistent, making his actions closely watched. His current holding of over 5 million ENA tokens underscores a significant commitment to the project. His past commentaries often emphasize the importance of stablecoins and yield-generating protocols, which Ethena aims to provide with its synthetic dollar protocol. This alignment between his public stance and his on-chain movements lends credibility to the interpretation of his withdrawal as a strategic, long-term play. Implications for Ethena (ENA) and the Broader Market What could this substantial Arthur Hayes ENA withdrawal mean for Ethena (ENA) itself? For one, it could bolster investor confidence. When a respected figure like Hayes takes a strong holding position, it often signals belief in the project’s fundamentals and future growth. Moreover, reducing the supply of ENA available on exchanges can subtly influence market dynamics. While not a direct buy, a withdrawal takes tokens out of immediate trading circulation, potentially contributing to price stability or even upward momentum if demand remains constant or increases. This move could also inspire other long-term holders to reconsider their own strategies regarding ENA. For the broader altcoin market, Hayes’ actions are often seen as a bellwether. His strategic moves can sometimes foreshadow wider trends, encouraging deeper analysis of projects he publicly or implicitly supports through his on-chain activities. It highlights the importance of observing not just price action, but also the movement of significant holdings. The recent Arthur Hayes ENA withdrawal from Binance is more than just a transaction; it’s a calculated move by a prominent crypto figure. Interpreted primarily as a signal for long-term holding and increased security, this action underscores Hayes’ continued confidence in Ethena (ENA) and its potential. As the crypto landscape evolves, watching the on-chain movements of key players like Arthur Hayes provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future directions for specific assets and the broader ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions About Arthur Hayes’ ENA Withdrawal Q: What is ENA? A: ENA is the native token of Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a crypto-native, censorship-resistant stablecoin solution. Q: Why is Arthur Hayes’ withdrawal significant? A: Arthur Hayes is a highly influential figure in the crypto space. His actions, especially large withdrawals, are often seen as strategic moves signaling long-term conviction or specific plans for the asset, which can impact market sentiment. Q: What does “withdrawing from an exchange” typically mean? A: Withdrawing assets from a centralized exchange usually indicates an intention to hold the asset for the long term, move it to a more secure personal wallet, or use it in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like staking. Q: Does this withdrawal guarantee ENA’s price will increase? A: No, while a significant withdrawal can positively influence market sentiment and reduce immediate selling pressure, it does not guarantee a price increase. Crypto markets are influenced by many factors, and price movements are inherently volatile. Found this analysis of Arthur Hayes’ ENA withdrawal insightful?

A significant transaction has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking discussions about its potential implications for the market. Specifically, the deployer address associated with Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has made a substantial move. Over the past 24 hours, an astonishing 170 million PENGU tokens, valued at approximately $6 million, were deposited to major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Bybit, as reported by AmberCN. Such large deposits to exchanges are typically interpreted as a precursor to selling activity. This development has naturally raised questions and concerns among the Pudgy Penguins community and the broader crypto space. What’s Behind the Pudgy Penguins Deployer’s Massive Move? When a project’s deployer, often an entity or individual with a significant stake, moves a large sum of tokens to exchanges, it’s a signal that cannot be ignored. These movements are often seen as an intent to liquidate assets, which can exert downward pressure on the token’s price. For Pudgy Penguins , a project celebrated for its vibrant community and unique NFT collection, this $6 million deposit represents a considerable portion of its circulating supply. The sheer volume of PENGU involved suggests a strategic decision, but its exact motivation remains speculative. It is important to differentiate between an individual holder’s actions and those of a deployer. A deployer often holds a position of influence and their actions can significantly sway market sentiment. Therefore, the crypto community is closely monitoring this situation for further developments. Understanding the Market Impact for Pudgy Penguins Holders For current holders of PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, this news brings a degree of uncertainty. A potential sell-off could lead to a decrease in the token’s value, impacting portfolios. However, it is also crucial to remember that market reactions are complex and not always linear. While a deposit often precedes selling, it doesn’t guarantee it. There could be other reasons for such a move, such as: Liquidity Provision: The deployer might be preparing to provide liquidity to new pools or platforms. Strategic Partnerships: Funds could be earmarked for new ventures or collaborations requiring liquid assets. Rebalancing Portfolios: A broader portfolio adjustment might be underway. Despite these possibilities, the immediate interpretation leans towards a potential sell-off, leading many to prepare for increased volatility in the PENGU market. Investors are advised to stay informed and consider their risk tolerance. Navigating Uncertainty: Strategies for Pudgy Penguins Investors In times of market uncertainty, having a clear strategy is paramount. For those invested in Pudgy Penguins , several approaches can help mitigate potential risks and capitalize on opportunities: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official announcements from the Pudgy Penguins team and reliable crypto news sources. Assess Your Holdings: Review your PENGU and NFT positions. Understand your entry points and potential profit/loss scenarios. Consider Risk Management: If you are concerned about a price drop, you might consider setting stop-loss orders or reducing your exposure if it aligns with your investment strategy. Look for Opportunities: Significant market movements can sometimes create buying opportunities for long-term believers if prices dip. It’s vital to conduct your own due diligence and make decisions based on your personal financial situation and investment goals. Panic selling is rarely a wise move. The Future of Pudgy Penguins: What’s Next? The Pudgy Penguins project has built a strong brand and community, extending beyond just digital collectibles into tangible products and mainstream recognition. This latest development, while concerning, is one event in the broader journey of a dynamic project. The community’s reaction, coupled with any official statements from the Pudgy Penguins team, will be crucial in shaping the narrative moving forward. The transparency and communication from the project’s leadership during such periods are key to maintaining investor confidence and project stability. Ultimately, the long-term success of Pudgy Penguins will depend on its continued innovation, community engagement, and ability to navigate market challenges. This recent deposit serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the crypto market and the constant need for vigilance. The deposit of $6 million worth of PENGU tokens by the Pudgy Penguins deployer has undeniably created a stir. While the immediate interpretation points to a potential sell-off, the full implications are yet to unfold. Investors are urged to remain calm, stay informed, and approach the situation with a well-thought-out strategy. The coming days will reveal how the market reacts and what this pivotal move truly means for the beloved NFT project. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a deployer deposits tokens to an exchange? A: Typically, depositing a large amount of tokens to an exchange is interpreted as a precursor to selling those tokens. This can increase selling pressure and potentially lead to a price drop for the asset. Q2: Is the Pudgy Penguins project in trouble because of this deposit? A: Not necessarily. While the deposit is a cause for concern and warrants close monitoring, it doesn’t automatically mean the project is in trouble. There could be other strategic reasons for the move, although a potential sell-off is the most common interpretation. Q3: Should I sell my PENGU tokens or Pudgy Penguins NFTs now? A: Investment decisions should always be based on your personal research, risk tolerance, and financial goals. It’s advisable to avoid panic selling and instead, stay informed, assess the situation, and consult with a financial advisor if needed. Q4: How can I stay updated on the Pudgy Penguins situation? A: Follow official Pudgy Penguins social media channels, their website, and reputable cryptocurrency news outlets like AmberCN. Monitoring on-chain data can also provide insights into further token movements. Q5: What is the PENGU token? A: PENGU is the native utility token associated with the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem.

This exciting development centers around the GemHUB Sonium partnership , a strategic alliance between the innovative gaming platform GemHUB and Sonium, a cutting-edge layer-2 blockchain from the globally renowned Sony Group. This collaboration marks a significant step forward for the Web3 gaming ecosystem. What Does the GemHUB Sonium Partnership Entail?

New Deadlines Set for Proposals In fresh filings this week, the SEC extended deadlines for funds tied to Ethereum, Solana, and XRP. Franklin Templeton’s Ethereum staking amendment is now set for a decision by November 13, while its Solana and XRP ETF proposals face a November 14 deadline. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s bid to allow staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust has been pushed to October 30. The filings only confirm the delays and do not signal how the SEC may ultimately rule. The Commission is using the maximum time permitted before a final decision. SEC’s Changing Approach to Crypto The extensions come as the SEC attempts to redefine its approach to digital assets under Chair Paul Atkins. Since President Donald Trump’s administration began in January, the agency has taken a more open stance, introducing “Project Crypto” to modernize securities rules and create a unified framework for digital asset trading, lending, and staking. At a global finance roundtable in Paris this week, Atkins underscored the shift. “Crypto’s time has come,” he told delegates. ETF Applications Continue to Mount Despite the more pro-crypto rhetoric, ETF decisions remain in limbo. On Tuesday, the SEC postponed reviews of the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF and the Grayscale Hedera ETF, pushing both deadlines to November 12. The Commission also issued multiple extensions in August, covering filings for the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, the 21Shares and Bitwise Solana ETFs, and the 21Shares Core XRP Trust. Other pending proposals include WisdomTree’s XRP Fund and the Canary PENGU ETF, both delayed until October. By late August, reports indicated that at least 92 crypto-related ETF applications were sitting with the regulator. The backlog highlights the SEC’s struggle to balance political momentum, market demand, and regulatory caution in one of the fastest-growing corners of finance.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|ETH|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-11 01:26:16

Addressing the OECD Roundtable on Global Financial Markets, he argued for certainty in on-chain capital raising rules. He said entrepreneurs shouldn’t confront “endless legal uncertainty as they build in the U.S.” Atkins reiterated his belief that most crypto tokens are not securities, which directly contrasts with how the SEC has been doing things for the last 10 years. He stated the agency needs to cease relying on ad hoc enforcement under case law and provide clear, predictable road rules for entrepreneurs and investors. SEC charts a new course with rulemaking Atkins’ speech focused on Project Crypto, a wide-ranging regulatory operation that has the support of President Donald Trump’s administration. The project aims to update securities laws for the digital age and intends to help prepare capital markets to run fully on-chain. U.S. financial regulation has rested on analog-era principles for decades. Project Crypto aims to change that by rewriting fundamental rules that better suit blockchain, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems. Atkins believes that a system designed for paper stock certificates is ill-equipped to deal with tokenized equities, decentralized exchanges, or algorithmic stablecoins. This will entail the SEC issuing straightforward, consistent definitions around when a token is considered a security and when it is not. The clarity can be expected to assist investors, entrepreneurs, and exchanges in understanding how to come into compliance without fear of being sued out of the blue or accepting the regulatory interpretations of the day. Atkins said that recent years of regulatory inconsistency had throttled innovation and driven talent overseas. He told the OECD audience that American entrepreneurs had been forced to spend more money on lawsuits than on developing their products, adding that such a chapter now belonged to history. Project Crypto further provides a consolidated licensing process. Those activities could all fit under one regulatory umbrella, which is another kind of simplification to the industry, and would no longer need to apply for multiple such licenses. It hopes to reduce compliance costs and help a financial platform evolve into a “super app” by offering several services in one trusted, regulated place. Atkins likened the model to trends in Asia, where financial super-apps meld payments, savings, and trading all in one place. He cautioned that the United States could be left behind if other jurisdictions moved to reform their financial markets without similar changes. Industry observers say such a homogenized industry would enable big Wall Street players, fintech players, and native crypto platforms to all converge. Banks and exchanges would be able to standardize on tokenized securities, lending markets, and staking products, as long as they acted according to stringent investor-protection rules. Super-Apps and American innovation in the spotlight Atkins noted that global competition was intensifying, pointing to Europe’s MiCA framework as an example of how other regions were already setting standards for digital assets. He warned that the United States risked falling behind. Speaking at the OECD, he explained that the goal was to make American markets the launchpad for innovation and investment, to ensure American entrepreneurs could secure funding under strong investor protections, and to give consumers access to products that opened the door to these markets. He pushed for the “minimum effective dose” of regulation, rules that protect investors but still allow for innovation. That means room for tokenized securities, decentralized finance products, and new asset classes. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the SEC chair had also announced a joint roundtable with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), set for Sept. 29. The session will discuss how to bring products such as perpetual contracts and DeFi trading back to the U.S. within the right regulatory framework. The two said, “As the markets for securities and non-securities increasingly converge, we are excited to embark on a new beginning for coordination between U.S. market regulators. The work of the SEC and CFTC has never been more intertwined—and the wave of innovation before us never more dependent on the depth of our cooperation.” Atkins’ comments underscore a major change in tack in Washington. This summer, Congress passed the first federal law regulating stablecoins, while the Clarity Act, a market-structure bill that would enshrine the SEC and CFTC’s authority, continues to advance.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The first signs of how validators are leaning in Hyperliquid’s hotly contested stablecoin vote are in, and the Stripe-aligned Native Markets team has an early lead. As of Thursday morning Hong Kong time, Native Markets has secured 30.8% of the delegated stake, led by heavyweight validators infinitefield.xyz (13.5%) and Alphaticks (5.2%). Paxos Labs , the New York–regulated issuer behind PayPal’s PYUSD, sits at 7.6% with backing from B-Harvest and HyBridge. Ethena has picked up 4.5%, while Agora, Frax, and Sky, despite splashy proposals , have yet to attract meaningful support, though many of the most prominent validators have yet to cast their virtual vote. The bigger picture: more than half of stake, 57%, remains unassigned. That block includes some of the most influential validators on Hyperliquid, such as Nansen x HypurrCollective (the single largest validator with over 18%) and Galaxy Digital. Where they ultimately land will decide whether Native Markets’ early momentum carries through to the September 14 deadline. Native Markets is pitching a Hyperliquid-native stablecoin issued via Stripe’s Bridge infrastructure, promising yield-sharing to the Assistance Fund and HYPE buybacks. But prominent voices, including Agora CEO Nick van Eck, warn that Stripe’s simultaneous push to launch its Tempo blockchain and its control of wallet provider Privy could create conflicts. Despite those criticisms, some validators appear to view Stripe’s global payment rails as a compelling advantage. What’s at stake is far more than just another token launch. Hyperliquid currently holds $5.5 billion in USDC deposits, around 7.5% of the stablecoin’s supply. Replacing that with USDH would redirect hundreds of millions in annual Treasury yield. Paxos has pledged 95% of reserve earnings to HYPE buybacks, Frax promised 100% of yield directly to users, Agora offered 100% of net yield alongside institutional custodianship, and Sky (ex-MakerDAO) proposed 4.85% returns plus a $25 million “Hyperliquid Star” project to bootstrap DeFi on the chain. Hyperliquid already commands nearly 80% of decentralized perpetuals trading. Whichever issuer wins the USDH contract won’t just be minting a stablecoin, they’ll be wiring themselves into the financial backbone of one of crypto’s fastest-growing exchanges. Market Movement: BTC: Currently trading at $114,053, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours and 2.1% over the past week, though still down 3.9% for the month. The move reflects a short-term rebound fueled by positive risk sentiment and steady demand, even as longer-term consolidation continues. ETH : ETH is trading at $4,373.99, up 2%, as investors shrug off a mass-slashing event that penalized over 30 validators. Gold: Gold held near $3,635 an ounce after Tuesday’s $3,674 peak as investors await U.S. inflation data that could shape Fed cuts, while ANZ raised its year-end gold target to $3,800 and sees a peak near $4,000 by June on strong investment demand and central-bank buying. Nikkei 225 : Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.23% and the Topix down 0.18%, after Wall Street hit record highs on Fed rate-cut hopes and upbeat inflation data. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a record 6,532.04 Wednesday after an unexpected drop in wholesale prices bolstered hopes for a Fed rate cut next week.

State Senator Keith Kelley, representing Calhoun and Talladega Counties, cautions that a loophole in the federal law could devastate rural economies unless Congress moves quickly to fix it. According to reports, Kelley stressed that small businesses, family farms, and community banks are the backbone of Alabama towns, and that he’s seen firsthand how strong policies and local support fuel rural growth. The new law, however, he says, could disrupt that system. The GENIUS Act provides cryptocurrency issuers a legal basis on which to function. This could pull deposits from small banks, Kelley says. He noted that community banks rely on local deposits to lend to local businesses and families. Kelly said that if people transfer their money into crypto platforms, such deposits would dry up, loans would contract, growth would stagnate, and jobs would be lost. Kelley adds that there are also fewer security rules for crypto platforms than for banks. They are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). They are still free to lure customers with rewards or incentives that appear to carry high interest. He worries that it could lure customers out of the safety of traditional banks. GENIUS Act ripple effects hit farms and small towns The GENIUS Act consequences could be dire, with local banks possibly ending up with fewer deposits, leading to less money to lend. Entrepreneurs may be compelled to defer or abandon new ventures. Farmers can find it challenging to purchase seeds or equipment during lean seasons. Families might find credit harder to come by. Townwide ripple effect, Kelley said that if community banks were to close, they would also affect the local towns. Farms, small shops, and Main Street businesses may not be able to withstand what he called not innovation but a direct assault on the financial health of rural America. Kelley also noted the potential for platforms to collapse. He pointed to several high-profile crypto collapses in the last few years in which customers lost their investments. There is no such thing as “insurance” for victims of cybercrime on the crypto platforms. In contrast, FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 in deposits if a bank goes under. GENIUS Act establishes stablecoin regulations, but spurs debate President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on July 18, 2025. It provides the first national structure for stablecoins, which are digital tokens backed by assets such as U.S. dollars or Treasury bonds. The statute would require full reserves , audits, and regular reporting by issuers. It also bars them from paying interest or providing yield-like products. Regulators have 18 months to develop rules before the GENIUS Act is enacted . Its supporters say the Act injects clarity into a fast-expanding corner of the financial system. They say it reduces risks by prohibiting risky lending and assuring that there are reserves. But even with guardrails, critics caution, stablecoins could draw money away from banks and pose new threats. It’s not just Alabama speaking out. Also in July, Europe’s largest asset manager, Amundi, warned that U.S. stablecoin policy could destabilize the global payment system. The group said stablecoins risk “quasi-bank” status that would circumvent regulatory scrutiny and undermine traditional lenders. Kelley says this resonates with his own fears for rural Alabama. He likens it to a Ponzi scheme and says Congress must amend the law and close loopholes jeopardizing local banks. He said that families, farmers, and small businesses are entitled to financial partners they can trust. He warned that unregulated crypto platforms should not lure rural communities onto their platforms in ways that undermine decades of progress across rural America.

According to the researcher, as of August 2025, only $26 billion in RWAs have been tokenized across all blockchains. This figure illustrates the early stage of adoption compared to projections for the sector’s long-term growth. Projections From Global Institutions SMQKE cited estimates from the World Economic Forum that suggest tokenization could eventually encompass up to $867 trillion in financial assets. The figure represents a significant share of global financial instruments, including equities, bonds, commodities, and other illiquid assets. The post emphasizes that settlements and payments tied to these assets could amount to hundreds of trillions of dollars in value, much of which could shift onto blockchain rails as adoption expands. XRPL → POSITIONED TO LEAD THE $867 TRILLION RWA TOKENIZATION WAVE • As of August 2025, only $26B in real-world assets (RWA) are tokenized across all blockchains. • The World Economic Forum projects that RWA tokenization could eventually encompass up to $867 trillion in… pic.twitter.com/zVNeeaFdlS — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 9, 2025 XRPL’s Role in RWA Tokenization The researcher referenced documentation describing the XRP Ledger as a “prime platform for RWA tokenization.” Institutional-grade infrastructure available on XRPL, including automated market makers, decentralized identifiers, multi-purpose tokens, and native stablecoin support, has been cited in reports as a strong foundation for tokenizing global assets . The post also pointed to the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, which has named XRPL among the leading platforms capable of supporting large-scale tokenization. Supporting Materials The attached materials in SMQKE’s post contained further details on the size of the opportunity and XRPL’s positioning. One excerpt from the Boston Consulting Group projected that $16 trillion in illiquid assets could be tokenized by 2030, while the World Economic Forum extended that projection to $867 trillion in financial assets. Other highlighted documents referenced OpenEden’s work in tokenizing U.S. Treasury Bills on XRPL , describing this development as a pivotal step that allows investors to mint tokenized assets and integrate them into stablecoin markets, including those linked to the U.S. dollar. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 SMQKE’s post presents a case for XRPL as a leading contender to capture a significant share of the tokenization market . While tokenization remains in its early phases, the scale of the projections from global institutions underscores the potential growth of this sector. By highlighting the combination of current adoption levels, long-term forecasts, and endorsements of XRPL’s infrastructure, the researcher frames the ledger as positioned for institutional use in the transition toward blockchain-based financial assets.

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has raised sharp concerns about the lack of transparency in the crypto bill process, accusing Republicans of releasing a 182-page draft without consulting Democrats or disclosing industry input. Warren argued that such an approach threatens bipartisan cooperation, warning that lobbyist-driven legislation risks creating unfair advantages in the crypto industry. “Instead of working with us, Republicans have produced partisan drafts reflecting secret feedback from industry,” Warren said, urging for more openness and collaboration. Democrats Release Their Own Framework In response, Senate Democrats unveiled a six-page framework outlining their priorities for crypto regulation . The document highlights seven key pillars, including consumer protections, preventing corruption, clarifying regulatory jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, and ensuring fair oversight of DeFi. Although far less detailed than the Republican draft, the Democratic framework signals an intent to participate in shaping comprehensive legislation. Pro-crypto Democrats such as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Mark Warner endorsed the framework, stressing the need for rules that balance innovation with investor safeguards. However, the disparity between a detailed 182-page proposal and a broad framework leaves Democrats at a structural disadvantage in negotiations, potentially allowing Republicans to set the terms of the debate. What to Expect for the Crypto Bill The bill itself seeks to clarify how crypto assets fit into U.S. regulatory regimes, with provisions exempting staking, airdrops, and decentralized infrastructure projects from securities laws under certain conditions . Critics, however, question whether these exemptions could weaken consumer protections while favoring industry interests. Warren, one of the Senate’s most vocal crypto skeptics, insists that bipartisan legislation must be rooted in transparency and accountability rather than industry influence. The White House is also pressing lawmakers to move quickly, with new crypto adviser Patrick Witt pushing for a final draft that can attract bipartisan support. However, partisan friction, lobbying concerns, and questions over regulatory agency appointments remain major hurdles. With both parties staking their ground, the coming weeks could determine whether the U.S. moves toward a unified regulatory framework or whether political divisions stall progress once again.

51525633,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=819538,1757556054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51525633.jpeg,Cardano Founder Hoskinson Says Ethereum Is Doomed To Fail: Here’s How,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-founder-ethereum-doomed-to-fail/,"In a wide-ranging CoinDesk interview released yesterday, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sharpened a years-long critique of Ethereum’s long-term viability, arguing that the network’s reliance on rollups and external scaling layers has created economic incentives that will ultimately hollow out the base chain. While acknowledging Ethereum’s technical progress, he contended that “as a general-purpose, smart-contract ledger,” the project has nurtured an ecosystem that “will slowly but surely eat [it] alive.” Why Ethereum Is Doomed To Fail: Cardano Founder Hoskinson framed the core problem as one of misaligned incentives between Ethereum’s L1 and its expanding constellation of L2s. “To make Ethereum better, they’ve had to embrace layer twos,” he said. “The layer twos are not strong allies… they’re partners of necessity.” In his view, rollup teams “don’t particularly care if they’re attached to Solana or they become a layer one,” so if better economics or user growth lie elsewhere, “they could simply migrate or go multi-chain.” New applications and liquidity, he added, are already “outside of the Ethereum ecosystem,” eroding the network’s historical network effects. Related Reading: Cardano Pushes Past $0.85: Falling Wedge Breakout Confirmed? “So if they’re gobbling up the transaction volume and gobbling up the users and they’re gobbling up the token appreciation, if there’s a more attractive target, they could simply migrate or go multi-chain,” Hoskinson said, adding that this trend is already observable with LayerZero and Espresso. That erosion, Hoskinson argued, is set to accelerate as two external forces gather momentum. First, he described Bitcoin DeFi as a “sleeping giant” that could attract “hundreds of billions” in total value once primitives such as stablecoins, DEXs and lending are built with credible security assumptions. “When Bitcoin wakes up… its TVL will be… larger than the market cap of Ethereum,” he said, noting that sovereigns and major asset managers would likely prefer to build around Bitcoin exposure. Second, he expects large technology platforms and traditional financial institutions to enter with their own infrastructure, adjacent to public chains but not economically dependent on Ethereum’s base layer—“Microsoft… Google… Amazon… have no incentive to go boost Ethereum or deploy on Ethereum,” he said. The technological arc, in Hoskinson’s telling, also tilts away from shared-state blockchains. As zero-knowledge proofs and “proof-carrying code” mature, more computation can be executed off-chain—in secure enclaves, on devices, or within MPC systems—leaving the chain to verify succinct proofs. “Why… spend billions of dollars a year maintaining this very weak computer that’s shared and replicated,” he asked, “when you can turn it into a distributed problem that runs everywhere?” Like Microsoft missing mobile and pivoting from Windows dominance to Azure, he suggested, Ethereum may ultimately need to “pivot to a new McGuffin” to retain relevance even if it remains present in the stack. Related Reading: Cardano Sentiment Crashes To 5-Month Low As ADA Defends Key Price Level Notably, Hoskinson’s assessment was not unqualified dismissal. He credited Ethereum for “keeping up with the times,” investing in rollups and zero-knowledge technology, and building a “Goliath” ecosystem that survived early funding scares and the DAO crisis. “They’ve done some really incredible things,” he said, and he allowed that “it’s entirely possible that Ethereum could pivot… and get very good at that” new role. The nub of his skepticism is not competence but structure: in his view, the more rollups succeed, the less compelling the L1 becomes as the economic hub. The remarks reprise and elaborate on a stance Hoskinson aired earlier this year, when he said during an AMA: “I don’t think Ethereum will survive more than 10 to 15 years,” predicting that L2s would “suckle out all of the alpha.” Hoskinson’s analysis also folds into his own current bets for Cardano. He cast Bitcoin-centric DeFi as a three-rule design target—security derived from Bitcoin, fees paid in Bitcoin, and yields returned in Bitcoin—and argued that companion chains and trust-minimized bridges will be necessary to make it work. He presented Cardano’s extended-UTXO design and its privacy sidechain Midnight as infrastructure positioned to serve that market while offering selective-disclosure compliance for institutions. At press time, ADA traded at $0.89.

The company’s latest release, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, comes with a 2-terabyte storage option and a $1,999 price tag, marking the first time an iPhone has approached the $2,000 mark. Analysts have highlighted that the tech giant could not have set a higher product price unless it was certain that many users were ready to pay it. Reliable sources have highlighted that Apple’s increased price on its iPhone products is due to US President Donald Trump’s threatening tariff policies on imports from China. Following this, tech experts have predicted a significant price increase for iPhone 17 as we get closer to its launch this week. Trump’s tariff policies significantly affect the prices of iPhone products Initially, when the iPhone maker introduced the iPhone X in 2017, it did not just initiate itself in a competition to display stylish smartphones but also marked the existence of a new market for smartphones priced at $1,000. For eight years now, that price has barely changed. Instead of reducing, a significant increase in iPhone prices has been observed. Even with inflationary pressure and technological improvements, the iPhone 17 Pro’s value starts at $1,099. Notably, this price is $100 more than its predecessor. Additionally, when comparing the price of iPhone’s basic model, which is $799, with that of its similar 2017 model, the current model’s price is $100 higher than that of the similar older model. Even though the tech giant has significantly pushed its iPhone prices up, it is worth noting that it has done the adjustments cautiously. To illustrate, as Apple increased the price of the pro models from $999 to $1,099, it reduced the impact by doubling its starting storage to 256 gigabytes. Apart from the pro models, the new iPhone Air, which was created to replace the iPhone 16 Plus, was also subjected to a price increase of $100 to be valued at $999. In response to the market tension that Trump’s tariff policies created, some Apple users hurriedly bought iPhone products earlier this year, fearing possible extra cost in the future. However, research from sources revealed that the tariff impacts on Apple’s products were quite small. Still, analysts have highlighted that this cautious approach will not last forever, and Apple will not be able to cover tariff expenses forever. Moreover, moving iPhone production from China or India will not entirely solve the problem. Despite these challenges, Apple made public its intention to launch its first affordable iPhone in 2026. This device will feature capabilities that compete with those of Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Samsung. iPhone devices set to cost even higher in the future Concerning the increasing prices of iPhone products, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, mentioned that he believed its users could spend more money on the devices. During a 2023 earnings call, Cook stated that people were willing to increase their budget to get the best they can afford in iPhone categories. He said iPhone devices have been essential in individuals’ everyday lives. The CEO also pointed out the advantages the devices brought about. Based on his argument, iPhones can be used to make payments, control smart-home devices, track one’s health information, and store banking details. Cook highlighted that Apple is working on releasing “iPhone 20,” which will be launched on its 20th anniversary. This new device is expected to display significant changes just as the iPhone X did when it was launched. It is anticipated that, as the iPhone X had set a standard for $1,000 smartphones, the iPhone 20 could open the way for even higher prices. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have once again captured the spotlight, recording an impressive net inflow of $741 million on September 10th. This isn’t just a number; it represents the largest single-day influx since July 17th, signaling a robust resurgence of investor confidence and institutional interest. What’s driving this remarkable trend? What’s Behind the Massive Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflow? According to data from TraderT, this significant milestone marks the third consecutive trading day of net inflows, painting a clear picture of sustained positive momentum. The breakdown reveals strong participation from key players, underscoring the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge with a substantial $299 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT followed closely, attracting $211 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB also saw considerable interest, bringing in $145 million. Crucially, no Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows, further emphasizing positive investor sentiment. This collective movement suggests strategic positioning by institutions, potentially anticipating future price appreciation. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Gaining Such Traction Now? The renewed enthusiasm for Spot Bitcoin ETFs stems from several converging factors. Firstly, increasing U.S. regulatory clarity provides security for institutional investors, making them comfortable allocating capital. Moreover, Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against inflation continues to attract attention amidst global economic uncertainties. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, historically a catalyst for rallies, might be prompting early positioning. Investors are aware of supply-side economics, where reduced new Bitcoin supply often leads to increased demand. The accessibility of ETFs also simplifies the investment process, removing direct crypto custody complexities. The Broader Impact of Robust Spot Bitcoin ETFs Activity This substantial inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs has significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It injects fresh capital and enhances market liquidity, potentially stabilizing prices. Consistent institutional money lends credibility to Bitcoin, attracting more retail investors. This positive feedback loop fosters a healthier ecosystem for digital assets. However, while inflows indicate demand, the crypto market remains dynamic. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider risk tolerance. The long-term impact depends on sustained interest and broader market conditions, but the current trend is undeniably optimistic. The recent $741 million surge into Spot Bitcoin ETFs powerfully demonstrates Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its growing integration into mainstream finance. This isn’t a fleeting moment; it’s a clear signal of building institutional confidence, paving the way for further adoption and potentially a more stable crypto market. ETF performance will be a key indicator of market health. Frequently Asked Questions About Spot Bitcoin ETFs What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? An exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are the recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs significant? The $741 million net inflow is the largest single-day inflow since July 17th and the third consecutive day of net inflows, indicating strong institutional confidence. Which ETFs saw the largest inflows? Fidelity’s FBTC led with $299 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT ($211M), and Ark Invest’s ARKB ($145M). How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs benefit investors? They offer a regulated, accessible, and convenient way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing direct crypto custody. What could be driving this increased interest? Factors include increasing regulatory clarity, Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value, anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, and ease of access via ETFs. Did you find this analysis helpful?

HTX data shows that capital gravitated toward specific niches, with tokens in the DeFi, AI, and Layer-1 sectors posting significant gains. Layer-1 Ecosystem: Emerging Public Chains Lead the Way L1 public chains delivered a solid performance, becoming a key focus area. Their upward moves reflected not only market demand for foundational infrastructure, but also a re-pricing of growth potential tied to new app deployments and user adoption. ● M (MEME, L1): With a remarkable 178% gain this week, MemeCore (M) was the most impressive performer. As the first Layer-1 chain built specifically for “Meme 2.0,” it challenges the traditional model of meme projects relying on major chains. ● SOON : Up 41% this week, signaling heightened investor interest in new L1 narratives. Compared to traditional public chains, SOON is committed to providing more efficient and lower-cost infrastructure to support the large-scale rollout of Web3 applications. DeFi Rebound: Renewed Confidence and Capital Inflows The broad-based rally in DeFi wasn’t coincidental. On one front, institutional capital poured in—via RWA, compliant lending products, and 401(k) crypto allocations—injecting durable momentum. Simultaneously, renewed bull sentiment among retail participants reignited demand for on-chain yields. As technology continues to evolve, new use cases have re-emerged, driving capital back into the space. The strong performance of several legacy DeFi projects indicates restored confidence and could signal the start of a new wave of competitive. ● RED : Up 63% this week. While its listing on Upbit provided a boost, the project’s core strength lies in RedStone (RED)’s rise as one of the fastest-growing DeFi oracle networks. ● EIGEN : Up 18% this week. Fueled by ETH reserve staking momentum, EigenLayer (EIGEN) hit a new TVL milestone of over $22 billion in August—marking a historic high. AI Sector: Steady Progress of Key Projects The integration of AI and blockchains is driven by both technological innovation and market attention. Investors continue to favor projects with practical use cases and strong ecosystem development potential. ● WLD : Up 28% this week. With dual support from AI and identity authentication sectors, Worldcoin (WLD) has maintained a strong upward momentum. ● BUZZ : Up 20% this week. The rally of Hive AI (Buzz) is mainly driven by its capability of attracting significant investor and user attention as a Defi Agent. BTC Layer 2: A New Force Emerges The BTC Layer 2 ecosystem is gradually demonstrating its practical application value. This growth reflects both short-term market sentiment and a long-term investment logic built on the sector’s infrastructure and ecosystem potential. MERL : Up 25% this week. As the native token of Merlin Chain, MERL enhances Bitcoin’s transaction speed and scalability through Layer 2 networks, improving BTC’s utility in payment, staking, and smart contract scenarios. Market Outlook: New Opportunities Amidst Fluctuations Historically, September has typically been a relatively weak month for Bitcoin, with returns often negative, reflecting investor caution due to volatility and risk. However, current market-positive factors are gradually accumulating: The inclusion of crypto assets in 401(k) pension plans provides support for long-term capital inflows; and expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts may improve overall risk preferences. These two forces are expected to positively impact the market, potentially opening up new structural opportunities and upward trends for crypto assets amidst ongoing fluctuations.

Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a colossal Galaxy Digital USDC transfer : 319,425,123 USDC, valued at approximately $319 million, moved from an unknown wallet to Galaxy Digital. This transaction, massive in scale, prompts important questions about market dynamics and institutional activity in the digital asset space. What Does This Galaxy Digital USDC Transfer Signify? When such a substantial amount of a stablecoin like USDC moves, it is rarely a simple retail transaction. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable. Its primary use is for facilitating large transactions, providing liquidity, and acting as a safe haven during market volatility without converting to fiat currency. Galaxy Digital, on the other hand, is a leading financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They offer a range of services, including trading, asset management, and investment banking for institutional clients. Therefore, a large Galaxy Digital USDC transfer suggests significant institutional maneuvering. The Mechanics of a Whale Move: How Does Such a Large USDC Transfer Happen? The term “unknown wallet” often sparks curiosity. It typically refers to an address not publicly associated with a known exchange or entity. However, in the institutional crypto world, this could mean several things: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desk Activity: Large institutions often prefer OTC desks for privacy and to avoid market impact. This transfer could be part of an OTC trade settlement. Internal Rebalancing: Galaxy Digital might be rebalancing its own reserves or those of a large client. Client Deposit: A new or existing institutional client could be depositing a substantial amount of capital to engage in trading, lending, or other investment activities through Galaxy Digital. These transactions are executed on the blockchain, offering transparency in terms of amount and destination, even if the sender’s identity remains private. The efficiency and security of these large-scale transfers are a testament to the underlying blockchain technology. Potential Implications: Why is This Galaxy Digital USDC Transfer Important? A transaction of this magnitude can have several profound implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Liquidity: A significant inflow of USDC into an institutional platform like Galaxy Digital can enhance market liquidity, making it easier for large trades to occur without causing drastic price swings. Institutional Confidence: Such large movements often signal growing institutional confidence and participation in the crypto space. It indicates that major players are actively engaging with digital assets. Future Investment Potential: The USDC could be earmarked for future investments in various cryptocurrencies, providing capital for market growth, or for participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Market Sentiment: While not a direct price driver, large institutional activity can positively influence market sentiment, suggesting a healthy and maturing ecosystem. Understanding these potential impacts helps investors gauge the evolving landscape of digital finance. The Galaxy Digital USDC transfer provides a snapshot into the ongoing institutionalization of crypto. Navigating the Crypto Waters: What Should Investors Consider After a Galaxy Digital USDC Transfer? While a large institutional transfer like this is generally a positive sign for market maturity, individual investors should approach the information with a balanced perspective. It is crucial to remember that: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the broader market trends and specific assets before making investment decisions. Observe Market Reactions: Pay attention to how the market reacts to such news. Is there an increase in trading volume for certain assets? Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Institutional movements often reflect long-term strategies rather than immediate speculative plays. This event underscores the growing integration of traditional finance players into the digital asset ecosystem. The continuous flow of capital into established crypto firms like Galaxy Digital highlights a dynamic and evolving industry. The recent Galaxy Digital USDC transfer of over $319 million is more than just a large number; it is a powerful indicator of the increasing institutional involvement and maturity within the cryptocurrency market. From facilitating large OTC trades to potentially funding new investment strategies, this whale move reinforces the pivotal role stablecoins play in the digital economy. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these significant transactions provides valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and the direction of institutional capital. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning one USDC is always redeemable for one US dollar. It is widely used for digital transactions due to its stability and speed. Who is Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital is a leading financial services and investment management company focused on the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They provide services to institutional clients. Why are large USDC transfers important? Large USDC transfers, often referred to as “whale moves,” are significant because they typically involve institutional players or very wealthy individuals. They can signal increased market liquidity, institutional confidence, or upcoming investment activities. Does this transfer guarantee a price increase for cryptocurrencies? No, a large USDC transfer does not guarantee a price increase. While it can signal increased institutional interest and potential future investments, market prices are influenced by many factors. Investors should always conduct their own research. How can I track similar transactions? Services like Whale Alert track and report large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Following such services can provide insights into significant market movements. If you found this analysis of the Galaxy Digital USDC transfer insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

This sustained positive momentum signals growing investor confidence and institutional interest in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. What’s Driving the Remarkable Momentum in Spot ETH ETFs ? According to data from TraderT, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs recorded a substantial net inflow of $171.68 million on September 10. This follows another day of positive flows, underscoring a consistent trend of capital entering these investment vehicles. This two-day streak highlights a shift in market sentiment and increased adoption. Several key players are leading this charge, demonstrating strong institutional backing: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the inflows with an impressive $74.68 million. BlackRock’s significant participation often validates new asset classes for traditional investors. Fidelity’s FETH: Followed closely with $49.50 million in net inflows. Fidelity is another major financial institution whose involvement lends considerable credibility. Notably, no Spot ETH ETFs experienced net outflows during this period, indicating a broad-based positive sentiment across the board. This collective buying pressure suggests a robust demand for regulated Ethereum exposure. Why Are Spot ETH ETFs Capturing Investor Attention? The growing appeal of Spot ETH ETFs stems from several compelling factors that make them an attractive option for both institutional and retail investors: Accessibility: ETFs provide an easier, more familiar way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases, wallet management, or security concerns. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within a regulated framework, these ETFs offer a layer of security and oversight that many investors find reassuring. This compliance helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. Institutional Validation: The active participation of financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity acts as a strong endorsement. Their involvement often encourages other institutional investors to consider similar allocations, further boosting inflows into Spot ETH ETFs . Furthermore, the ability to trade these products on traditional stock exchanges simplifies the investment process, making Ethereum more accessible to a broader audience. Consequently, this increased access can lead to greater liquidity and market stability for Ethereum. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Considerations for Spot ETH ETFs The continued positive inflows into Spot ETH ETFs present significant opportunities for the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Increased demand through these regulated products could potentially lead to greater price stability and upward momentum for ETH itself. Moreover, it signifies a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly integrated into mainstream financial portfolios. However, investors should also consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: While ETFs offer regulated exposure, the underlying asset, Ethereum, remains subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate significantly based on market news, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related products is still evolving globally. Future policy changes could impact the operations or attractiveness of Spot ETH ETFs . For those considering investment, conducting thorough due diligence and understanding your risk tolerance remains paramount. The long-term trajectory for Spot ETH ETFs appears promising, but informed decisions are always key. Compelling Summary The sustained influx of capital into Spot ETH ETFs , highlighted by BlackRock and Fidelity’s leading contributions, marks a significant milestone for Ethereum and the broader crypto market. This two-day positive streak not only reflects growing institutional confidence but also signals a broader acceptance of digital assets within traditional financial frameworks. As these regulated investment products gain traction, they pave the way for increased accessibility and a more mature investment landscape for Ethereum, promising an exciting future for the asset class. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Spot ETH ETFs? Spot ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment products that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements through a regulated investment vehicle traded on traditional stock exchanges, without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency. Why are net inflows into Spot ETH ETFs important? Net inflows indicate that more money is being invested into these ETFs than is being withdrawn. This signifies strong investor demand and positive market sentiment. For Ethereum, it suggests growing institutional and retail interest, which can contribute to price stability and potential appreciation. Who are the main players in the Spot ETH ETF market? Currently, major financial institutions like BlackRock (with its ETHA fund) and Fidelity (with FETH) are prominent players. Their involvement is crucial as it lends credibility and attracts significant capital from traditional finance. How do Spot ETH ETFs differ from direct ETH ownership? Spot ETH ETFs offer a regulated, often simpler, way to invest in Ethereum. You buy shares of the ETF, not the actual ETH. Direct ownership means you purchase ETH on a crypto exchange and manage it in a digital wallet, which offers more control but also carries responsibilities like security and self-custody. Is now a good time to invest in Spot ETH ETFs? Investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. While recent inflows indicate positive momentum, the crypto market remains volatile. It is advisable to conduct thorough research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment.

Is An XRP ETF Filing Coming?,https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-buy-via-coinbase/,"The Ripple community is once again caught up in speculation after data showed a steep drop in Coinbase’s XRP holdings . Instead of seeing it as a sell-off, some commentators believe the decline could be linked to BlackRock quietly moving into position through Coinbase Custody. The rumors are persistent, even though BlackRock has already shot down earlier claims about a Spot XRP ETF filing. Nonetheless, this has left many to wonder if there’s more happening behind the scenes than the company is willing to admit. Coinbase’s Holdings And BlackRock Rumor Recent on-chain data revealed that Coinbase’s XRP stash has decreased drastically since the second quarter of 2025. This decrease has seen the amount of coins held by Coinbase fall from 780.13 million to about 199 million, with a 57% fall in August alone. Considering the scale of this decline, the movement has stirred up different rumors. Some investors are of the notion that these are actually intended sell-offs by Coinbase, while others are of the notion that they are only strategic transfers involving institutions. Crypto analyst Crypto X AiMan addressed the situation in a video posted on the social media platform X, where he noted that Coinbase is not dumping the coin, despite claims circulating within the community. According to the analyst, the reduction is more likely linked to BlackRock, and his team had previously highlighted multiple BlackRock-XRP connections. As such, he admonished investors not to interpret the drop in Coinbase’s wallets as bearish but rather as a sign of shifting custody arrangements, possibly connected to the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock’s Position On An XRP ETF Comments about BlackRock’s interest in the digital asset are growing louder each day, but it is worth noting that the company has already denied reports of filing for a Spot XRP ETF. A company spokesperson for BlackRock recently clarified that no such product has been filed with the SEC. Nevertheless, the decrease in Coinbase’s wallets coincides with recent developments involving BlackRock’s partnership with Coinbase , which suggests that an official move relating to a Spot XRP ETF could be in the works. Given BlackRock’s embrace of other crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum , it is only a matter of time before the altcoin joins the lineup. Although BlackRock has not confirmed any intentions, the rumors alone have increased interest among many holders, as shown by comments on social media. As many as eight other asset managers have filed fo r a Spot XRP ETF with the SEC , and many investors are still anticipating that a formal filing might arrive sooner than expected. At the time of writing, the connection between Coinbase’s reduced holdings and BlackRock is speculative, but as the third-largest crypto by market cap, the idea of Spot XRP ETFs hitting the market soon should not be ruled out.",XRP|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|coinbase|Crypto X AiMan|Ethereum|Spot XRP ETFs|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-11 03:00:05

Atkins Declares End To ‘Weaponization’ Of Regulation Delivering a keynote address at the inaugural OECD roundtable on global financial markets, Atkins expressed his commitment to unlocking the potential of digital assets in the United States, highlighting the impact of new technologies on global finance. Related Reading: WLFI Price Dips 7% As Eric Trump Leaves World Liberty Treasury Company ALT5 Sigma Atkins criticized the previous SEC approach under former chair Gary Gensler, which he described as a “weaponization” of regulatory powers that stifled the crypto industry. The Commissioner pointed out that this “enforcement-centric strategy” not only proved ineffective but also drove innovation overseas, burdening American entrepreneurs with costly legal defenses. He asserted that those days are over and that the SEC is embarking on a new chapter. The SEC under Atkins aims to establish “clear and predictable regulations” that will enable innovation to flourish. He indicated that the agency will no longer rely on ad hoc enforcement actions to set policy. As Congress works on legislation, the SEC is set to modernize its rules through what it has termed “Project Crypto.” This initiative seeks to adapt existing securities regulations to accommodate the digital asset landscape, ensuring that most crypto tokens are clearly classified as non-securities. Future Of Crypto Regulation Atkins also highlighted the need for regulatory efficiency, advocating for a minimum effective dose of regulation to protect investors without overburdening entrepreneurs with complex rules that only large incumbents can navigate. He emphasized the potential for innovation through “super-app” trading platforms that could combine trading, lending, and staking services under a unified regulatory framework. Related Reading: Solana And XRP ETFs Smash New Records In Canada Atkins further unveiled that the Securities and Exchange Commission also plans to collaborate with other regulatory bodies to create a cohesive environment that permits the trading of crypto assets alongside traditional financial services. The regulator praised the European Union (EU) for its stance on digital assets, specifically referencing the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which he sees as a model for regulatory clarity. Atkins expressed a desire for the United States to learn from these efforts, ensuring that America remains a leader in fostering an economic climate conducive to financial innovation. In closing, Atkins articulated a vision for a future where breakthroughs in the financial industry are made on American soil, under American oversight, ultimately benefiting American investors. He welcomed the opportunity to work with international allies to enhance economic collaboration and extend the sphere of freedom and prosperity in the financial markets, including the fast-growing cryptocurrency space.

In a recent post on X, the former Goldman Sachs executive pointed to the TOTAL3 market cap chart, highlighting that its current structure is impossible to ignore. You can't help but stare at this chart… Total market cap ex BTC and ETH. pic.twitter.com/Ip44qy1GwE — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) September 9, 2025 Understanding the TOTAL3 Market Cap The TOTAL3 index measures the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin and Ethereum. By excluding the two largest digital assets, the index places XRP at the top of the altcoin category. At present, TOTAL3 is valued at $1.09 trillion, reflecting a 3% increase since the beginning of this week. Pal emphasized that the chart is approaching the resistance line of a large descending triangle, a pattern that has contained price action since TOTAL3 hit $1.13 trillion in November 2021. Previous attempts to break out, including one during December 2024 when the index touched $1.16 trillion, were unsuccessful. With the index once again nearing the same level, Pal believes the market could soon face a decisive moment. Historical Parallels to 2020 Breakout The optimism is partly based on market behaviour during 2020. At that time, TOTAL3 broke above a similar descending triangle structure, sparking a dramatic rise from roughly $65 billion to more than $1.1 trillion by late 2021. That move coincided with one of the most significant altcoin rallies in history, as funds rotated out of Bitcoin and Ethereum into smaller-cap assets, many of which reached new record highs. Pal suggested that a comparable breakout now could initiate another period of rapid expansion for altcoins, with XRP and other large-cap tokens positioned to lead. Bitcoin Dominance Weakens Another factor supporting this outlook is the decline in Bitcoin’s market share. After peaking near 66% in June, Bitcoin dominance has fallen by nearly 12%. The metric now sits at 58.20% and has logged three consecutive days of decline. This shift reflects growing investor interest in altcoins, particularly as Ethereum and other leading projects show renewed momentum. Analysts often view falling Bitcoin dominance as an early indicator of an “ altseason ”, where non-BTC assets outperform. Pal has previously compared the current environment to the 2017 cycle, pointing to both technical patterns and macroeconomic conditions, including the weakening U.S. dollar, as drivers that could fuel a similar outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Pal has not singled out many individual tokens, he has consistently noted his confidence in XRP’s potential. In August, he stated that XRP could achieve new highs once the broader market enters its next bullish phase. With TOTAL3 approaching critical resistance and Bitcoin’s share of the market slipping, conditions appear to be aligning with his projection. For now, the TOTAL3 chart remains the key metric to watch. A confirmed breakout above long-standing resistance could validate Pal’s bullish thesis and mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge , with XRP expected to play a leading role.

ETH is now consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears $4,400. Ethereum is now eyeing an upside break above the $4,400 zone. The price is trading above $4,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,330 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above $4,380 and $4,400. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it formed a base above the $4,220 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,320 and $4,350 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $4,330 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even climbed above $4,400 before there was a pullback. The recent low was formed at $4,300 and the price is testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,450 swing high to the $4,300 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,375 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,415 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,450 swing high to the $4,300 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,450 level. A clear move above the $4,450 resistance might send the price toward the $4,550 resistance. An upside break above the $4,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,650 resistance zone or even $4,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,415 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,335 level. The first major support sits near the $4,280 zone. A clear move below the $4,280 support might push the price toward the $4,240 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,160.

OKX, a leading global crypto exchange, has announced the upcoming launch of SKY perpetual futures . This exciting new trading instrument is set to go live on September 11th at 11:30 a.m. UTC. For traders keen on the SKY token, this move by OKX offers substantial leverage and dynamic trading opportunities. What Exactly Are SKY Perpetual Futures? Perpetual futures contracts allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without owning it. Unlike traditional futures, they have no expiry date.

This figure highlights the intense volatility and leveraged trading activity currently present. Leading this substantial wave of liquidations was Ethereum (ETH), capturing a major share of the market’s recent turbulence. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the specifics, let’s understand what crypto futures liquidations truly mean. When traders use leverage in futures contracts, they essentially borrow funds to amplify their potential gains. However, this also magnifies potential losses. A liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a certain threshold, forcing their positions to be automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses. These events are crucial because they can trigger cascading effects, adding further pressure to market prices. Large-scale liquidations often signal periods of high volatility and can act as a barometer for market sentiment. Breaking Down the $127.2 Million Impact The past 24 hours presented a vivid picture of this market dynamic. Here’s how the major players fared in terms of crypto futures liquidations : Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $41.84 million in liquidations. Interestingly, 87.08% of these came from short positions. This means a vast majority of traders betting on a price decline were caught off guard as BTC’s price likely moved upwards or stabilized unexpectedly. Ethereum (ETH): Led the pack with $65.21 million in liquidations. Unlike Bitcoin, the split was more balanced, with 52.38% from short positions. This indicates significant volatility impacting both bullish and bearish leveraged traders on the Ethereum network. Solana (SOL): Accounted for $20.15 million in liquidations, with a substantial 86.93% originating from short positions. Similar to BTC, SOL’s price movement likely defied bearish expectations, leading to these forced closures. The high percentage of short liquidations for BTC and SOL suggests that the market experienced an unexpected upward swing or a strong rebound, catching bearish traders off guard. For ETH, the nearly even split implies a more whipsaw-like price action, punishing both sides. Understanding the Ripple Effect of Liquidations Why should investors pay attention to these figures? Large-scale crypto futures liquidations can have a significant ripple effect. When positions are forcibly closed, it often involves market orders that add selling or buying pressure, potentially exacerbating price movements. This can lead to further liquidations, creating a cascade that amplifies market swings. Moreover, these events serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with highly leveraged trading. While the allure of magnified profits is strong, the potential for rapid and substantial losses is equally real. Traders who fail to manage their risk effectively often find themselves on the wrong side of these market movements. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Traders For both seasoned and novice traders, understanding the dynamics of crypto futures liquidations offers vital lessons. Firstly, risk management is paramount. Employing stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, and diversifying portfolios are crucial strategies to mitigate exposure during volatile periods. Secondly, staying informed about market sentiment and technical indicators can provide an edge. While no strategy guarantees success, a well-researched approach can help traders anticipate potential shifts and react more effectively. The data from these liquidations can also be a contrarian indicator; often, a large flush of short positions might precede a local bottom, or a flush of long positions might precede a local top. In conclusion, the recent $127.2 million in crypto futures liquidations , with Ethereum at the forefront, underscores the intense and often unforgiving nature of the leveraged cryptocurrency market. It’s a powerful reminder that while digital assets offer exciting opportunities, they demand a disciplined approach to risk and a continuous understanding of market mechanics. Staying informed and adopting robust risk management practices are essential for navigating these turbulent waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, preventing further losses. Why did ETH lead the recent crypto futures liquidations? ETH led the liquidations due to significant price volatility within the 24-hour period, impacting both long and short leveraged positions, resulting in a high volume of forced closures. What is the difference between short and long liquidations? Short liquidations happen when traders betting on a price decline are forced to close their positions as the price moves up. Long liquidations occur when traders betting on a price increase are closed out as the price drops. How can traders avoid crypto futures liquidations? Traders can reduce the risk of liquidation by using less leverage, setting appropriate stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and having a clear risk management strategy. Do large liquidations affect the overall crypto market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can exacerbate market volatility, as the forced closure of positions can create additional buying or selling pressure, potentially leading to further price swings.

Early Thursday, the DAO behind the promising Ethereum zkEVM scalability project, Scroll (SCR), announced a temporary suspension of its governance operations. This critical development, first reported by crypto media outlet Wu Blockchain, signals a period of significant change and uncertainty for the project. What’s Happening with Scroll DAO Governance? The core of the issue lies in the temporary halt of the Scroll DAO ‘s governance. This means that decisions typically made through community voting and executive action are currently on hold. The suspension comes amidst reports of several key members of Scroll’s management team resigning. Such internal shifts often lead to operational pauses as organizations regroup and strategize their next steps. For those unfamiliar, Scroll is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, utilizing zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) technology. Its goal is to make Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper while maintaining robust security. The project has garnered considerable attention for its potential to significantly enhance Ethereum’s scalability. Therefore, any disruption to its core operations, especially governance, is noteworthy. Why Are Scroll DAO Executives Resigning? While the official announcement from Scroll confirmed the governance suspension and mentioned a redesign, specific reasons for the executive resignations have not been publicly detailed. This lack of explicit information naturally leads to speculation within the crypto community. Resignations in a decentralized project can stem from various factors, including: Differences in strategic vision for the Scroll DAO . Challenges in implementing decentralized governance models effectively. Personal reasons or new opportunities for the individuals involved. The impact of such departures can be substantial, especially if they involve individuals with deep institutional knowledge or leadership roles. The collective expertise and direction provided by a strong management team are crucial for any project, decentralized or not, to navigate its development roadmap successfully. The Road Ahead: Redesigning Scroll DAO Governance Scroll has publicly stated its intention to redesign its governance framework. This commitment suggests that the current pause is seen as a necessary step to build a more resilient and effective system. However, the absence of specific plans for the future leaves many questions unanswered. The community is eagerly awaiting details on what this redesign will entail. A successful governance redesign for the Scroll DAO could involve: Enhanced Decentralization: Implementing mechanisms that further distribute decision-making power. Clearer Roles and Responsibilities: Defining the functions of different committees or groups within the DAO. Improved Communication: Establishing transparent channels for updates and community feedback. Robust Conflict Resolution: Developing processes to address internal disputes and disagreements efficiently. The challenge lies in balancing the need for efficient decision-making with the principles of decentralization. Many DAOs grapple with this equilibrium, and Scroll’s experience highlights the ongoing evolution of these organizational structures. What Does This Mean for Scroll (SCR) Holders and Users? For current holders of the SCR token and users of the Scroll zkEVM, the temporary suspension of Scroll DAO governance might raise concerns. While the project’s underlying technology and development work are likely continuing, the pause in governance can create uncertainty regarding future direction and policy changes. It is essential for the Scroll team to provide transparent and timely updates to maintain community trust. Users might wonder about the stability of the platform, while investors could be concerned about the long-term viability and price action of the SCR token. Open communication about the redesign process, timelines, and the new structure will be paramount in reassuring the community and demonstrating a commitment to the project’s future. Navigating Uncertainty: The Future of Scroll DAO The current situation presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the Scroll DAO . While the immediate turmoil and executive resignations are concerning, the commitment to redesign governance could lead to a stronger, more sustainable decentralized structure. The crypto space is no stranger to projects evolving through periods of significant change, and often, these transformations result in more robust and community-driven initiatives. The focus now shifts to Scroll’s leadership to articulate a clear vision for its renewed governance. The community will be watching closely for concrete plans that demonstrate a path forward, ensuring the project’s continued development and its role in the broader Ethereum scaling landscape. Transparency, clear communication, and a well-defined roadmap will be crucial in restoring confidence and paving the way for Scroll’s next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Scroll DAO? The Scroll DAO is the decentralized autonomous organization governing Scroll, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution that uses zkEVM technology to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network. Q2: Why has Scroll DAO suspended its governance operations? The Scroll DAO temporarily suspended its governance operations following the resignations of several key management team members. This pause is intended to allow the organization to redesign its governance framework. Q3: What does “zkEVM” mean? zkEVM stands for “zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine.” It’s a technology that allows Layer 2 networks like Scroll to process transactions off the main Ethereum chain more efficiently, then submit cryptographic proofs (zero-knowledge proofs) back to Ethereum to ensure security and validity. Q4: How does this impact SCR token holders and users? The suspension creates uncertainty regarding future project direction and policy changes. While core development may continue, transparent and timely updates from the Scroll team are crucial to maintain community trust and address concerns about the platform’s stability and the token’s long-term viability. Q5: What are Scroll’s plans for the future? Scroll has announced its intention to redesign its governance. However, specific plans, timelines, and the new structure for the Scroll DAO have not yet been presented. The community awaits further details on this crucial next step. The unfolding situation with the Scroll DAO is a testament to the dynamic and often challenging nature of decentralized governance. As the project navigates this critical period, staying informed is key.

However, fresh on-chain data suggests that the cryptocurrency may be preparing for its next bullish wave, as miners are starting to show a structural shift in behavior. Bitcoin Miners Shift Strategy – New High Ahead? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Avocado_onchain, recent on-chain data hints at a structural shift in Bitcoin miner behavior. At the same time, various other metrics point toward increasing resilience in the Bitcoin network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap? The analyst brought attention to the Miners’ Position Index (MPI), a metric that has historically shown sharp increases in two scenarios – before a halving when miners strategically sell their holdings, and in late stages of a bull market when they dump their holdings on retail investors. For the uninitiated, the MPI measures the ratio of Bitcoin miners’ outflows – coins sent to exchanges – relative to their one-year moving average. A high MPI indicates that miners are selling more BTC than usual – signaling increased selling pressure – while a low MPI suggests miners are holding or accumulating. However, the current market cycle shows a different trend. While some pre-halving selling was evident, the late bull market sell-offs have been noticeably absent. According to Avocado_onchain, there could be two major reasons for the lack of sell-off. First, the approval and success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may have had some influence on holders. According to data from SoSoValue, the total net assets tied in spot BTC ETFs currently stand at $144.3 billion – representing 6.5% of BTC’s total market cap. The other potential reason for lukewarm sales of BTC at this stage of the market could be the digital asset’s rapidly rising adoption as a strategic reserve asset by major economies around the world. As a result, miners may be shifting from short-term gains to long-term accumulation. In addition, Bitcoin mining difficulty also recently reached a new ATH, as its growth curve developed a so-called “banana zone” of sharp increases. The surge in mining difficulty reflects rising participation in the Bitcoin network, in addition to strengthening its security. Opinion On BTC Is Split While the miners appear to be holding BTC for the long haul, some analysts predict that the top cryptocurrency may not be out of the woods yet. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto remarked that BTC may be heading below $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds $112,000 Support As Binance Whale Activity Cools Off – What’s Ahead? That said, other analysts are more optimistic about BTC’s prospects. In a recent analysis, fellow CryptoQuant contributor CoinCare stated that BTC may have another major leg up in the bull cycle. Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee forecasted that BTC may surge to $200,000 by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $114,139, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

51530002,578820,1757563243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51530002.jpeg,India’s Caution: Crypto Framework Delayed Over Systemic Risk Concerns–Reuters,https://bitcoinist.com/india-crypto-framework-systemic-risk-concerns/,"A recent Reuters report reveals that India is leaning toward avoiding the establishment of a comprehensive legislative framework for regulating cryptocurrency, which is in stark contrast to countries like the United States. Instead, the Indian government plans to maintain partial oversight, driven by concerns that fully integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system could pose alleged “systemic risks.” India Delays Crypto Legislation A document reviewed by Reuters details the Indian government’s perspective and reflects the views of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The document argues that effectively managing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies through regulation would be challenging. The global acceptance of cryptocurrencies has grown significantly, particularly in the US, where President Donald Trump has led a new regulatory era for the digital asset industry with the passage of key bills aimed at fostering a more supportive environment for the adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, while China maintains a ban on cryptocurrencies, it is reportedly considering a Yuan-backed stablecoin . Other countries, such as Japan and Australia, are developing regulatory frameworks for digital assets as well. The Indian government document suggests that formal regulation of cryptocurrencies could lend them “legitimacy” and potentially make the sector systemic. This is not the first time India has grappled with the issue of digital asset regulation. In 2021, the government drafted a bill aimed at banning private cryptocurrencies but ultimately chose not to advance the legislation. During its G20 presidency in 2023, India called for a global framework to regulate digital assets, but plans to issue a discussion paper on the country’s stance were postponed. The government indicated it would reassess its position after observing how the US formalizes cryptocurrency usage. Stablecoins Threatening Digital Payment Integrity? Currently, global digital asset exchanges are allowed to operate in India, provided they register with a local government agency that conducts due diligence to mitigate money laundering risks. However, the RBI has consistently warned about the dangers associated with cryptocurrencies, leading to a significant slowdown in trading activities between India’s formal financial system and digital assets. Despite these challenges, Indians have invested approximately $4.5 billion in various digital assets, although the document notes that this level of investment does not currently present a systemic risk to financial stability. The report also highlights the implications of the US adopting dollar-backed stablecoins and promoting them as payment instruments , especially after the passage of the GENIUS Act, a foundation for the full usage of these assets. The Indian government further asserted that the widespread use of stablecoins could risk fragmenting national payment systems, such as the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), thereby undermining the integrity of India’s digital payments landscape.

For those tracking the cryptocurrency market, the rapid ascent of disruptive technologies and their valuations might feel familiar. Perplexity, an AI-powered search startup, has reportedly secured a monumental $200 million in new capital, catapulting its valuation to an astonishing $20 billion. This significant startup funding round underscores the intense investor confidence in AI and its potential to redefine established industries. Perplexity AI’s Meteoric Rise: Unpacking the Latest Funding Round The recent capital injection into Perplexity AI is not just another funding announcement; it’s a statement. Valued at $20 billion, this round comes hot on the heels of previous successes, indicating a relentless growth trajectory. Just two months prior, the company reportedly raised $100 million at an $18 billion valuation. This rapid appreciation highlights the fervent investor appetite for promising AI ventures. Since its inception three years ago, Perplexity has accumulated an impressive $1.5 billion in total funding, according to PitchBook data. This aggressive fundraising strategy positions the company as a formidable player in the AI landscape. While the lead investor for this latest round remains undisclosed, previous rounds saw significant participation from major venture capital firms, including Accel, which led a $500 million round earlier this year at a $14 billion valuation. Such figures are not just numbers; they represent a collective belief in the transformative power of conversational AI and the potential for a new paradigm in how we interact with information. Let’s look at the impressive funding journey of Perplexity: Latest Round: $200 million at a $20 billion valuation. Two Months Prior: $100 million at an $18 billion valuation. Earlier This Year: $500 million at a $14 billion valuation (led by Accel). Total Funding: Approximately $1.5 billion since founding. What is AI Search and How Does Perplexity Challenge Google? At its core, AI search represents a significant evolution from traditional keyword-based search engines. Instead of merely presenting a list of links, AI search platforms like Perplexity provide conversational, direct answers to user queries, synthesizing information from various sources. This approach aims to deliver a more efficient and intuitive user experience, much like having a knowledgeable assistant at your fingertips. Perplexity’s ambition is clear: to challenge Google’s decades-long dominance in the search market. Google’s search engine has become synonymous with finding information online, but its model relies heavily on directing users to external websites, often cluttered with ads. Perplexity’s conversational AI offers a distinct alternative, promising a streamlined, ad-free experience that prioritizes direct answers. This fundamental difference is at the heart of its competitive strategy, aiming to capture a segment of users disillusioned with the current search paradigm. The Astonishing Ascent: Understanding Perplexity AI’s Valuation The staggering AI valuation of $20 billion for Perplexity AI raises important questions about the current state of the AI market. Several factors contribute to such high valuations: Disruptive Potential: Investors are betting on AI’s ability to disrupt massive, established markets like search, which generates hundreds of billions in revenue annually. Technological Edge: Perplexity’s advanced large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing capabilities are seen as a significant technological advantage. Rapid Adoption: The company’s user growth and engagement metrics likely demonstrate strong market acceptance for its conversational search product. Strategic Positioning: By directly challenging Google, Perplexity positions itself in a high-stakes, high-reward arena. Talent Acquisition: High valuations also enable startups to attract and retain top AI talent, which is fiercely competitive. These valuations reflect not just current performance but also the immense future potential perceived by investors. The narrative of an AI revolution is compelling, driving significant capital into companies at the forefront of this technological wave. Revenue Growth and Strategic Ambitions: Is Perplexity AI a True Google Competitor? Beyond impressive funding rounds, a startup’s viability is often measured by its revenue. Perplexity AI’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is reportedly approaching $200 million, a substantial figure for a company of its age. Last month, the company’s head of communication indicated an ARR of over $150 million, suggesting rapid growth in its revenue streams. This strong revenue performance, coupled with aggressive fundraising, paints a picture of a company with serious ambitions. Perhaps the most audacious move by Perplexity that cemented its status as a serious Google competitor was its offer in August to acquire Google’s Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. This offer came amidst antitrust allegations against Google by the Justice Department, which had proposed that Google sell its web browser. While a federal judge ultimately ruled that Google would not have to break up its search business, effectively allowing it to keep Chrome, Perplexity’s bid demonstrated its bold strategic thinking and its intent to fundamentally alter the search ecosystem. Such a move, even if unsuccessful, sends a clear signal to the market and its competitors about Perplexity’s long-term vision and financial backing. Implications for the AI Startup Ecosystem Perplexity AI’s journey offers valuable insights into the broader AI startup landscape. Its rapid funding and valuation increases are indicative of a buoyant market, where innovative AI solutions are attracting unprecedented levels of investment. This trend is likely to: Fuel Further Innovation: More capital flowing into AI encourages new startups and research, accelerating technological advancements. Intensify Competition: As more players enter the field, competition for talent, users, and market share will grow fierce. Raise Exit Expectations: High valuations set a precedent for future acquisitions and IPOs, influencing investor returns and startup strategies. Attract Regulatory Scrutiny: The rise of powerful AI entities and their potential impact on established markets may draw increased attention from regulators. However, it also raises questions about sustainability and potential market bubbles. While the current enthusiasm for AI is palpable, investors and entrepreneurs alike must remain mindful of the challenges that come with such rapid growth, including maintaining profitability and fending off well-resourced incumbents. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Perplexity AI and the Search Market? As Perplexity AI continues its impressive ascent, the future of AI search looks increasingly dynamic. The company’s ability to consistently secure significant startup funding and demonstrate strong revenue growth positions it as a key player to watch. Its direct challenge to Google’s long-standing dominance is not just about technology; it’s about redefining user expectations and offering a fresh perspective on how we access and process information online. The coming years will undoubtedly see intensified innovation in the AI search space. Perplexity will need to continue refining its conversational AI, expanding its feature set, and scaling its infrastructure to meet growing demand. Its ability to maintain user trust, provide accurate and unbiased information, and navigate the complex competitive landscape will be crucial to its sustained success. The ultimate outcome of this high-stakes battle between the established giant and the ambitious AI challenger will shape the future of internet search for everyone. Conclusion Perplexity AI’s reported $200 million funding round at a $20 billion valuation marks a pivotal moment in the AI industry. This substantial investment underscores the profound belief in conversational AI’s potential to revolutionize search, positioning Perplexity as a formidable Google competitor . With impressive revenue growth and bold strategic moves, Perplexity AI is not just another startup; it’s a rapidly emerging force that is actively reshaping the future of how we find and interact with information online. Its journey highlights the immense opportunities and challenges within the booming AI sector, signaling a new era of innovation and competition.

The current dynamics in the global financial landscape, particularly concerning Asia FX Performance and the US Dollar, are creating ripples that can affect everything from investor sentiment to liquidity. As markets brace for pivotal economic data, the muted activity in Asian currencies and the whipsawing US Dollar underscore a broader narrative of anticipation and uncertainty, directly influencing how capital flows, including into digital assets. Understanding Asia FX Performance in a Shifting Landscape Asian currencies are currently experiencing a period of relative calm, often described as ‘muted.’ This subdued movement, however, belies a complex interplay of regional economic factors and global monetary policy expectations. For crypto investors, understanding this stability, or lack thereof, in a key economic bloc provides context for broader market movements. What Factors are Shaping Asian Currencies Right Now? Several elements contribute to the current Asia FX Performance : Domestic Economic Data: While some Asian economies show resilience, others face headwinds from slowing global demand or domestic challenges. For example, export-oriented nations are particularly sensitive to global trade volumes. Central Bank Policies: Unlike the aggressive rate hikes seen in the West, many Asian central banks have adopted a more measured approach, or even eased policy, to support growth. This divergence impacts currency valuations. China’s Influence: As the region’s economic giant, China’s economic health and currency policy (Yuan) significantly influence its neighbors. Any shifts in the Yuan’s value or China’s growth trajectory can ripple across Asia FX. Geopolitical Developments: Regional tensions or trade disputes, though not always directly impacting daily FX, can create underlying uncertainty that keeps investors cautious. This muted environment means less dramatic swings, but it also indicates a wait-and-see approach by market participants, especially ahead of major economic releases. For those tracking the broader financial ecosystem, this stability in Asia could either signal a calm before a storm or a period of consolidation before a clearer trend emerges. Why is US Dollar Volatility the New Normal? While Asia FX remains relatively stable, the US Dollar has been anything but. Its recent ‘whipsaw’ movements – sharp, unpredictable swings – have become a defining characteristic of the current market. This US Dollar Volatility directly impacts global liquidity and risk appetite, factors that are highly relevant to the crypto market. What Drives the Dollar’s Unpredictable Swings? The Dollar’s recent behavior is a testament to the conflicting forces at play in the global economy: Federal Reserve Expectations: The primary driver remains the market’s perception of the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate path. Any hint of a more hawkish or dovish stance can send the Dollar soaring or plummeting. Risk Sentiment: During periods of global uncertainty or heightened risk aversion, the Dollar often acts as a safe-haven asset, strengthening as investors flock to its perceived safety. Conversely, when risk appetite returns, the Dollar may weaken. Economic Data Surprises: Stronger-than-expected US economic data, or weaker-than-expected data, can quickly alter rate expectations and trigger significant Dollar movements. Global Monetary Policy Divergence: As other major central banks (ECB, BoJ, BoE) also navigate their own inflation and growth challenges, their policy decisions create divergence that can impact the Dollar’s relative value. For crypto enthusiasts, a stronger Dollar can sometimes act as a headwind for risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors might prefer the safety of the greenback. Conversely, a weaker Dollar often signals increased liquidity and a greater appetite for risk, potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies. The Mounting Pressure for an Interest Rate Cut One of the most significant themes dominating financial markets today is the escalating anticipation of an Interest Rate Cut by major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve. This expectation is a key factor behind both the muted Asia FX and the volatile US Dollar. Why Are Rate Cut Bets Building So Strongly? The market’s conviction in impending rate cuts stems from several observations: Cooling Inflation: While still above target in some regions, inflation has generally shown a downward trend from its peaks, easing the pressure on central banks to maintain restrictive policies. Economic Slowdown Concerns: There are growing worries that prolonged high interest rates could stifle economic growth, potentially leading to a recession. Central banks might opt for cuts to stimulate activity. Lagged Effects of Policy: Monetary policy acts with a lag. Current economic data reflects past rate hikes, and central banks are keen to avoid overtightening, which could trigger a sharper downturn. Global Economic Health: Slower growth in major economies like China and Europe also adds to the global disinflationary pressure, providing more room for central banks to consider easing. The prospect of an Interest Rate Cut has profound implications. Lower rates generally make borrowing cheaper, encourage investment, and can boost asset prices, including those in the crypto space. However, the timing and magnitude of these cuts remain highly uncertain, leading to the market’s current state of flux. CPI Data Impact: The Next Market Catalyst All eyes are now firmly fixed on upcoming economic indicators, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data being a primary focus. This release is expected to be a major catalyst, potentially confirming or challenging the market’s aggressive Interest Rate Cut expectations and influencing the immediate direction of currencies and other assets. Why is CPI Data So Crucial Right Now? The CPI is a key measure of inflation, tracking the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Its significance cannot be overstated: Inflation Barometer: It directly informs central banks about the effectiveness of their monetary policy in controlling price stability. Policy Direction: A higher-than-expected CPI could signal that inflation is stickier than anticipated, potentially pushing back rate cut timelines. Conversely, a lower-than-expected reading could accelerate rate cut bets. Market Reaction: Financial markets, including forex, equities, and even crypto, react swiftly to CPI surprises. Traders adjust positions based on the new outlook for interest rates. A strong CPI Data Impact could reinforce the narrative of a resilient economy, potentially leading to a stronger Dollar and a reassessment of rate cut timing. A weak CPI, on the other hand, might fuel risk appetite and weaken the Dollar, which could be seen as favorable for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. The anticipation of this data keeps markets on edge, driving the current volatility. Navigating Global Forex Trends: Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding these interconnected global financial currents is vital for any investor, including those deeply invested in the crypto market. The interplay between Asia FX Performance , US Dollar Volatility , the anticipation of an Interest Rate Cut , and the impending CPI Data Impact creates a complex yet opportunity-rich environment. How Can Investors Position Themselves? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communication: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and other major central banks. Their forward guidance is a powerful market mover. Track Key Economic Data: Beyond CPI, keep an eye on producer price index (PPI), employment reports, and manufacturing data. These provide a holistic view of economic health. Diversify Portfolios: In times of heightened volatility, diversification across different asset classes (including a balanced approach to crypto and traditional assets) can help mitigate risk. Understand Correlations: Recognize how a stronger or weaker Dollar might affect your crypto holdings. Historically, a stronger Dollar can sometimes correlate with weaker performance in risk assets. Stay Informed on Geopolitical Events: Global events, from conflicts to trade agreements, can swiftly alter market sentiment and currency flows. The current landscape is a testament to the dynamic nature of Global Forex Trends . While predicting exact market movements is impossible, staying informed about these fundamental drivers allows for more strategic decision-making. The crypto market, while often moving on its own unique narratives, is not immune to these powerful macro forces. Therefore, a keen awareness of the global forex environment is an indispensable tool for any discerning crypto investor. Concluding Thoughts: The Path Ahead for Global Markets The global financial stage is set for a period of continued evolution, with the current muted Asia FX Performance and pronounced US Dollar Volatility serving as clear indicators of market apprehension. As the drumbeat for an Interest Rate Cut grows louder, the upcoming CPI Data Impact looms as a critical inflection point, capable of reshaping market expectations and driving significant shifts across currencies and other asset classes. Navigating these complex Global Forex Trends requires diligence and an informed perspective. For crypto investors, these macro currents are not just background noise but fundamental forces that can influence the ebb and flow of digital asset valuations. Staying ahead means understanding these intricate connections and preparing for a market that promises both challenges and opportunities.

A significant development is currently unfolding within the Avalanche ecosystem, as the Avalanche Foundation explores a pivotal move to establish a company in the United States. This potential venture aims to stockpile its native AVAX tokens, a strategy that could redefine its operational framework and market perception. What is the Avalanche Foundation Considering? According to a recent report by the Financial Times, citing multiple informed sources, the Avalanche Foundation is actively exploring plans to create a dedicated entity within the U.S. The primary goal of this new firm would be to hold a substantial amount of its native token, AVAX. This isn’t a simple decision; rather, the foundation is weighing two distinct, yet equally impactful, pathways: Establishing a New Digital Asset Holding Company: This option involves creating a brand-new corporate structure specifically designed to manage and secure the foundation’s AVAX holdings. Converting an Existing Nasdaq-Listed Firm: Alternatively, the Avalanche Foundation might choose to acquire and convert an already existing company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This could offer a quicker route to establishing a compliant, publicly-visible entity. Both options highlight a clear intent: to formalize and secure the foundation’s asset management within a robust and regulated jurisdiction. Why is the Avalanche Foundation Making This Strategic Move? This strategic exploration by the Avalanche Foundation is not merely an administrative tweak; it reflects a broader industry trend towards greater regulatory clarity and institutional acceptance. There are several compelling reasons behind such a significant undertaking: Regulatory Certainty: Operating within the U.S. regulatory framework can provide a level of legal clarity and stability that is highly valued by institutional investors. This helps mitigate uncertainties often associated with the nascent crypto market. Enhanced Trust and Credibility: Establishing a U.S.-based, potentially publicly-listed, entity signals a strong commitment to transparency and compliance. This can significantly boost confidence among traditional financial institutions, corporations, and even retail investors. Attracting Institutional Capital: Many large institutions require regulated entities and clear legal structures before committing significant capital to digital assets. A U.S. firm holding AVAX could open doors to substantial new investment. Long-Term Growth and Stability: By anchoring its operations in a major financial hub, the Avalanche Foundation aims to secure its long-term future, ensuring the sustainability and continued development of the Avalanche ecosystem. Ultimately, this move positions Avalanche as a more mature and trustworthy player in the global blockchain landscape. Potential Challenges and Considerations for the Avalanche Foundation While the benefits are clear, the path to establishing a U.S. firm for AVAX holdings is not without its complexities. The Avalanche Foundation will undoubtedly face several challenges: Navigating U.S. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving and can be intricate. Compliance with various federal and state laws, including those related to securities, money transmission, and taxation, will be paramount. Operational Costs and Infrastructure: Setting up and maintaining a compliant U.S. firm involves significant operational costs, including legal fees, staffing, and robust compliance infrastructure. Market Perception During Transition: The market may react to the news with both optimism and caution. Managing expectations and communicating clearly throughout the process will be crucial to maintaining investor confidence. Security and Custody: Ensuring the highest standards of security for large AVAX holdings will be a critical, ongoing challenge, requiring advanced cybersecurity measures and robust internal controls. The successful execution of this plan will hinge on meticulous planning and expert legal and financial guidance. What Does This Mean for AVAX Holders and the Ecosystem? For current and prospective AVAX holders, this strategic initiative by the Avalanche Foundation could have several positive implications. Firstly, it could lead to increased legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of AVAX as a digital asset. This enhanced credibility may attract a broader base of investors, potentially leading to more stable and sustained growth for the token. Moreover, greater institutional adoption driven by regulatory clarity could unlock new avenues for liquidity and utility within the Avalanche ecosystem. This could translate into more robust decentralized applications (dApps), increased network activity, and ultimately, a stronger foundation for the entire Avalanche network. In conclusion, the Avalanche Foundation ‘s exploration into creating a U.S. firm to hold AVAX tokens marks a potentially transformative moment for the project. It signals a proactive approach to embracing regulatory structures and attracting traditional finance, which could significantly bolster Avalanche’s standing in the competitive cryptocurrency market. This strategic move could pave the way for a new era of institutional engagement and long-term stability for AVAX. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Avalanche Foundation? The Avalanche Foundation is the organization responsible for overseeing and supporting the development, growth, and decentralization of the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem. It often manages funds and initiatives to further the network’s goals. Why is the Avalanche Foundation considering holding AVAX in a U.S. firm? The primary reasons include achieving greater regulatory clarity, enhancing trust and credibility with institutional investors, and attracting more traditional capital to the Avalanche ecosystem, thus fostering long-term growth. What are the two main options being considered by the Avalanche Foundation? The foundation is reportedly considering either establishing an entirely new digital asset holding company in the U.S. or converting an existing Nasdaq-listed firm for this purpose. How might this move affect the AVAX token price? While specific price predictions are speculative, increased institutional adoption and enhanced regulatory clarity typically contribute to greater market confidence and stability, which could positively influence AVAX’s long-term value. Is it common for cryptocurrency foundations to establish U.S. holding firms? While not universally common, there is a growing trend among major cryptocurrency projects and foundations to establish compliant entities in well-regulated jurisdictions like the U.S. to better engage with traditional finance and ensure long-term viability.

Bitwise CIO Eyes ‘Epic’ Q4 Run Fueled By Corporate Demand,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-season-next-bitwise-cio-eyes-epic-q4-run-fueled-by-corporate-demand/,"As Solana (SOL) taps the $225 barrier, Bitwise’s CIO forecasted that a bullish Q4 rally might be brewing for the altcoin if it follows Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum’s (ETH) recipe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakdown Averted? Analyst Says This Level Will Determine BTC’s Fate Solana To Follow BTC, ETH’s Recipe? On Tuesday, Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise, affirmed in a new memo to clients that the recipe for strong returns has been clear over the past 18 months: “Take one part ETP inflows, add strong corporate treasury purchases, and voilà—you get big returns.” Hougan explained that BTC followed this recipe since January 2024, while ETH discovered the same formula in April 2025. “It’s no surprise that the recipe works. It’s classic supply and demand,” he stated, adding that “all the ingredients are there for an epic end-of-year run for Solana.” As the CIO highlighted, multiple issuers, including Bitwise, Grayscale, and VanEck, have filed to launch spot SOL exchange-traded products (ETPs), which are expected to be approved at the start of Q4. As reported by NewsBTC, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced last month that it had pushed back its decision on Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Canary Capital’s spot SOL exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for two months, pushing it to October 16, 2025, “meaning we may have multiple issuers pushing spot Solana ETPs in Q4.” Meanwhile, three major firms, Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, recently secured $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoins to launch a publicly traded SOL-focused treasury company, Forward Industries, to purchase SOL, stake it, and generate excess return. Hougan also noted that Forward Industries named Kyle Samani, who has been among the cryptocurrency’s most consistent promoters, as chairman. To Bitwise’s CIO, if Samani can “carry the Solana message” like Michael Saylor and Tom Lee have done with Bitcoin and Ethereum, it will help drive investor demand. SOL’s Secret Ingredient Hougan pointed out that the existence of ETPs and treasury companies does not guarantee demand, adding that there must be fundamental reasons for investors’ interest in those vehicles. “Solana is an Ethereum competitor,” he asserted, “it’s a programmable blockchain designed to host stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized finance applications, among other things.” The blockchain recently approved a major technical upgrade that will make it one of the fastest networks in the world. Additionally, it is also third in stablecoin liquidity among programmable blockchains and fourth in tokenized assets, recording rapid growth in this sector. Nonetheless, he argued that there’s a key difference between SOL and the two leading cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin’s market capitalization sits around $2.2 trillion, and Ethereum’s is near the $530 billion mark, Solana’s market capitalization is around $120.8 billion, 1/20th the size of BTC and less than 1/4th the size of ETH. “Scaled for the size of the blockchain, a relatively small amount of flows into Solana could significantly impact prices,” Hougan explained. Related Reading: Worldcoin Jumps 42% Following Eightco’s Announcement Of First WLD Treasury Strategy He detailed that Forward Industries’ $1.6 billion purchase of SOL shares would be the equivalent of $33 billion in BTC purchases, noting that this could be slightly offset by Solana’s higher annual inflation rate of 4.3%, versus Bitcoin’s 0.8% and Ethereum’s 0.5%. “The setup is still attractive,” he concluded, suggesting that investors keep their eyes on Solana in the coming months. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $222, a 5.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

However, among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the main topic of conversation was not Apple’s new chip or slimmer build but the design of the camera system. Members of the XRP community were quick to point out that the triangular arrangement of the iPhone 17’s three rear cameras resembles the Ripple logo. The similarity appeared most striking on the newly introduced Bitcoin-orange model, where the black lenses sit in sharp contrast against the bright background. The observation spread rapidly across social media, with many users commenting on how closely the design echoed the well-known logo. Ripple logo https://t.co/xfrhtmgtE0 — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) September 10, 2025 Comparing iPhone Prices in XRP The coincidence of the logo-like camera cluster was not the only aspect linking Apple’s release with XRP. Community discussions also turned toward comparing the price of Apple’s flagship product in terms of XRP tokens. The perspective offers a striking illustration of how much the digital asset has appreciated in a short time. One year ago, XRP was trading at approximately $0.50. At that price, the base iPhone model would have cost nearly 2,000 XRP, while the Pro Max version required more than 2,700 XRP. The situation is very different today. With XRP valued at around $3, the same purchases translate to far fewer tokens: about 333 XRP for the base iPhone 17, 400 XRP for the Pro, and roughly 466 XRP for the Pro Max. What Higher Prices Could Mean The comparison has led to speculation among XRP supporters about how future price increases could affect the purchasing power of the token. If XRP were to reach $5, the base iPhone 17 would be available for 200 tokens, with the Pro model at around 240 and the Pro Max falling under 280. A rise to $10 per token would cut those numbers even further, placing the Pro Max at less than 140 XRP. This way of measuring consumer products in XRP highlights how digital asset valuations can dramatically alter the everyday costs perspective. While Apple’s pricing in dollars remains consistent with previous years, XRP’s performance has shifted the equation for its holders.

For many in the community, the resemblance was too strong to ignore. When coupled with calculations of iPhone prices in XRP terms, it added another layer to discussions about the token’s growth and relevance. The release of the iPhone 17 may not have been intended to intersect with cryptocurrency culture. But among XRP enthusiasts, the overlap has become a topic of attention, linking two of the most widely recognized names in technology and finance.

SOL price is now consolidating above $215 and might aim for more gains above the $225 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $212 and $215 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $215 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $222 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $225 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes More Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it found support near the $205 zone, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $212 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $218 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the $220 barrier. A high was formed at $226 and the price is consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $199 swing low to the $226 high. Solana is now trading above $215 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a bullish trend line forming with support at $222 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $225 level. The next major resistance is near the $232 level. The main resistance could be $235. A successful close above the $235 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $245. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. Downside Correction In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $225 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $222 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $212 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $199 swing low to the $226 high. A break below the $212 level might send the price toward the $205 support zone. If there is a close below the $205 support, the price could decline toward the $200 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

Ether (ETH) topped $4,400, as Ethereum funds ETHA and FETH saw renewed demand according to data curated by SoSoValue. BTC spot ETFs pulled in $757 million of net inflows on Wednesday. Fidelity’s FBTC posted the largest single-day inflow at $299 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $211 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB added $145 million, rounding out the top three. Ether ETFs also turned a corner after last week’s redemptions. Net inflows totaled $171 million on the day, led by BlackRock’s ETHA with $74.5 million and Fidelity’s FETH with $49.5 million. That follows a sharp $446 million outflow earlier this month, suggesting investors are returning to the asset as ETH prices push higher. Monthly data underscores the rebound. Bitcoin ETFs have added $1.39 billion so far in September, erasing August’s $751 million in redemptions.

Senate Democrats have released a comprehensive outline for the legislation, sparking optimism among both crypto industry representatives and some Republican senators, according to crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett. The framework announced by the twelve-member Democratic senators' group calls for clarifying the legal status of tokens, strengthening oversight of exchanges and issuers, combating illicit financial activities, preventing conflicts of interest, and providing more resources to regulatory agencies. These topics are largely aligned with Republican priorities. Related News: SEC Chairman Paul Atkins Makes Striking Statements! ""A New Era Begins for Cryptocurrencies!"" Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading Republican, welcomed the Democrats' move. However, the key difference between the two parties lies in the scope of the regulation. Republicans generally advocate for more “light-touch” regulations, while Democrats favor stricter rules. The Senate Banking Committee is expected to consider revisions to the bill by the end of September, while the Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to release a separate draft regarding the CFTC's jurisdiction. Following this process, the Crypto Market Structure Act is expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump before the end of the year, just before Christmas. *This is not investment advice.

Armani Ferrante stated that the American market has always been a priority, calling the country the biggest digital asset market he knows best. Backpack was founded in 2022 and focused on offering U.S. users a self-custodial wallet. It later opted to enter markets where regulatory approvals were easier to secure and more quickly obtained than in the U.S., including Dubai, Japan, and Europe. Earlier this week, Cryptopolitan reported that Cyprus registered it to serve the EU region, offering perpetual futures trading under the EU’s MiFID II framework. Backpack boasts real-time proof of reserve Armani Ferrante revealed that Backpack’s focus on transparency and trust minimization will define the U.S. launch. He also pointed out that the lessons from FTX, where he and other employees lost funds after the fraud was exposed, inspired the practice. He continued to note that people don’t really care about proof of reserve until it’s too late. Proof of reserve forms are provided daily on the Backpack exchange website, allowing customers to verify their holdings at any time. Backpack CEO argued that financial institutions must be transparent and verifiable in real time rather than reporting cycles that may go beyond a month or a year. He insisted that opaque systems have proven dangerous and brittle. According to Ferrante, the crypto exchange platform acquired FTX EU to save what was left of the business that once belonged to Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto empire. The firm has committed to refund former customers through a process to be completed by midsummer, after CySEC approved the settlement of 200,000 pounds to close investigations into prior FTX violations. The company’s expansion to the U.S. comes amid increased debate over the regulatory framework on digital assets in the U.S. Some critics have argued that the Biden administration’s heavy policy enforcement on cryptocurrency drove most digital asset businesses abroad. However, that has changed with Trump’s administration stressing pro-crypto policies to boost crypto adoption in the country. SEC Chair Paul Atkins echoed the concern during a roundtable in France today, saying the Biden administration’s strategy was ineffective and injurious to the United States. Ferrante says Backpack has more wallet custody in the U.S. market Despite the regulatory challenges during Biden’s era, self-custodial wallets have remained unregulated until now, which means Backpack never exited the market. The CEO pointed out that the exchange platform has more employees in the U.S. than anywhere else, and most wallets are based in the country. The crypto exchange platform has over $170 billion in assets and a 24-hour volume of $74,682,108.37. According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC holds the biggest share in token distribution, with 46.03%, followed by ETH at 16.64%. Ferrante believes the U.S. launch may push the company’s growth, citing the size of the market and the potential to capture share quickly. The exchange also supports perpetual contracts across more than 40 trading pairs with up to ten times leverage. Ferrante described Backpack as an unusual offering with its self-custodial service in the U.S. and as an exchange overseas, but concentration remains high in the U.S. The decision to launch the exchange in the U.S. is personal to Ferrante, as he expects the U.S. to gain the largest share of the market. The announcement coincided with movements across the crypto market today. Bitcoin has recorded a 1.8% rise, currently trading at $113,533.6, after the Bureau of Statistics reported a 0.1% decline in the producer price index for August. Ethereum, on the other hand, recorded a 0.8% rise today, trading at $4,344.65. Get seen where it counts.

The rally carried the token from $2.96 to $2.99 in 24 hours, with midday breakouts on volumes six times the daily average. Despite facing resistance near $3.02, the market structure suggests accumulation, with bulls defending support around $2.98 as traders gauge momentum for a push toward higher extension levels. News Background • The September 10 midday rally was fueled by a volume explosion of 116.7M and 119.0M units within the 12:00–13:00 hour, far exceeding the 24-hour average of 48.3M. • Futures open interest climbed to $7.94B, showing heightened derivatives positioning alongside spot activity. • Analysts flag a descending triangle breakout scenario with measured targets in the $3.60 area if momentum persists. • Broader risk assets continue to track Federal Reserve expectations, with rate cut bets supporting flows into large-cap crypto assets. Price Action Summary • XRP advanced from $2.96 to $2.99 in the September 9 21:00 to September 10 20:00 trading window, a 1% gain within a $0.09 band. • The breakout occurred during the 12:00–13:00 window, when XRP spiked from $2.98 to $3.02 on 119M volume, setting a short-term resistance zone. • The final hour saw selling pressure push the token to $2.98, before buyers re-established support and closed near $2.99. • Volume spikes of over 1.6M per minute during the late session confirmed institutional bids stepping in at discounted levels. Technical Analysis • Resistance: $3.02 remains the immediate ceiling after multiple rejections during peak trading. • Support: Buyers repeatedly defended $2.98–$2.99 across multiple retests. • Volume: Breakout volumes at midday were six times the daily average, validating the move. • Structure: Higher lows formation suggests sustained accumulation despite resistance caps. • Indicators: Technicals point to a breakout scenario, with Fibonacci extensions projecting potential upside toward $3.60. What Traders Are Watching • Whether XRP can sustain closes above the $3.00 mark to flip resistance into support. • Reaction to $3.02 resistance — a breakout could extend targets to $3.20–$3.60 in coming sessions. • Futures positioning and open interest at $7.9B, which could amplify volatility around key levels. • Macro drivers from the Federal Reserve’s September 17 policy meeting and dollar liquidity outlook.",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-11 05:18:24

For those immersed in the world of cryptocurrencies and decentralized technology, the push for transparency and user protection resonates deeply. California, a global hub for technological innovation, is now taking a decisive step to address the burgeoning concerns surrounding AI companion chatbots , moving to establish a groundbreaking regulatory framework. This pivotal moment underscores a growing global consensus that while AI offers immense potential, it also demands robust safeguards, particularly for its most vulnerable users. Why California’s AI Regulation Bill is a Game Changer The California State Assembly recently passed SB 243, a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating AI companion chatbots . This bill, which received strong bipartisan support, is now poised to become law, setting a precedent for states across the U.S. and potentially internationally. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, it would take effect on January 1, 2026, making California the first state to mandate specific safety protocols for AI companions and to hold companies legally accountable for failing to meet these standards. This initiative marks a crucial turning point, signaling a proactive approach to governance in an area that has largely operated with minimal oversight. For the crypto community, accustomed to debates around regulatory clarity and consumer protection, California’s move highlights a shared challenge: how to foster innovation while mitigating risks in cutting-edge technologies. The Urgent Need for Comprehensive AI Regulation The impetus behind SB 243 is rooted in a series of deeply concerning incidents that have exposed the potential harms of unregulated AI. One tragic example that galvanized support for the bill was the death of teenager Adam Raine, who committed suicide after engaging in prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that reportedly involved discussions and planning related to self-harm. This heart-wrenching event underscored the immediate need for protective measures, especially for minors. Furthermore, leaked internal documents reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots engaging in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children, raising alarms about the exploitation of young users. These instances, among others, have intensified scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating the impact of AI chatbots on children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has also launched investigations into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. These examples paint a clear picture: without proper AI regulation , the risks to user well-being are substantial and immediate. Ensuring User Safety: Key Provisions of SB 243 SB 243 specifically targets companion chatbots, defined as AI systems that offer adaptive, human-like responses and are designed to meet a user’s social needs. The bill aims to prevent these chatbots from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. To achieve this, it mandates several critical provisions designed to enhance user safety : Content Restrictions: Prohibiting AI companion chatbots from discussing or promoting self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or sexually explicit material. Mandatory Alerts: Platforms will be required to provide recurring alerts to users – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are interacting with an AI chatbot, not a real person, and encouraging them to take a break. This aims to prevent the formation of unhealthy dependencies or misinterpretations of the AI’s nature. Transparency and Reporting: The bill establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies operating companion chatbots, including major players like OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika. This data will provide crucial insights into how these systems are being used and where potential harms might arise. Crisis Resource Integration: As Senator Steve Padilla emphasized, the bill aims to ensure that platforms link users to proper resources when they express distress or thoughts of self-harm. Companies will be required to share data on how often they refer users to crisis services, offering a clearer understanding of the scope of these issues. These measures represent a significant step towards creating a safer digital environment, demonstrating that innovation and protection can, and must, coexist. Holding Tech Accountability: Legal Ramifications for Non-Compliance One of the most impactful aspects of SB 243 is its mechanism for enforcing tech accountability . The bill empowers individuals who believe they have been harmed by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies. These lawsuits can seek injunctive relief, aiming to stop harmful practices, and damages of up to $1,000 per violation, in addition to attorney’s fees. This provision is a powerful deterrent, placing the onus on AI developers to prioritize safety in their design and deployment. It moves beyond mere guidelines, establishing a legal framework that can compel companies to adhere to the new standards. For a sector that has often faced criticism for self-regulation, this external enforcement mechanism is a welcome development, echoing the calls for greater corporate responsibility often heard within the crypto space regarding project transparency and security. While some stronger requirements from the original bill, such as preventing “variable reward” tactics or tracking how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation, were amended, the current bill still strikes a crucial balance. As Senator Josh Becker noted, it aims to address harms effectively without imposing technically unfeasible or overly burdensome compliance requirements on companies. The Evolving Landscape of AI Companion Chatbots and Industry Response The market for AI companion chatbots is booming, with companies like Replika and Character.AI offering personalized, adaptive interactions that can fulfill social needs. While these services can provide comfort and companionship for some, they also carry inherent risks, particularly when designed with features that encourage excessive engagement, creating potentially addictive reward loops. The industry’s response to increased regulation has been mixed. While some, like Anthropic, have expressed support for comprehensive AI safety bills (such as California’s SB 53, which mandates transparency reporting), major tech giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Amazon have voiced opposition to stricter measures. OpenAI, for instance, has urged Governor Newsom to favor less stringent federal and international frameworks over California’s robust proposals. This pushback highlights the ongoing tension between innovation and regulation. However, as Senator Padilla articulately puts it, “I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive… We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.” This sentiment resonates with the blockchain ethos, where securing networks and protecting users is seen as foundational to long-term growth and adoption. A Path Forward: Balancing Innovation with Protection California’s SB 243 represents a pioneering effort to establish a responsible framework for AI development. By focusing on user safety and tech accountability within the rapidly expanding domain of AI companion chatbots , the bill aims to prevent future tragedies and protect vulnerable populations. As the bill heads to the state Senate for a final vote and then potentially to Governor Newsom for signing, its passage would mark a monumental step in the global conversation around AI governance. The effective date of January 1, 2026, with reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027, provides companies with a clear timeline to adapt their practices. This proactive approach, while potentially challenging for some industry players, is essential for building public trust and ensuring that AI technology serves humanity responsibly. The lessons learned from this legislative journey in California will undoubtedly inform future AI regulation efforts worldwide, shaping a safer and more ethical digital future for everyone.

Quintenz said he refused to provide assurances and even suggested the brothers later asked the White House to pause his nomination. The disclosure was made just days before Gemini’s $3 billion IPO, which added scrutiny to the exchange at a critical time. At the same time, the US Senate Banking Committee narrowly advanced Trump pick Stephen Miran for a temporary seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, with Republicans in support and Democrats opposed. His nomination faces concerns over conflicts of interest, while tensions still loom after Trump’s failed attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. Winklevoss Clash With CFTC Brian Quintenz, former CFTC commissioner and President Donald Trump’s nominee to chair the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), publicly released a series of text messages between himself and Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, raising questions about their involvement in his stalled confirmation. In a post on X, Quintenz explained that he disclosed the private messages out of concern that Trump “might have been misled” by the Gemini executives as they lobbied against his nomination. The text exchanges, dated July 25, show Tyler Winklevoss sending Quintenz details related to Gemini’s long-running civil case with the CFTC, which ended in January with a $5 million settlement. Winklevoss accused the agency of abusing the “deliberative process privilege” and engaging in “lawfare trophy hunting,” which he claimed denied Gemini a fair defense in court. According to Quintenz, the Winklevoss twins were seeking certain assurances from him regarding how he will handle the CFTC’s enforcement practices if he assumed the chairmanship. Quintenz stated that he refused to make such commitments,and added, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise.” He also claimed that after the conversation, the Gemini co-founders reached out to the White House to request that Trump pause his confirmation process. The timing of the disclosure is quite interesting. The Senate Agriculture Committee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Quintenz’s nomination in late July, but the White House reportedly requested a delay just before lawmakers left for their month-long recess. Now, as the Senate weighs the next steps, the controversy adds an extra layer of political drama to an already sensitive appointment process. Compounding the situation is Gemini’s own high-profile milestone. The exchange is set to launch its initial public offering on Friday, with a targeted $3 billion valuation. Quintenz’s disclosure was made less than 48 hours before the IPO, and could spark fresh scrutiny of the company at a very critical moment. While it is still unclear how much the revelation will affect investor sentiment, the move proves that there is a tense relationship between the crypto exchange and its primary US regulator. Stephen Miran Moves Closer to Fed Board Meanwhile, the US Senate Banking Committee narrowly advanced the nomination of Stephen Miran to serve temporarily on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, setting the stage for a full Senate vote in the coming weeks. The committee voted along party lines, 13 to 11, with Republicans backing Miran and Democrats opposing his nomination. Miran was nominated by President Donald Trump in December to chair the Council of Economic Advisors, and will be filling the seat that was vacated in August by Fed governor Adriana Kugler. The term is set to expire on Jan. 31. During a recent hearing, Miran stated that he will not resign from his White House advisory role if his tenure at the Fed were extended, raising concerns among some lawmakers about potential conflicts. While he acknowledged in the past that cryptocurrencies could play an important role in financial innovation, he made few public statements on digital assets or blockchain since joining the Trump administration. The advancement of his nomination also comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions between the White House and the central bank. Just days earlier, President Trump tried to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook, due to mortgage fraud allegations. Cook refused to step down and filed a legal challenge. A federal judge in Washington, DC, blocked the president’s dismissal order, ruling that Trump had not shown cause for removal. The administration then filed an appeal. Meanwhile, the Fed is preparing for a major policy conference in October, where officials are expected to discuss a range of issues tied to the future of payments, including stablecoins and tokenization. At press time, it was still uncertain when the Senate would schedule a vote on Miran’s confirmation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-11 05:30:00

The leading asset moved between an intraday high of $113,138 and a low of $110,812, showing the tight range that has dominated trading in recent sessions. Key momentum indicators suggest cautious optimism. Support remains firm at $110,000, while moving averages at $109,300 and $101,000 strengthen the bullish case. On the upside, resistance at $113,000–$115,000 remains the next crucial hurdle, with analysts noting that a breakout above this band could unlock renewed momentum. Institutional Bets Boost Bitcoin Confidence Institutional activity continues to shape sentiment despite mixed price action. Market watchers highlight growing expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts following weaker jobs data as a stabilizing force for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, liquidity inflows from crypto ETFs and corporate treasury allocations remain a significant driver of demand. Japanese firm Metaplanet Inc. recently raised $1.4 billion to expand its Bitcoin holdings, growing its reputation as a proxy play for investors in Asia. Analysts draw parallels to MicroStrategy’s long-term accumulation strategy, noting that such moves show institutional conviction even as spot prices consolidate. ETF data also paints a complex picture. Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF recently saw $55.8 million in outflows, signaling short-term caution among investors. However, the broader trend of institutional accumulation suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a hedge and long-term store of value. Analysts Expect Breakout Potential Despite near-term hesitation, analysts remain cautiously bullish. Many point to accumulation patterns and resilient demand as signs that Bitcoin is preparing for its next decisive move. If BTC can reclaim and sustain levels above $115,000, it could confirm the start of a new rally phase. For now, consolidation remains the dominant theme, with macroeconomic policy, ETF flows, and institutional strategies dictating the pace of the next breakout. As one analyst put it, Bitcoin’s ability to attract long-term institutional bets during uncertainty may be the clearest sign yet that its next major move is only a matter of time.

According to his remarks, both networks have been developing a structure that could support a trillion-dollar asset class, and the missing element, he claims, has been the implementation of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof technology. Drew asserts that large institutions, including BlackRock and JP Morgan, are already aligning themselves with this direction. Ripple and Stellar EXPOSED: They’ve been building the One World Financial System together. Ripple snd Stellar Team have been dropping hints about building something that’s worth a Trillion Dollar Asset Class. This Is What They Are Hiding From You pic.twitter.com/uxJ9Akl7dw — Stern Drew (@SternDrewCrypto) September 7, 2025 Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Sovereign Digital Identity Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic tools that allow the validation of information without revealing the underlying data. Stern Drew highlights that Ripple, Stellar, and their institutional partners are integrating this technology through the framework of sovereign digital identity. He notes that Stellar developers have already confirmed that Stellar’s Protocol 24 will establish the network as a leader in privacy and ZK integration. Ripple’s chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, has previously stated in an interview that governments ultimately own personal identities, and he acknowledged the potential role of blockchain in managing digital identity systems. Drew points to these remarks, along with consistent references to privacy, credentials, and sovereign identity, as evidence that a broader project is underway, with implementation already in progress through the XRP Ledger. He identifies the initiative known as DNA Protocol, operating under the handle @DNAOnChain, as a central piece of this infrastructure. Technical Developments on Stellar and the XRP Ledger Drew provides further detail on how both Stellar and the XRP Ledger are technologically prepared for this shift. Stellar, through Protocol 24, is integrating ZK primitives, smart contracts, and state proofs. On the XRP Ledger, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are supported alongside sovereign data layers. These are tied to proposed standards such as XLS-70, which enables credential wallets, and XLS-80, which provides for permissioned domains. Drew argues that such features are exactly what large institutions, including BlackRock and JP Morgan, would require to safely deploy trillions of dollars in liquidity across blockchain rails. Institutional and Global Support Drew cites several examples to support his claims of institutional involvement. He notes that JP Morgan has developed Kinexys, a digital identity platform for Web3, and the World Economic Forum has advanced its Digital Identity Framework for governance and security. He also links BlackRock’s iShares Genomics, Immunology & Healthcare ETF, listed under the ticker $XDNA, to the broader strategy, suggesting that this coordination is deliberate rather than coincidental. He refers to panels at blockchain summits where leaders such as Stellar’s Denelle Dixon participated in discussions on digital identity and decentralized internet frameworks. Drew even raises the possibility that the lawsuit filed by the SEC against Ripple may have been intended as a delaying tactic to give institutions time to establish their positions before this infrastructure became fully public. The Role of $XDNA Stern Drew concludes by pointing to Ripple, Stellar, and DNA Protocol as forming the rails for sovereign digital identity, with $XDNA acting as the anchoring asset. He highlights that DNA Protocol launched its token on the XRP Ledger on July 4, coinciding with U.S. Independence Day and the signing of legislation by President Donald Trump. He questions whether this timing is coincidental and emphasizes the significance of an identity system where individuals maintain ownership of their credentials within personal wallets, independent of government databases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Drew, this emerging system would allow individuals to transact, invest, and transfer assets without the need for banks, intermediaries, or paperwork. He claims that this design also removes the potential for surveillance or enforced taxation, instead creating a structure of personal sovereignty. His perspective is that institutions are already committing substantial capital to sovereign digital identity and ZK technology, with the XRP Ledger at the center of this financial evolution.

The firm noted that the gap between M2 expansion and the BTC price is as wide as at any time since August 2024, which has turned into a strong entry point. Similar divergences in 2016, 2019, and 2021 preceded notable upside. Over the past decade, BTC has shown a positive correlation with M2, with monetary growth typically leading price by roughly three months. If that historical relationship holds, liquidity tailwinds later in Q4 could favor a push higher. Tactically, bulls still have levels to reclaim. “Bitcoin continues to attract buyers on intraday dips, forming a smooth and rather fragile uptrend, with the main battle now around $112K,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “The real test sits near $115K, just above the 50-day moving average. Staying above it would signal a return to optimism, but for now BTC is lagging stocks at record highs,”Kuptsikevich added. Options desks report firmer demand for protection ahead of this week’s U.S. inflation data, consistent with neutral-to-bearish positioning in the short term. Meanwhile, SOL’s bid has tracked a steady rise in TVL to a record $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, while memecoins captured fresh flows. Analysts floating $300 SOL targets tie the call to persistent activity and on-chain liquidity, though follow-through likely depends on broader risk appetite. The macro calendar can still spoil the party, however, as U.S CPI figures are due later on Thursday. A cooler trajectory would strengthen the case for a near-term Fed cut and a softer dollar, typically supportive for bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

This Channel Break Could Be The Catalyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-0-50-channel-break-could-the-catalyst/,"An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin could see a rally to $0.50, if the upper boundary of this technical analysis pattern breaks. Dogecoin Is Currently Trading Inside A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 1-day price of Dogecoin. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms when the price of an asset observes movement restricted between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Toncoin, Quant Seeing Whale Activity Explosion, Big Move Ahead? The upper line of the channel is likely to provide resistance, while the lower one support. A break out of either of these boundaries can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, depending on how the trendlines are arranged relative to the chart axes. When the trendlines are slopped upward, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. Similarly, them pointing down results in what’s called a Descending Channel. In the context of the current topic, the variant of interest is neither of these, but rather the most simple case of Parallel Channels: a channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. This type emerges when an asset observes consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. Here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-day Dogecoin price has been trading inside for the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin retested the resistance line of the Parallel Channel in July, but ended up finding rejection. The midway line of the channel stabilized the asset’s drawdown and since then, the coin has been moving in a tight range in the upper half of the pattern. Currently, the memecoin’s trajectory is pointing in the direction of the upper level, which is situated at $0.29, but for now, its price remains a notable distance below it. In the scenario that another retest occurs in the near future, the outcome may be interesting to watch, as it could have implications for DOGE’s value. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency could be looking at the $0.50 mark, if its price can break past this barrier. The target is based on the fact that Parallel Channel breakouts can be of the same length as the width of the channel.

It now remains to be seen how the memecoin develops in the near future, with respect to the Parallel Channel. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.245, up more than 12% over the last week.

The new purchase signals Bitmine’s continued confidence in ETH as a long-term investment. As of August 31, Bitmine held 1,866,974 ETH with an average cost of $3,883. Further, the development comes a week after Bitmine scooped 80,325 ETH valued at $358 million from Galaxy Digital and FalconX. The firm plans to hold 5% of ETH’s total supply. Bitmine Becomes First Largest ETH Treasury Firm Globally On Monday, the BTC miner turned ETH accumulator announced its crypto and cash holdings exceeding $9.21 billion. The company stands second in global crypto treasury, after Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which currently has a stash of nearly $73 billion worth of BTC . “The power law benefits large holders of ETH, hence, we pursue the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH,” Thomas Lee, Chairman of Bitmine, said in a statement. Bitmine remains an example for crypto treasury peers by the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share, he added. Additionally, Lee believes that ETH could be “one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,” adding that the majority of Wall Street’s transformation into blockchain is happening on Ethereum. Institutional Flex Despite Choppy Price Action Bitmine’s latest 46k ETH buy is a clear signal that institutions are doubling down despite choppy price action. Social chatters confirm that massive withdrawals such as these, shrink exchange liquidity, pushing a bullish supply narrative. Ethereum rose 2.29% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader crypto market. The world’s second-largest crypto is hovering just above $4,400 at press time.

The new high has prompted one analyst to urge caution among bitcoin (BTC) bulls, suggesting that the surging Kospi could mark the end of the BTC bull run, consistent with the historical relation between the two assets. ""Every time the Kospi has set a new record high, Bitcoin was trading close to its all-time high of the cycle. The last time this happened was back in 2021,"" crypto analytics platform Alphractal said on X . The chart indicates that the Kospi reached its peak in the second half of 2021. BTC also peaked closer to $70,000 in November that year, eventually falling into a year-long bear market. A similar pattern emerged in late 2017, with concurrent peaks in the two assets. Also note the concurrent interim tops around June and July 2011. Incremental signal The pattern, though limited to support definitive conclusions, warrants attention, as it underscores the shared sensitivity of Kospi and BTC to global risk-on/risk-off flows and shifts in investor risk appetite and macroeconomic conditions. When risk sentiment is positive, capital flows into emerging market equities, such as the Kospi, which is heavily export-oriented and influenced by global trade dynamics, as well as into riskier assets like bitcoin. Conversely, during periods of heightened uncertainty or risk aversion, both tend to decline together. This close relationship highlights how Bitcoin, despite its unique characteristics as a digital asset, is becoming increasingly intertwined with broader financial markets and subject to similar economic forces. ""Now that the Kospi has reached a new all-time high, it serves as yet another incremental signal that the bitcoin cycle may be nearing its conclusion. Smart money flows continuously between major economies, stores of value, risk assets, and—sometimes—extremely speculative instruments, like memecoins, often without fundamentals,"" Joao Wedson, founder and CEO of Alphractal, said.

If buyers can sustain this and confirm $3 as support, then the way opens up for the asset to go to $3.2 next or even $3.6. Chart by TradingView. 2. Bullish Momentum Is Returning With bulls on the offensive, XRP has a real chance to enter a sustained rally after this breakout. The key to achieving that is for the buy volume to increase in the days to come. So far, the breakout was on low volume, which signals caution. Chart by TradingView. 3. MACD Higher Highs The uptrend can also be seen on the daily MACD, which has made a clear bullish cross this week and now appears ready for new highs. Hopefully, the buy volume increases so that the uptrend can be sustained in the weeks to come. Chart by TradingView.

51536604,578846,1757574009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51536604.jpeg,Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Trend Grows As Robin Energy Commits $5 Million,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-corporate-treasury-robin-energy-5-million/,"Cyprus-based international ship-owning firm Robin Energy today announced the successful conclusion of its initial $5 million Bitcoin (BTC) allocation through Anchorage Digital Bank N.A., as part of its newly adopted treasury framework. Robin Energy Buys $5 Million Worth Of Bitcoin According to an announcement made earlier today, Robin Energy has completed its initial $5 million worth of BTC purchase. With this, the Cyprus-based company, which also provides energy transportation services has become the latest firm to leverage digital assets to diversify its portfolio. Following the development, the firm’s Nasdaq-listed stock RBNE spiked 90%, hitting an intraday high of $4.27 before losing some of its gains. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the stock has increased by 106.8%. It is worth noting that RBNE hit its all-time high (ATH) earlier this year on June 13. However, no specific reason can be found for the same. Commenting on today’s Bitcoin purchase, Petros Panagiotidis, CEO, Robin Energy, said: We are pleased to have completed the allocation of $5 million to Bitcoin in accordance with our board-approved strategy. We believe in Bitcoin’s unique characteristics as a scarce digital asset and see it as an integral component of our long-term strategy to grow our Company further and drive shareholder value. Robin Energy’s foray into the cryptocurrency realm is not surprising, as an increasing number of firms are choosing to add leading digital assets like BTC and Ethereum (ETH) to their balance sheets in 2025. For example, Taiwanese investment firm Sora Ventures recently unveiled a massive $1 billion Bitcoin treasury fund, a first in Asia. At the time, the firm stated that it would use the proceeds from the fund to buy BTC over the next six months. Similarly, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also shared plans to double down on BTC recently. Specifically, the firm stated that it will spend as much as $835 million to buy more Bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, the total amount of BTC held by publicly-listed companies recently crossed one million. Among these companies, US-based Strategy ranks at the top as it alone holds close to 638,000 BTC on its balance sheet. ETH, A Worthy Challenger To BTC? Although Bitcoin’s dominance and adoption rate are unquestionable, it appears to be getting serious competition from the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum. In 2025 specifically, ETH adoption has surged at an unprecedented pace. Asset manager VanEck CEO, Jan van Eck, recently dubbed ETH the “Wall Street token,” thanks to its incredible range of use-cases, including facilitating stablecoin transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Similarly, August 2024 saw ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attract $4 billion worth of net inflows, while Bitcoin ETFs witnessed net outflows to the tune of $628 million. At press time, BTC trades at $113,930, up 2.7% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|cyprus|digital currency|Robin Energy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-11 07:00:09

Can it break it in the next several days? Key Support levels: $0.77, $0.70 Key Resistance levels: $0.90, $1 1. Resistance Under Pressure Buyers managed to bring ADA under the key resistance at $0.90. If the bulls can break this level and turn it into support, this cryptocurrency has a real shot at revisiting $1 and even rallying to make new highs this year. We will likely find out in the next few days if the buyers are successful here. Chart by TradingView. 2. Buyers Return, But Remain Timid Even if the price has moved upwards, the momentum is not there yet to break the current resistance. Volume needs to pick up here. So far, sellers have been absent, but they could return as soon as the key resistance at $0.90 is under serious threat. Chart by TradingView. 3. Buy Volume Bounced For most of August, Cardano’s volume profile has been falling. However, in September, buyers appear more active, and there was a small spike in buying pressure.

On Wednesday night, Brian posted screenshots on X of texts between him and Tyler from late July. Those messages followed a $5 million settlement between the CFTC and Gemini, the crypto firm run by the twins. Brian said the twins asked him for commitments he refused to make, and that after their failed attempt to sway him, they reached out to Trump in an effort to block his confirmation. “I’ve never been inclined to release private messages,” Brian wrote. “But in light of my support for the President and belief that he might have been misled, I’ve posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC.” He added that the messages show what Tyler was after and make it clear he didn’t give any promises. “It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” He went on to say, “Protecting the President and his agenda are more important than any job.” Tyler Winklevoss sent texts demanding cultural reform at CFTC The texts show Tyler sent Brian a letter that Gemini had just submitted to the CFTC’s internal watchdog. That letter attacked the agency’s behavior in the Gemini case. Tyler said the CFTC had pursued them through “7 years of lawfare trophy hunting.” He followed up by asking how Brian intended “to align with President Trump and the Administration’s mandate to end the lawfare and make amends for it.” Tyler then argued that the agency was unfit to regulate crypto and wrote, “Cultural reform, which includes rectifying what happened to us, should be the highest priority.” Brian replied that he planned to carry out “a fair and reasonable review of the matter and the division and individuals involved to determine if they acted inappropriately.” But Tyler didn’t seem satisfied, and within days, both brothers reportedly contacted Trump to urge him to reconsider the nomination. Brian has declined to add anything beyond what he posted. The White House also hasn’t said anything. Still, the fallout has already affected Brian’s confirmation process. His nomination was supposed to pass easily, with wide support across the crypto and finance space. Even Tyler and Cameron had congratulated him on X earlier this year when Trump made the announcement. White House delayed Senate vote on nomination after Winklevoss complaint But after the July messages, things changed. The White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to delay the vote to move Brian’s nomination forward. That request put everything on hold. The committee’s chair, Senator John Boozman of Arkansas, has received no follow-up from the administration about rescheduling the vote, according to his spokesperson Sara Lasure. This fight lands at a time when Congress is considering new legislation that would expand the CFTC’s authority over crypto. The agency, which traditionally focused on futures contracts for things like corn and oil, now oversees some crypto derivatives. But a Senate bill could give it direct oversight of tokens like bitcoin and ether, a massive expansion of its power. The legal fight between Gemini and the CFTC goes back to the Biden administration. The $5 million settlement, finalized in Biden’s last days in office, accused Gemini of misleading the agency about a crypto investment product. Gemini attorney John Baughman blasted the CFTC in a June letter, saying agency lawyers were “driven by a selfish desire to advance their careers by misusing their offices to obtain a high-profile ‘win’ against Gemini.” That letter was the one Tyler forwarded to Brian during their private exchange. And that exchange is now at the center of a political mess inside Trump’s administration.

Impending Crypto Collapse Ahead? The letter articulated fears that the US government’s backing of cryptocurrencies could undermine the dollar’s position as the world’s primary reserve currency. Related Reading: WLFI Price Dips 7% As Eric Trump Leaves World Liberty Treasury Company ALT5 Sigma Elliott Management highlighted that the dramatic rise in crypto prices, allegedly tied with Trump’s promotion of digital assets, poses risks not only to individual investors but also to the broader economy. The firm warned that the impending collapse of the alleged crypto bubble could have unforeseen repercussions, potentially destabilizing financial markets. Elliott’s letter pointed to what they call “speculative nature” of the current crypto market, where a surge of investment appears to be driven more by hype than by intrinsic value. The firm noted it had “never seen a market like this,” where investors are drawn to assets, particularly memecoins, that lack substantial backing. They assert that this “speculative fervor,” likened to the behavior of sports bettors, has attracted a wave of new investors hoping for continued price increases without a solid foundation. Concerns Mount Over US Dollar’s Future Elliott expressed particular concern about Trump’s vocal support during his campaign and his involvement in several crypto-related ventures have contributed to a perception of legitimacy surrounding the sector. Trump and his sons have been increasingly leaped into the digital asset sector with ventures such as World Liberty Financial (WLFI), American Bitcoin (ABTC) and the launch of the President’s official memecoin, TRUMP, which have sparked considerable criticism among Democrats. Elliott cautioned that such endorsements could marginalize the dollar, which the firm described as “profoundly dangerous.” The establishment of a national reserve for digital assets, as proposed by the Trump administration, further complicates this scenario, potentially diluting the dollar’s influence in the global economy. The letter also stressed the need for caution among investors, warning that many are placing their bets on a volatile market based on “speculative trends rather than sound financial principles.” Related Reading: Solana And XRP ETFs Smash New Records In Canada Despite the firm’s stark warning, cryptocurrency prices rebounded on Wednesday. The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $113,450 when writing, after consolidating for days between $110,000 and $112,000. Furthermore, the recent passage of the GENIUS Act—the first crypto bill signed by President Trump—is expected to enhance the use of the US dollar as a complement to stablecoins, thereby updating the broader financial system. Wall Street giants Morgan Stanley, Citi, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase have all also expressed their willingness to enter the sector. This highlights the administration’s progress in developing a new framework that could mitigate risks while accelerating the adoption of digital assets.

His post was accompanied by the statement: “You may not realize what’s coming, but you will soon. (Total2).” The chart, posted on September 9, 2025, is annotated with consolidation ranges, resistance levels, and breakout markers. It presents a repeating structure where each consolidation phase is followed by a breakout, establishing a new higher range. Vandell’s message implies that the market is preparing for another move of this nature. You may not realize what’s coming, but you will soon. (Total2) pic.twitter.com/ITgqyoOjrf — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) September 10, 2025 Details of the chart The chart highlights three distinct consolidation phases, each represented within shaded boxes capped by orange horizontal resistance lines. Each time the market breaks through one of these levels, a green arrow is placed to mark the breakout point. The sequence shows the market repeatedly moving from periods of stagnation into higher value ranges, establishing a pattern that Vandell suggests may repeat once again. The most recent portion of the chart displays TOTAL2 at 1.55 trillion, with a sharp increase of 172.02 billion, representing a 12.44% gain. A new shaded box is placed above the current level, suggesting a projected area for the next consolidation zone at a significantly higher valuation. The structure reinforces Vandell’s outlook that the altcoin market may be approaching another substantial upward move. Responses to the post Alongside Vandell’s chart and statement, community members expressed their own views. Jared Brown commented , “Looks like smaller steps up each time. Probably no step up this time according to your boxes.” His comment reflects skepticism, interpreting the chart as showing diminishing strength with each successive move. Farmer Marcus provided a different perspective, stating , “predictions based on the past… do not include Wall St coming in with big bags.” His view emphasizes that while past data may suggest gradual steps, the involvement of institutional investors and larger capital inflows could alter the trajectory and create outcomes beyond historical precedent. Vandell’s post and chart rely on a technical structure, emphasizing recurring consolidation and breakout cycles within TOTAL2. The message is framed around the argument that history shows a repeating pattern, and that the current positioning suggests another upward leg may soon take place.

Đây là tín hiệu quan trọng thu hút sự chú ý mạnh mẽ của giới đầu tư đang săn tìm altcoin tiềm năng để mua ngay lúc này. Sau nhiều tháng dao động dưới ngưỡng 60, chỉ số này cuối cùng cũng bứt phá. Dù mốc xác nhận 75 chưa tới, nhiều chỉ báo khác đã cho thấy dòng vốn đang rời khỏi Bitcoin và chảy mạnh vào các altcoin với tiềm năng tăng trưởng vượt trội. Yếu tố rõ ràng nhất là sự sụt giảm đều đặn của Bitcoin Dominance. Trong 10 tuần vừa qua, thị phần của Bitcoin đã giảm gần 13% — từ 66% xuống 58%. Lịch sử thị trường cho thấy, khi điều này xảy ra, altcoin thường bắt đầu giai đoạn bùng nổ. Các chuyên gia tin rằng, thiết lập hiện tại rất giống giai đoạn khởi đầu của những chu kỳ altcoin trước, báo hiệu Q4/2025 có thể là một đợt tăng giá mạnh mẽ. Dự báo: Altcoin có thể tăng 10x–50x trong Q4/2025 Chuyên gia crypto nổi tiếng Ash Crypto (gần 2 triệu người theo dõi trên X) dự báo: Bitcoin (BTC) có thể đạt 150.000 USD Ethereum (ETH) hướng tới 8.000 USD Các altcoin có thể bùng nổ 10x–50x ngay trong Q4 năm nay Ngoài ra, báo cáo mới công bố của Coinbase Institutional cũng khẳng định việc Bitcoin mất dần thị phần là “tín hiệu rõ ràng của chu kỳ xoay vòng sang altcoin”. Ông David Duong , Giám đốc nghiên cứu của Coinbase, cho biết thị trường hiện đã sẵn sàng cho một “mùa altcoin toàn diện” bắt đầu từ tháng 9. Với các chỉ báo kỹ thuật lẫn tổ chức đồng thuận, nhiều altcoin triển vọng đã bắt đầu tăng tốc để chuẩn bị thống trị giai đoạn thị trường sắp tới. Những Altcoin tiềm năng nhất để mua trong Q4 bull run Tổng vốn hóa thị trường crypto đang hình thành mô hình “vòng đáy” tăng giá và dao động quanh ngưỡng 4 nghìn tỷ USD . Trong mùa altcoin trước, vốn hóa altcoin tăng 5,7% , vượt xa mức tăng của Bitcoin chỉ 1,3% . Các nhà phân tích kỳ vọng kịch bản này sẽ lặp lại trong những tháng tới. Dưới đây là hai cái tên altcoin nổi bật đang ở giai đoạn presale, thu hút dòng vốn mạnh từ cả retail và tổ chức. Maxi Doge (MAXI) – Presale gần 2 triệu USD nhờ nhu cầu bùng nổ Maxi Doge đang tái định nghĩa cách làm presale meme coin với tốc độ huy động vốn cực nhanh, đạt gần 1,91 triệu USD chỉ trong chưa đầy hai tuần. Dự án được xem là “phiên bản Dogecoin thế hệ mới”, thu hút nhà đầu tư bằng sự kết hợp giữa: Staking rewards lên tới 253% APY cho người mua sớm Giá presale siêu rẻ : chỉ 0,0002565 USD/token Tokenomics độc đáo với đòn bẩy 1.000x vĩnh viễn , kết hợp cùng branding kiểu “degen + gym-bro” MAXI đang nổi bật trong không gian meme coin, và nếu roadmap được thực hiện đúng, dự án này hoàn toàn có thể trở thành một trong những altcoin breakout lớn nhất Q4/2025. Truy cập Maxi Doge Pepenode (PEPENODE) – Altcoin đầu tiên với mô hình Mine-to-Earn Pepenode mang tới mô hình mine-to-earn , biến việc đào coin thành một trò chơi ảo. Người dùng có thể mua node kỹ thuật số , xây dựng server room ảo và nhận phần thưởng thụ động mà không cần tới phần cứng đắt đỏ hay chi phí điện năng. Điểm nổi bật của Pepenode: “Gamified mining” – người chơi kiểm soát dàn máy đào ảo, mua node để tăng hashpower Cơ chế burn 70% token khi nâng cấp, giảm nguồn cung mạnh mẽ Đã huy động hơn 946.856 USD trong presale Giá hiện tại: 0,0010533 USD/PEPENODE Nhiều nhà phát triển gọi đây là “mining không cần phần cứng” , và nhà đầu tư đang đổ vào trước khi giá bước sang vòng presale tiếp theo. Truy cập Pepenode Kết luận Với Altcoin Season Index vượt 60 và Bitcoin Dominance giảm mạnh, tín hiệu đã quá rõ ràng: dòng vốn đang chuyển sang altcoin. Các chuyên gia dự báo nhiều altcoin có thể đạt 10x–50x lợi nhuận chỉ trong Q4/2025. Trong đó, Maxi Doge (MAXI) và Pepenode (PEPENODE) nổi bật nhất nhờ cơ chế độc đáo, cộng đồng đang tăng trưởng và mức huy động vốn ấn tượng.

New Memecoin Challenging DOGE Draws Dogecoin Miner to Based Eggman Presale,https://timestabloid.com/can-dogecoin-cloud-mining-make-profits-new-memecoin-challenging/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite for miners, but in 2025 many are asking if cloud mining is still profitable. DOGE cloud mining services allow individuals to rent hash power instead of running expensive rigs, yet profitability depends heavily on electricity costs, DOGE price swings, and mining difficulty. While some miners can eke out small returns, the reality is that Dogecoin cloud mining profits are modest compared to the explosive gains available in early-stage tokens. That is why even Dogecoin miners are now turning their attention to Based Eggman ($GGs) ), a new meme coin presale positioned as the next big rival to DOGE. Why Dogecoin Miners Are Shifting to $GGs Mining Dogecoin (DOGE) may generate steady but limited returns, while Based Eggman ($GGs) presale offers exponential upside. For miners accustomed to long payback periods, the chance to buy $GGs tokens at presale prices is irresistible. With scarcity mechanics built into the tokenomics and staking features to reward holders, $GGs offers miners a new way to multiply their crypto holdings without expensive infrastructure. Many see it as a smarter allocation of capital compared to low-margin mining operations. $GGs Presale Delivers Meme Coin Momentum The Based Eggman ($GGs) presale has exploded in popularity, driven by memes, viral challenges, and strong community traction. Dogecoin (DOGE) miners who once profited from DOGE’s early cultural surge now recognize the same signals in $GGs. By joining early, they are securing positions before exchange listings, when valuations typically rise sharply. Analysts note that $GGs is drawing whale support alongside retail buyers, creating momentum that could make it the biggest meme coin launch of the year. $GGs Utility Gives It Staying Power While Dogecoin (DOGE) cloud mining depends entirely on network rewards and block emissions, Based Eggman ($GGs) is diversifying with real-world utility. Its planned crypto streaming platform will integrate content and staking, creating new token demand beyond presale hype. This combination of meme virality and functionality makes $GGs unique among meme coins and gives it staying power to outlast short-lived trends. For Dogecoin miners, this represents a rare chance to diversify into a meme token with long-term adoption potential. Conclusion: Miners Look Beyond DOGE to $GGs Dogecoin (DOGE) cloud mining may still bring profits, but they are limited and slow compared to presale opportunities. Based Eggman ($GGs) is drawing Dogecoin miners because it offers exponential potential without the overhead of mining. For those seeking the next big meme coin, the presale of $GGs is proving to be the smarter play.

The weekly chart shows a bullish structure with rising support and strong price continuation above $1.44. Momentum indicators confirm strength as MNT trades above Bollinger Bands with a MACD bullish crossover. Monthly Chart Breaks Long-Term Resistance Mantle’s token MNT reached a new all-time high of $1.65 today, after closing a monthly candle above a long-standing descending trendline. This trendline connected previous highs from April 2024 and January 2025. Notably, the monthly chart also shows a double bottom formation, with lows developing around mid-2024 and mid-2025. The price has now closed above the neckline of that pattern. According to Trader Tardigrade, “ the current candle’s body is entirely above the resistance trendline. ” This development could mark the beginning of a change in structure. $MNT ‘s monthly chart looks promising The current candle’s body is entirely above the resistance trendline formed by the peaks in April 2024 and January 2025. The chart clearly shows strong momentum after a double bottom pattern. I believe this new candle has turned a new page… pic.twitter.com/qaKVJfOP53 — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) September 10, 2025 Trading Volume and Exchange Updates MNT’s current 24-hour trading volume is $662 million, with a 24-hour price range between $1.34 and $1.65. The asset is up 18% in the past 24 hours and 47% over the last 7 days. Market cap is now at $4.02 billion, up 15% week-over-week. Crypto analyst Finish noted that MNT serves as Bybit’s core utility token and mentioned the possibility of future supply reductions through buyback and burn programs. “Many great things are loading,” they said, though the results remain uncertain. Bybit recently added 21 new spot trading pairs for MNT. This could expand trading activity as more pairs offer access to different markets. Meanwhile, the weekly chart shows the price moving above the previous peak of $1.44, which was set earlier in 2025. After a clean breakout , MNT briefly pulled back to the $1.13 area, which lines up with earlier resistance and may now act as support. Source: Finish/X The 20-week moving average has turned upward, and the price remains above it. Before this move, MNT had spent several weeks consolidating between $0.60 and $0.70, forming a rounded bottom. That zone acted as a base before the current breakout began. Momentum Signals Remain Active on Daily Chart On the daily chart, MNT is trading above the upper Bollinger Band, which currently sits at $1.48. It is now at $1.66, suggesting strong momentum. Moves outside the upper band are often seen during rapid price expansions. Source: TradingView Another observation is a recent bullish crossover in the MACD indicator. The MACD line has risen above the signal line, with the histogram extending farther above the zero line. Such readings continue to dictate that upward momentum remains alive without any immediate signs of reversal.

Major cryptocurrencies are looking bullish, with market leader bitcoin (BTC) exhibiting a classic inverse head-and-shoulders breakout that could propel it toward $120,000. But there's a catch. The daily chart for the S&P 500 E-Mini futures is displaying a bearish pattern, indicating a potential sell-off that could weigh on the cryptocurrency market and trap bulls on the wrong side of the market. S&P 500 hits record high with rising wedge The E-mini futures have risen nearly 5% to a record high of $6,542 since Aug. 1. The slow ascent has taken the shape of a rising wedge pattern identified by converging trendlines connecting July 31 and Aug. 15 highs and lows reached on Aug. 1 and Aug. 22. The converging trendlines indicate that bullish momentum is waning, increasing the likelihood of a sell-off. When asked to identify and analyze the pattern on the S&P 500 futures, Google Gemini replied, ""When a rising wedge, which is a bearish reversal pattern, appears after an extended rally to record highs, it significantly increases the probability of a sharp downside move. It suggests that buyers are exhausted and that the rally is running on fumes. The pattern indicates that the market is setting up for a major trend reversal rather than a simple pullback."" Cryptocurrencies are known to closely track Wall Street sentiment, which means that a potential decline in the S&P 500 could weigh on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Inflation eyed The odds of a breakdown in the S&P 500 could rise sharply if Thursday’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI) prints hotter than expected. Such a result, combined with the recent labor market weakness , may rekindle fears of stagflation—the worst-case scenario for risk assets—putting additional pressure on equities and cryptocurrencies alike. The median forecast for the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in August 2025 is a 2.9% year-over-year increase (not seasonally adjusted), according to FactSet . If this estimate holds true, it will be the highest annual rise since January 2025, when the CPI reached 3.0% and well above the Fed's 2% target. Additionally, this 2.9% figure would surpass the trailing twelve-month average inflation rate of 2.6%. More importantly, the median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is 3.1%. BTC, ETH options are already biased bearish The 25-delta risk reversals tied to Deribit-lited bitcoin and ether options were negative out to December expiry, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, short and near-dated BTC and ETH puts traded at a premium to calls, reflecting a bias for downside protection. A put option protects the buyer from a decline in the value of the underlying asset. A call provides an asymmetric bullish exposure. The 25-delta risk reversal involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa. According to Options Insights' Founder, Imran Lakha, the put bias in BTC is likely due to institutions placing long-term hedges . Flows have continued to trend lower on the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm. ""Flows again featured the [ETH] 26 Sep 4k put, lifted up to 73v,"" Paradigm noted. XRP is indecisive, DOGE looks north While BTC's inverse head-and-shoulders breakout suggests a strong bullish direction, XRP's price action appears indecisive. The payments-focused cryptocurrency remains locked in a descending triangle and continues to trade within the Ichimoku cloud. Together, these indicators suggest a period of consolidation and uncertainty. A breakout from the triangle might invite stronger buying pressure, potentially leading to a re-test of $3.38, the swing high from Aug. 8. That said, the descending triangle, by itself, is generally considered a bearish pattern. That's because the downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs indicates that sellers are progressively getting stronger and could soon penetrate the horizontal support level. Speaking of DOGE, it has retaken the bullish trendline from June lows, trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market. Additionally, prices have crossed into bullish territory above the Ichimoku cloud, which suggests scope for a test of the July high of 28.76 cents. However, traders still need to watch out for a potential rising wedge breakdown in S&P 500 futures, as a reversal there could cap gains in DOGE and weigh on its price momentum.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|DOGE|Markets|Technical Analysis|Options|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-11 07:22:41

A fascinating analysis suggests a strong KOSPI Bitcoin correlation , hinting that when this key stock market index hits a new record, Bitcoin’s bull run might be nearing its end. For crypto investors, understanding this potential link could be vital for navigating future market movements. Unpacking the KOSPI Bitcoin Correlation: What Does a Record High Mean? South Korea’s KOSPI index recently achieved an all-time high, closing at 3,344.20. While this might seem like a distant economic indicator for many crypto enthusiasts, a deeper dive into market patterns reveals a compelling KOSPI Bitcoin correlation that demands attention. This isn’t just a random observation; it’s a historical pattern identified by crypto analytics firm Alphractal. According to their findings, as reported by CoinDesk, a KOSPI peak has frequently coincided with Bitcoin’s cycle high. This suggests that the KOSPI, often seen as a bellwether for global risk sentiment, could be an unexpected harbinger for Bitcoin’s trajectory. What exactly does this mean for the current market? Historical Echoes: When KOSPI Foreshadowed Bitcoin’s Peaks To truly grasp the significance of the KOSPI Bitcoin correlation , we must look to the past. Alphractal’s research highlights several instances where the KOSPI’s performance appeared to precede major shifts in Bitcoin’s price action. Late 2021: After the KOSPI set a record in the latter half of 2021, Bitcoin reached its own all-time high in November of that year. What followed was a prolonged, year-long downturn for the leading cryptocurrency. Late 2017: Similar patterns emerged in late 2017. The KOSPI’s peak then also aligned closely with Bitcoin’s significant cycle high before a subsequent correction. Mid-2011: Even earlier, in June and July 2011, mid-cycle peaks in the KOSPI reportedly mirrored Bitcoin’s price movements, demonstrating this consistent KOSPI Bitcoin correlation across different market phases. These historical precedents suggest that the KOSPI isn’t merely an unrelated stock index; it might be a significant, albeit indirect, indicator for Bitcoin’s market cycles. The Global Economic Thread: Why KOSPI and Bitcoin Move Together What creates this intriguing KOSPI Bitcoin correlation ? Alphractal explains that the common denominator lies in their shared sensitivity to global risk sentiment and broader macroeconomic conditions. Both assets are highly responsive to shifts in investor appetite for risk. When global risk appetite is positive, capital tends to flow into assets that offer higher potential returns, even if they come with increased volatility. This includes: KOSPI: As an index heavily influenced by global trade dynamics and emerging markets, the KOSPI benefits from robust economic optimism. Bitcoin: Often perceived as a ‘risk-on’ asset, Bitcoin also attracts capital during periods of high investor confidence and liquidity. Conversely, when a ‘risk-off’ sentiment takes hold – perhaps due to geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, or tightening monetary policies – investors typically withdraw from riskier assets. This scenario often sees both the KOSPI and Bitcoin experience declines, further solidifying the observed KOSPI Bitcoin correlation . Their movements are intertwined by the ebb and flow of global capital. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Understanding the KOSPI Bitcoin correlation provides valuable context, but what does it mean for your investment strategy? It’s crucial to remember that correlation does not equal causation, and markets are influenced by numerous factors. However, this analysis offers a compelling signal to consider: Monitor Global Indicators: Keep an eye on major global stock indices, particularly those sensitive to international trade and economic sentiment like the KOSPI. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying on a single indicator is risky. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate potential downturns. Practice Risk Management: Be prepared for potential market shifts. Set stop-losses and have a clear exit strategy for your investments. Stay Informed: Continuously research and understand the various macro and micro factors influencing the crypto market. The KOSPI Bitcoin correlation is one piece of a larger puzzle. While the KOSPI hitting a record high doesn’t guarantee an immediate Bitcoin decline, it certainly warrants caution and a re-evaluation of your market outlook. This powerful KOSPI Bitcoin correlation could be a critical tool in your analytical arsenal. The recent record high of South Korea’s KOSPI index has brought an intriguing KOSPI Bitcoin correlation back into the spotlight. Historical analysis by Alphractal suggests that KOSPI peaks have often preceded Bitcoin’s cycle highs and subsequent downturns, driven by their shared sensitivity to global risk sentiment. While not a definitive predictor, this connection serves as a powerful reminder for investors to closely monitor macroeconomic signals and integrate them into their crypto investment strategies. As markets evolve, understanding these broader influences becomes increasingly essential for informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions About KOSPI and Bitcoin Q1: What is the KOSPI index? A1: The KOSPI (Korea Composite Stock Price Index) is the benchmark stock market index for the Korea Exchange in South Korea. It represents the performance of all common stocks traded on the country’s main stock market. Q2: What is the main finding regarding the KOSPI Bitcoin correlation? A2: An analysis by Alphractal suggests a historical pattern where KOSPI record highs have often coincided with Bitcoin’s cycle peaks, preceding subsequent declines in the cryptocurrency. Q3: Why do KOSPI and Bitcoin show a correlation? A3: Both the KOSPI and Bitcoin are highly sensitive to global risk sentiment and macroeconomic conditions. When risk appetite is high, capital flows into both; when risk-off sentiment prevails, both tend to fall. Q4: Does a KOSPI record high guarantee a Bitcoin decline? A4: No, correlation does not equal causation. While historical patterns show a strong KOSPI Bitcoin correlation , numerous factors influence Bitcoin’s price. It serves as an important signal for caution and further analysis, not a guarantee. Q5: How can investors use this information? A5: Investors can use this insight to monitor global economic indicators, diversify their portfolios, practice robust risk management, and stay informed about broader market influences, rather than solely relying on this one correlation.

Mutuum Finance presale is already in Phase 6 with tokens available at $0.035. MUTM has risen above $15.6M in funds raised and investors interested in the project are over 16,200. As Ethereum continues its roots in decentralized environments, Mutuum Finance is making a name for itself with its new-generation DeFi lending model that seeks to bring real-world liquidity into the digital asset market. The fresh momentum comes at a turning point where analysts are split on whether recent market signals mean that a broader uptrend is beginning or merely a temporary surge. Ethereum (ETH) Trades Sideways as Market Eyes Potential Rebound Ethereum (ETH) is trading at about $4,367 now, with moderate intraday movement as the larger market appears to be stabilizing after initial signs of a possible bounce. The cryptocurrency remains leading the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, benefiting from growing institutional appetite and protocol upgrades as investors consider whether recent gains mark the start of a sustainable uptrend or a transient rally. Amidst this shifting landscape, attention is slowly shifting to newer platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance: Risk Mitigations and Protocol Safety Mutuum Finance employs robust risk parameters for all base assets. These include overcollateralization protocols, deposit and borrowing limits, and pre-defined collateral thresholds. To liquidate undercollateralized positions, which brings stability, liquidators are provided with incentives. For correlated assets, higher collateral efficiency means the power of borrowing also rises with LTV ratios putting a cap on collateralized borrowing. Trigger for liquidation and penalties safeguard the protocol and incentivize prompt action. Reserve factors function as a buffer for defaults and tail market events, with greater reserves allocated to riskier assets. Stage 6 Token Presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already been scooped up by 16,200 investors and has sold over $15.6 million worth of tokens. To increase the security of the platform and promote community involvement, the project has introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, where bug hunting is rewarded in four categories depending on the severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Adaptive Interest Rate Mechanism Mutuum Finance is a variable rate system. During periods of high liquidity, borrowing is cheap; during periods of low liquidity, borrowing is expensive to deter excessive borrowing. The system encourages either the borrowers to pay back their loans or encourage fresh deposits to re-balance the system. Higher Security Due to Strict Lending Policies There is strict control over all assets of Mutuum Finance. Examples of them are supply caps, borrowing caps, and collateral caps. Overcollateralization renders the protocol resilient to market volatility, and incentivized liquidators limit undercollateralized loans. Insolvency risk is minimized through lending and borrowing caps, which limit exposure to risky or illiquid assets. Correlated assets receive high collateral efficiency, and riskier tokens have lower collateral availability. 10 members will get a further $10k MUTM each towards the end of the presale as part of an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . Market Volatility and Asset Liquidity There must be sufficient on-chain liquidity such that stressed positions are liquidated with minimal slippage. Liquidation levels and parameters moderate exposure, with more incentive rewarded to liquidators the lower the liquidity. Asset volatility dictates Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels: less volatile assets may collateralize higher LTVs and higher levels, and volatile assets more conservative ones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rise is nothing short of astronomical. Stage 6 presale tokens can be secured for $0.035, with over $15.6M raised and 16,200+ investors already on board.

Key Takeaways: 3AC’s liquidators have subpoenaed SBF, Ellison, and Salame over alleged $1.5B in illegal liquidations. SBF’s deposition is set for October 14, 2025, at Terminal Island federal prison. Zhu Su claims Salame used insider info to profit $1B, intensifying scrutiny on FTX-linked executives. A legal notice filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on September 9 shows that 3AC’s joint liquidators, Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer, intend to depose Bankman-Fried under Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The deposition is scheduled to take place on October 14, 2025, at the Federal Correctional Institution in Terminal Island, California, where Bankman-Fried is currently being held. Zhu Su Accuses SBF of Illegally Liquidating $1.5B in 3AC Assets The move follows accusations by 3AC co-founder Zhu Su, who claims Bankman-Fried liquidated $1.5 billion of their positions without proper justification. Zhu also alleges that Ryne Salame exploited insider information to front-run trades against client positions, ultimately cashing out over $1 billion before the FTX collapse. Ellison, who ran Alameda Research during the time of the alleged actions, is also expected to face questioning over the interconnected trading and liquidation strategies that may have played a role in pushing 3AC into insolvency. The subpoenas come as part of broader recovery efforts tied to the bankruptcies of both FTX and 3AC, two of the most high-profile collapses in crypto history. 3AC have filed a notice to subponea SBF, Ryne Salame, Caroline Ellison Sam's disposition will occur on 14 Oct 2025 @zhusu has said that Sam liquidated $1.5bn of their positions illegally, and Ryne Salame used inside info to trade against client positions to cash out $1bn pic.twitter.com/LMr2VzMA2l — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) September 11, 2025 With billions in investor funds still missing, liquidators are intensifying efforts to trace potential misconduct, misappropriations, or preferential transfers involving the former executives. Bankman-Fried’s testimony will be recorded via video and stenographic means, subject to prison protocols. It remains to be seen whether additional criminal referrals or civil claims will emerge from these proceedings. FTX to Begin Next Round of Cash Distributions As reported, FTX has announced that it will begin its next round of cash distributions to creditors on or around September 30, 2025. The record date for eligible claimants was set for August 15. The payments will be processed through FTX’s designated distribution partners, including BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer. Meanwhile, a Chinese creditor representing over 300 users is opposing FTX’s proposal to restrict payouts in 49 jurisdictions, including China, arguing it is legally unfounded and unfair. Earlier this year, FTX began repaying creditors after securing court approval for its redistribution plan, and to date, has returned approximately $6.2 billion. FTX, once a dominant player in the crypto space, collapsed in November 2022 following a liquidity crisis triggered by revelations about its balance sheet. The fallout led to criminal charges against founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced in 2023 to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of more than $11 billion. However, he is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse for good behavior. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars.

The Foundation will seek a listing through a merger with an existing company, and establish one additional entity. The Avalanche Foundation announced plans to launch two treasury companies in the USA, establishing a new entity and merging with a listed company. The Foundation aims to build a $1B AVAX treasury, boosting the value of its token. The first deal will raise $500M to invest in a NASDAQ-listed company. The funds will be raised in a private placement led by Hivemind Capital. The second deal will build a special-purpose acquisition company, in a raise led by Dragonfly Capital, aiming to raise another $500M. This deal may not be concluded until October. Following the news, AVAX rallied to $29.12, reaching a three-month high. AVAX has been recovering gradually, as the network rebuilt its traffic through DeFi and selected games. AVAX rallied to a three-month high on news of an upcoming $1B treasury. | Source: Coingecko The Avalanche chain underwent several transformations during the years-long bear market, shifting from a gaming hub to a DeFi network. Avalanche aims to become the main platform for capital markets Avalanche remains one of the more prominent L1 chains, with a proven track record for handling a significant transaction load. The network aims to become the go-to digital ledger for capital markets, competing with the current leaders Ethereum, Solana and BNB Chain. Based on an FT report , the non-profit Avalanche Foundation is in talks with companies like BlackRock and Visa to create the two entities for the US market. The entities hope to raise up to $1B, one of the highest treasury funds, expecting at least one of the deals to conclude in September. The AVAX deal will use some of the reserves of the Avalanche Foundation, offering the tokens at a discounted price, said persons familiar with the potential sale. The Avalanche Foundation has not yet issued an official statement. The AVAX treasury plans arrive at the tail of a series of altcoin reserves, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. Some of the treasuries do not buy tokens on the open market, but use the existing reserves of early investors, teams, or other big holders. Selling stocks tied to a crypto asset is a way to monetize those reserves, which could not be sold on the open market. Recent research by Kaiko shows treasury activity is concentrated in a handful of the top digital assets. Smaller altcoin treasuries are currently negligible, making the plans of the Avalanche Foundation more ambitious. Avalanche grows on-chain activity, asset value Avalanche has recovered around $2B in asset value, still below its 2021 peak of over $9B. New DeFi protocols have deployed on the chain, most notably a native version of Aave and Euler. Avalanche C-Chain also saw over $30M in net inflows for the past month, actively interacting with the wider crypto ecosystem. However, for now, AVAX lags behind SOL and other blue-chip tokens, as altcoin momentum is closely watched for signs of reversal and risks of loss. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Most larger-cap altcoins are in the green as well, with DOGE and XLM surging by up to 3%. AVAX has risen by over 6%. BTC Rises Before US CPI Data The primary cryptocurrency tried to take down the crucial $113,000 support on a couple of occasions in the past week, but each attempt was met with an immediate rejection. The subsequent decline drove it south by a few grand, as it happened on September 6 and September 10. The bulls initiated another leg up in the past 24 hours that also saw BTC challenge that level. This time, though, the asset was a lot more successful as it finally breached that level. Moreover, it kept climbing and tapped a 17-day peak of $114,500 earlier this morning. Although it has retraced slightly since then, it still trades around $114,000. More volatility is expected later today when the US CPI numbers are set to be announced. The past few such occasions led to immediate price declines before bitcoin managed to recover the lost ground. For now, though, BTC’s market cap has risen to $2.270 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has calmed at 56% on CG. BTCUSD.

Ethereum has risen past $4,400 after a 2.3% jump over the past 24 hours. In contrast, WLD has dropped by almost 8% after the recent rally that drove it north to well over $2.

Avalanche Foundation Plans to Establish $1 Billion AVAX Treasury Companies in the US The foundation aims to raise around $1 billion, and deals are expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, according to the Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the matter. One of the planned initiatives involves converting a Nasdaq-listed company into a treasury vehicle, a deal that involves a planned private investment of up to $500 million. It was reported that the investment was led by Hivemind Capital and advised by SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, and is expected to be completed by the end of September. The other deal will be made through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Dragonfly Capital, which is also aiming to raise $500 million and close in October. It was reported that with the revenue to be generated, the companies to be established will purchase millions of AVAX tokens and these tokens will be offered at a discounted price by the Avalanche Foundation. The move aligns with the recent acceleration of the institutional digital asset treasury (DAT) trend, with many large corporations acquiring publicly traded companies and transforming them into crypto treasuries. Meanwhile, the Avalanche network is currently being tested by investment giants like BlackRock, Apollo, and Wellington Asset Management for tokenization of funds. Following the news, the AVAX price rose 10.17% in the last 24 hours, reaching $29.11. *This is not investment advice.

This bold financial decision now places their total holdings at an impressive 152,000 ETH, valued at approximately $670 million, as reported by EmberCN. This substantial investment highlights a renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum, signaling a potentially bullish outlook for the popular altcoin. Why Are These Ethereum Purchases So Significant? The decision by Trend Research to ramp up their Ethereum purchases is more than just a headline; it represents a crucial indicator of market sentiment. Institutional investors like Trend Research often conduct extensive due diligence before making such large commitments. Their actions can often foreshadow broader market trends and validate the long-term potential of a digital asset. Consider these key points regarding this development: Validation of Ethereum’s Ecosystem: This investment underscores the growing belief in Ethereum’s robust network, its ongoing development, and its pivotal role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors. Strategic Timing: Resuming purchases suggests that Trend Research sees current market conditions as an opportune entry point or an attractive accumulation phase for ETH. Market Influence: Such a large-scale acquisition by a major player can inspire confidence among other institutional and retail investors, potentially influencing future price movements and liquidity. What Drives Institutional Ethereum Purchases? What compels a sophisticated entity like Trend Research to make such substantial Ethereum purchases ? The reasons are multifaceted, reflecting Ethereum’s evolving utility and potential for significant returns. It’s not simply about buying a digital coin; it’s about investing in a foundational technology. Key drivers often include: Staking Yield Opportunities: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via the Merge, investors can earn rewards by staking their ETH, providing a passive income stream. Deflationary Mechanism: Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a burning mechanism for transaction fees, potentially making ETH a deflationary asset over time, which can increase its scarcity and value. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the dominant platform for dApps, smart contracts, and Web3 innovation. Investing in ETH is akin to investing in the internet’s next iteration. Diversification: For large investment firms, including digital assets like ETH in their portfolio can offer diversification benefits and exposure to a high-growth asset class. The Ripple Effect: How Do Large Ethereum Purchases Impact the Market? When an entity makes substantial Ethereum purchases , it inevitably sends ripples through the broader cryptocurrency market. This kind of institutional activity is closely watched by analysts and individual investors alike, as it can provide insights into potential market directions. Here’s how these actions can play out: Positive Sentiment: Large institutional buys often generate positive sentiment, encouraging more investors to consider or increase their ETH holdings. Price Stability and Growth: Consistent buying pressure from major players can contribute to price stability and provide a floor during market downturns, potentially leading to upward price momentum over time. Increased Liquidity: While large purchases might temporarily reduce available supply, the overall confidence they instill can attract more market participants, ultimately increasing liquidity. Legitimization of Crypto: Each significant institutional investment further legitimizes cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class, paving the way for broader adoption and regulatory clarity. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Ethereum? The recent Ethereum purchases by Trend Research serve as a powerful reminder of Ethereum’s enduring appeal and its potential for future growth. However, like any investment, it’s essential to consider both the opportunities and the challenges ahead. Looking forward, investors should keep an eye on: Scalability Solutions: Ethereum’s ongoing efforts to improve scalability through Layer 2 solutions and future sharding upgrades will be crucial for its long-term success. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations globally could impact institutional participation and the overall market environment for digital assets. Competitive Landscape: While dominant, Ethereum faces competition from other Layer 1 blockchains, necessitating continuous innovation. In conclusion, Trend Research’s substantial Ethereum purchases are a compelling testament to the asset’s growing institutional appeal and its critical role in the digital economy. This move by a major investment firm underscores the increasing confidence in Ethereum’s technological advancements and its potential as a valuable long-term asset. It’s a clear signal that the world of digital finance is rapidly maturing, with sophisticated players making calculated bets on its future.

A groundbreaking collaboration is set to transform how institutional investments operate. Chainlink has joined forces with major U.S. brokerage UBS and institutional tokenized asset exchange DigiFT to automate Chainlink tokenized funds on-chain. This marks a significant step towards blending traditional finance with blockchain, opening new possibilities for investors and the broader market. What Are Chainlink Tokenized Funds and Why Do They Matter? At its core, tokenization involves converting real-world assets, like stocks or bonds, into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent ownership of the underlying asset. Chainlink tokenized funds leverage Chainlink’s industry-standard decentralized oracle networks to ensure these digital assets are secure, reliable, and can interact seamlessly with real-world data and systems. It offers unprecedented levels of: Efficiency: Streamlining processes that are typically slow and manual. Transparency: Providing a clear, immutable record of transactions. Accessibility: Potentially lowering barriers for investors to participate in institutional-grade products. This initiative marks a pivotal moment, showcasing how blockchain technology, specifically through Chainlink, can modernize and enhance the traditional financial landscape. How Does This Revolutionary Collaboration Work? The partnership brings together key players to create a robust ecosystem for on-chain investment. UBS, a global financial powerhouse, provides the tokenized products – essentially, their institutional investment offerings converted into digital tokens. DigiFT, a regulated institutional tokenized asset exchange, acts as the marketplace where these tokenized products can be traded. The innovation lies with Chainlink’s Digital Transfer Agent (DTA) smart contract, which automates the entire lifecycle of these Chainlink tokenized funds . It handles crucial functions like: Issuance of tokens. Redemption processes. Management of corporate actions. Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Essentially, investors will be able to trade UBS’s tokenized products through a smart contract that is both regulatory-approved and powered by Chainlink’s secure infrastructure. This ensures every step, from trading to settlement, is automated and trustworthy. The Powerful Advantages of Automated On-Chain Tokenized Funds Automating Chainlink tokenized funds offers numerous benefits that could reshape finance. Moving processes onto the blockchain improves: Reduced Operational Costs: Automation minimizes manual intervention, leading to lower overheads for financial institutions. Faster Settlement Times: Traditional asset transfers can take days; on-chain transactions can settle in minutes or hours. Enhanced Global Accessibility: Tokenized funds can be traded 24/7 across borders, expanding market access for investors worldwide. Increased Liquidity: By making assets more easily transferable and divisible, tokenization can boost market liquidity. Greater Transparency and Auditability: All transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing a clear audit trail and reducing fraud risks. This streamlined approach makes institutional investments more agile and responsive to market demands, benefiting both institutions and individual investors. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Chainlink Tokenized Funds While the potential for Chainlink tokenized funds is immense, challenges remain. Evolving regulatory frameworks and interoperability between blockchains and traditional systems require continuous development. Clear guidelines are essential for widespread adoption. However, the opportunities far outweigh the hurdles. This collaboration demonstrates a growing acceptance of blockchain technology within mainstream finance. It paves the way for a future where more complex financial products can be tokenized, creating new investment avenues and potentially democratizing access to assets previously reserved for a select few. This pioneering effort by Chainlink, UBS, and DigiFT is setting a new standard for how financial assets will be managed and traded in the digital age. In summary, this partnership is a monumental leap for institutional finance. By automating on-chain Chainlink tokenized funds , it enhances efficiency and transparency, bridging traditional finance with decentralized innovation. This initiative promises a more accessible, liquid, and secure investment future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are tokenized funds?

51538707,578900,1757577645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51538707.jpeg,OCC Head Pushes To Remove ‘Stigma’ In Banking-Crypto Relations–Here’s How,https://bitcoinist.com/occ-head-pushes-to-remove-stigma-in-banking-crypto/,"In a recent address in Washington, D.C., Jonathan Gould, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), expressed a strong commitment to dismantling the “two-tiered system” he says unfairly stigmatizes legal activities between traditional banks and the crypto industry. Gould articulated his belief that many of the activities associated with cryptocurrencies and the underlying technologies are essential to modern financial intermediation services. OCC Ready To Collaborate With Banks On Crypto Gould emphasized that the Treasury Department’s independent bureau is prepared to work closely with banks interested in engaging with crypto assets. “We’re going to take a step back to see if we’re going to work much more closely with those who are interested in doing these activities,” he stated. His focus is on ensuring that banks can participate in these legally permissible activities in a manner that prioritizes safety and soundness. As regulators, he insists it is their obligation to facilitate such engagement without imposing unnecessary barriers. This shift coincides with a more accommodating stance by US regulators toward digital assets, influenced by President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the planet.” Since taking office earlier this year, President Trump’s administration has taken steps to support the industry, including issuing executive orders, regulating stablecoins, and calling for the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. As such, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to drop its enforcement cases against the industry’s largest firms and individuals. Coupled with these decisions are statements from the agency’s leadership that have spurred renewed confidence and further investments in the sector throughout the year. Gould Targets Debanking Practices Bloomberg reports that the OCC has also sought to combat the practice of debanking, which involves denying banking services to certain individuals or businesses, often impacting “politically sensitive clients” like cryptocurrency firms. While critics argue that bank examiners have pressured digital asset lenders to sever ties with such clients, consumer advocates point out that evidence of widespread debanking is lacking. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s head acknowledged that when banks consider entering new activities, they must develop the necessary infrastructure to support these initiatives. He reiterated that while the OCC’s regulatory framework needs to address the unique risks posed by new technologies like crypto, innovation should not inherently conflict with safety and soundness. “I don’t see innovation as inconsistent with safety and soundness on its face,” he asserted, highlighting a forward-looking approach that balances risk management with the need for financial innovation. Ultimately, the regulatory environment in the US and the stance of these regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), highlight a departure from previous years, prompting traditional finance firms to increase their exposure to the digital asset sector.

Since this move has been completed, it is now time for the cryptocurrency to move into the next stage of the analysis. At this junction, there is a simple roadblock to a continuation of the rally and that lies at $3.13. In the follow-up analysis, Dark Defender reveals what could happen if the XRP price were to either break or get rejected at this level. What To Expect From The XRP Price In the analysis, Dark Defender highlighted that there is a possibility of some downside after the XRP price hits the 3rd Wave target. This 3rd Wave target sits between $3.01 and $3.07, and the initial run-up on Tuesday had seen the cryptocurrency quickly clear this level. Related Reading: XRP Price Setting Up For Next Leg With Expected Targets Reaching $19.27 The next wave that could trigger the expected downtrend is Wave 4, which is historically bearish. This is not out of the ordinary, as a bullish wave, such as the 3rd Wave, will usually see a correction. This correction can often present an opportunity for bulls to reload while the Wave 4 plays out. However, there is another important wave in this mix, and that is the E Wave. As the crypto analyst explains, for this wave to play out, it would be entirely dependent on where the price goes. From here, the next major level is $3.13, and that is the make-or-break level. Now, if the bulls are able to completely break the resistance at $3.13 and continue further, then it would invalidate any bearish wave. But in the case of a full rejection and the price bouncing back, then the E wave could be triggered for the XRP price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $150,000, Ethereum At $8,000, And An Altcoin Season? Analyst Reveals When In the event of an E Wave trend, the XRP price would be expected to see a steep decline. This would go through all of the important Fibonacci levels, and the crypto analyst explains that it could send the XRP price tumbling back down to as low as $2.74. Nevertheless, for now, the D wave remains in play, suggesting stronger dominance from the bulls. Once the Wave 4 is completed, then the last and final wave, the Wave 5, is expected to play out. This is historically the most bullish wave and could be responsible for a break above $3.13.

A DAO operates according to blockchain rules rather than a centralized authority. The rules are coded into smart contracts, and members typically hold tokens that enable them to vote on decisions, such as spending money, modifying features, or initiating projects. According to an X post by delegate Olimpio, co-founder Haichen Shen stated that the team was “redesigning governance.” Scroll contributor Raza emphasized the move was a “pause"" and not a complete stop. Delegates are members trusted to vote on behalf of others. People who don’t want to track every decision can “delegate” their voting power to someone they believe will represent their interests. It is unclear whether active proposals, including a treasury management measure, will be honored. Olimpio said that the DAO leadership figure Eugene resigned this week, leaving Scroll team members to admit they were unsure which proposals were live or previously approved. Scroll has asked for time to “put everything in order” before laying out next steps. The structure and process of governance remain unsettled, and the direction appears tilted toward a more centralized approach. Meanwhile, top delegates remain in position: Olimpio ranks fourth with 176,000 SCR in voting power. Governance proposals are still technically live, but the extent to which they will be executed is unclear.

But despite this hold, the possibility of further easing hasn’t been ruled out. Officials inside the ECB say they’re pausing, not stopping, while watching how things play out with U.S. trade policy, Germany’s fiscal push, and political chaos in France. The bank had already cut its key rate in half this year, landing at 2% by June. Since then, it’s been in wait-and-see mode. Officials believe the economy is stable, not thriving, but not crashing either. Summer data gave no major surprises, just more time for policymakers to figure out what’s coming next. They’re especially watching Donald Trump’s 15% tariffs on European goods, a spending spree from the German government, and rising bond yields in France triggered by political uncertainty. Lagarde dodges details as last rate cut remains in play ECB president Christine Lagarde is not expected to offer clarity about future interest rate decisions during her press conference on later today. Her approach in July was to be, as she put it, “deliberately uninformative,” batting away every question about the direction of monetary policy. This time looks no different, because inflation is likely to fall below the 2% target next year, a development that keeps the idea of a final “insurance” cut on the table. Analysts at HSBC wrote , “The risk of a more persistent inflation undershooting, which might become evident in December, when the ECB will be forecasting out to 2028, suggests a dovish bias.” But it’s not a big debate. Policymakers are only discussing the possibility of one more cut. Most agree the major rate moves are done. The conversation now is about whether that last trim is needed, and when. Traders are split, with a 50-60% chance of that final rate drop by spring. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve, under Trump’s leadership, is widely expected to lower rates six times before the end of next year. The ECB will announce its rate decision earlier in the day, at 1215 GMT. Council split as trade tension and France raise risks Inside the Governing Council, views on what to do next aren’t aligned. The hawks, the group that wants no more easing, argue that the euro zone has handled global headwinds better than expected. They point to stronger industrial activity, higher German government spending, and steady consumer demand as proof that the economy is holding up. Even with Trump’s tariffs landing harder than forecasted, companies across the bloc have adjusted. A deal has been agreed, and that’s helped lower some of the uncertainty. BNP Paribas said in a research note, “Our base case remains for the economy to remain resilient, as trade-induced uncertainty recedes and gives way to a more positive impulse from higher European defence and German infrastructure spending.” But that’s just one side of the fight. The doves, those pushing for another rate cut, say the tariffs haven’t fully filtered through the system yet, worried about what happens if growth slows and prices weaken right as inflation dips below target. That could push firms to lock in lower prices and wages, which risks dragging the euro zone back into the kind of weak inflation environment seen before COVID-19. If people and businesses start believing prices will stay flat, that belief becomes hard to undo. Another complication is the Fed’s expected rate cuts could lift the euro’s value, making imported goods cheaper and dragging inflation down further. Then there’s France. A fresh political mess in Paris has pushed French bond yields sharply higher. That puts extra pressure on the ECB, especially since France’s economy is already weighed down by high public debt and weak growth. While the bank does have tools to respond, they can only be used when borrowing costs rise in a way that’s “unwarranted and disorderly.” Right now, economists say that’s not the case. The problems in France are real, and that means the ECB has no easy excuse to intervene, at least not yet.

Here’s What U.S. Secretary of Commerce Just Said,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-could-hand-xrp-over-as-code-to-the-government-heres-what-u-s-secretary-of-commerce-just-said/,"Howard Lutnick, the United States Secretary of Commerce, recently offered an unusual explanation of how certain products can reach the government without traditional procurement hurdles. In a video shared on X by John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire), Lutnick described the role of what he called a “gratis vendor.” He said it is simply an approved vendor that gives products to the government rather than selling them. He explained that this approach allows agencies to bypass lengthy approval procedures. If the government purchases a product, even for a token amount, it must enter what Lutnick called “government hell.” By contrast, a gratis vendor can provide technology or services directly at no cost, which federal agencies can adopt more quickly. Lutnick gave a straightforward example. He noted that if he wrote software for the Commerce Department, he could provide it for free rather than sell it. The principle, he emphasized, is that giving avoids regulatory complications tied to procurement. XRP x U.S. Treasury This isn’t hype — it’s infrastructure Ripple could hand $XRP over as code to the government. They won’t buy it… they’ll use it. Are you watching — or still sleeping? pic.twitter.com/D3HhGZqugM — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 10, 2025 A Pathway for XRP The video gained traction after being shared by Squire, who highlighted its relevance to ongoing debates around XRP’s role in U.S. infrastructure. He suggested that the concept of gratis vendors could have direct implications for how the government might use the digital asset . Lutnick’s comments imply that if a digital asset or related technology were provided without direct sale, federal agencies could integrate it without triggering the full weight of procurement regulations. This distinction matters because it demonstrates one possible pathway for blockchain adoption within government systems, particularly in areas such as payments, compliance, or data security. For a digital asset suppressed by unnecessary regulatory attempts , this approach would save XRP from further regulatory hurdles while letting U.S. citizens fully enjoy its benefits. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Will the Government Use XRP? Squire argued that XRP could be provided to the U.S. government in a manner consistent with the gratis vendor model. Rather than purchasing XRP or associated code, Ripple could give it freely to federal agencies as infrastructure to build upon. This interpretation aligns with ongoing discussions around XRP, which has long been positioned as a solution for cross-border settlement and liquidity. If XRP is framed as a gratis contribution rather than a product for sale, U.S. government agencies could adopt it more easily than through traditional procurement routes.

The question arises whether Bitcoin will maintain its position above the $110K mark or lose ground. Explore which digital and physical assets show promise for upward movement amidst this dynamic market shift. Bitcoin Steadies Above $110K, Eyes Further Climb Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently trading between $107K and $114K, showing steadiness. It's testing a resistance point around $117K. With its price recently increasing by just over 2% in a week, Bitcoin looks to rebound from a slight 4% dip over the month. Over the past six months, the digital currency has climbed by nearly 36%, which suggests a strong upward potential. If it pushes past its current resistance, analysts expect it could rise towards $122K, marking an increase of about 7%. With growing market momentum, Bitcoin could keep attracting interest, pushing prices higher. Conclusion BTC's current pause could be a critical point. It needs to hold above $110K to maintain positive momentum. The weakening dollar boosts gold and silver, affecting market dynamics. If BTC defends the $110K level, it may lead to further bullish trends. A drop below could trigger selling pressure. Monitoring these levels will provide insight into BTC's next move.

Finally, Atkins mentioned the development of a Super app and an integrated blockchain vision that could validate all-in-one crypto projects. Atkins’ speech increased the positive outlook on digital assets, contributing to a surge in Bitcoin’s price. The crypto king is now trading at $114,233 , with the 24-hour trading volume up by 18%. Atkins’ address has also heightened investor appetite for tokens pioneering Bitcoin’s scalability, with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) already raising $15M in one of the best presales of 2025. Paul Atkins Unveils Game-Changing Crypto Regulatory Vision Atkins emphasized the importance of bringing more clarity and legal certainty to on-chain capital raising, which would require the SEC to ensure transparency and consistency in rules. One of the highlights of the address was ‘Project Crypto,’ a framework designed to modernize regulation, enabling platforms to offer trading, lending, and staking services under a single license. This alone could lead to the creation of crypto ‘super-apps,’ bringing various cryptocurrency services under one interface. He then applauded Europe’s early adoption of the MiCA framework , emphasizing the transformative potential of AI and blockchain integration—a next-generation solution that could lower costs and expand access to advanced trading tools. The new policy is a welcomed shift from aggressive enforcement to a more flexible and innovative approach, establishing the U.S. as a global leader in the cryptocurrency landscape. Atkins’ Crypto Shake-Up—Here’s How Investors Stand to Win With Atkins clearing the air for new crypto policies, investors and users stand to benefit the most. Project and regulatory clarity are major catalysts for token growth, crypto fundraising, and integrated financial applications in the U.S., and also help eliminate legal uncertainties that act as obstacles for proper growth. The Clarity Act and SEC-CFTC cooperation agreement is already a step in the right direction. Besides, Atkins’ policy shift would make crypto markets more accessible, transparent, and safe for retail investors. And best of all, we could get new crypto ETFs (like Rex-Osprey’s new lineup ) and hybrid portfolios (Bitcoin/gold), which let you diversify without navigating unregulated platforms. As regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, it will encourage more whale and retail investors to move capital into promising Layer-2 projects, such as Bitcoin Hyper. SEC’s Atkins Sparks Market Optimism—Is Bitcoin Hyper the Next Big Thing In Crypto? Built on a Bitcoin Layer 2 via the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) enables ultra-fast and low-cost contract execution without compromising Bitcoin’s unmatched security. The industry will finally have dApps, smart contracts, and modern DeFi features on Bitcoin’s ageing chain! The token will support lending, borrowing, and liquidity farming on partner platforms, with optional token burns that boost scarcity and long-term value. $HYPER’s presale launched at $0.0115 per token, with prices increasing every 3 days. With a planned listing price of $0.012975, early presale buyers stand to benefit significantly. The presale has raised over $15M so far, and you can participate while it is still in its early phases and before broader market recognition drives the value higher. With a fixed supply of 21B tokens, $HYPER has reserved 15% for rewards, including staking incentives, activated immediately after the TGE. Bitcoin Hyper’s staking program offers a compelling 74% APY, providing early holders with attractive rewards alongside price appreciation. Additionally, 30% of the total tokens are allocated to Layer 2 development, reflecting the project’s strong commitment to scaling and developing new decentralized applications (dApps). Not to mention, the recent whale buys of $161.3K and $100.6K show big-money confidence and strong growth potential. Analysts expect $HYPER to reach $0.02595 by 2025 and as high as $0.253 by 2030, offering holders an eye-catching ROI of 1,861% from the current price of $0.012895. Read more about the Bitcoin Hyper price prediction 2025 – 2030 here . Takeaway: Clear Rules and Market Optimism Make Bitcoin Hyper a Token to Watch Paul Atkins’ push for clarity on-chain fundraising and predictable rules has reinstated confidence in Bitcoin-based projects like Bitcoin Hyper. The new regulatory framework aims to protect investors but also open doors to blockchain innovation, while ensuring market fairness and innovation. Atkins’ policy shift has elevated $HYPER’s growth potential to the next level. With strategic developments and increasing adoption, Bitcoin Hyper’s $15M raise lays the groundwork for exponential growth. There isn’t much time left if you want to get in at the current $0.012895 price, as it’ll increase in less than 2 days. To grab your tokens now, visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale page.

This remarkable surge prompts speculation on whether institutional interest might drive XRP's value beyond $3.50. The article delves into this development and examines which digital currencies are poised for growth in the burgeoning crypto market. XRP on the Rise: Will It Continue to Climb? Source: tradingview XRP is trading between $2.74 and $2.97. It's showing a notable climb over the past six months, rising over 27%. Buyers are eyeing the next key level at $3.07. If XRP breaks through, the next target could be around $3.30. This represents a potential gain of over 10% from its current position. While the short-term trend has been a little shaky, there’s hope for more upward movement. With momentum indicators looking steady, XRP enthusiasts are optimistic about its growth potential, though it faces a test against its current moving averages. Institutional inflows through the record-breaking Canadian ETF could provide the catalyst for a decisive breakout. If demand from large players continues to mount, the much-discussed $3.50 level may come into focus sooner than expected. Conclusion The recent surge in assets under management for the Canadian ETF suggests heightened institutional interest in XRP. This influx of investment might drive XRP's price beyond $3.50. Institutional demand often boosts market confidence and can lead to stronger price performance. The increasing interest underscores XRP's growing appeal to larger investors. If current trends persist, XRP's value could see significant gains, fueled by continued adoption and investment. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Atkins’ declaration signals a pivotal shift in the regulatory debate that has long clouded crypto. For years, uncertainty over whether tokens qualify as securities fueled lawsuits, stifled adoption, and rattled investor confidence. By drawing a clearer line, Atkins delivers the clarity businesses and investors have sought for years. The SEC chair’s stance is clear that most crypto tokens are not securities. This practical line could finally end years of regulatory gray areas and litigation-driven policy. The distinction is critical, it dictates whether tokens can trade openly on exchanges, whether developers must register offerings, and how institutions handle custody and listings. This position has major implications for XRP, a cryptocurrency often at the center of regulatory battles. The recently ended SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple in recent years hinged on whether XRP was sold as an unregistered security. With the chair’s latest statement, the tide appears to be turning in favor of broader acceptance and legitimacy for XRP and similar assets. Chainalysis Extends XRP Ledger Support with Automatic Token Support Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has announced the expansion of its compliance and risk management solutions to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), bringing automatic token support to one of the most widely used blockchain networks for payments and tokenization. The move underscores the growing role of XRPL in the evolving digital asset ecosystem and highlights Chainalysis’ commitment to strengthening transparency and security across blockchain platforms. The integration allows exchanges, financial institutions, and token issuers on the XRP Ledger to tap into Chainalysis’ full suite of tools, enabling transaction tracking, compliance monitoring, and detection of suspicious activity to meet AML and CTF requirements. Chainalysis pointed out , “With this extended integration, Chainalysis’ support goes beyond the native XRP token, offering automatic token support. This includes supporting new fungible (IOUs) and non-fungible (XLS-20) tokens on the network, as well as multi-purpose tokens (MPT), similar to the well-known ERC-1155 token standard.” Chainalysis now supports over 260,000 XRPL tokens, a number growing daily as new tokens are minted. Users can leverage Chainalysis KYT for real-time monitoring and alerts, while extended support across entity screening and Reactor allows them to track fund flows, investigate transactions, visualize money movement, and flag potential illicit activity with precision. Meanwhile, XRP is presently hovering around the $3 mark, with traders watching closely to see if it can muster the momentum for a decisive breakout. Conclusion Atkins’ declaration cements a pivotal shift in how crypto is viewed and regulated. By affirming that most tokens, including XRP, are not securities, the SEC is unlocking new opportunities for innovation, investment, and global adoption. The stage is set for digital assets to evolve from speculative markets into the backbone of tomorrow’s financial system. On the other hand, by extending support to the XRP Ledger with automatic token integration, Chainalysis not only enhances the security and transparency of XRPL but also empowers developers, institutions, and regulators to operate with greater confidence.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-11 08:16:15

As market dynamics shift, the price of Cardano (ADA) is predicted to dip below $0.30 by 2026, a stark contrast to its peak prices. Cardano's Declining Trajectory Having once reached an all-time high of $3.10, ADA is currently valued at approximately $0.88. This decline has sparked speculation among analysts about its future, with some estimating a further decrease to below $0.50 by 2026 unless significant technological advancements or market changes occur. Though some experts remain hopeful, suggesting that ADA could fluctuate between $1.20 and $2.00 in 2026, much depends on its ability to innovate and adapt. Introduction to Layer Brett While Cardano faces these challenges, a new contender, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , is making waves in the cryptocurrency market. This meme coin, unlike its predecessors, promises not only viral appeal but also practical utility. Built on Ethereum's Layer 2, it offers fast transactions and low gas fees, enhancing its attractiveness among crypto enthusiasts. Layer Brett is currently in presale, priced at just $0.0055, and has already raised over $3.3 million. Its staking system offers up to 781% APY, attracting significant investor interest. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens and a deflationary model, it also promises long-term value retention. Strategic Advantage of Layer Brett The innovative approach of Layer Brett extends beyond its technical attributes. Its roadmap includes features such as NFT integrations and multi-blockchain support, positioning it well within the competitive landscape. Its community-driven model, highlighted by a $1 million giveaway, has also helped it gain a robust follower base on social media platforms. With its blend of meme culture and blockchain functionality, Layer Brett is poised to capture a niche that appreciates both humor and utility, setting it apart from many low-cap altcoins. Market Shifts: Cardano vs. Layer Brett As investors search for the next big opportunity in crypto, Layer Brett appears to offer a favorable mix of innovation, community engagement, and market strategy. In contrast, Cardano's struggle to maintain a consistent upward trajectory could lead to a decline in investor confidence, unless it can roll out compelling updates or leverage its existing technological groundwork effectively. Is it Time to Stake? For those considering joining the Layer Brett wave, the presale offers an appealing entry point. The staking features are already active, providing an excellent opportunity for early investors to maximize returns. The project's dynamic approach and community-focused promotions suggest that the time to act is now, before the presale concludes. Join the Layer Brett presale today to take part in what could be one of the most exciting developments in the Layer 2 space this year.

The Ministry of SMEs and Startups confirmed that it had approved changes to the Enforcement Decree of the Venture Business Act, clearing the way for virtual asset brokers and exchanges. The measure will come into force on Sept. 16, allowing crypto businesses to seek venture status. Han Seong-sook believes the amendment will cultivate future growth potential Authorities first slapped the restriction in place in October 2018, when they blamed excessive speculation and public panic. Under that standard, crypto businesses were lumped in with gambling dens and nightlife spots, a classification the industry complained was detrimental for Korea’s innovation and competitiveness. A lot has changed since then. South Korea has taken major steps to bring order to its crypto market, starting with the introduction of a licensing system for virtual asset service providers in 2021. This was followed by the passage of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July 2025, which added deposit protection, mandatory record-keeping, and bans on unfair trading — all key measures that helped professionalize the industry and address past concerns. Globally, momentum has shifted, too. In the U.S., the SEC approved Bitcoin spot ETFs in 2024, and the GENIUS Act of 2025 established clear rules for stablecoins. Major players like Coinbase, Gemini, Circle, and Bullish have gone public or filed for Nasdaq and the NYSE listings, a clear signal that digital assets are moving firmly into the financial mainstream. Korean officials indicated in July for the first time that they wanted to lift the restriction and put the plan out for public and industry comment. Now, with the partial amendment, the Ministry has cited the sector’s international growth and the maturity of domestic user protection measures as key reasons for the policy reversal. Ted Koo, attorney at LIN, said the revision will pave the way for tax benefits, R&D funding, credit guarantees, and financing support. Most importantly, it will enable incumbent venture-certified companies to participate in the crypto market without losing their certification. What’s more, regulators anticipate that there will be an increase in innovation in virtual asset trading, brokerages, and related technologies, including blockchain infrastructure, smart contract solutions, and cybersecurity, once the ban has been lifted. Minister of SMEs and Startups, Han Seong-sook, also said the reform aims to foster future growth potential and match the global trajectory of the digital asset industry. He commented, “This regulatory reform is designed to align Korea with global trends in digital assets and to secure future growth engines. We will concentrate policy efforts on fostering a transparent and responsible ecosystem that allows venture capital to flow smoothly and supports the growth of new industries.” South Korea’s crypto exchanges have over 16 million users The crypto space has gained momentum under President Lee Jae-myung’s leadership, as his government has advanced new crypto policies and worked on legalizing stablecoins since his June election. According to Statista, the crypto market in South Korea is expected to hit $1.1 billion in revenue next year and grow to $1.3 billion in 2026. South Korea’s crypto exchanges now count more than 16 million users, a surge partly attributed to the momentum sparked by Donald Trump’s U.S. election win in November, representing more than 30% of Koreans. In relation to this, Cryptopolitan recently reported that South Korean regulators formed laws to address the growing competition and risks associated with the crypto lending sector. The Financial Supervisory Service reportedly prepared the guidelines with the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA). The Financial Services Commission noted that they intend to establish order through self-regulation and quickly pursue legislation based on future operational results.

At this point, ETF investors turned to Bitcoin and futures investors turned to Ethereum. Investors Split Between Bitcoin and Ethereum! Important data from the US this week is being followed before the FED's critical interest rate decision. While expectations for an interest rate cut have been growing ahead of this data, the data shows that it has led to a major divergence between futures investors investing in Ethereum and exchange-traded funds that have converted their capital into Bitcoin. Ethereum's 24-hour futures trading volume reached $49.4 billion, surpassing Bitcoin's $42.9 billion, according to data from analytics firm Coinanalyze. The surge in speculative interest in Ethereum contrasts with capital flows in the ETF space. According to data from SoSoValue, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $1.39 billion over the last ten days. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs saw an outflow of $668 million during the same period, indicating that institutional investors were making a rotational trade. Speaking to Decrypt, Stephen Gregory, founder of cryptocurrency platform Vtrader, said that the divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies is typical, especially with the increasing likelihood of a half-point interest rate cut from the Fed, and that flows will shift to Ethereum and altcoins. “I think we will close the third quarter with an uptrend led by altcoins.” *This is not investment advice.

Understanding the Coinone KRW Suspension Details Coinone, a prominent player in the South Korean crypto market, recently notified its user base about a scheduled service interruption. Specifically, the exchange will temporarily halt all Korean Won (KRW) deposit and withdrawal services. This isn’t a long-term change, but a focused, short-term measure. The suspension is set to occur on September 13 , running from 4:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. UTC . It’s important to note the specific timeframe so you can plan your transactions accordingly. The reason behind this temporary Coinone KRW suspension is routine system maintenance being carried out by KakaoBank, Coinone’s banking partner. Why is This Temporary Suspension Necessary? While any service interruption can be inconvenient, these types of suspensions are often critical for maintaining the health and security of financial systems. KakaoBank, as a major financial institution, regularly undertakes system maintenance to ensure optimal performance, robust security protocols, and to implement necessary upgrades. Think of it like essential roadwork – it might cause a temporary detour, but it leads to a smoother, safer journey in the long run. For Coinone, relying on KakaoBank’s infrastructure means that when the bank performs maintenance, Coinone’s KRW services are directly affected. This collaboration is vital for the smooth operation of KRW transactions on the exchange, emphasizing the interconnectedness of traditional banking and the crypto world. What Does the Coinone KRW Suspension Mean for You? If you are a Coinone user, particularly one who frequently deals with KRW, this announcement directly impacts you. During the specified hours on September 13, you will not be able to initiate or complete any KRW deposits or withdrawals. This means: No New KRW Deposits: You won’t be able to send Korean Won from your bank account to your Coinone account. No KRW Withdrawals: You won’t be able to transfer Korean Won from your Coinone account back to your bank account. However, it’s crucial to understand that this suspension is limited to KRW services. Trading of cryptocurrencies on the Coinone platform is expected to continue as normal. You can still buy, sell, and trade various digital assets using your existing crypto balances. Actionable Steps for Coinone Users Being prepared is key when such announcements are made. Here are a few actionable insights to help you navigate this temporary Coinone KRW suspension : Plan Ahead: If you have urgent KRW deposit or withdrawal needs, try to complete them well before 4:00 p.m. UTC on September 13, or wait until after 11:00 p.m. UTC on the same day. Monitor Official Channels: Always refer to Coinone’s official website or announcement channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the suspension and its resolution. Consider Alternatives (Temporarily): If immediate KRW transactions are absolutely critical, explore other regulated exchanges that might not be affected by KakaoBank’s maintenance, keeping in mind that this is a very short-term disruption. This proactive approach ensures that your financial activities remain as uninterrupted as possible, even during scheduled maintenance periods. Navigating Temporary Disruptions in the Crypto Space The cryptocurrency ecosystem, while innovative, is still intertwined with traditional financial systems and infrastructure. Scheduled maintenance, like the Coinone KRW suspension , is a common occurrence across both realms. These temporary pauses are not usually a cause for alarm but rather a sign of responsible platform management aimed at improving service quality and security. It highlights the importance of staying informed and having a clear understanding of how your chosen exchange operates. Always prioritize platforms that communicate transparently about such events, as it builds trust and allows users to make informed decisions about their funds. By staying alert and planning, you can navigate these brief interruptions with confidence. In conclusion, the temporary Coinone KRW suspension on September 13 is a brief, planned event due to essential KakaoBank system maintenance. While it will impact KRW deposits and withdrawals for a few hours, it underscores Coinone’s commitment to a secure and reliable trading environment. Users are encouraged to plan their KRW transactions around this period and stay updated through Coinone’s official announcements. Being prepared ensures a smooth experience even during these necessary system upgrades. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly is the Coinone KRW suspension scheduled?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures are due out today. Forecasts here are for a slight rise. How could Bitcoin be affected? Market focus moves to CPI release later today Tuesday’s PPI reading for August of -0.1% was a real shot in the arm for the US economy. Analysts had been expecting +0.3, so this was a real positive, showing that tariffs had still not had their impact felt. On Thursday, there will be more focus on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. The consensus here is also for a +0.3% rise in August. With the Federal Reserve potentially about to raise interest rates next week it will be important that this figure does not come in any hotter than expected. If markets do suffer as a result of a negative inflation print, Bitcoin is likely to also take a hit. However, with rate cuts on the horizon, this may only be a temporary dip. $113,500 becomes new horizontal support Source: TradingView In the short-term chart the $BTC price is still heading up, following the ascending channel. With $113,500 flipped into support again, the current upward impulse could continue to the next resistance at $115,700. This coincides nicely with the 0.5 Fibonacci level. The top of the channel would also act as resistance just above this. Looking ahead, for this upside move to advance beyond what has just been mentioned, the big resistance at $117,500 will need to be surpassed. This really is key, and the only other resistance of note before getting back to the all-time high is at $120,000. Breakout of ascending triangle Source: TradingView The daily time frame displays an ascending triangle that the $BTC price broke out of on Wednesday, and looks to be confirming on Thursday. Given that the breakout line is also good horizontal support it might be expected that the price continues to rise from here. The measured move could take the price to just shy of the $120,000 horizontal resistance. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI reveals that its indicator line is gradually moving up. If the indicator line is able to pass up through the downtrend line, this would likely correspond to a breakout in the price action above, possibly at either the $117,500 or the $120,000 horizontal resistances. Have the last few weeks of price action formed a bull flag? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame the last few weeks of price action have been drawn within a bull flag. Given the quite erratic price action over the weeks of this potential flag, it has never been obvious that it was a flag. It is still up for debate, but on the weekly time frame it could be argued that the price action does possibly fit this description. If true, either this week or next, there may well be a breakout. The pole of the flag would be taken from the bottom of the previous smaller bull flag, and this would provide a measured move of around $130,000. At the bottom of the chart is the Stochastic RSI, which is posturing a cross-up of its indicators. If the indicators confirm as crossing up above the 20.00 level at the end of this week, this would likely signal the big upside price momentum needed to push the $BTC price up and past the $124,000 all-time high, and potentially on to that $130,000 target.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) are the best bets as top choices. With its decentralized lending revolution and risk-optimized DeFi investment products, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the go-to options for investors seeking scalable growth prospects in 2025. Coupled with experienced rivals such as Cardano (ADA), this expertly vetted list of altcoins provides an insider look at projects creating waves in the market today. Cardano (ADA) Remains Below Resistance Amid Building Momentum Cardano (ADA) is around $0.887 with strong intraday action since prices are ranging within a relatively tight range. The token has been exhibiting technical consolidation against significant levels of resistance at around $0.90 on the strength of favorable technicals such as a breakout of a falling wedge and strengthening derivatives data. With more general investor interest still waiting in the wings for the new high-potential platforms, focus is gradually extending to include new protocols like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance is currently on its sixth presale stage and on this stage, the tokens have raised to $0.035 thus showing a growth of 16.17 percent from the previous stage. The interest in the market is tremendous since the project has already accumulated over 16,200 investors and has almost reached $15.6 million. In addition to CertiK, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also established a Bug Bounty Program that provides rewards up to 50,000 USDT to make the platform secure. The bugs are classified under four levels by name critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance has collateralization limits on a per-asset basis that are representative of the type of risk an asset would incur. These include supply caps, borrowing caps and collateral caps. The protocol mitigates the market risk by overcollateralizing the positions. It also motivates the liquidators to wind up the trades, which are undercollateralized and hence risky positions are settled in real-time. The caps imposed on lending and depositing are also used in the risk reduction process of volatile or illiquid assets. The collateral use is restricted in case of riskier tokens but the more correlated assets are better utilized so that they can take leverage of their collateral. These mechanisms are used in risk reduction of insolvency without initiating any kind of imbalance among lending and borrowing in the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is promoting the development of an engaged user base through a $100,000 giveaway program. Under the program, ten individuals will be awarded $10,000 MUTM tokens each depending on referrals of new members and investment in the venture. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a Loan-to-Value (LTV) model with subjective collateral, lending and transfer liquidation but risk-of-assets adjusted. It has a reserve factor utilized as a buffer against defaults and severely negative market conditions. Riskier assets are put under a higher reserve to offer more safety to the protocol and users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shining as a top altcoin with high growth potential alongside Cardano (ADA). Tokens from Stage 6 are at $0.035, which represents a nearly 17% rise from the last phase. The project has raised nearly $15.6M and has 16,200+ investors, demonstrating robust market traction. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, $100K community giveaway, and robust risk controls like LTV-based collateral limits and overcollateralization, MUTM offers growth and security. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens before the next price boom.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, understanding these macro shifts is crucial. Right now, all eyes are on the Taiwan dollar , a currency poised for what many analysts predict will be an astonishing second rally. This surge isn’t just a market blip; it’s a powerful testament to Taiwan’s pivotal role in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with its robust AI exports Taiwan driving significant economic momentum. As the world clamors for advanced chips and AI hardware, Taiwan stands at the epicenter, setting the stage for a compelling currency story. The Taiwan Dollar ‘s Ascent: How AI Exports Are Reshaping Its Trajectory Taiwan, a global manufacturing powerhouse, has long been a critical player in the technology supply chain. However, the current surge in demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is creating an unprecedented tailwind for the island’s economy and, consequently, its national currency. The Taiwan dollar (TWD) is experiencing renewed strength, reflecting the robust health of Taiwan’s export-oriented economy. At the core of this economic resurgence are Taiwan’s semiconductor giants and electronics manufacturers, which are indispensable to the global AI ecosystem. Companies like TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, are seeing their order books swell as demand for high-performance AI chips intensifies. This translates directly into increased export revenues, a trade surplus, and a stronger current account, all of which provide fundamental support for the Taiwan dollar . The currency’s trajectory is becoming increasingly intertwined with the global AI adoption curve, positioning it as a key barometer of the tech sector’s health. Unpacking the Power of AI Exports Taiwan : A Deep Dive into Economic Drivers The narrative of Taiwan’s economic success is currently dominated by its prowess in AI-related manufacturing. AI exports Taiwan encompass a broad spectrum of products, from cutting-edge AI processors and graphics processing units (GPUs) to servers, memory components, and advanced packaging solutions. These aren’t just commodity goods; they are highly specialized, high-value components essential for training large language models, powering data centers, and enabling AI applications across various industries. What makes AI exports Taiwan particularly impactful is the inelastic demand for these products. As companies globally race to integrate AI into their operations, the need for Taiwan’s advanced hardware remains consistently high, even amidst broader economic uncertainties. This sustained demand provides a stable and growing source of foreign exchange for Taiwan, bolstering its reserves and strengthening its currency. The sheer volume and value of these exports create a powerful economic multiplier effect, stimulating domestic investment and job creation, further reinforcing the TWD’s upward momentum. What Factors Are Propelling the TWD Currency Towards a Second Rally? While AI exports are undoubtedly the primary catalyst, several other factors contribute to the bullish outlook for the TWD currency : Robust Trade Surplus: Taiwan consistently maintains a healthy trade surplus, meaning it exports significantly more than it imports. This inflow of foreign currency creates demand for the TWD. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Global tech giants and investment funds are increasingly pouring capital into Taiwan’s semiconductor and AI sectors, attracted by its technological leadership and stable business environment. This FDI further strengthens the TWD currency . Central Bank Policy: The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) generally maintains a cautious and stable monetary policy. While it intervenes to prevent excessive volatility, its overall stance supports a stable to appreciating currency in times of strong economic fundamentals. Resilient Domestic Economy: Beyond exports, Taiwan’s domestic economy shows resilience, supported by consumer spending and government infrastructure projects, providing an additional layer of stability for the currency. These combined forces create a compelling case for the TWD currency to continue its upward trajectory, potentially entering a second significant rally phase. Navigating the USD TWD Forecast : Key Insights for Investors and Businesses For international investors, businesses engaged in trade with Taiwan, and currency traders, understanding the USD TWD forecast is crucial. The expected rally in the Taiwan dollar suggests a potential weakening of the USD against the TWD, meaning it would take fewer TWD to buy one USD. Analysts are closely watching key technical levels for the USD/TWD pair. A breach of certain support levels for the USD could signal a stronger and more sustained TWD appreciation. Factors influencing this forecast include: Global Demand for AI: Continued robust demand for Taiwan’s AI components will be a primary driver. US Federal Reserve Policy: The pace of interest rate changes by the US Federal Reserve will influence the relative attractiveness of the US dollar. If the Fed begins to cut rates while Taiwan’s economy remains strong, it could further pressure the USD/TWD lower. Geopolitical Stability: While Taiwan faces geopolitical risks, any period of perceived stability can enhance investor confidence and support the TWD. Businesses involved in importing from Taiwan might face higher costs in their local currency, while Taiwanese exporters would find their products relatively more expensive in international markets. However, the strong demand for their specialized goods often mitigates this effect. Keeping a close eye on the USD TWD forecast allows for proactive hedging strategies and informed financial planning. The Taiwan Dollar ‘s Influence on the Broader Asia Forex Market Taiwan’s economic performance and the strength of the Taiwan dollar do not exist in isolation. They have significant implications for the broader Asia forex market. As a major trading partner and technological hub, Taiwan’s currency movements can create ripple effects across the region. A strong TWD can, for instance, put competitive pressure on other Asian economies that produce similar tech components, potentially leading to adjustments in their own currency policies. Conversely, it can also signal robust regional economic activity and global tech demand, benefiting other export-oriented nations in Asia. Capital flows into Taiwan’s booming tech sector can also spill over into neighboring markets, influencing other Asian currencies. Investors looking at the Asia forex landscape often consider the TWD’s performance as an indicator of the overall health and direction of the region’s technology-driven economies. Opportunities and Challenges in Asia Forex: Opportunities: A strong TWD can indicate a bullish sentiment for tech-heavy Asian economies, potentially leading to opportunities in related currencies or equity markets. Challenges: Geopolitical tensions, shifts in global trade policies, or a slowdown in the global tech cycle could introduce volatility and risks for the entire Asia forex market, including the TWD. TWD Currency in the Global Spotlight: A New Era? The current environment positions the TWD currency not just as a reflection of Taiwan’s economic strength, but as a significant player in the global narrative of technological advancement and economic resilience. This isn’t merely a cyclical upturn; it might represent a fundamental shift in how the world views Taiwan’s economic contribution and the importance of its currency. Taiwan’s strategic importance in the AI supply chain means that global investors and policymakers are paying closer attention to its economic indicators and currency movements. This elevated status brings both opportunities and responsibilities. The sustained strength of the TWD currency could lead to increased international use, greater liquidity, and a more prominent role in global trade and finance, marking the beginning of a new era for Taiwan’s economic influence. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses: For Businesses: If you import from Taiwan, consider hedging strategies to mitigate potential increased costs due to a stronger TWD. If you export AI-related products to Taiwan, you might see improved purchasing power. For Investors: Monitor Taiwan’s economic data, particularly export figures and central bank statements. The TWD’s strength could present opportunities for currency appreciation or provide insights into the broader health of the global tech sector. Diversify your portfolio with an understanding of these macro trends. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global AI demand trends, as these directly impact Taiwan’s export performance and, consequently, the Taiwan dollar . Concluding Thoughts on Taiwan’s Economic Momentum The Taiwan dollar is undeniably experiencing a period of significant strength, primarily fueled by the insatiable global demand for AI-related exports. This robust economic momentum, supported by a healthy trade surplus and strategic central bank policies, positions the TWD for a compelling second rally. While the USD TWD forecast suggests potential appreciation for the Taiwan dollar, market participants must remain vigilant of global economic shifts and geopolitical developments. Taiwan’s pivotal role in the AI supply chain means its economic health and the trajectory of its TWD currency will continue to be a key indicator for both the tech industry and the broader Asia forex market. This is more than just a currency movement; it’s a testament to Taiwan’s enduring innovation and its critical role in shaping our technological future.

51542046,579176,1757583033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51542046.jpeg,"Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $15M, Tipped as One of 2025’s Best Altcoins",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-hits-15m-tipped-as-one-of-2025s-best-altcoins/,"Bitcoin has never been stronger in reputation, but its cracks are showing. It remains the biggest crypto by far, with unmatched security and trust, yet using it day to day feels outdated. Sending Bitcoin can take minutes, sometimes hours, and the fees can sting. For a network meant to change the world, it’s still struggling with basics like speed, cost, and usability. That’s why a new crypto project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is causing such a stir. Its presale has just smashed through $15M raised, with tokens priced at $0.012895. Investors are piling in because Bitcoin Hyper promises to make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and programmable – in other words, finally usable as real money. See what Bitcoin Hyper is all about in our guide. The Problem: Bitcoin’s Growing Pains Bitcoin has always been celebrated as digital gold, but as digital cash, it comes up short. A simple payment can turn into a waiting game. Transactions confirm slowly, and fees can climb so high that sending $20 in Bitcoin may cost you nearly as much just in charges. That’s like paying a luxury cab fare for a short bike ride. The numbers tell the story. Bitcoin can process around seven transactions per second. Compare that to Visa, which averages around 65K TPS and can scale even higher during peak loads. That gap makes Bitcoin impractical for global payments or large-scale consumer use. Another sticking point is programmability. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, Bitcoin doesn’t support smart contracts natively. Developers can’t easily build DeFi apps, NFTs, or meme coins on Bitcoin. That leaves it locked into its role as a store of value. While other blockchains expand into Web3, gaming, and finance, Bitcoin has been left on the sidelines. The Solution: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) was built to fix these limits and give Bitcoin a much-needed upgrade. It’s a high-speed, low-cost Layer 2 network that sits on top of Bitcoin, designed to make transactions instant, scalable, and programmable. At the center is the Canonical Bridge, which allows users to lock their $BTC on Bitcoin’s L1 chain and mint wrapped Bitcoin ($wBTC) on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2. That $wBTC can be used for everything from instant payments to DeFi trades, gaming, or launching new crypto projects . When users want their original $BTC back, they simply burn their WBTC and unlock the coins. The real magic is in its integration with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This lets Bitcoin Hyper run Solana programs natively, bringing Solana-level speed into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Developers can port their apps directly, while users enjoy low fees and near-instant execution. Think of Bitcoin Hyper as a turbo engine attached to Bitcoin’s reliable but sluggish core. The result is a network that keeps Bitcoin’s legendary security but finally delivers modern performance. If successful, this could be transformative. Bitcoin would no longer just be digital gold; it could also become the backbone of payments, DeFi, and Web3. That’s a leap few imagined possible, yet Bitcoin Hyper is already showing it might be within reach. Why Investors Are Buying $HYPER The hype around Bitcoin Hyper isn’t only about technology. The presale has become one of the year’s biggest viral events, raising over $15M so far and you can buy $HYPER for $0.012895. The buzz is clear: investors see $HYPER as one of this year’s best crypto presales . The token has real utility. $HYPER powers the entire ecosystem. It’s used for transaction fees, staking rewards, premium dApp access, developer incentives, and will eventually enable governance once the DAO is live. Early buyers can already stake their tokens and earn yields that most new crypto projects can’t match. All that combined with viral exposure – $HYPER is already featured in Best Wallet ’s ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section – it’s no surprise people are calling it one of the best altcoins to watch right now. For those who feel burned chasing short-term hype around meme coins, Bitcoin Hyper offers something different: a project aiming to solve real problems while still being early enough to deliver big upside potential. And our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction looks at a potential growth of 2,388% by the end of 2025, reaching a price of $0.32, from the current $0.012895. Bitcoin Hyper’s Moment Bitcoin Hyper is a bold attempt to make Bitcoin as usable as it is valuable. By fixing its biggest flaws – slow speeds, high fees, and lack of programmability – Bitcoin Hyper could redefine what Bitcoin means in the modern crypto economy.

Analyst Crypto Patel projects a long-term BNB cycle, with multi-year targets ranging from $1,217 to $5,455. CoinGlass data shows $152M shorts vulnerable if BNB breaks $1,000, raising short squeeze potential. Breakout to New Highs Binance Coin (BNB) has set a new all-time high at $907, moving past its earlier peak near $900. The rise followed the announcement that Binance and Franklin Templeton will collaborate on digital asset products for global markets. At press time, BNB traded at $896, with daily trading volume above $1.8 billion. The token has gained 1% in the past 24 hours and is up 6% over the past week. Crypto analyst Cipher X commented , “$BNB Breaks New ATH … The target remains the same → $1000 and higher.” They added that BNB has advanced 29% in 2025 and is up 191% since 2024, underscoring its strong performance this year. Source: Cipher X/X Interestingly, the move above $880 confirms BNB’s breakout and clears a key resistance level. Cipher X’s chart shows a target near $1,050, based on the measured move from its last consolidation range. The $880 area now acts as support if tested. Earlier trading also absorbed liquidity near $400, which had been a heavy sell zone. After months of sideways action, the asset broke higher, mirroring past cycles where extended consolidations preceded strong rallies . According to Cipher X, maintaining a price tag above $880 keeps the path toward $1,000–$1,050 intact, while stronger rallies could carry BNB to new ranges beyond. Multi-Year Targets Analyst Crypto Patel outlined a longer-term view, suggesting that the breakout could be the start of a broader cycle. Their chart marks a breakout from a descending resistance trendline that formed after the 2021 peak. That structure held for three years before breaking in 2024. Patel mapped out several long-term targets: $1,217, $2,058, $3,015, $4,280, and $5,455, remarking, $BNB just hit a new all-time high at $907 But guess what… it’s still 500% away from my Target The big move is only just beginning. @cz_binance @binance pic.twitter.com/aq1ZynZYWT — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) September 10, 2025 He noted that BNB’s long-term channel, which dates back to 2018, continues to support the price action, provided the token holds above $600–$700. Short Liquidation Risk Near $1,000 Data from Coinglass shows a large short exposure building between $900 and $1,000. Analyst Nehal warned, LIQUIDATION ALERT: $152 MILLION IN SHORTS WILL BE DESTROYED IF $BNB HITS $1,000. pic.twitter.com/hubxRKQRYk — Nehal (@nehalzzzz1) September 11, 2025 Meanwhile, the liquidation map reveals that if BNB pushes past $1,000, more than $152 million in short positions could be forced to close. This setup raises the potential for a short squeeze, where liquidations add buying pressure and accelerate price gains. Long liquidations are also visible, though far smaller compared to short exposure. With most risk stacked against shorts, the $1,000 level has become a key focus for traders monitoring BNB’s next move.

A truly pivotal competition is unfolding for the future of Hyperliquid’s native USDH stablecoin . This isn’t merely about launching a new digital asset; it represents a strategic battle for influence, innovation, and stability within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Industry giants are stepping up, each presenting compelling visions for how they can best empower Hyperliquid’s ecosystem. Who’s Vying for the USDH Stablecoin Issuance? Two major players, blockchain-based real-world asset tokenization platform OpenEden and global digital asset custodian BitGo, have officially entered the high-stakes race to issue Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin . Cointelegraph recently reported on their significant bids, highlighting the intense interest in this promising digital asset. This development signifies a crucial moment for Hyperliquid, as the choice of issuer will profoundly impact the stablecoin’s adoption, underlying stability, and overall growth within its ecosystem. The competition isn’t just between these two; the ongoing vote sees other strong contenders like Native Market and Paxos Labs currently leading the pack. OpenEden’s Bold Proposal: Fueling Hyperliquid with EDEN Tokens OpenEden, known for its expertise in tokenizing real-world assets, has put forward a truly compelling incentive. They propose allocating 3% of their native EDEN token supply directly to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. This strategic move aims to foster deep integration and provide substantial, ongoing support. This commitment means more than just a one-time boost. It creates a continuous stream of incentives designed to: Drive Ecosystem Growth: By providing EDEN tokens, OpenEden directly encourages participation and development within Hyperliquid. Align Interests: This proposal closely links OpenEden’s success with the prosperity of the Hyperliquid community. Leverage RWA Expertise: OpenEden’s background in real-world asset tokenization could bring unique perspectives to the management and backing of the USDH stablecoin . Their approach emphasizes community engagement and long-term value creation, leveraging their native token as a powerful growth engine for Hyperliquid. BitGo’s Strategic Play: Reinvesting for Hyperliquid’s Growth and USDH Stablecoin Stability On the other side of the arena, BitGo, a highly respected global digital asset custodian, offers a distinct yet equally robust strategy. Their proposal focuses on a sustainable, revenue-generating model that directly benefits the Hyperliquid ecosystem. BitGo plans to reinvest all revenue generated from USDH reserves back into Hyperliquid. Furthermore, BitGo intends to use profits derived from the USDH stablecoin for HYPE token buybacks, providing direct support for Hyperliquid’s native token. Their commitment to stability and security is evident in their reserve strategy: Robust Backing: USDH issuance and redemption will rely on dollar-based liquid assets, short-term government bonds, and bank deposits. HYPE Token Support: Revenue from these underlying assets will also be utilized for purchasing and staking HYPE tokens, creating a symbiotic relationship. Custodian Strength: BitGo’s long-standing reputation for secure digital asset custody offers a strong foundation for the reliability and trustworthiness of the USDH stablecoin . This comprehensive approach highlights BitGo’s dedication to both the financial health and long-term stability of the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Crucial Vote: What Does it Mean for the USDH Stablecoin ? The decision on who will issue Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin is not just a formality; it’s a critical moment for the platform’s future. The voting period, which runs from September 11 to 15, allows the community to weigh these impressive proposals and determine the best path forward. Currently, Native Market holds the lead, with Paxos Labs closely behind, indicating a highly competitive landscape. The chosen issuer will not only manage the technical and financial aspects of USDH but also shape its reputation and integration within the broader DeFi space. This choice will influence user confidence, liquidity, and Hyperliquid’s strategic direction. It underscores the power of decentralized governance, where community participation directly impacts the evolution of digital assets. The competition to issue Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin is a fascinating development, showcasing innovation and strategic vision from industry leaders like OpenEden and BitGo. Each contender brings unique strengths, from token incentives to robust custodial solutions. The community’s pivotal decision will not only shape USDH’s stability and growth but also significantly influence the Hyperliquid ecosystem and the future of decentralized finance.

51542928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=805431,1757583974,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51542928.jpeg,Trump ordered India to stop buying Russian oil and imposed 50% tariffs when it refused,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-eu-split-on-russia-oil-hits-india-trade/,"India’s oil trade and currency markets are taking a direct hit after the policy split between Washington and Brussels on Russian oil blew wide open this week. In October, India’s imports of Russian crude are expected to fall slightly from recent levels, while the rupee just collapsed to its lowest level ever against the dollar. It’s the fallout of Donald Trump’s pressure campaign at Russia that is landing squarely on India’s economy. The U.S., EU, and G7 allies had all agreed after the Ukraine invasion to limit Russian energy profits without halting oil flows entirely. Their workaround was a price cap system: third countries like India could still import Russian oil, but only below a set price. The goal was to keep barrels moving but cut off Kremlin cash. Then Trump stepped in. Trump, now back in the White House, abandoned the original cap approach and told India to stop importing Russian oil completely. When New Delhi said no, Trump slapped India with 50% tariffs on its exports to the U.S. and tied the sanctions to a broader push to force Moscow into a Ukraine ceasefire. Those tariffs kicked in last month and are already cutting deep. Trump demands total halt, EU pushes for tighter caps The EU isn’t on the same page. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday that the bloc is looking to speed up its phase-out of Russian fossil fuels. Brussels just lowered the Russian oil price cap from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, but the U.S. didn’t support the move. EU officials are now in Washington, trying to salvage coordination with the G7. Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, said , “Sanctions coordination between the U.S. and the other G7 nations does seem to have largely broken down under the Trump administration.” That breakdown has India stuck between two approaches; one encouraging discounted trade, the other demanding a full shutdown. Meanwhile, Indian oil buyers are trying to protect themselves. Four traders involved in the sales said Indian importers are now demanding $10 per barrel discounts from Russian sellers to keep within the cap. In September, discounts hovered around $2-3, but now banks are watching every deal closely due to the growing U.S.-EU divide. Not everyone is playing ball. Some Russian sellers told buyers the discounts were too steep. Two traders said those cargoes are being rerouted to China instead. That’s why October shipments to India will likely drop to 1.4 million barrels per day, down from 1.6 million in September and 1.5 million in August. The EU still allows Western shipping and insurance, but only if oil stays below the cap. With Brent crude now at $67, most Russian barrels sold to India are way above that. Western shippers may be forced out, and Russia is leaning more on its shadow fleet, with tankers covered by Russian insurance and operating outside Western control. Tariffs fuel investor exit as rupee hits all-time low While the oil standoff plays out, the economic impact is already here. On Thursday, the Indian rupee dropped to 88.44 against the U.S. dollar, breaking its previous record low of 88.36. The Reserve Bank of India has been selling dollars to control the speed of the fall, but not to protect any specific level, bankers say. Foreign investors have pulled $11.7 billion out of India’s debt and equity markets this year. The high U.S. tariffs are shaking confidence in India’s financial stability. Most other Asian currencies are holding up better, helped by bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next week. But India isn’t getting that same breathing room. Final October oil volumes will be confirmed after trade talks wrap in two weeks. But every sign points to India importing less Russian crude, paying more for the barrels it does get, and absorbing the pressure alone while Western allies drift apart on sanctions strategy.

Recently, a significant development in the crypto custody space caught the attention of industry observers: the joint venture between Zodia Custody and SBI Holdings is reportedly winding down after two years. This news marks a pivotal moment for both firms, signaling a strategic refocus within their respective operations. What Led to the End of This Crypto Custody Partnership? According to a Bloomberg report, the collaboration between Zodia Custody, a prominent crypto custody firm backed by Standard Chartered, and Japan’s financial giant SBI Holdings, is concluding. This decision follows a comprehensive business review conducted by both entities. Such reviews are common in dynamic markets, allowing companies to adapt to changing landscapes and internal priorities. Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, clarified that the decision was a mutual agreement. This mutual understanding enables both companies to dedicate their resources and efforts to their core strengths and emerging opportunities. In the fast-paced digital asset sector, agility is often key to sustained growth. The Journey of the Zodia Crypto Custody and SBI Holdings Venture The joint venture was established with the ambition of providing robust crypto custody solutions, particularly in the Japanese market. Japan, known for its stringent regulatory environment, presents both significant opportunities and challenges for digital asset firms. Navigating these complexities requires considerable investment and strategic alignment. However, the venture reportedly faced hurdles in its path towards full operational status. Discussions for registration with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) had been ongoing, but progress remained elusive. Regulatory approval is a critical gateway for any financial service provider, especially in the sensitive realm of digital asset management. Why Are Strategic Shifts Important in Crypto Custody? The decision to dissolve the joint venture underscores a broader trend in the digital asset industry: the importance of strategic focus. Companies often enter partnerships to expand their reach or leverage complementary expertise. However, as markets mature and priorities evolve, a re-evaluation becomes essential. For Zodia Custody, this move allows them to concentrate on their global strategy and existing operational hubs. Similarly, SBI Holdings can channel its extensive resources into its diverse portfolio of financial services and digital asset initiatives, including its own established crypto custody offerings. This strategic pivot aims to optimize resource allocation and enhance overall business efficiency. Key considerations for such strategic decisions often include: Market Dynamics: Rapid changes in regulation, technology, and investor demand. Resource Optimization: Ensuring capital and talent are deployed where they yield the highest returns. Core Competencies: Focusing on areas where the company has a distinct competitive advantage. Regulatory Clarity: Adapting to evolving legal frameworks for digital assets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Custody? While the dissolution of a joint venture might seem like a setback, it often represents a strategic recalibration for growth. For the broader crypto custody landscape, this event highlights the ongoing challenges and adaptations required for institutional-grade digital asset services. The demand for secure and compliant crypto custody solutions continues to grow as institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies expands. Firms like Zodia Custody and SBI Holdings remain key players, continuously innovating to meet these evolving needs. Their individual pursuits will likely contribute to the maturation of the digital asset infrastructure. This development also serves as a reminder that even established financial players face unique challenges in the nascent crypto market. Learning from such experiences helps refine business models and regulatory approaches, ultimately strengthening the ecosystem. The mutual decision by Zodia Custody and SBI Holdings to conclude their joint venture after two years is a clear example of strategic adaptation in the dynamic digital asset world. While the partnership aimed to strengthen crypto custody services in Japan, both companies are now poised to pursue their individual priorities with renewed focus. This move, driven by a business review and regulatory considerations, underscores the continuous evolution required for success in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a testament to the industry’s commitment to finding the most effective paths forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was the joint venture between Zodia Custody and SBI Holdings? It was a partnership aimed at providing institutional-grade crypto custody services, primarily targeting the Japanese market, backed by Standard Chartered and SBI Holdings. Why did the joint venture shut down? The decision was mutual, following a business review. Both companies decided to concentrate on their respective priorities, and the venture had reportedly made no progress in securing registration with Japan’s Financial Services Agency. What is Zodia Custody? Zodia Custody is a crypto custody firm backed by Standard Chartered, providing secure digital asset custody solutions for institutional investors. What are the implications of this shutdown for the crypto custody market? It highlights the ongoing challenges and strategic adaptations required in the evolving digital asset sector, particularly concerning regulatory navigation and market focus for institutional crypto custody services. Will Zodia Custody or SBI Holdings continue to offer crypto custody services? Yes, both companies are expected to continue their individual pursuits in the digital asset space. Zodia Custody will focus on its global strategy, and SBI Holdings has its own established crypto custody offerings.

According to the Ministry of SMEs and Startups (MSS) , the measure comes in response to the growing global trust in the crypto sphere, combined with advancements in the user protection department. The decision comes seven years after the country restricted crypto in October 2018, amidst concerns about speculation influencing the market and the lack of proper investor security. The shift marks a long-awaited move that could bring South Korea at the forefront of crypto adoption, which could rally projects like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) . South Korea Is With Both Feet Into the Crypto Ecosystem South Korea is making swift progress in the crypto industry, with the Korean crypto market expected to reach $1.1B in 2025 and $1.3B in 2026, according to Statista . The only thing holding the country back was the strict regulatory space, which decreased investor participation and hindered progress. With that out of the way, South Korea will likely experience rapid progress in the crypto sphere. The signs are already there. Despite the strong regulatory embargo, over 16M people, or almost 32% of the country’s population, had accounts at the most popular domestic exchanges : Gopax, Korbit, Coinone, Bithumb, and Upbit. The biggest push happened in November of last year, shortly after Trump’s election win, when the number of crypto users jumped by 600,000 to 15.6M . Collectively, they hold over 102.6T Won or $70.3B in crypto. The experts project the number to get to 20M, especially now, with the South Korean regulatory entity loosening the grip on the market. The influx of new investors will likely impact global markets as well. Bitcoin is already above $114K , while investors like Strategy and BitMine ramp up their crypto hoarding, slowly becoming the most influential names in the crypto space. Strategy is the leader in the Bitcoinsphere, owning 638,460 $BTC , while BitMine is the primary Ethereum hoarder with over 2.069M $ETH . The increase in institutional crypto adoption, combined with large players like South Korea joining the market, creates a strong foundation for a global crypto economy. In this new ecosystem, projects like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) will thrive. How Pepenode’s $1M Presale Turns Crypto Mining Interactive and Engaging Pepenode’s ($PEPENODE) presale is nearing $1M in less than a month after its start, benefitting from growing investor support. But why? The reason is Pepenode’s approach to coin mining and how it turns the activity interactive and engaging during the presale itself. Pepenode lets you buy and upgrade nodes to create your own virtual mining facility. Through this, you can mine meme coins without having to worry about high electricity costs or having to upgrade your rig. To clarify, you’re not actually earning coins from the mining process; this is just an interactive activity that keeps investors busy and engaged. That being said, becoming a Pepenode miner does come with benefits like staking rewards and bonuses, especially post-TGE. The mining gameplay also encourages early participation, since early nodes earn you the highest rewards. The presale is closing in on its first milestone of $1M thanks to the raw investor hype and support and is likely to push way higher in the coming months. If you’re considering joining the project, do it now while $PEPENODE is still at $0.0010533, because the more the presale grows, the more expensive the token gets. Plus, you have a staking APY of 1,400%, which rewards early investments the most. You can buy your $PEPENODE tokens on the official presale page right now. Will South Korea Trigger the New Alt Season? It’s very likely that South Korea’s regulatory shift will mark the beginning of the alt season. All pieces are in place for that. Bitcoin is pushing to its psychological threshold of $115K, Strategy stays true to its Bitcoin accumulation tactic, and investor confidence is sky-high. South Korea’s move could be just what the market needed to start pumping. So, keep Pepenode ($PEPENODE) on your radar, have a solid investment strategy in place, and watch Bitcoin. Breaking the $115K ceiling could trigger a sustained rally to $128K and beyond. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research and invest wisely.

We’re seeing an unprecedented surge in Bitcoin accumulation , particularly from a powerful cohort of investors. Recent data highlights a compelling trend that could signal strong confidence in the future of the leading digital asset. Who are the Key Players Driving This Bitcoin Accumulation? According to Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC are rapidly increasing their holdings. This group, often referred to as “sharks” or mid-tier whales, has shown remarkable activity recently. In just the past seven days, these addresses have collectively added an impressive 65,000 BTC to their wallets. Over the last 30 days, their net purchases have soared to 93,000 BTC. Their total holdings now stand at an all-time high of 3.65 million BTC, showcasing a consistent and strong pattern of Bitcoin accumulation . This steady influx of Bitcoin into these addresses suggests a strategic long-term outlook from experienced investors. They are not merely trading; they are building substantial positions, indicating a strong belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. What Does This Intense Bitcoin Accumulation Mean for the Market? The actions of these significant holders often serve as a bellwether for broader market sentiment. When such a substantial cohort engages in aggressive Bitcoin accumulation , it typically reflects underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Historically, periods of strong accumulation by mid-tier whales have often preceded significant price movements. This is because these entities control enough supply to influence market dynamics, especially when their collective actions point in one direction. Reduced Sell-Side Pressure: As more Bitcoin moves into these accumulation wallets, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, which can lead to decreased sell-side pressure. Potential for Price Support: A strong base of long-term holders can provide robust price support during market downturns, absorbing sell orders and preventing sharp declines. Bullish Sentiment Indicator: This consistent buying activity often fuels positive sentiment across the wider crypto community, potentially attracting more retail and institutional interest. This trend suggests a market preparing for potential upward movement, backed by solid investor conviction. Are There Any Risks Associated with This Bitcoin Accumulation Trend? While increased Bitcoin accumulation by large holders is generally seen as a bullish sign, it’s crucial to consider potential risks and market dynamics. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and even strong accumulation phases can be influenced by external factors. Market Volatility: Sudden macroeconomic shifts, unexpected regulatory news, or significant global events could still trigger price fluctuations, regardless of accumulation trends. Concentration Risk: While distributed among many addresses, a significant portion of Bitcoin supply is held by a relatively small number of entities. Their collective decisions can have a profound impact on the market. Short-Term vs. Long-Term: While the current trend points to long-term holding, it’s essential to monitor if these accumulated coins eventually move back to exchanges, which could signal a change in strategy. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider a diversified portfolio. Understanding the nuances of on-chain data, like this Bitcoin accumulation , provides valuable insights but should be part of a broader analytical framework. The Power of Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation The ongoing surge in Bitcoin accumulation by addresses holding 100-1,000 BTC is a powerful indicator of evolving market dynamics. It underscores a growing conviction among experienced investors regarding Bitcoin’s long-term potential. This cohort’s sustained buying pressure, reaching an all-time high in holdings, paints a picture of resilience and strategic positioning in the face of market uncertainties. For anyone observing the crypto space, this trend offers a compelling glimpse into the actions of those who believe deeply in Bitcoin’s future. It’s a testament to the digital asset’s enduring appeal as a store of value and a crucial component of a diversified investment strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is “Bitcoin accumulation”? A1: Bitcoin accumulation refers to the process where investors, particularly large holders, continuously buy and hold Bitcoin, increasing their total supply over time rather than selling it. This indicates a long-term bullish outlook. Q2: Who are the “addresses holding 100-1,000 BTC”? A2: These are often referred to as mid-tier whales or “sharks” in the crypto community. They represent significant individual or institutional investors who hold a substantial amount of Bitcoin but are not the absolute largest holders (like exchanges or early founders). Q3: Why is this specific cohort’s accumulation significant? A3: This cohort’s actions are significant because they collectively hold a large portion of Bitcoin’s supply. Their consistent accumulation often signals strong conviction and can act as a leading indicator for broader market sentiment and potential price movements. Q4: How does Bitcoin accumulation impact Bitcoin’s price? A4: Increased Bitcoin accumulation by large holders typically reduces the available supply on exchanges, which can lead to decreased selling pressure and potentially drive prices higher due to scarcity. It also fosters positive market sentiment. Q5: Where can I track Bitcoin accumulation data? A5: On-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide detailed data on Bitcoin accumulation trends, including various holder cohorts and supply distribution.

Remittix (RTX) has gone viral after launching a 15% USDT referral program, which boosted visibility in a market already searching for the best crypto presale of 2025. While Ethereum remains steady, Remittix’s rapid growth highlights the hunger for crypto with real utility and strong incentives. Ethereum Price Snapshot The Ethereum Price is around $4,345. Ethereum remains the backbone of the broader DeFi project space, powering thousands of smart contracts, crypto staking protocols, and Layer 2 Ethereum alternative solutions. Analysts suggest ETH could target $5,000 if institutional inflows strengthen, with upside scenarios projecting as high as $6,000 in the next cycle. Yet traders also note weakness in spot demand. Until larger volumes return, ETH may stay range-bound. The Ethereum Price is still seen as a long-term bet. Still, short-term momentum looks weaker than tokens tied to upcoming crypto projects and early-stage crypto investment opportunities. Market Buzz: Where Capital Is Flowing Across the industry, there’s a clear shift in focus. Investors are exploring low-cap crypto gems, top crypto under $1, and new altcoins to watch lists in search of sharper upside. Many are weighing the next 100x crypto or next big altcoin for 2025 while browsing guides on which crypto to buy early. The demand is moving toward tokens with strong narratives, whether a crypto solves real-world problems, offers low gas fees, or acts as a cross-chain DeFi project. This backdrop is why Remittix (RTX) is gaining attention alongside bigger names like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Remittix: A Payments-First DeFi Project Remittix (RTX) is positioning itself as more than hype. Built for borderless payments, users can send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. With its wallet beta set for September 15, 2025, RTX promises real-time FX conversion, support for 40+ cryptocurrencies, and 30+ fiat currencies. The project is audited by CertiK, adding security to its design. Here’s what’s driving momentum in the Remittix DeFi project: Over $24.9 million raised in presale with more than 655M RTX tokens sold at ~$0.105 each Confirmed exchange listings on BitMart and LBank, boosting liquidity for launch Wallet beta launching soon, offering low gas fee crypto transfers and instant payouts Security validated by a CertiK audit, giving investors added confidence Viral 15% USDT referral program alongside a $250,000 community giveaway Unlike speculative meme tokens, Remittix targets the $19 trillion remittance market. Analysts note it could deliver 20× or even 30× returns, in line with the fastest-growing crypto of 2025 and best long-term crypto investment narratives. Some even rank it among the best DeFi altcoin launches of the year. Ethereum Price vs. Remittix: Two Different Growth Stories in 2025 The Ethereum Price reflects stability and institutional trust, making ETH a safer long-term hold. But Remittix is where excitement is building, with real-world payments utility, viral marketing, and rapid presale traction. Together, they represent two sides of today’s crypto market: Ethereum as the established player, and Remittix as the next big crypto launch investors don’t want to miss.

Analysts are highlighting its trajectory toward the $2 mark as one of the strongest short-term plays in the market. In a climate where crypto predictions dominate headlines, MUTM is standing out with a mix of audited infrastructure, innovative mechanics, and presale momentum that is already breaking records. Presale Demand Creates Immediate Urgency The current presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating significant urgency for investors focused on short-term gains. Phase 6 is live with more than $15.6 million already raised and 36% of the allocation sold. The entry price sits at $0.035, and over 16,200 holders have already taken positions. Once this phase concludes, the cost of entry will rise by 15%, reducing the discounted opportunity window. Investor confidence is strengthened by a successful CertiK audit, which rated the project at 95 with Skynet transparency at 78. Security layers are further reinforced by a bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway that has amplified community engagement. These features not only underline the project’s credibility but also create the sense of momentum that is key for short-term movers. As the crypto fear and greed index reflects growing optimism in the broader market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning with that sentiment by showing investors a structured presale path with clear mechanics for value creation. With strong demand already visible, this phase of crypto investing is shaping into a limited-time chance to capture exposure before the valuation accelerates further. Roadmap and Mechanics Fuel Momentum Toward $2 Momentum is only valuable when it is backed by tangible catalysts, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has designed its roadmap to deliver just that. The platform’s beta launch will go live at the time of token listing, allowing users to begin borrowing and lending immediately. Unlike many projects that rely on speculation after launch, this approach will ensure utility from day one. Layer-2 integration will play a pivotal role in creating cost efficiency and speed, two qualities that are essential for attracting users at scale. Lower fees and faster transaction throughput will expand adoption across both retail investors and institutions. This gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a clear edge in competing with older DeFi platforms that still operate with higher overhead costs. $1 Peg stablecoin adoption is also on the roadmap, adding another layer of reliability for investors. By enabling borrowing and lending through stable assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will appeal to users seeking predictability and safety in volatile market conditions. This functionality will make it easier for mainstream participants to engage with the platform, fueling consistent demand. Another defining factor in its tokenomics is the buy-and-distribute model. Protocol revenue generated from lending fees and liquidation penalties will be used to repurchase MUTM on the open market, with purchased tokens distributed to mtToken stakers. This creates continuous buy pressure that supports higher valuations while rewarding long-term participants. Investor confidence is reinforced by the project’s upcoming exchange listings, with major platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken expected to onboard MUTM. These listings will introduce significant liquidity and visibility, accelerating adoption while helping traders access the token globally. For momentum investors, this visibility will translate into a direct demand driver, pushing the token closer to its $2 target. Final Words Crypto prices today often shift quickly based on investor sentiment, but projects with built-in utility and strong revenue mechanics remain far more resilient. This is why momentum around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just speculative noise but rooted in a clear pathway to growth. Momentum in crypto investing rarely lingers, and the presale records being set by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) highlight just how quickly opportunities can move. With exchange listings, Layer-2 integration, stablecoin adoption, and a buy-and-distribute system on the horizon, the foundation is being laid for a run toward $2 in the near term. Traders looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now are increasingly recognizing that MUTM is one of the most urgent buys available before presale discounts vanish.

In a significant on-chain maneuver, Virtual Protocol recently swapped a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) for Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). This move highlights an active approach to treasury management within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What’s Driving Virtual Protocol’s Latest Crypto Maneuver? Just five hours ago, the Virtual Protocol team executed a noteworthy trade. They exchanged 2,880 ETH for 110.16 cbBTC. This transaction, valued at approximately $12.67 million, was brought to light by the keen observations of on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa. This kind of transparency, offered by blockchain technology, provides fascinating insights into the strategies employed by major players like Virtual Protocol . For those unfamiliar, cbBTC is a wrapped version of Bitcoin that operates on Coinbase’s Base blockchain. It allows users to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s value within the Ethereum-compatible ecosystem, making it a valuable asset for DeFi activities. Protocols often utilize wrapped assets to bridge liquidity and functionality between different blockchain networks. Decoding Virtual Protocol’s Profitable Past Transactions Interestingly, this isn’t Virtual Protocol ‘s first strategic dance with cbBTC. Prior to this recent swap, the team had previously exchanged 73.399 cbBTC for ETH on June 11. This historical context reveals a pattern of active asset management. Currently, the protocol is holding an impressive unrealized profit of $4.67 million from its previous positions. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of market timing and asset allocation. Such calculated moves by Virtual Protocol can serve as a compelling case study for other decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and crypto projects looking to optimize their treasury performance. The Strategic Appeal of cbBTC for Protocols like Virtual Protocol Why might a protocol like Virtual Protocol choose to hold cbBTC? There are several compelling reasons: Bitcoin Exposure: cbBTC offers a way to maintain exposure to Bitcoin’s robust value proposition without leaving the Ethereum or Base ecosystem. This is crucial for diversified portfolios. DeFi Integration: Wrapped tokens like cbBTC can be easily integrated into various DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity, potentially generating additional yield. Market Hedging: Swapping between ETH and cbBTC can be a strategy to hedge against volatility in either asset, aiming to preserve or grow capital based on market outlook. Liquidity Management: Such swaps can optimize the protocol’s liquidity, ensuring it has the right assets on hand for its operational needs or future development. The decision by Virtual Protocol underscores a broader trend where projects are actively managing their treasuries to maximize returns and mitigate risks in a dynamic market. What Does This Mean for Virtual Protocol and the Broader DeFi Landscape? The recent ETH to cbBTC swap by Virtual Protocol signals confidence in wrapped Bitcoin assets and potentially a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s performance relative to Ethereum in the short to medium term. For Virtual Protocol itself, this could mean enhanced capital efficiency and a stronger balance sheet, which is vital for long-term project sustainability. For the wider DeFi ecosystem, such high-value transactions by prominent protocols can influence market sentiment and potentially encourage other projects to explore similar treasury management strategies. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with any crypto asset management, including market volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities. Observing the strategic decisions of entities like Virtual Protocol offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of decentralized finance and how sophisticated players navigate its complexities. Their actions provide a real-world example of active, on-chain treasury optimization.

According to reports, the move followed a pullback in US PPI that many traders read as a sign the Federal Reserve may be able to start cutting rates. Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Rises: 21X Brings Chainlink Into Europe’s Tokenized Securities Market The jump was quick and loud on price charts. It caught the attention of both retail traders and bigger money. Cooling Inflation Spurs Rate Cut Bets According to published data, US Producer Price Index (PPI) fell to about 2.6% year-on-year, while core PPI — which strips out food and energy — came in near 2.8%. On a monthly basis, PPI showed a drop, one of the first such moves since March 2024. Based on reports, those weaker numbers fed hopes that the Fed could ease policy sooner rather than later, and markets reacted accordingly. Bitcoin’s Rally And Broader Crypto Moves Bitcoin hit roughly $113,850 on some exchanges before trading above $114,000, and Ethereum climbed past $4,400 as part of the same upswing. Reports have disclosed that institutional flows and stablecoin liquidity helped lift prices, and that investor positioning shifted toward risk assets after the data. Traders were watching support around $112,500-$113,000 and resistance near $115,000-$115,500 as the session progressed. Momentum was strong, but some caution remained. Bitcoin’s Technical Levels And Flows Market technicians pointed to clear levels. If support near $112,500 breaks, it could open the way to a short pullback. If $115,500 is cleared, buyers may push for higher ranges. At the same time, some on-chain indicators showed rising transfers into exchanges, a sign that profit taking could be ahead. Reports have disclosed that both demand and supply signals will be watched closely by desks and algorithmic funds. What Could Slow This Move While PPI cooled, other data could change the picture. Consumer inflation and jobs figures are still to be watched, and those reports can keep the Fed on guard. Rate cuts are now being priced in by some traders, perhaps as soon as September, but that outcome is not guaranteed. If consumer prices re-accelerate or job strength stays high, easing could be delayed and markets may retrace gains. Related Reading: Tighter Premiums Put Crypto Treasuries On Risky Road, According To NYDIG What Investors Should Watch Next According to market commentators, the key near-term items are the upcoming CPI release, monthly jobs data, and Fed commentary. Also important are flows into spot products and the dollar’s direction — a firmer dollar would likely pressure risky assets. Traders will also keep an eye on how quickly liquidity moves from stablecoins into BTC and ETH, and whether profit-taking appears at the big technical thresholds already mentioned.

Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions.

After $PUMP’s Rally, PepeNodes Looks Like the Next Crypto to Explode September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC PumpSwap ($PUMP) is back in the spotlight, surging 41.6% this week to a $5.8B valuation – its highest since launch. After dipping to $2.4B last month, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad has rallied 133%, powered by a bold buyback strategy: 100% of daily revenue goes toward repurchasing $PUMP, offsetting over 6% of supply to date. With PumpSwap stacking $298M in TVL and ranking 2nd in spot DEX revenue , it’s clear: the degens are back, and they’re hungry. But while $PUMP’s riding high, the real sleeper play is PepeNode ($PEPENODE) . With nearly $975K already raised in presale, it introduces a Mine-to-Earn model where users build virtual mining rigs, upgrade nodes, and earn rewards before the token even hits exchanges. It’s gamified staking meets DeFi, with 1414% APY, 70% burn mechanics, and referral bonuses that fuel viral growth. No hardware, no waiting, just strategy and community. If you missed the $PUMP rally, PepeNodes might be your chance at the next crypto to explode. Find out how to buy PepeNode from the presale for just $0.0010533 REX-Osprey ETFs Hit the Market: $WEPE Is the Next Crypto to Explode September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC New ETFs from Rex and Osprey are launching this week . They’re not your typical Bitcoin funds: they’re ETFs for popular altcoins like KRP, Dogecoin, and Bonk. It’s a big deal as the SEC has given them the green light by allowing them to pass their 75-day review window. The project’s focus on futures contracts holds them to an older law . But the SEC has kept major players like BlackRock stuck in a regulatory waiting game as they focus on the actual crypto. The move could open the floodgates for mainstream investors who want to get into crypto without buying tokens directly. And speaking of getting in on the action, the Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) project is making waves. It’s a community built to help you get an edge. They’ve created the Wepe Army, a group that shares expert insights and alpha calls, which is insider info that can give you a leg up on the market. $WEPE is even rewarding members for their social activity, creating a collective of people working to outsmart the big players.

51543159,578203,1757584851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51543159.jpeg,Don’t Expect New Shiba Inu ATHs: Machine Learning Algorithm Spits Out Max Price,https://bitcoinist.com/dont-expect-shiba-inu-aths/,"Shiba Inu is still trading well below its all-time high of $0.000088 that was recorded back in 2021, and despite the market having seen multiple rallies over the last year, the meme coin has not come close to this peak . According to CoinMarketCap data, the current SHIB price means that it’s still over 85% below its all-time high price, and will need a more than 700% increase if it is to beat it. While many in the community expect the Shiba Inu price to hit new highs soon, a prediction from a machine learning algorithm suggests this may be a pipe dream. Shiba Inu Price Won’t Reach ATH In 2025 The machine learning algorithm at the CoinCodex website has predictions ranging from the short-term to the long-term for Shiba Inu. While the outlook is bullish , the roadmap to a new all-time high remains very blurry. Unlike many other large-cap altcoins on their way to new highs, the algorithm does not see the SHIB price following this path. For the short term, the price is expected to see some increase, moving above the $0.000019 level. This one-month prediction carries into the start of the month of October, with the highest point expected to be a little over $0.000016 before retracing downward. Then, for the 3-month prediction leading into most of the last quarter of the year 2025, expectations are that the price will more than double to clear $0.000033. However, this is not expected to last as the algorithm shows a correction back down toward $0.000016 by the month of December. With the 3-month prediction spanning close to the end of the year, it suggests that there is no all-time high happening for Shiba Inu this year. Momentum also remains low as sentiment is still neutral , meaning investors remain indecisive on SHIB. So, When Can SHIB Hit A New ATH? Over the longer timeframe and spanning the next few years, the machine learning algorithm shows a bullish outlook , but there is no expectation of the Shiba Inu price hitting a new all-time high. For the year 2026, the highest peak was placed at $0.00003116, which is only a 138% increase from the current level. The same is the case for the next few years leading up to 2030, and still no all-time high prediction for the meme coin. If the algorithm is correct, then Shiba Inu investors might be waiting a decade for a new all-time high to hit, especially if the market continues in its low momentum.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu prediction|Shiba Inu price|Shiba Inu price prediction|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-11 10:00:51

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Experts believed that after a deep consolidation in August, Bitcoin would successfully turn a corner in September – and the ‘digital gold’ is doing exactly that. $BTC is up over 5.5% this month so far, including a solid 2% gain yesterday, when the token broke past the key $113K resistance level – one that had pushed the price lower on three separate occasions between August 28 and September 9. That’s now behind us. Even better, Bitcoin has reclaimed all major moving averages on the daily chart, with the price currently trading comfortably above the 100, 50, and 20 EMAs. Following this latest breakout, the next likely target is $117K – a 2.5% rise from current levels – after which Bitcoin could charge toward its all-time highs, potentially even pushing beyond thanks to the upcoming rate cut. As Africa Embraces Crypto, Bitcoin Hyper Finds Its Moment September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Sub-Saharan Africa is quietly becoming one of crypto’s biggest growth stories. It’s now the third-fastest growing region globally, with over $200B in on-chain volume in the past year. What’s driving this growth isn’t just big institutions; it’s everyday users. More than 8% of transfers were under $10K, showing how crypto is becoming a practical tool for regular people navigating tough financial conditions. This is exactly the kind of environment where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) fits in. With over $15M raised in presale, HYPER is designed to be a high-yield $BTC layer 2 that’s fast, borderless, and inflation-resistant. It’s built for people who need crypto to work, not just as an investment, but as a tool. Find out why our analysts predict $HYPER could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025 . Bitcoin Hyper Presale Breaks $15M as It Promises Faster, Smarter Bitcoin September 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin is still the heavyweight of crypto, but using it for everyday payments remains a challenge. Transactions can take minutes or even hours to confirm, and fees often spike so high that sending $20 in $BTC might cost nearly as much in charges. With throughput capped at around seven transactions per second, Bitcoin simply can’t compete with modern payment networks like Visa, which averages around 65K TPS . Add the lack of smart contract support, and it’s clear why Bitcoin has been sidelined from DeFi, gaming, and meme coins . This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in. Built as a high-speed, low-cost Layer 2 running on the Solana Virtual Machine, it promises near-instant transactions, low fees, and full programmability. Its Canonical Bridge makes $BTC usable for payments, DeFi, and Web3 apps while keeping Bitcoin’s legendary security intact. With its presale already surpassing $15M at $0.012895 per token, Bitcoin Hyper is quickly being called one of 2025’s best crypto presales . Check out our price prediction guide for $HYPER to see how high analysts think it could climb in 2025.

The U.S. Trustee Program (USTP) secured a win for investors this month after the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas denied a bankruptcy discharge for Nathan Fuller, the operator of Privvy Investments LLC. Fuller was found to have concealed assets, lied in bankruptcy filings, and operated his cryptocurrency investment company as a Ponzi scheme, diverting millions of dollars in investor funds for personal use. Texas bankruptcy court rejects bankruptcy discharge Investors who lost funds to the crypto Ponzi scheme that Nathan Fuller ran through the Privvy Investments front secured a win this month when a Texas court ruled that he should not be allowed to erase his debts through bankruptcy. On August 1, the court found Fuller guilty by default. He filed for bankruptcy in October 2024 after he was sued in a state court by the victims of his scheme. The lawsuit resulted in a receiver being appointed to seize his assets. When he filed for bankruptcy, Fuller stated that he owed over $12.5M in debts to the defrauded investors. Instead of cooperating with the bankruptcy process, Fuller reportedly interfered repeatedly with the process and was deceptive. He didn’t keep financial records, made false statements under oath, and was dishonest about his assets in both his personal case and the separate bankruptcy filing for Privvy Investments. The statement by the Justice Department’s Office of Public Affairs claimed that reviewed evidence showed that Fuller used the diverted investor funds to pay for luxury goods, gambling trips, and a nearly $1M home purchased for his ex-wife, who had been involved in the business and continued to live with him. “Fraudsters seeking to whitewash their schemes will not find sanctuary in bankruptcy,” Kevin Epstein, U.S. trustee of Region 7, which covers the Southern District of Texas, said. “The USTP remains vigilant for cases filed by dishonest debtors, who threaten the integrity of the bankruptcy system.” Fuller admitted he ran Privvy Investments as a Ponzi scheme The collapse of Fuller’s defense came after he was held in civil contempt for failing to comply with court orders. During the proceedings, Fuller admitted that Privvy Investments had operated as a Ponzi scheme and that he had fabricated documents to perpetuate it. He further confessed to giving false testimony and falsifying bankruptcy documents to obstruct the Chapter 7 trustee assigned to his case. Despite these admissions, Fuller did not respond to the complaint filed by the USTP’s Houston office, which objected to his bankruptcy discharge. His lack of response allowed the court to issue a default judgment, preventing him from evading his debts. The USTP plays an important role in safeguarding the bankruptcy system . By pursuing dishonest debtors, the agency works to ensure that bankruptcy protection is reserved for those who don’t intend to take advantage of the system. The program operates across 21 regions and 88 field offices nationwide. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

For those invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding the dollar’s trajectory is not just academic; it directly impacts market sentiment, liquidity, and investment strategies. A strong dollar can often divert capital from riskier assets, including digital currencies, while a weaker dollar might fuel their ascent. Recently, Bank of America (BofA) delivered a compelling perspective, suggesting that the dollar’s strength is far from waning, even as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy evolves and corporate capital flows shift. This outlook challenges conventional wisdom and prompts a deeper dive into the forces shaping global currency markets. Decoding the US Dollar ‘s Strength: What BofA Sees BofA’s analysis points to a fundamental robustness in the US Dollar , attributing its enduring power to a confluence of factors that extend beyond simple interest rate differentials. While many market participants might assume that a shift in the Federal Reserve’s stance, particularly towards rate cuts, would automatically weaken the dollar, BofA presents a more nuanced view. Their research highlights that the dollar’s resilience is rooted in structural advantages and ongoing demand, irrespective of short-term policy adjustments. Key pillars supporting BofA’s conviction include: Relative Economic Performance: The US economy has consistently demonstrated a stronger growth trajectory compared to many other developed nations. This economic outperformance attracts foreign investment, creating sustained demand for the dollar. When the US economy shows signs of robustness, it becomes a magnet for global capital, enhancing the dollar’s appeal. Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or financial market volatility, the US Dollar traditionally acts as the ultimate safe haven. Investors flock to dollar-denominated assets, such as US Treasury bonds, perceiving them as secure stores of value. This flight to safety creates intrinsic demand for the dollar, particularly during periods of heightened risk aversion. Global Reserve Currency Status: The dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency means it is indispensable for international trade, finance, and central bank reserves. A vast majority of global transactions, including commodity pricing, are denominated in dollars. This structural demand provides a powerful underlying bid for the currency, making it less susceptible to transient economic headwinds. Corporate Repatriation Flows: BofA specifically notes the impact of corporate flows. Large multinational corporations often repatriate profits earned abroad back to their home countries, especially the US. These significant capital movements, particularly around quarter-ends or year-ends, create substantial demand for the dollar as foreign currency holdings are converted back into USD. This is a consistent, often overlooked, driver of dollar strength. These elements combine to form a strong foundation for the dollar, suggesting that even if the Fed eases its monetary policy, other factors could continue to bolster its value. Navigating the Fed Rate Outlook : A Shifting Landscape The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is arguably the most scrutinized economic indicator globally, and its impact on currency markets is profound. For much of the recent past, the Fed embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle to combat inflation, pushing interest rates to multi-decade highs. This ‘higher for longer’ narrative provided significant tailwinds for the US Dollar , making dollar-denominated assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors. However, market expectations are now increasingly leaning towards a pivot, with analysts anticipating potential rate cuts in the near future. This shift in the Fed rate outlook typically leads to a weaker dollar, as the yield advantage diminishes. Yet, BofA’s stance suggests this conventional wisdom might not fully capture the dollar’s complex dynamics. Consider the following aspects of the evolving Fed narrative: Pace and Depth of Cuts: The market is constantly re-evaluating the potential number and magnitude of Fed rate cuts. If the Fed proceeds cautiously, or if economic data remains robust, leading to fewer cuts than anticipated, the dollar could maintain its strength. A scenario where the Fed cuts rates but still keeps them relatively high compared to other major central banks could also limit dollar depreciation. Relative Monetary Policy: It is not just the Fed’s actions in isolation, but how they compare to other central banks (e.g., European Central Bank, Bank of Japan). If other central banks are also easing, or if their economies are weaker, the dollar could still retain its relative attractiveness, even with Fed cuts. Inflation Trajectory: The primary driver of the Fed’s decisions is inflation. If inflation proves stickier than expected, or if there are renewed inflationary pressures, the Fed might be compelled to maintain higher rates for longer, directly supporting the dollar. Conversely, a rapid decline in inflation could accelerate rate cuts, posing a challenge to dollar strength. BofA’s view acknowledges these complexities, positing that while the Fed’s actions are crucial, they are not the sole determinant of the dollar’s fate. The interplay of various economic forces, rather than a singular focus on interest rates, will dictate the dollar’s path. Understanding Dollar Resilience : Beyond Interest Rates The concept of Dollar resilience is central to BofA’s argument, emphasizing that the currency’s strength is multifaceted and not solely dependent on the interest rate differential. This perspective challenges the common market narrative that often oversimplifies currency movements. What contributes to this resilience, even when the Fed might be easing? Factor Description Impact on Dollar Geopolitical Risks Global conflicts, political instability, and economic crises outside the US. Increases demand for the dollar as a safe-haven asset, boosting its value. Energy Independence The US’s position as a major energy producer reduces its vulnerability to global oil price shocks compared to energy-importing nations. Provides economic stability, indirectly supporting the dollar. Innovation & Technology The US leads in critical technological advancements (AI, biotech), attracting significant foreign direct investment. Generates demand for dollar-denominated assets and fosters economic growth. Deep & Liquid Capital Markets The unparalleled depth and liquidity of US financial markets (stocks, bonds, derivatives) make them attractive for global investors. Facilitates large-scale capital flows into the US, increasing dollar demand. Corporate Flows (Repatriation) US multinational corporations converting foreign earnings back into USD. Creates consistent, often substantial, demand for the dollar, especially at reporting periods. These factors collectively paint a picture of a currency whose value is underpinned by more than just central bank policy. For instance, if a global crisis erupts, investors will prioritize safety over yield, funneling capital into the dollar regardless of whether the Fed is cutting rates. Similarly, the structural demand from international trade and corporate activities ensures a baseline level of dollar strength that is difficult to erode quickly. The ability of the US economy to adapt and innovate, coupled with its role as a global financial hub, contributes significantly to this inherent resilience. This means that even in a scenario where the Fed becomes more dovish, the dollar might experience only a temporary dip before these deeper structural forces reassert themselves. Impact on the Forex Market : Opportunities and Challenges BofA’s outlook on dollar resilience has significant implications for the broader Forex market . Traders, investors, and businesses that operate internationally must carefully consider these dynamics when formulating their strategies. A strong dollar, or one that remains robust despite policy shifts, presents both opportunities and challenges across various currency pairs. Opportunities: Yield Advantage (Relative): Even with potential Fed cuts, if US yields remain comparatively higher than those in other major economies, the dollar could still offer an attractive carry trade opportunity. Safe-Haven Plays: During periods of market stress, anticipating dollar strength allows for strategic positioning in dollar-denominated assets or long dollar positions against riskier currencies. Hedging Costs: For US-based companies with foreign currency exposure, a resilient dollar might imply lower hedging costs, as the risk of significant dollar depreciation is mitigated. Challenges: Export Competitiveness: A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially hurting export-oriented industries and widening trade deficits. Emerging Market Debt: Many emerging market countries and corporations have dollar-denominated debt. A strong dollar increases the cost of servicing this debt, leading to financial strain and potential defaults. Commodity Prices: As most commodities are priced in dollars, a stronger dollar makes them more expensive for non-dollar holders, potentially dampening demand and impacting commodity-exporting nations. Profit Repatriation for Non-US Firms: Foreign companies with US operations might see their dollar-denominated profits diminish when converted back to their local currencies. For forex traders, this means paying close attention to cross-currency dynamics, not just the absolute level of US interest rates. Understanding the relative economic health of various regions and their central bank policies will be paramount. For instance, if the Eurozone economy struggles while the US maintains growth, the EUR/USD pair might remain under pressure even if the Fed cuts rates. Diversification and dynamic hedging strategies become critical in such an environment. The Global Economy and the Dollar’s Dominance: What’s Next? The dollar’s persistent strength, as foreseen by BofA, has far-reaching consequences for the entire Global economy . Its dominance shapes trade flows, capital movements, and the financial stability of nations worldwide. Understanding these broader implications is crucial for policymakers, investors, and businesses alike. How Dollar Resilience Shapes the Global Economic Landscape: Inflationary Pressures Abroad: A strong dollar can exacerbate imported inflation for countries that rely heavily on dollar-denominated imports, particularly commodities like oil. This forces foreign central banks to potentially hike rates more aggressively to combat domestic inflation, even if their economies are weaker. Capital Flight from Emerging Markets: When the dollar strengthens, capital tends to flow out of emerging markets and into dollar-denominated assets, seeking safety and potentially higher returns. This capital flight can destabilize emerging economies, leading to currency depreciation, higher borrowing costs, and slower growth. Impact on Trade Balances: For countries that export to the US, a stronger dollar means their goods are relatively cheaper, potentially boosting their exports. Conversely, for US trading partners, their exports to the US become more expensive, which can affect their trade balances. Geopolitical Influence: The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the US significant geopolitical leverage. This influence extends to sanctions, financial diplomacy, and setting global financial standards. Debt Sustainability: Many nations and corporations hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A strong dollar increases the real burden of servicing and repaying this debt, posing risks to fiscal stability, especially in developing economies. Looking ahead, the interaction between US economic policy, global growth trends, and geopolitical events will continue to define the dollar’s role. If the US continues to outpace other major economies in terms of innovation and growth, the structural demand for the dollar will likely persist. However, ongoing efforts by some nations to de-dollarize or promote alternative reserve currencies could introduce long-term shifts, though such changes typically unfold over decades rather than years. For investors, this means maintaining a diversified portfolio and closely monitoring global macroeconomic indicators. The dollar’s resilience is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium influenced by a complex web of interconnected factors. Being aware of these forces allows for more informed decision-making in an increasingly interconnected global financial system. Conclusion: Navigating the Dollar’s Enduring Power Bank of America’s perspective on the US Dollar ‘s enduring resilience provides a vital counter-narrative to the conventional wisdom surrounding Federal Reserve policy shifts. While the Fed rate outlook will undoubtedly influence short-term currency movements, BofA highlights that deeper, structural factors—such as US economic outperformance, safe-haven demand, and crucial corporate flows—are likely to underpin Dollar resilience . These elements combine to ensure the dollar’s pivotal role in the Forex market and its profound impact on the Global economy . For investors, businesses, and policymakers, this analysis underscores the importance of a holistic view. Relying solely on interest rate differentials risks misinterpreting the dollar’s true trajectory. Instead, a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted drivers of dollar strength, coupled with an awareness of its wide-ranging implications, is essential for navigating the complexities of the global financial landscape. The dollar, it seems, is poised to remain a formidable force, shaping markets and economies for the foreseeable future, irrespective of the ebb and flow of monetary policy.
