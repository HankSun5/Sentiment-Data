42227728,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104036,1742763908,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Considering Bitcoin Inspired Halving — Will TRX go Above $0.4 in the Next Bull Phase?,https://zycrypto.com/tron-considering-bitcoin-inspired-halving-will-trx-go-above-0-4-in-the-next-bull-phase/,"Tron founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to raise public awareness regarding the digital currency’s proposed block reward halving. He drew parallels with Bitcoin’s much-touted 4-year halving cycle, in which the premier cryptocurrency undergoes a major bull phase followed by a bearish cooldown before starting things all over again in the ensuing couple of years. Sun wants TRX to eventually settle down on a similar halving cycle because it showcases the maturity of the digital asset. He tweeted : “….As the Bitcoin network grew, block rewards gradually decreased. In the early days, higher rewards were necessary for bootstrapping the network. However, as Bitcoin’s price surged, block rewards were lowered, and the halving cycle played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability—aligning with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision….” The New TRX Block Reward Halving Proposal On paper, following BTC seems like a straightforward proposal: periodically decrease the block reward halving to mimic the top cryptocurrency, and it can follow the same trajectory. However, in reality, it is easier said than done. Many other digital currencies have tried to come up with a similar model but failed to maintain a strong periodic foothold in the market like Bitcoin. However, Sun is very enthusiastic about the proposal currently being analyzed by the Tron community. The suggestion titled “Reduce TRX block rewards #738” presents several deflationary tactics, like reducing the block reward by 50% to 1.5-2% per year. Currently, it is set at 1%, which is apparently not enough to kickstart a BTC-like halving cycle. However, the Tron community has not provided definitive word on this proposal, but it is expected to be put to a vote soon. Sun tweeted: “Ultimately, this decision rests with the TRX community!” TRX to Rise to $0.4? Here is the TRX/USD graph from the last 4 months: Image Source: TradingView TRX is the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It has been able to cling to this coveted position during the last few months, especially during a time of turmoil in the markets. But, like the rest of the crypto market cap, it has experienced significant losses in dollar terms. It recorded an All-Time High (ATH) of $0.44 at the end of November 2024 but has since lost 50% against the greenback and has struggled to remain above $0.24 for long periods. A $0.4 valuation is very much in the realm of possibility, but a major market rebound or a successful block reward halving will be needed to supercharge the cryptocurrency’s market position. The Future While TRX’s long-term future depends on the larger cryptocurrency market, it can also make its way if it offers the perfect tokenization recipe. The network is resurgent and its growing use case in the sprawling meme coin economy has breathed new life into the digital network.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Tron News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRX|MARKET|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:05:08

Cosmos and Algorand Gain Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/can-qubetics-testnet-launch-secure-its-spot-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-invest-this-week-cosmos-and-algorand-gain-strength/,"Crypto markets are heating up again, but not all eyes are on the usual suspects this time. With presale stages creating buzz, discerning participants are searching for the best crypto presale to invest this week. Amid the noise, a few projects stand out—not for hype, but for their robust ecosystems, technology, and real-world use cases. Qubetics has emerged as a top contender, gaining momentum with its successful testnet launch. Alongside it, Cosmos and Algorand continue to prove their worth with unique innovations in blockchain interoperability and financial-grade applications. These projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, especially for those seeking quality beyond the speculative frenzy. Qubetics Testnet Go Live: Setting a New Standard for the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Qubetics takes a giant leap forward by activating its TestNet —a major step from its alpha testnet phase. This launch is not just ceremonial. It provides a secure environment where developers, validators, and community members can engage directly with the platform, testing features without risking financial loss. Performance tuning, enhanced security protocols, and smooth transaction testing pave the way for a robust mainnet rollout. What sets Qubetics apart is its advanced Qubetics Wallet , designed to streamline complex financial operations for businesses, professionals, and individual users. The wallet eliminates reliance on third-party custodians by enabling complete control over digital assets. This user-centric approach enhances security while simplifying DeFi participation, token management, and smart contract execution. Strategic alliances with industry heavyweights such as 1inch , SWFT , and CertiK further boost Qubetics’ credibility. CertiK’s auditing prowess is widely respected, while 1inch and SWFT ensure liquidity and efficient cross-chain transactions. Together, these partnerships reinforce Qubetics’ mission to deliver a secure, reliable, and highly functional ecosystem. Qubetics Presale and ROI Projections With over 502 million $TICS tokens sold to 23,500 holders, the crypto presale has already raised $15.3 million in its 26th presale stage. At $0.1181 per token, Qubetics presents a prime opportunity for early buyers aiming for long-term rewards. Analysts project impressive potential returns: $1 post-presale — 746.05% ROI $5 post-presale — 4,130% ROI $6 post-presale — 4,976% ROI $10 post-presale — 8,360% ROI $15 post-mainnet launch — 12,590% ROI These forecasts, though exciting, come with the usual crypto market risks. Still, such metrics solidify Qubetics as the best crypto presale to invest this week. Cosmos Powers Ahead: Breaking Barriers and Bearish Trends Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a sharp turnaround after enduring a grueling stretch that pushed its price from $10 to $3.62 by March 10. However, with a 22% surge in the last week, ATOM now stands at $4.67—and momentum continues to build. Technical indicators point toward sustained strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) readings are bullish, confirming heightened buying pressure. Social dominance has risen to 0.27%, signaling growing market buzz around Cosmos. A recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern invalidated the bearish outlook. ATOM now trades above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a classic sign of trend reversal. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) remains in positive territory, affirming bullish control. Cosmos could soon break the $5 resistance if momentum holds, potentially climbing toward $6.21, aligning with the golden ratio Fibonacci level. While risks persist, Cosmos reclaims its spot as a blockchain worthy of attention this week. Algorand’s Strategic Moves: Is It Joining the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Club? Algorand (ALGO), currently trading near $0.2480, is turning heads in 2025 for reasons beyond price action. Algorand’s tech is gaining real-world relevance, especially through its DeRec Alliance partnership with Hedera and Ripple. This collaboration focuses on decentralized asset recovery standards—a critical need in the evolving Web3 landscape. Further strengthening its use case, Algorand plays a key role in Sweden’s central bank CBDC trials, showcasing its technology in large-scale financial applications. These developments underline Algorand’s commitment to providing scalable and secure blockchain solutions, elevating its status among top-performing projects this year. With increasing demand for interoperability and institutional-grade infrastructure, Algorand’s strategic advancements make it a prime watchlist candidate. While not a presale token, ALGO’s steady growth aligns it with those projects drawing strong community and enterprise support. Final Thoughts Choosing the best crypto presale to invest this week requires more than hype-chasing. Projects like Qubetics, Cosmos, and Algorand demonstrate why fundamentals matter, especially in volatile markets. Qubetics stands tall with its testnet success, strategic partnerships, and a presale model offering substantial ROI potential. Its wallet features, real-world business focus, and rigorous testing regime place it at the center of market attention. Cosmos has defied bearish expectations, flashing strong technical signals and renewed social dominance. Algorand’s practical applications in national financial systems and decentralized asset recovery make it a standout for 2025. While crypto remains inherently risky, these three projects show the traits of long-term players. Qubetics, in particular, emerges as the best crypto presale to invest this week, backed by innovation, community momentum, and a clear roadmap.

42228152,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104038,1742764690,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"US Treasury Uses Discretionary Powers to End Sanctions Against Tornado Cash, says “Innovation” Benefits Americans",https://zycrypto.com/us-treasury-uses-discretionary-powers-to-end-sanctions-against-tornado-cash-says-innovation-benefits-americans/,"The U.S. Treasury has ended its sanctions on Tornado Cash , a prominent mixing service, by removing addresses associated with the token, including Ethereum addresses. Under the U.S. Treasury, the department responsible for this decision is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The list of banned addresses is referred to as the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. However, the Treasury Department maintains sanctions on one of Tornado’s founders, Roman Semenov. In 2022, OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash allegedly for facilitating money laundering on its platform. Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, had used the service to anonymize their stolen money, totaling millions of dollars in stolen tokens. Tornado Cash is a mixer service for Ethereum and allows users to anonymize their coins by randomly mixing them with other coins. Tornado users sued the Treasury when the service was blacklisted. Coinbase financially backed the lawsuit. The Treasury made an official announcement about the delisting of the crypto service: “Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by the use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury”. Tornado Cash is a tool that allows users to make their transactions more private. It combines different transactions, making it more difficult for people to track them. Privacy advocates see the service as vital for protecting one’s anonymity and financial security. However, many governments see it as a tool used by hackers to disguise their transactions. In November 2024, a judge from the Fifth Circuit ruled that a piece of automatic software cannot be classified as property and, therefore, cannot be sanctioned by OFAC. Tornado supporters are celebrating the decision by OFAC to drop the blacklisting. They argue that banning Tornado because Lazarus is misusing the service is like banning the internet because Lazarus is using the web to hack crypto wallets. The Treasury, however, further stated that it is still concerned about money laundering, particularly the Lazarus group stealing billions from various crypto wallets. It plans to strike a balance between cutting back on crime and giving people room to make critical innovations. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities,” said Scott Bessent, secretary of the Treasury, “for innovation and value creation for the American people. Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion”. Roman Storm, Tornado Cash co-founder, still faces a criminal trial in July for creating protocols and smart contracts. Storm’s lawyer tried to get the case dropped after the November 2024 ruling. However, Judge Katherine Failla denied the request in February, stating that Storm still defied the sanctions list, regardless of the November ruling. Coinbase helped finance Tornado Cash’s legal defense, claiming the allegations were unreasonable. Brian Armstrong has argued that open source technology benefits citizens and should therefore not be banned.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|ETH|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:18:10

Cathie Wood to give inaugural lecture for El Salvador's AI public education program Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood is kicking off El Salvador's AI education program by giving the inaugural lecture for the public education initiative. In a March 23 X post , El Salvador's Bitcoin Office wrote that the program would leverage industry experts to provide university-level artificial intelligence education to students and professionals. The Bitcoin Office added: ""This is the only national education program bringing in top-tier field experts to blow young minds!

Bitcoin needs weekly close above $85k to avoid correction to $76k: analysts Bitcoin analysts are eying the weekly close to gauge Bitcoin’s price trajectory for next week, as traditional and crypto markets are lacking direction amid a mix of global trade war fears paired with easing inflation concerns. Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price may see more downside next week unless it manages to close the week above the $85,000 psychological mark, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “Bitcoin’s relief rally after the FOMC meeting and lower CPI readings has analysts eyeing a weekly close above $85,000, as critical for resuming upside momentum,” Lee told Cointelegraph, adding: “A close above this level could prevent a drop to $76,000 and signal strength, while $87,000 would provide even clearer bullish confirmation. Macro factors like steady rates and cooling inflation support risk assets, but the Sunday close will be decisive.” BTC/USD, 1-year chart.

Crypto security will always be a game of ‘cat and mouse’ — Wallet exec Cryptocurrency wallet providers are getting more sophisticated , but so are bad actors — which means the battle between security and threats is at a deadlock, says a hardware wallet firm executive. “It will always be a cat and mouse game,” Ledger chief experience officer Ian Rogers told Cointelegraph when describing the constant race between crypto wallet firms adding new security features and hackers finding more advanced ways to access victims’ wallets. Rogers said, unfortunately, the most straightforward scams work best because scammers rely on people making simple mistakes. “People give their 24-word phrases to people every day, so as long as that happens, then they are going to go for the low-cost tax,” he said, adding: “Anyone who asks for your 24 words is a criminal.” Rogers highlighted a common crypto scam where victims get tricked by replies under “any post on Twitter about crypto,” with messages like “DM me, and I’ll help you.” “You know that scammers are always asking you for your 24 words,” Rogers said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-23 21:23:23

The attacker tried to exploit GitHub permissions to add harmful code into the project’s automated build system (CI/CD pipeline). Thanks to a fast response from Coinbase and help from security professionals, no major damage occurred. The issue was first made public on March 23, when Yu Jian, the founder of the security firm SlowMist, shared a post on X. He referred to a detailed report from Unit 42, the security research team at Palo Alto Networks. The hacker targeted Coinbase’s open-source tool agentkit , which helps create blockchain-based AI agents. They also attacked another related toolkit, onchainkit , both hosted on GitHub. By forking these repositories, the attacker inserted dangerous code into the automation process. This malicious activity was detected on March 14, 2025 . Unit 42 explained that the goal was to take advantage of the public CI/CD flow in agentkit. The hacker used GitHub’s broad “write-all” permissions, which allowed them to plant harmful payloads into the automated workflows. This could have exposed sensitive data or opened the door to further compromises. Fortunately, the injected code did not include highly dangerous features like remote control tools or reverse shell exploits. Instead, it was built to gather internal data quietly. Still, the risk was serious. Coinbase moved quickly. Working closely with cybersecurity experts, the company isolated the threat and applied key protections. Their quick action stopped the attack before it could reach deeper systems or cause lasting harm. This incident comes at a time when Coinbase holds a critical role in the crypto world, especially as the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and a main custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs . A successful breach could have created serious problems in the wider industry, similar to Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack. Although this attack failed, the same threat actor is now believed to be part of a larger cyber campaign that is gaining global attention. In response, Yu Jian urged developers to carefully review their GitHub setups. He specifically warned those using tools like reviewdog or tj-actions to double-check their systems and make sure no sensitive information has leaked. “If your company uses reviewdog or tj-actions, do a thorough self-examination,” he advised on X. The case shows how securing open-source tools is becoming more urgent as the crypto space grows. According to data from DeFiLlama, over $1.5 billion in crypto has already been lost to hacks and exploits this year alone.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-23 21:40:54
42230932,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61406,1742766188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Role of Blockchain in the Digital World,https://timestabloid.com/the-role-of-blockchain-in-the-digital-world/,"Blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century. It has revolutionized industries ranging from finance to healthcare, creating new opportunities for secure and decentralized digital transactions. While initially known as the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain has expanded beyond digital currencies, shaping various sectors and redefining how data is stored and verified. In this article, we will explore how blockchain is influencing the world and the many ways it is being integrated into different industries. Understanding Blockchain Technology At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers. This system ensures transparency, security, and immutability, making it nearly impossible to alter or hack data once it has been recorded. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain does not rely on a single authority to manage or validate information. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that work together to maintain the integrity of the ledger. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a continuous chain. This structure enhances security and prevents tampering, making blockchain a reliable tool for digital record-keeping. Key Features of Blockchain 1. Decentralization One of the most important aspects of blockchain technology is decentralization. Unlike traditional financial systems that depend on central banks or governments, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network. This means that no single entity has control over the entire system, reducing the risks of fraud and manipulation. 2. Security and Transparency Blockchain networks use cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions, making them highly resistant to cyber threats. Additionally, all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust among users. 3. Immutability Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This immutability ensures that records remain accurate and unaltered, which is particularly valuable in industries that require verifiable data integrity, such as healthcare and supply chain management. Applications of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency Although blockchain gained popularity through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, its potential extends far beyond digital money. Here are some of the key areas where blockchain is making a significant impact: 1. Finance and Banking Blockchain has transformed the financial sector by enabling faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions. Traditional banking processes often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and high transaction fees. Blockchain eliminates these middlemen, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions. Moreover, smart contracts – self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain – streamline processes like loan approvals and cross-border payments. 2. Supply Chain Management Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains by providing an immutable record of goods as they move through various stages of production and distribution. Companies can use blockchain to track product origins, prevent counterfeiting, and improve inventory management. 3. Healthcare and Medical Records The healthcare industry benefits greatly from blockchain’s ability to store and secure patient records. Blockchain ensures that medical histories remain accurate, up-to-date, and accessible only to authorized individuals. This reduces errors, prevents data breaches, and improves patient care. 4. Real Estate and Property Transactions Real estate transactions often involve complex paperwork and lengthy verification processes. Blockchain simplifies this by creating digital property ownership records, reducing the need for intermediaries, and minimizing fraud risks. Smart contracts also automate property sales, ensuring smooth and transparent transactions. 5. Voting Systems Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize voting systems by ensuring secure and tamper-proof elections. With blockchain-based voting, each vote is recorded on a decentralized ledger, preventing fraud and ensuring transparency in the electoral process. 6. Intellectual Property and Digital Rights Artists, musicians, and content creators can use blockchain to protect their intellectual property rights. By registering their work on a blockchain, they can create a verifiable proof of ownership, preventing unauthorized use and ensuring fair compensation. 7. Education and Credential Verification Blockchain can be used in the education sector to verify academic credentials. Universities and employers can use blockchain to ensure that diplomas, certificates, and degrees are authentic and tamper-proof, reducing fraud in academic qualifications. 8. Decentralized Identity Verification Identity theft and data breaches are major concerns in today’s digital world. Blockchain offers a solution by enabling decentralized identity verification, allowing individuals to control their own digital identities securely. This eliminates the need for centralized databases that are vulnerable to hacking. 9. Energy Trading and Sustainability Blockchain technology is being integrated into the energy sector to enable peer-to-peer energy trading. Homeowners with solar panels can sell excess energy directly to others without the need for intermediaries. This creates a more efficient and sustainable energy distribution system. The Future of Blockchain Blockchain technology continues to evolve, and its adoption is expected to grow across multiple industries. Innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain-based identity verification are paving the way for a more secure and decentralized digital future. However, challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and energy consumption concerns. Governments and organizations worldwide are working to address these challenges to ensure the responsible development and integration of blockchain technology. Conclusion Blockchain is more than just a buzzword; it is a groundbreaking technology with the potential to reshape numerous industries. From finance and healthcare to real estate and digital rights management, blockchain’s decentralized and secure nature is revolutionizing how data and transactions are handled. As technology continues to evolve, its impact on the world will only grow, offering endless possibilities for innovation and efficiency. Businesses and individuals looking to stay ahead in the digital era should embrace blockchain technology and explore its benefits. Whether it’s through secure financial transactions, transparent supply chains, or tamper-proof voting systems, blockchain is set to become a fundamental pillar of the future digital landscape.

42229812,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697835,1742767200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42229812.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Holder Abruptly Sells Huge SOL Stake for New Coin Currently Under $0.03,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-holder-abruptly-sells-huge-sol-stake-for-new-coin-currently-under-0-03/,"One of the largest Solana (SOL) investors has cashed in a huge amount of their bag in the crypto market to purchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending token that is in presale and is currently valued at less than $0.03. It follows the turbocharged presale of Mutuum Finance, with Phase 3 already 60% full after raking in $4.5 million and 6,400 holders. Despite currently sitting at $0.02, on its next stage, MUTM will rise to $0.025 — a 25% increase — fostering an urge to buy MUTM to prevent a gap formed with the next price range. The token is said to have artificially induced buy pressure mechanisms and real-world use cases in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which analysts are looking to as catalysts for its explosive potential. Presale Ramps Up For Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting immense demand as a first to market with its unique lending model and profit-sharing ecosystem. The project’s presale has already surpassed $4.5 million, with Phase 3 tokens being snapped up quickly in advance of an exchange listing at $0.06. In fact, those who snatch the token up now at the $0.02 price will be able to see a return of 200% when MUTM hits the public markets. An exciting post-launch price prediction based on tokenomics is also strongly propelling optimism – $1.50 would imply a 7,400% ROI and has established MUTM as a genuine breakout candidate in terms of DeFi due diligence across 2025. A share of protocol income flows into the platform’s “buy-and-distribute” system, directly purchasing MUTM tokens for distribution among stakers. This mechanism maintains demand and prevents sell offs which creates a self-reinforcing cycle of scarcity and value increase. Moreover, Mutuum’s overcollateralized lending pools and peer-to-peer borrowing services provide real utility that distinguishes it from speculative competitors. Shift In Investors On Solana Reflects The Confidence In The Market The Solana (SOL) investor’s move to Mutuum Finance is part of a larger trend of capital flowing toward projects with tangible use cases. Despite being one of the leading blockchains, Solana has faced challenges in recent months — including price fluctuations and network congestion — which have motivated some investors to seek additional opportunities among newer tokens, such as MUTM. The presale mechanics of Mutuum with progressive price increases between phases is a hook for many looking for asymmetric returns. The $0.02 barrier to entry of Phase 3 in particular is well considered. Over half of the allocation has already been taken, so the window to secure tokens at this tier is closing. By buying now ahead of Phase 4, investors not only secure themselves a 25% gain, but place themselves in prime position for even more exponential growth after listing. In contrast, Solana’s 2025 estimates fall short of MUTM’s potential, given the latter’s strategic integrations with DeFi and token burns designed to escalate its market presence. Security and Long-Term Vision The development team of Mutuum Finance has started a security audit with CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. The results of the audit will be made public, and behind it, transparency. This preventive measure is in line with the project’s dedication to risk mitigation and keeping users’ funds and platform operations safe from exploits. The protocol’s roadmap involves the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, which would add to the diversity of its DeFi offerings. By minting stablecoins against pooled deposits, Mutuum plans to improve liquidity while keeping things decentralized — a direct challenge to centralized stablecoin masters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing what it means to have value, revolutionizing lending and incentivizing investors. With the presale gaining momentum and exchange listings on the horizon, the $0.02 price point could mark a brief window of opportunity for the project. Those early adopters will be able to enjoy life-changing returns that would be a mirror image of the foresight shown by the Solana whale who bet on MUTM. With Phase 3 almost full, waiting will cost you the final low-price entry before the flood of price increases irreversibly begins.

Perhaps basking in the landmark win, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, says the company will continue to push for fair regulations. Victory over SEC Sparks Renewed Push for Fair Rules In an interview with CNBC , Alderoty maintained that Ripple will lead the quest for “clear and fair crypto regulation.” This stance comes after Ripple announced that the U.S. regulatory body has decided not to pursue its controversial appeal against it. The SEC did not only drop its case with Ripple; other crucial cases were also tossed off. Some of those cases included the SEC’s case against American crypto exchange Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenSea . The development comes amid the shift in aggressive crypto enforcement the SEC has been known for under its former Chair, Gary Gensler. Interestingly, despite the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Ripple has remained silent about the cross-appeal it filed. The company has not made its stance known as to whether it would continue with the case or withdraw it. In a recent interview, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, stated that it has not yet reached a decision yet. Ripple’s Legal Battle and Its Market Impact Ripple’s victory over the SEC is a testament to the firm’s resilience. According to Alderoty, “Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back and won on essential legal questions.” Notably, the SEC filed a suit against the company four years ago, accusing it of raising over one billion dollars from XRP sales. The regulatory body argued that Ripple failed to register XRP as a security. XRP, launched in 2012, is one of the first altcoins in the cryptocurrency space. It became the native currency of Ripple Labs. Future of Crypto Regulation Post-Ripple Case The asset has remained resilient throughout the legal drama and witnessed an 11% increase after the news of the legal battle hit the market. As of this writing, XRP is changing hands at $2.41, a 1.72% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. With the legal hurdle over, many analysts anticipate XRP’s value to soar. Interestingly, Ripple’s executives predict that crypto assets could record explosive growth this year.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal has taken swipes at the US Treasury for its “botched” attempt at waiving the need for a final judgment. Coinbase CLO Pokes Holes In US Treasury’s Latest Court Filing In a strongly worded post on X , Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal railed against the US Treasury’s handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting from the sanctions list. According to Grewal’s disclosure, the US Treasury filed a pleading to moot the need for a final judgment on the matter. In legal terms, a party to dispute can apply to moot a final judgment, arguing that the issue at hand is no longer significant or actionable. Following Tornado Cash’s removal from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list, the US Treasury’s latest filing seeks to waive a final judgment on the case. Tornado Cash users have been in court, challenging the US Treasury’s decision to place the mixer on the SDN list. However, Grewal argues that the filing runs contrary to established legal processes in the US. He notes a proper filing follows only if the defendant can show that the “practice cannot reasonably be expected to recur.” The Coinbase CLO cited several legal precedents involving law enforcement agencies removing sanctions and not moving a case. He argues that without a final court judgment, law enforcement can review their decision to impose fresh sanctions at a future date. “Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again,” said Grewal. A Protracted Legal Battle Against Authorities The road toward the lifting of Tornado Cash’s sanctions was long and winding. A raft of Tornado Cash users headed to court to protest the placing of the mixer on the SDN list. US authorities say the mixer played a principal role in laundering nearly $500 million worth of stolen digital assets by North-Korean backed Lazarus Group. After notching a series of small wins in Court, Grewal criticized the US Treasury for failing to comply with a court ruling clarifying the status of Tornado Cash’s smart contract. The court ruled that the smart contract did not form property under the IEEPA as it is non-erasable. Tornado Cash has received support from Coinbase with the Ethereum Foundation supporting the legal defense of lead developer Alexey Pertsev.

Prosecutors allege that he misused $11 million from a major streaming service, meant for his science fiction television series “White Horse,” on crypto trading. The $11M Fraud According to the indictment, Rinsch reached a deal with the streaming platform in 2018, securing $44 million to complete the production of White Horse. In 2019 and early 2020, he requested an additional $11 million, which was transferred to his company on March 6, 2020. In a statement , acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said: “As alleged, Carl Erik Rinsch orchestrated a scheme to steal millions by soliciting a large investment from a video streaming service, claiming that money would be used to finance a television show that he was creating. But that was fiction.” Instead of using the funds as intended, he moved them through various accounts before storing them in a personal brokerage account. He then engaged in speculative securities trading but lost more than half of the funds within two months. Rather than redirecting the remaining money back into the show, Rinsch allegedly shifted to crypto trading and continued making extravagant personal purchases. Prosecutors say he spent nearly $1.8 million on credit card payments, $1 million on legal fees for lawsuits against the streaming service and his divorce, and $395,000 on luxury hotel stays and rental properties. Further, the Netflix director spent $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, including $638,000 on two mattresses and $295,000 on luxury bedding. His purchases also included five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari totaling $2.4 million and $652,000 on designer watches and clothing. The Charges Against Rinsch The 47-year-old has been indicted with one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and five counts of engaging in financial transactions involving criminally gotten property. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud, 20 years for money laundering, and 10 years for each financial transaction charge. This is not Rinsch’s first encounter with controversy. In 2023, the “Conquest” director reportedly took $4 million from the show’s budget to invest in Dogecoin, earning a $27 million return. Much like the current case, his crypto profits were followed by a lavish spending spree. Rinsch allegedly spent nearly $9 million on luxury purchases, including high-end furniture, designer clothing, a $380,000 watch, and luxury vehicles.

Concurrently, BlockDAG’s latest AMA delivered a wealth of updates, especially thrilling the community with a major announcement: an upcoming beta testnet launch accompanied by a generous 10,000 testnet token airdrop. These distinct developments reflect significant momentum for both projects, each impacting investor sentiment uniquely. For XRP, traders focus on its technical strength and legal milestones. For BlockDAG , investor enthusiasm builds on ambitious testnet plans and community incentives. This combination of XRP’s steady progress and BlockDAG’s strategic community engagement sets a compelling scene for crypto observers this quarter. XRP Holds Steady, Targets a New High XRP traders watched carefully as the cryptocurrency bounced from its critical support at $2.30, positioning itself for a potential move toward $3. Recently, XRP’s stability at this support level boosted market optimism significantly. Technical indicators highlighted a successful defense against bearish pressures, showing strength amid market volatility. Analysts identified the $2.42 resistance level as the key barrier before XRP can successfully break toward its ambitious $3 target. This current range ($2.30-$2.42) remains closely monitored as traders await clear directional signals. Adding further fuel to the bullish sentiment, XRP recently celebrated a pivotal legal milestone. The protracted lawsuit involving Ripple Labs and the SEC concluded favorably, significantly alleviating regulatory pressures that had long cast shadows over XRP. The resolution of this lawsuit dramatically improved market sentiment, giving XRP bulls additional confidence to maintain buying pressure at current support levels. This optimism is further supported by XRP’s broader adoption trajectory, with Ripple’s growing cross-border payment partnerships continuing to strengthen the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals. As Ripple expands globally, demand for XRP’s liquidity solutions steadily grows, underpinning bullish arguments beyond mere technical analyses. Traders and investors alike are thus hopeful that these combined factors can push XRP confidently toward the much-anticipated $3 price point in the near term. BlockDAG AMA Highlights Robust Community Initiatives On the other hand, BlockDAG continues capturing investor interest through proactive community-building strategies. The project’s latest AMA session unveiled detailed updates, significantly elevating enthusiasm within its community. Perhaps most notably, BlockDAG announced an imminent beta testnet launch coupled with an ambitious 10,000 testnet token airdrop to each of its 110,000 investors. This significant initiative aims to amplify community engagement while thoroughly testing network capacity, usability, and stability. During the AMA, the BlockDAG team emphasized the meticulous preparations for this testnet phase, detailing extensive improvements implemented since the previous alpha phase. Upgrades include enhanced node installation processes, streamlined documentation, and significantly improved network explorers. New capabilities like contract verification, node explorer functionalities, and real-time token views further bolster the testnet’s appeal, setting clear benchmarks for transparency and user-friendliness. Additionally, the AMA outlined a compelling incentive program designed explicitly to boost participation. The top 30 participants across various engagement metrics—including active wallets, miner participation, and token balances—stand to receive substantial rewards totaling $60,000, distributed in real BDAG tokens post-launch. This strategy highlights BlockDAG’s determination to foster an active and involved community, creating valuable feedback loops that improve network functionalities ahead of the mainnet launch. Beyond short-term excitement, BlockDAG also provided crucial clarifications on token vesting schedules, enhancing investor clarity. Presale investors will receive 40% of their tokens immediately upon the Token Generation Event (TGE), followed by evenly paced releases over subsequent months. Bonuses and miner rewards involve structured lock-ups extending from one to five years, underscoring BlockDAG’s commitment to sustainable growth and market stability post-launch. These details revealed transparently in the AMA, reinforce investor confidence, showcasing long-term planning and fiscal responsibility from the project’s leadership. The AMA also spotlighted significant strategic partnerships, including a prominent alliance with Inter Milan. This high-profile partnership offers substantial marketing potential, blending crypto innovation with traditional global sports appeal. Exclusive fan experiences, branded merchandise, and stadium tours were detailed as elements of this partnership, designed explicitly to extend BlockDAG’s global reach beyond crypto-native audiences. Additionally, BlockDAG’s participation in significant blockchain events—like ETHDenver, ETHPanama, and upcoming Token2049 summits in Dubai and Singapore—reflects the project’s coordinated strategy to bolster visibility and credibility within the broader crypto and blockchain sectors. Key takeaways As XRP maintains bullish ambitions, BlockDAG’s transparent AMA and community-first strategies continue driving meaningful investor engagement. Both cryptocurrencies stand poised for significant developments, each with clearly defined catalysts. XRP’s near-term path hinges on overcoming resistance, supported by robust fundamentals and favorable legal outcomes. For BlockDAG, the imminent testnet launch, significant airdrop incentives, structured vesting policies, and high-profile partnerships paint a clear and exciting trajectory. These clear, milestone-driven developments position both XRP and BlockDAG attractively within the broader market. However, BlockDAG’s raging presale with over $206M in presale, carefully structured community incentives, thorough transparency, and strategic event participation underline a particularly appealing narrative for long-term-oriented investors seeking sustainable value. Investors assessing crypto opportunities today would be wise to closely monitor both projects, though BlockDAG’s meticulous preparation and long-term vision distinctly set it apart.

The star of this trend? Remittix (RTX) , a $0.0734 altcoin that has already raised over $14 million and sold more than 520 million tokens. Some traders are calling it “XRP 2.0” thanks to its focus on low-cost, near-instant remittances. There’s also chatter that RTX could surge past $5 by 2025, an enormous leap from its current price. Below, we unpack how the PayFi narrative is gaining traction, why Remittix leads the pack, and how high it might climb in the next bull market. Why PayFi Is Booming PayFi tokens like Remittix are aimed at making payments simpler, cheaper and more user-friendly. Traditional wire transfers can be expensive and slow, a hassle for families, freelancers or small shops dealing with international clients. Remittix addresses this pain point directly, letting users convert crypto (BTC, ETH or others) into local cash and send it to a bank account in around 24 hours. This sets PayFi apart from advanced DeFi or NFT platforms, appealing to people who need to move money across borders without crazy fees. With the global remittance market worth trillions, PayFi tokens might have a huge real-world audience ready to jump in. As cross-border payments remain a daily challenge for countless people, the simplicity of PayFisolutions often wins them over. Someone who struggles with wire transfers or expensive remittance apps wants a no-fuss way to convert digital assets to local currency. That’s why PayFitokens like Remittix are attracting fresh interest, as they marry the benefits of crypto (speed and low fees) with the familiarity of regular bank deposits. Remittix (RTX): The ‘XRP 2.0’? While XRP famously tackled cross-border finance for banks, Remittix focuses on everyone else's families, gig workers and small businesses. Priced at $0.0734, RTX has pulled in over $14 million in funding, with 520+ million tokens sold in presale, showing strong initial backing. The team aims to keep things user-friendly, automating the entire conversion process so recipients don’t have to wrestle with crypto wallets or advanced steps. Observers believe that if Remittix (RTX) secures deals with major payroll systems or e-commerce companies, daily usage could skyrocket, pushing the token well beyond its current valuation. That’s why some analysts see it as “XRP 2.0,” but with a more direct approach to real people’s needs. Could RTX Really Pass $5 by 2025? At first glance, jumping from about $0.07 to over $5 sounds wild yet fans note that similar leaps happened when tokens like XRP or early DeFi coins caught mainstream attention. If Remittix(RTX) does become a go-to solution for cross-border transfers, its daily transaction volume could spike rapidly. Each new user has friends or family who might also switch, creating a chain reaction of adoption. Of course, hitting $5 demands big partnerships, consistent network stability and a supportive crypto market cycle. But given how large the international remittance market is, some experts say the goal is possible especially if PayFi becomes the next hot niche. Conclusion: Why Remittix Might Outpace XRP’s Old Record While XRP still plays a major role in cross-border banking, Remittix aims to capture everyday payments. At $0.0734 with over $14+ million raised, its potential user base (from freelancers to families) could drive a bigger, faster adoption wave than older tokens reliant on big institutional deals. If PayFi momentum continues, RTX has a big chance of surpassing $5 in the next bull run delivering life-changing gains for early buyers. Remittix stands as a prime example of how focusing on an everyday problem can catapult a token from obscurity to stardom, even in a crowded crypto landscape. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

It also vowed to consider talking points raised by the Virtual Asset Committee, a government advisory body that answers to the FSC. The BOK, meanwhile, is more “reluctant” to act. It has gone on the record as stating that it is “cautious about investing in virtual assets,” as they “do not meet the IMF’s foreign exchange reserve requirements.” The bank has also claimed that “high price volatility” means BTC and other tokens may not be “in line with the purpose of managing foreign exchange reserves.” South Korea’s financial authorities tighten AML controls to address new money laundering risks in the crypto sector. #SouthKorea #CryptoLaws https://t.co/2BlRNYWfxR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 5, 2025 The FSC has taken a different stance, noting that the Virtual Asset Committee has reported on “the possibility of stockpiling digital assets” and “setting the standards for stockpiling” crypto.

Web3 casinos represent a fundamental shift in gambling, reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud through verifiable randomness and immutable transaction records. The marriage of cryptocurrency and gambling creates a powerful combination that addresses long-standing issues in the industry. Through token ownership, players can verify game fairness, enjoy faster withdrawals, and participate in casino governance. These platforms are building what some call ""GambleFi"", an ecosystem where betting becomes community-centric and tokenised. As blockchain technology matures​​, the trajectory of Web3 gambling points toward increased democratisation and player control. The concept of rolling the decentralised dice goes beyond just playing games, it represents a new paradigm in which gamblers become stakeholders in the platforms they use. This shift from mere consumers to active participants may fundamentally restructure the £100+ billion online gambling industry for decades to come. The Advancement of Decentralised Gaming Platforms Decentralised gaming platforms have transformed the gambling industry by introducing transparency, security, and user ownership. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to create a more fair and accessible gambling environment. Evolution from Traditional to Decentralised Gambling “Traditional online casinos operate under centralised control, requiring players to trust the operator to maintain fair games and handle funds properly. Web3 gambling changes this dynamic by using blockchain to create trustless environments where outcomes are verifiable,” said UK online casino website JeffBet . The shift began with simple decentralised betting applications that processed payments using Bitcoin. These primitive platforms demonstrated the potential for removing intermediaries from gambling transactions. Today's Web3 casinos offer sophisticated experiences comparable to conventional online gambling sites. Without lengthy verification processes, players can now use digital wallets to deposit and withdraw various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Solana. User ownership represents a critical advancement. Players can verify game fairness through distributed ledgers rather than relying on opaque algorithms controlled by a single entity. Technological Underpinnings of Web3 Casinos Blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital currencies are the foundation of Web3 casinos. Together, these elements create transparent, secure, and user-controlled gambling platforms. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements with rules written in code, automatically determine game outcomes and distribute winnings. This automation eliminates the need to trust a centralised casino operator to pay out winnings. Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and game results are recorded immutably. Players can independently verify that games run fairly by checking the distributed ledger. Security benefits extend beyond fair play. Digital wallets provide enhanced protection against fraud compared to traditional payment methods. Players maintain control of their funds until they actively place bets. Interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing gamblers to use their preferred digital currency. Whether using Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, or emerging currencies, the increasing flexibility makes Web3 gambling more accessible. Benefits and Opportunities of Dice Gaming on the Blockchain Blockchain technology offers unique advantages for dice games that traditional online casinos simply cannot match. These innovations reshape the player experience through verifiable fairness, economic incentives, and unmatched security. Providing Fair Systems and Transparency The most compelling feature of blockchain-based dice games is their provably fair system. Unlike traditional online casinos where algorithms remain hidden, Web3 dice games use cryptographic methods to verify each roll's fairness. By examining the blockchain record, players can independently check that outcomes weren't manipulated. This verification happens through cryptographic hash functions and publicly visible smart contracts. The transparency extends beyond individual dice rolls. Casino profit margins (house edge) are coded directly into smart contracts, making them immutable and visible to all players. This openness builds unprecedented trust. Players who know with mathematical certainty that games aren't rigged develop stronger confidence in the platform. Many decentralised dice games publicly display transaction histories and dice roll outcomes on the blockchain, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record that regulatory bodies and players can audit. Tokenomics: Earning and Spending in Web3 Web3 dice games introduce innovative economic models through tokenised systems. Players often earn native platform tokens through gameplay, staking, or participation. These tokens serve multiple functions. They act as in-game currency for placing bets and grant governance rights in decentralised platforms. Token holders may vote on house edge percentages or new game implementations. Loyalty programmes in blockchain dice games offer free spins and bonuses based on token holdings rather than centralised decisions, creating a more equitable reward structure. Players can earn passive income by staking their tokens to provide liquidity to the dice game's betting pool. This makes players partial ""house owners"" who share in platform profits. The interoperability of tokens means winnings from dice games can be used across the broader Web3 ecosystem, creating greater utility than closed casino systems. Enhanced Security and Player Autonomy Blockchain dice games dramatically improve security through cryptographic protection and eliminating central points of failure. Funds remain in player-controlled wallets rather than casino accounts. Smart contracts automate payouts instantly when winning conditions are met. This removes the withdrawal delays and arbitrary limits common in traditional online casinos. Instant withdrawals via cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin allow players to access their winnings whenever they choose, without waiting for approval from centralised authorities. Players maintain full custody of their funds until they place a bet. This self-custody model eliminates the risk of casino insolvency affecting player deposits. KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are often minimised or eliminated, protecting player privacy while maintaining responsible gambling standards through blockchain verification. Implications for the Online Gambling Ecosystem The rise of decentralised dice platforms forces traditional gambling operators to reconsider their business models. Many are now incorporating blockchain elements to remain competitive. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate these new models. Some jurisdictions now recognise blockchain's inherent protections and are creating specialised licensing for Web3 gambling operations. Rolling the decentralised dice represents more than technological change, it signals a philosophical shift towards player-centric gambling experiences. Cross-chain compatibility allows dice games to operate across multiple blockchains, reaching broader audiences and providing flexibility in cryptocurrency choice for betting. The community-governed nature of these platforms ensures that development priorities reflect actual player needs rather than purely profit-driven motives.

According to the company, the number of active altcoins listed on CoinMarketCap dropped by 400, indicating a decrease in public interest. This decline is largely attributed to the significant decline in altcoin trading volume on exchanges, which currently averages $100 billion, much lower than the $400 billion recorded in December 2024. Despite this, Alphractal suggests that decreasing trading volumes will not necessarily prevent future price increases in altcoins. Historical trends show that altcoins have reached all-time highs even when trading volume has not peaked, as seen in 2021. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson stated that new incentives are needed in the cryptocurrency market. Wedson stated that, unlike the peak enthusiasm in 2017 and 2021, the current market is facing slow growth and lack of investor confidence. Wedson also identified the significant decline in investments in Web3 startups as a major contributing factor: 2021: $33 billion worldwide 2022: $7.1 billion raised despite “crypto winter,” signaling an early slowdown. 2023: Less than $7 billion raised, a 74% decrease from 2021. According to Crunchbase, $1.7 billion was raised in the first quarter alone, the lowest amount since late 2020. This decline in Web3 investments outpaced the downturn in the overall Venture Capital (VC) market, which saw a 38% decline between 2021 and 2023. Wedson pointed out several key reasons for the market slump: The collapse of FTX and the resulting loss of confidence in the industry. Regulatory uncertainties in major cryptocurrency markets. Shifting investor focus to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is set to attract around $50 billion by 2023. Despite these challenges, Wedson remains optimistic about the potential for a resurgence in crypto investment, believing that the combination of AI, crypto, and gaming-themed cryptocurrencies could be the next big driver of institutional capital. Alphractal’s latest observations show that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have accumulated more long positions than short positions over the past week, suggesting that the market could experience higher volatility early next week. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency world now focuses on Remittix as the token projected to surpass both Solana and Cardano in 2025 market performance. The market has shown its desire for straightforward payment options by allowing Remittix to sell more than 521 million tokens at $0.0734 each which resulted in $14 million raised. Solana’s Strong Momentum and ETF Speculation Source: tradingview . SOL’s current price is $133.27. The price of Solana regularly undergoes substantial changes. High growth rates and quick processing combined to make Solana renowned until obstacles such as network failures and negative market changes appeared. Recent attention on Solana news revolves around developing a Solana ETF just like traditional investors utilized for Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Such an ETF approval would enhance SOL's standing while offering an opportunity for new capital inflow from hedge funds alongside institutional participants. Solana could establish itself permanently in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to additional institutional support. Meme coin developers choose Solana because of its affordable transaction costs which allows them to deploy new tokens on its chain thus increasing on-chain action. The increase in transactions generates both short-term popularity and enhances the speed of operations in the network. The proposed exchange-traded fund could create institutional backing for Solana if its hopes materialize. Cardano’s Choppy Waters and Possible Recovery Since its inception Cardano (ADA) followed a step-by-step development process while relying on research reviewed by peers together with network upgrading layers. The coin experiences unstable performance during the latest week. The crypto market experiences significant challenges as analysts detect a “ Death Cross ” technical indicator that signals a bearish pattern following a 37% value decrease during this month. At its current price of $0.71 the ADA coin remains close to its essential support value at $0.70 . If the price drops below $0.62 it will strengthen the current bearish market sentiment. Source: tradingview . ADA’s death cross pattern. Although Cardano maintains fans who focus on its long-term development. Pioneers expect ADA to retrace to $1 after it successfully rises above $0.77 and maintains upward momentum. ADA along with the entire cryptocurrency market continues to give Charles Hoskinson hope as he suggests 2025 will mark their breakthrough year. Large holders continue to envision ADA growth potential based on their recent purchases of approximately 190 million tokens in the span of 48 hours. The signals point in different directions at present while new heavy buying spells the start of significant market advancement. Remittix: The Altcoin Forecasted to Outperform The direct everyday functionality of Remittix enters the market as settled competitors Solana and Cardano face scaling issues together with uncertain market sentiment alongside upcoming price barriers. The project obtained $14 million in funding through selling 521 million tokens at $0.0734. Through its swift crypto shortcode method Remittix enables users to make instant digital asset conversions that lead to easy spending and transferring capabilities. Numerous experts predict Remittix will deliver market successes because they believe today's consumers are seeking user-friendly practical solutions over multilayered platforms or delayed system updates. The incoming merchant partnerships, remittance services and e-commerce deals have the potential to create significant demand for Remittix tokens. Many experts consider Remittix the leading altcoin to dominate market gains during 2025 because it appeals to both crypto veterans and introductory users seeking simple payment methods. Why Remittix Could Eclipse Solana and Cardano Remittix distinguishes itself from Solana and Cardano with its straightforward link between cryptocurrency and regular bank funds while Solana focuses on developer needs and Cardano drives their development through research. The user bases continue supporting both coins but institutional money could potentially choose projects offering solutions for instant everyday needs. The rumored ETF for Solana holds promise along with potential improvements for Cardano yet these outcomes depend on directed and gradual project developments. Conclusion Analysts predict that both Solana and Cardano will experience partial price gains as certain market players continue to show enthusiasm for well-recognized platforms. New alternatives to Bitcoin are earning widespread approval as they address routine challenges in the year 2025. Near-instant payment solutions form the key priority of Remittix in its market leadership. The market recommends Remittix's direct payment solutions for its clear approach to delivering everyday utility ahead of methodical roadmap-driven projects like Cardano and prospectively successful projects like Solana.

Fidelity’s March 21 filing with the US securities regulator said “OnChain” would help track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) — an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While OnChain is pending regulatory approval, it is expected to take effect on May 30, Fidelity said. Fidelity’s filing to register a tokenized version of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund. Source: Securities and Exchange Commission The OnChain share class aims to provide investors transparency and verifiable tracking of share transactions of FYHXX, although Fidelity will maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. “Although the secondary recording of the OnChain class on a blockchain will not represent the official record of ownership, the transfer agent will reconcile the secondary blockchain transactions with the official records of the OnChain class on at least a daily basis.” Fidelity said the US Treasury bills wouldn’t be directly tokenized. The $5.8 trillion asset manager said it may also expand OnChain to other blockchains in the future.

That’s why many now focus on other coins that show better speed, utility, or smart tech upgrades. In this article, we’ll take a close look at four top trending cryptos in 2025—BlockDAG, Litecoin, Mantra, and XRP. These coins offer unique value with their strong tech and market plans. Each project is expected to make a big move in the coming year. Let’s explore how they work and what makes them special in today’s fast-growing space. BlockDAG: Most Advanced Layer-1 Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining a lot of attention due to a fast-moving presale that has raised more than $205 million while selling over 18.8 billion coins. Starting at just $0.001 in its first batch, the price has now climbed to $0.0248 in batch 27—a growth of 2,380%. This steady climb shows strong backing from the crypto crowd and explains why BDAG is one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. With plans to list on 10 centralized exchanges (CEXs) in 2025, BlockDAG will become easier to access globally, making buying and trading smoother. Alongside this, its awaited mainnet launch will take the system live, offering real use of its peer-to-peer setup. This move can help shape the future of decentralized tech use. The presale is getting closer to its goal of $600 million, and with only a few batches left, demand is growing. Prices are set to rise with each batch, so those waiting too long might miss a better deal. BlockDAG’s fast growth, mainnet launch, and CEX plans explain why it leads among the top trending cryptos in 2025. Litecoin: Trusted Digital Coin with Fast Transactions Created by ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) was built to improve transaction speed while using less data space than Bitcoin. It now holds a market value of $8.61 billion and trades at $114.46 per coin, proving its steady and reliable track record. The coin’s quick transfer times and lower cost make it a solid pick among top trending cryptos in 2025. It is known for handling daily use cases well, making it ideal for fast digital payments. Its steady support and active use in the crypto scene keep it relevant. LTC”s history of long-term use and simple network function gives it an edge. Keeping watch on Litecoin’s progress may help those tracking coins with proven value and function. Mantra: Bringing DeFi Closer to Traditional Finance Mantra (OM) is a platform that mixes decentralized finance (DeFi) with more familiar banking ideas. It offers services like lending, staking, and community voting, all managed on a blockchain-based setup. The OM coin helps run these services while also giving users voting rights. Priced at $7.38 currently, Mantra has shown a 92.71% price jump in 2024. This performance makes it one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. Yet beyond numbers, it’s also working on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and forming new links in both crypto and finance sectors. People looking at Mantra will want to study its growth path, active user role, and wider adoption before making any long-term move. Its mix of features and ties to DeFi and real finance could make it a strong pick going forward. XRP: Designed for Fast Global Transactions XRP helps move money across borders quickly and with fewer fees. It’s the base of RippleNet, a payment system made for speed and scale. Unlike banks using slow tools like SWIFT, XRP allows faster and cheaper transfers between countries. Its system is built differently from most cryptocurrencies, which has led to talks about how it should be classified. Still, XRP’s tech works well for solving real problems in global payments, which keeps it high on the list of top trending cryptos in 2025. Open-source coding and a clear goal to ease money movement across countries make XRP a project worth watching. For those following coins focused on global use, XRP may be a clear option. Which Top Trending Crypto to Buy Right Now? The crypto space offers many choices, but a few stand out due to strong use cases and clear paths forward. Litecoin has stood the test of time by offering fast and affordable transfers, making it a trusted pick. Mantra takes a smart step by combining DeFi tools with the finance world people already know. Its growth in RWA and service features give it a long-term appeal. XRP’s role in changing how global payments are made gives it solid ground in the top trending cryptos in 2025. Even with these strong names, BlockDAG may have the biggest leap ahead. Its presale passing $205 million, major exchange plans, and upcoming mainnet make it one to watch closely. Few batches remain, and with each one, the price is expected to rise. This mix of timing and strong tech places BlockDAG firmly among the t op trending cryptos in 2025 .

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 244,300 followers on the social media platform X that he expects meme tokens to eventually take center stage, highlighting that the crypto sector relies on trader attention. But while the analyst believes that memecoins will make a comeback, he says those that have been around longer than others will likely lead the surge. One asset on his radar is the Solana ( SOL )-based token Bonk ( BONK ). “Most memes got smashed overall but I think that they’ll eventually come back to some degree. Memes by nature are attention driven but I do think that some of the more ‘Lindy’ ones will have a better chance You probably just go off ecosystem. When SOL is hot, coins like BONK are going to be decent bets (along with some others like Fartcoin and WIF and others). BONK being down 85% from highs to lows probably makes it an ok bet down here (I have a bag of it).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X The trader is referring to the Lindy Effect, a concept suggesting that the longer something has survived, the longer it’s likely to keep surviving. At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.000012. Another memecoin on the trader’s roster is the Ethereum ( ETH )-based token Pepe ( PEPE ). “Feels like PEPE is also around a bottom, too. PEPE obviously an ETH beta but it’s also a good one if BTC starts going wild in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that PEPE would either rally to a high of $0.000015 or collapse to a new 2025 low of $0.000001. At time of writing, PEPE is trading for $0.000007.

Currently though, the market price of DOGE and Pepe Coin is seeking to stabilize but Remittixis performing impressively as it has yielded over 300% returns for early investors positioning it as currently one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Price Is Struggling To Find Footing In 2025 While DOGE began as a joke crypto coin, the currency has cemented its longevity in the top 10 altcoin list by boasting a market capitalization of more than $25 billion. Now trading at $0.17 , Dogecoin has seen modest gains of 2% in the past 24 hours on the back of a broader market rebound following a few weeks of bearish downturns. Some technical analysts have observed that the price of Dogecoin shows downtrend potential under intense resistance causing bearish effects as its EMAs cross paths and trading volume declines rapidly. Other analysts think DOGE shows signs of an upcoming price increase through its formation of an ascending triangle pattern. The price is expected to increase based on the anticipated movement from point AB to point CD and should hit highs of $0.59 in Q3 2025. Overall, the consensus remains that DOGE's reliance on fan-driven hype makes it vulnerable to change in market sentiment and limits its long-term growth potential compared to utility-driven ventures like Remittix . Pepe Coin Is Riding The Meme Wave; Will It Outperform Utility Tokens Like Remittix? Pepe Coin has emerged as one of the most talked-about meme coins in recent weeks, following its 22% price surge in the past 14 days which was brought about by its nostalgic appeal and viral marketing campaigns. With a price of $0.0000073, Pepe Coin sits at number 42 on the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $3 Billion. While analysts project Pepe to reach $0.000026 by mid-2025 should its user base continue to grow, its lack of tangible use cases taints its long-term viability. Like Dogecoin, the success of Pepe Coin relies on maintaining its meme coin value through hype while not offering functional solutions a stark contrast to what Remittix is set to offer the Defi space. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments The predictions for Dogecoin price show growth potential while Pepe Coin maintains its position in meme coin speculation but Remittix stands as a unique investment option combining functional benefits with explosive profit. The main distinction of Remittix arises from its aggressive approach in applying blockchain solutions to concrete business utility by providing rapid international money transfers. In contrast to hype-dependent speculative meme coins, Remittix has innovation and utility embedded within it and is a distinctive project in today's saturated new ICO market. Remittixpresale has been nothing but phenomenal and has generated a staggering $13.9 million to date. Trading at $0.0734 per RTX token at the current stage, the presale is a worthwhile entry for those seeking early adopter exponential growth potential. Industry experts forecast the RTX token will see an exponential leap increasing up to 800% by the end of the token presale with further gains anticipated in subsequent months after release and listing on top crypto exchanges.

With growing market optimism following the recent Fed rate pause, speculative BTC traders deployed increased leverage over the weekend. Will BTC advance above $90,000, or will it reverse to $80,000 in the week ahead? Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $85,500 After Three-Day Consolidation After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin (BTC) made a major recovery bounce on Sunday. Following Trump’s appearance at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, many short-term traders opted to take profits on their BTC holdings. Despite the decline, Bitcoin continues to find buyers, as the recent U.S. Fed rate pause announced on Wednesday prompted macro-sensitive capital to flow toward risky assets. Bitcoin price action, March, 24 2025 Bullish tailwinds from the Fed rate pause counteracted the downward pressure from profit-taking, leading to a three-day stalemate at the $84,000 level since Thursday. However, as sell-side pressure subsided, BTC price recorded a major breakout above $86,000 on Sunday, March 23. The chart above shows how BTC rose 2.6%, hitting a daily peak of $85,600. BTC Options Volume nears $800M as Whales Return After Fed Rate Pause Bitcoin price demonstrated remarkable resilience consolidating around $84,000 over the past three days, as macro-sensitive institutional investors reassess their stance on U.S. economic policies. Earlier this month, fears of inflationary pressure from Trump’s proposed tariffs triggered a cautious retreat from risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, with recent CPI and PPI reports showing inflation cooling and the Federal Reserve opting to pause rate hikes, large investors appear to be re-entering the market. This shift in sentiment is reflected in broader financial markets. The S&P 500 surged by 32 points following the Fed rate pause, signalling renewed risk appetite. As Bitcoin mirrors this trend, it has seen a sharp uptick in speculative trading activity from large investors. Validating this stance, Coinglass derivatives market data shows BTC’s options trading volume skyrocketed 24% in the last 24 hours, pushing total volume above $793 million. Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis, March 24 | Coinglass What Does 24% Options Trading Surge Mean for Bitcoin Price Action This Week? Options trading is a derivatives market strategy that allows traders to bet on the future price movements of an asset without directly purchasing it. This technique is particularly popular among institutional investors and whales because leverage enables traders to control large positions with relatively small capital, amplifying returns, especially during periods of market volatility. Given that options trading volume surged 24% over the last day, it suggests that whales and institutional investors are taking bullish positions on BTC’s near-term price movements. Why is BTC Options Volume Rising? The renewed interest in BTC options trading aligns with key macroeconomic narratives: Fed Rate Pause Fuels Risk Appetite – With the Fed pausing rate hikes, liquidity-sensitive assets like Bitcoin become more attractive. S&P 500 Rally Indicates Broader Market Confidence – TradFi investors reallocating capital to stocks may also be expanding exposure to BTC. Altcoin Season Rotation – With BTC holding steady above $85,000, traders are betting on volatility to capture short-term gains. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Data Supports Bullish Outlook, But $90K Flip Unlikely Beyond options trading, other key metrics reinforce a positive BTC outlook for the week ahead: Open Interest Rose 3.88% to $54.04B – A sign that new capital is entering the derivatives market. Long/Short Ratio at 1.28 on OKX & 1.2217 on Binance – Indicates more traders are placing long bets. Liquidations Favor Shorts – Over the last 12 hours, $14.2M in short positions were wiped out, compared to just $2.82M in longs. With Bitcoin showing strong demand above $86,000 and institutional investors actively positioning through options, a bullish breakout toward $90,000 remains a distinct possibility. However, signals on the daily Bitcoin price forecast charts below suggest the rally could face significant resistance below the $90,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTCUSD Technical Indicators Signal $90,000 Resistance Despite these bullish signals, the technical chart presents a nuanced picture. While Bitcoin has reclaimed $85,600, the looming death cross—where the 50-day moving average trends below the 200-day moving average—remains a cause for concern. This bearish formation suggests that unless BTC can decisively break above $87,200, a retracement toward the $80,000 region remains plausible. Bulls must clear this key resistance zone to sustain momentum toward $90,000. If BTC fails to establish support above $87,200, bears could regain control, triggering a potential pullback.

At the same time, attention turns to a new DeFi project that offers real solutions to crypto payment challenges. It may help many people who struggle with traditional banking by offering faster, safer ways to send money. Many now call it one of the best cryptos to buy. Shiba Inu Price Prediction and Trends Recent data shows that SHIB has seen fluctuations over the past month. The current Shiba Inu price prediction reports a slight dip, but increased whale activity may signal a turn around soon. Technical indicators point to a potential rebound if the market finds a steady base. Analysts who follow Shiba Inu price prediction note that heavy selling by whales may soon turn to accumulation. Some Shiba Inu price prediction reports show that if whales buy more, SHIB could recover and even grow by 97.14% to $0.00002562 by March 28. The coin still enjoys a vibrant community and strong online interest, which many believe will help its price bounce back.

Several positive indicators suggest a rise toward the $5,000 ETH price level. However, the path to this success faces challenges because experts predict Remittix (RTX) will perform better than Ethereum's most ambitious expectations. Retesting a Multi-Year Ascending Support Ethereum has displayed strong resistance over the years. Previous market surges of more than 1,400% and 270% from this technical structure have occurred following the LUNA collapse and the Bybit hack events. Observers of Ethereum's bullish sentiment have valid reasons to be optimistic due to the historical reliability of this trendline despite current market skepticism. This strong level serves as a launchpad which allows Ethereum to generate a positive technical indicator. Analysts predict that ETH overcoming mid-$2,000 resistance zones would enable a quick rising trend towards $3,000, $4,000 or even $5,000. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported during March that whale accumulation of ETH experienced a substantial boost as big players purchased 120,000 Ether worth approximately $236 million throughout three days. Another whale bought approximately 7,000 ETH worth $13.8 million. The large whale purchases indicate widespread enthusiasm because investors small and large view Ethereum as a platform that will persist into the future. Analysts from Standard Chartered predict that ETH may reach $4,000 by 2025 regardless of their previous $10,000 projection. The Road to $5K: Resistance Levels Ahead Despite the renewed optimism, Ethereum still faces stiff resistance at various price checkpoints. The price movement took ETH from 1,825 to 1,940 before reaching $2,061 but selling activity triggered a reversal below the $2,000 mark. The token is currently trading at $1,997. source: coingecko.com The price mechanics alone will not determine if or when ETH can begin its serious push for $5000 because broader market trends will also impact this situation. The crypto market experiences fluctuations driven by both macroeconomic factors and governmental changes that create quick changes in market sentiment. Why Remittix Could Outshine Ethereum’s Ambitions Remittix (RTX) has recently caught significant attention because researchers believe this project might generate superior returns than the upcoming Ethereum rally. Remittix has achieved a successful fundraising round that exceeded $14 million through selling 521 million coins at a price of $0.0734 each. This token addresses a worldwide market need of streamlining international payment systems which positions it to resolve problems affecting many global users while processing huge worldwide remittance flows. Remittix aims to reach an extensive market segment which Ethereum did previously when it established its blockchain applications during its early development phase. The company should succeed in delivering affordable digital remittance services supported by dependable performance to quickly acquire users from both retail and institutional client bases. RTX token prices should follow the pattern of initial Ethereum price growth during its period of rapid expansion. Remittix Holds the Real Key to Growth Despite Ethereum’s solid foundations supported by technology infrastructure and large investor presence there is still a chance new market entrants will seize a significant portion of investors' attention more quickly than Ethereum can achieve its potential $5,000 price target. Remittix(RTX) aims to transform the vast untapped remittance industry by focusing on a market that needs transformation. The main distinction between Remittix and Ethereum exists in its total dedication to address real-life problems rather than resolving consensus models or Layer-2 separation issues. Those who want to capitalize on upcoming crypto developments should consider investing in Remittixinstead of traditional Ethereum because the company represents exciting changes in blockchain technology.

TRX, which has recovered about 10% from its weekend low of $0.22; is still struggling with the $0.25 resistance level, last transferring at $0.232. Although during October prices rose but technical indicators suggest only weak buying as the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has not confirmed the recent price rise. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s almost-blank performance adds to the uncertainty, which could lead TRX to sink into a downward spiral. Investors are seeking alternatives as uncertainty surrounds the markets, and the decentralized lending ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been attracting significant interest, a sub-$0.05 token boasting presale momentum and a structured growth model. TRX’s Technical Ceiling Enhanced The inability of TRX to break through $0.25 is the result of two rejections at this psychological level. For weeks, the token has been stuck in an oscillation between $0.22 and $0.2745, where $0.248 is an obstinate point of resistance in the middle. Not even a swift 10% recovery on March 19th was enough to breach this ceiling, a sign that bullish conviction was waning. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains close to 50, indicating indecision, while liquidation heatmaps suggest $0.25 is a particularly high-risk area. A push toward this level TD maybe trigger the automated sell-off, bringing TRX back into its lower range. It risks being kicked out of the crypto elite if it fails to deliver a decisive breakout, analysts caution. Whales Shift Towards Presale Investments With TRX still stagnating, investors are diversifying into emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Phase 3 of its presale. Current token price of $0.02, growing to $4.5 million raised with over 6,400 holders and a massive +60% of Phase 3 tokens already claimed. Stage two will raise the price to $0.025 — a 25 percent increase — giving existing buyers an instant paper gain of 200 percent when it launches at $0.06. In addition to outlining their projections, analysts have predicted that with its revenue-sharing model and token buybacks, MUTM could be worth $3.50 or higher by late 2025. This potential 17,400% return stands in stark contrast to TRX’s stagnant outlook, which explains the accelerating capital shift. The Strategic Framework of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presents a self-reinforcing ecosystem. Its platform allows for decentralized lending, where users can deposit assets (such as ETH or stablecoins) in return for interest-yielding mtTokens. Some protocol fees go to automatic MUTM buybacks redistributing tokens to long-term stakers. This method minimizes the sell pressure while maintaining demand, creating a cycle of scarcity and appreciation. Moreover, the team is in the final stages of a smart contract audit with CertiK, a landmark step anticipated to enhance investor confidence. Results will be revealed through social channels, further aligning with Mutuum’s ethos around transparency. Timing the Presale Window The rapid sell-out in Phase 3 indicates urgency, with the $0.02 entry point evaporating with the tokens. By gaining early participation, investors can not only secure better rates but also prepare for the imminent launch, which will help pump the project’s visibility with listing exchanges. The project’s tokenomics — capped supply and buyback-driven scarcity — implies post-launch supply squeeze, a catalyst for rapid price discovery. For example, a $500 investment today could become $17,500 in junction price ($3.50) a potential if MUTM hits $3.50 — Something some compare to early adopters of Eth.

Its presale model and clear metrics such as the CertiK audit reduce speculative risk compared to memes and aged stalwarts. As to whales look for alternatives that can offer stability and exponential upside, MUTM´s sub-$0.05 valuation sets it up as the ideal entry point. Agility is the key to survival in the tireless evolution of the crypto market. TRX holders looking for diminishing returns now have a choice: stay in those for which returns are far from certain in 2025, or migrate to where this decentralized finance will be in 2025. While Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to be open to investors, the dwindling of Phase 3 suggests hitting the brakes on access to the lowest pricing in the tranches.

As look toward 2025, three meme coins— Arctic Pablo Coin , Dogwifhat, and Ponke—are generating significant buzz. Each offers distinct narratives and potential for investors seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: Bridging Myth and Reality – One of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s an adventurous journey inviting investors to explore the world’s hidden mysteries. As one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo stands out with its unique blend of storytelling, financial potential, and an ever-growing community. At the heart of this project is the intrepid explorer Arctic Pablo, who embarks on expeditions to uncover mystical $APC coins. These shimmering tokens symbolize more than just currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity and potential, infused with the magic of forgotten lands. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo Coin is uniquely designed around Pablo’s travels. Instead of traditional stages, each presale phase is tied to a specific location, with the current being Nippy Nook, the 15th location. As of now, the price stands at $0.000079, with a final presale price set at $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008. This structure not only adds an element of storytelling but also creates a sense of anticipation and excitement among investors. If you’re lucky enough to join now, you could be looking at a return on investment (ROI) of 10,027.85% once the coin hits the listing price of $0.008—just one of the reasons why it’s considered among the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Investing in Arctic Pablo offers significant potential returns. For instance, a $500 investment would yield approximately 6,328,430.00 APC tokens. Upon reaching the listing price of $0.008, this investment could balloon to $50,627.44 showcasing an impressive return on investment. With such high-profit potential, it’s no surprise that APC is gaining attention as one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. A deflationary mechanism is also in place, where unsold tokens are burned at the end of each week during the presale. This approach reduces the total supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens and fostering a deflationary environment. Arctic Pablo has strategically chosen the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for its robust platform, ensuring efficient and secure transactions. The project’s tokenomics are well-structured, with a total maximum supply of 221,200,000,000 APC tokens, allocated across presale, staking, ecosystem development, community rewards, and the team. In essence, Arctic Pablo combines an engaging narrative with solid financial incentives, making it a compelling choice for those seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Dogwifhat: The Viral Sensation in the Solana Ecosystem Dogwifhat (WIF) has become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, riding the wave of hype and community-driven momentum. With a market cap exceeding $500 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $248 million, WIF continues to capture the attention of traders and meme coin enthusiasts alike. As the crypto market sees renewed interest in meme coins, Dogwifhat’s impressive rally and cult-like following make it a standout contender. With its viral appeal and growing liquidity, many investors are eyeing WIF as a potential high-reward play in the ever-evolving meme coin landscape. The success of Dogwifhat can be attributed to its strong community engagement and viral marketing strategies. Leveraging social media platforms, the project has created a buzz that resonates with Gen Z and Millennials, particularly in Australasia. Memes, challenges, and interactive content have fueled its popularity, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a cultural phenomenon. Ponke: The Underdog with Growing Momentum Ponke (PONKE) is a rapidly emerging meme coin on the Solana blockchain, boasting a market cap of $56.5 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $10.68 million. With a total and max supply of 555.55 million tokens, Ponke has demonstrated impressive volatility, surging over 4,411% from its all-time low of $0.002254. Despite an 87.9% decline from its all-time high of $0.8409, the coin maintains strong momentum, backed by an active community and viral social media presence. The project thrives on user engagement, offering features like the “helmet” utility for its holders and leveraging influencer-driven hype. With increasing liquidity and exchange listings, Ponke continues to position itself as a top contender in the meme coin space, drawing comparisons to major players like PEPE and DOGE. Ponke’s appeal lies in its community-centric approach. The project has cultivated a loyal following by engaging users through interactive campaigns, meme contests, and collaborations with influencers. This strategy has not only increased its visibility but also fostered a sense of ownership and participation among holders.

Right now, it’s at Nippy Nook, the 15th location, with a presale price of $0.000079. The price increases every week, and unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, and the listing price is set at $0.008, offering massive upside potential. 3. Is Dogwifhat (WIF) still a good investment in 2025?

After the presale, any remaining unsold tokens will also be burned, making the tokenomics even stronger for long-term holders. The post Low Price, High Gains!

The start of 2025 has been troubling, particularly in Europe, where Tesla saw a 45% drop in new registrations in January compared to the same period in 2024, with further declines in February. While the sales rose by 21% in the UK and Australia, shipments of Chinese-made cars in China fell by more than 49%. In March, a Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, Joseph Spak, published a research note predicting a decrease of 5% in Tesla’s sales around the world. Despite the 10% growth expectations, Spak’s forecast triggered a negative reaction in the stock market, causing Tesla’s share price to drop. There can be many other reasons for the fall in Tesla sales. People working with Tesla already expected this drop as the company headed toward the launch of the new Model Y with customers waiting for the latest version. However, research by Morning Consult Intelligence, a brand monitoring firm, says that Musk’s actions have harmed Tesla significantly in Europe and Canada. It also acknowledges the Chinese market remains crucial for Tesla’s success despite the backlash elsewhere. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. In the U.S., the situation seems a bit more complicated. Sure, a lot of consumers seem to be on board with DOGE cuts in government spending. But there’s a catch, “Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.” Tesla’s problems go way beyond how the public views Musk. Prof. Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University’s Centre for Automotive Industry Research told BBC “We’ve not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.” The competition is coming from all directions. Traditional carmakers have been pouring money into electric vehicles, with companies like Kia and Hyundai building a strong reputation for reliable, high-quality EVs. Meanwhile, China is making serious moves. Brands like BYD are expanding rapidly by offering well-performing cars at affordable prices. And then you have higher-end players like Xpeng and Nio, which are all about luxury and advanced tech. Judging from Musk’s comments during Tesla’s earnings calls, he seems much more focused on the robotaxi vision than anything else. Back in January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service up and running in Texas by June. But skeptics were quick to respond, pointing out that Musk has been making these kinds of promises for years. In 2019, he said that within a year, there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of working as robotaxis. Yet Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” package still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and stay alert. “Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,” says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Tesla needs solid leadership, but Musk’s hands are clearly full. Apart from running Tesla, Musk is also deeply involved in his social media platform X, artificial intelligence firm xAI, and SpaceX, which has had a couple of setbacks with its massive Starship rocket recently. When Fox Business asked him how he was managing all these responsibilities, Musk admitted it was “with great difficulty.” “It’s hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,” says Prof. Wells. “If he’s making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.” Despite all this, Musk’s position at Tesla seems untouchable. He’s the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 13% of the stock, which is worth over $95 billion. That’s nearly the same amount held by investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock combined. Other financial players like State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley also have smaller stakes. Sure, Tesla’s recent drop in share price probably wasn’t fun for those investors. But if you look at the big picture, the stock is still about 30% higher than it was a year ago. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. Musk should hand over Tesla to new leadership. Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings. That’s way higher than other car companies like Ford, General Motors, or Toyota. And the reason? Shareholders are still banking on Tesla’s technological breakthroughs and explosive growth. For now, none of the big investors are calling for major changes. But Ross Gerber, a longtime shareholder who’s turned into one of Musk’s most outspoken critics, recently said Musk should step down. Analysts tend to agree that a leadership change could be beneficial. “A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,” says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. “It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.” Prof. Wells adds, “I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalize the business. It needs a significant change of direction now.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

For the first time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are officially recognized in global economic reports. However, this sparked a wave of discussion in the crypto community where many claimed that the IMF had referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold.”This quickly caught the attention of many in the space, fueling debates and speculation across social media. However, Dennis Porter, a well-known voice in the space, quickly questioned this interpretation, asking, “Can anyone point to exactly where the IMF says Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’?” Dennis Clarifies The Confusion After diving into the IMF’s statement , Dennis clarified the source of the confusion. The IMF actually referred to Bitcoin as a “new digital asset designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” Ok I’ve tracked down why people are claiming the IMF said Bitcoin is digital gold. “new digital assets designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” This is a massive stretch to jump to: “IMF says bitcoin is digital gold”. The key phrase is… https://t.co/2bWMbIdRgK pic.twitter.com/wEm7ht62CZ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) March 23, 2025 He remarked that the phrase “designed to be” is crucial here and it doesn’t necessarily mean that the IMF is officially endorsing Bitcoin as “digital gold” or guaranteeing its stability or value like gold. It’s more about recognizing Bitcoin’s potential, not confirming it as a proven asset. The “store of value” idea for Bitcoin is debated due to its volatility. Unlike gold, which has a long history of stability, Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. IMF Provides Guidelines on Tracking Digital Assets The IMF’s latest update to the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) now includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in its global economic framework. This is the first time the IMF has provided clear guidelines on how digital assets should be tracked in global financial stats, marking a big step for crypto in the financial world. Cryptos like Bitcoin are classified as non-productive capital assets, while stablecoins are treated as financial instruments. The update also changes how cross-border crypto transactions, staking, and mining are tracked, with mining and staking now recorded as services in a country’s computer services exports/imports. This update is a big step in officially recognizing digital assets as part of the global economy, helping to track and regulate them better in the future.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 01:42:36

One of the tokens currently drawing interest from both early-stage investors and analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While still in its presale phase, the protocol has already gained traction—not just for its fundraising numbers but for the potential upside that experts say could carry it all the way to the $1 mark. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that emphasizes non-custodial control and real on-chain functionality. The idea is simple: users deposit their crypto assets into liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers can access those funds by providing overcollateralized assets. All of this happens through smart contracts, with no need for intermediaries, and complete transparency at every step. What separates Mutuum from many early-stage tokens is the level of focus on functionality. The platform is set up to allow both passive earners and borrowers to engage in DeFi in a way that doesn’t compromise ownership. Lenders receive mtTokens in return for their deposits, which not only represent their share in the pool but also increase in value over time as interest accrues. These mtTokens are ERC20-compliant and can be transferred, traded, or used in other DeFi applications—offering flexibility for users who want more than just a locked position. Another key feature is the upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted directly through the Mutuum lending protocol, allowing users to access liquidity without selling their original assets. It adds another layer of utility while reinforcing demand for the platform itself. Since interest from these stablecoin loans feeds directly into the protocol’s treasury, it also supports long-term stability and value growth for the ecosystem. So why are experts increasingly bullish on MUTM’s price potential? A few reasons stand out. First, the presale momentum has been impressive—Mutuum has already raised over $4.5 million, and more than 6,300 holders have joined the project during its early stages. Currently, in Phase 3, the token is priced at $0.02 and will launch at $0.06. That alone offers early investors a 3x return out of the gate. But more than that, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform around the time the token goes live. This is critical because it means the token’s utility won’t be based on future promises—it will be tied to an active product from day one. That alignment between launch and functionality is a major reason why many in the crypto space believe MUTM isn’t just another presale token—it’s a DeFi protocol with room to scale. Shortly after its launch, analysts expect the token to trade between $0.21 and $0.28, already showing strong price movement. But in the weeks that follow, projections go even further. Experts suggest that MUTM will reach $1 as the platform gains more traction and user adoption increases. For those buying in at the current $0.02 price, this would represent a 50x return—a rare opportunity in today’s more competitive and cautious market. The presale is expected to sell out quickly, especially given how fast earlier phases have progressed. With strong early adoption, clear communication from the team, and real utility backing the token, the demand isn’t surprising. It’s not just hype that’s driving attention—it’s the structure, the timing, and the execution. As more eyes turn to the DeFi space in search of projects that combine usability with growth, Mutuum Finance is making its case. With key milestones approaching and a working product on the horizon, the $1 prediction doesn’t feel out of reach—it feels like a matter of time.

For BDAG, March brings several powerful shifts that strengthen its long-term future. Beta Testnet Arrives in March The beta testnet goes live this month, offering the first full test of BlockDAG’s parallel chain setup. Compared to slower platforms like Ethereum, BDAG’s design handles high traffic without delays. Backed by SpaceDev This partnership is more than a tech move. SpaceDev will support BDAG with advanced upgrades, aiming to improve system strength and user adoption. HackerEarth Hackathon Launched BlockDAG aims to grow a large developer base. Through major hackathons, it is bringing in global Web3 talent to create useful apps that will raise BDAG’s demand. Third Keynote Update After the success of the last two, the upcoming Keynote 3 is expected to unveil new roadmap plans. Previous keynotes have always sparked fresh interest—and this one could have a greater effect. Early BDAG Buyers Have Strong Return Potential Let’s look at the expected returns with clear numbers. BDAG sells for $0.0248 in batch 27. Some experts believe BDAG could reach $1 after it goes live—a 40x gain. Putting in $1,000 today would get roughly 40,000 BDAG. If BDAG reaches $1, that turns into $40,000. This reminds many of Solana, which started near $0.22 and jumped above $250. BDAG may follow a similar track but with quicker growth signals. Key Factors That May Push BDAG to $1 Over 10 CEX Listings—Access to major exchanges means more people can trade, pushing demand up. Limited Supply Structure—BDAG’s setup limits supply, so higher demand could drive price increases. Growing Crowd Interest—Both large-scale and casual buyers are getting involved, and broader attention could lift prices quickly. Final Words! Big updates this month give BDAG an edge, but the highest returns are likely for those who act early. The beta testnet, strong technical support, and near-future listings all signal major changes ahead. Waiting might mean paying 5x, 10x, or even 20x more per coin. For those watching closely, this could be the time BDAG breaks through—like Solana or Avalanche once did.

Qubetics Presale is Your Next Big Chance—Get in on the Top Altcoin Presale of 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-cashs-boom-qubetics-presale-is-your-next-big-chance-get-in-on-the-top-altcoin-presale-of-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has been an absolute rollercoaster lately. From Bitcoin hitting new highs to altcoins skyrocketing with innovative tech, it’s been a non-stop adventure. But here’s the kicker: not everyone caught the early train to profit-town. Whether it was too much uncertainty or simply missing the boat, opportunities have been missed, and some are left scrambling. If you’re feeling like you missed your shot at a big payday with some altcoins, you’re not alone. The truth is, many people passed on Bitcoin Cash, and now it’s too late to scoop up a massive return on that one. But don’t sweat it – there’s a new kid on the block. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently going through an exciting presale phase, and the buzz surrounding this project is something you don’t want to sleep on. Its presale is already in its 27th stage, and the response has been insane. Over 502 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $15.3 million with 23,500+ holders jumping on board. With analysts predicting massive returns after the presale, Qubetics might just be the chance to turn missed opportunities into winning ones. So, let’s dive in and take a look at why Qubetics is the altcoin presale that’s too good to ignore. Bitcoin Cash Coin: A Missed Opportunity Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its time to shine. Back in 2017, it was one of the top contenders to become the go-to digital currency for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin due to disagreements over scaling solutions, and its goal was clear: make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. For a while, it seemed like BCH could potentially overtake Bitcoin itself, with many crypto enthusiasts touting it as the future of digital cash. However, as time passed, it became clear that Bitcoin Cash couldn’t quite live up to the hype. Its use case, while solid, didn’t evolve fast enough. Competing technologies like Ethereum and newer platforms started to steal the spotlight with their smart contract capabilities and scalability solutions. The market began to see Bitcoin Cash as a “nostalgic” crypto option, more of a historical token than a futuristic one. While BCH still has its place in the market, the window for massive gains is largely closed. It’s a missed opportunity for those who couldn’t jump on board when it was hot. In the crypto space, timing is everything. A few years ago, Bitcoin Cash had the potential for massive returns, but now, for the average crypto enthusiast, it’s like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. There are new projects on the horizon, and many are more innovative, adaptable, and prepared for the future of crypto than BCH ever was. And here’s where Qubetics comes in: it’s offering something Bitcoin Cash never could – real-world applications and huge ROI potential that’s far from tapped out. Qubetics: Still Available and Ready for Action You’ve probably heard whispers about Qubetics ($TICS), and now it’s time to get the lowdown. Right now, this altcoin is in the 27th stage of its presale, and analysts are hyping it up for good reason. As of now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300 per token. The presale is raking in serious money, with over $15.3 million raised and more than 23,500 holders jumping on board. But here’s the thing: there’s still time to get in early, and the price is expected to explode. The real kicker with Qubetics is the sheer promise it holds. Unlike many altcoins that are all talk and no action, Qubetics is set to revolutionize the world of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT). In simple terms, Qubetics is aiming to take real-world assets – like real estate, commodities, and even artwork – and tokenize them on the blockchain. This means individuals and businesses can buy, sell, and trade ownership in things like properties and valuable assets with the transparency and security of blockchain technology. So, what does this mean for everyday folks? Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to raise capital but don’t want to deal with the headaches of traditional financing methods. With Qubetics, you could tokenize your business’s assets, making it easier to access funding while providing more security and potential for future growth. Or think about the average person who wants to own a piece of luxury real estate but doesn’t have the full cash flow to buy a property outright. Qubetics lets them purchase fractional ownership in that property through tokenization. No more waiting for a miracle investment opportunity – Qubetics offers an affordable, secure, and efficient way to make significant investments possible for everyone. Now, consider the massive return potential of $TICS. Analysts predict that after the presale, the token could skyrocket to $1, giving early adopters a 669% ROI. But that’s not all – experts are predicting it could hit $5 post-presale, offering a jaw-dropping 3745% ROI. And the best part? Once the mainnet launches, the $TICS token could go as high as $15, offering a mind-blowing 11,436% return. The presale is moving fast, so if you’re still sitting on the sidelines, it’s time to get serious about your crypto future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025: Qubetics is the One So, let’s face it – there are a ton of cryptos out there, and it can be tough to pick the right one to buy in 2025. From DeFi projects to meme coins, there’s no shortage of choices. But here’s the thing: not all of them have staying power. Many coins will fizzle out or fail to deliver on their promises. When it comes to identifying which altcoin presale is the real deal, it’s all about finding a project with a solid use case, scalability, and massive upside potential. That’s where Qubetics checks all the boxes. Think about it: the crypto space has seen some solid growth, but it’s still stuck in a lot of legacy thinking. Traditional investment options, like real estate, haven’t evolved to the same degree. The world is shifting toward tokenization, and Qubetics is right at the forefront of that shift. What makes this project stand out from others in the crypto presale space is its potential to solve real-world problems. Tokenizing assets like real estate and luxury goods isn’t just an idea; it’s a tangible solution that’s going to change the way people think about ownership and investment. Qubetics isn’t just some moonshot – it’s a project that addresses actual pain points in the global economy. People have been craving solutions to fractional ownership, transparency, and liquidity in the asset space, and Qubetics is answering that call. And when it comes to the presale, there’s still time to grab $TICS at a low price before it potentially shoots up after the mainnet launch. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Qubetics Presale If you’ve been sleeping on the idea of getting involved in a top altcoin presale , Qubetics ($TICS) is the one to wake up to. With its revolutionary approach to Real World Asset Tokenization, it’s positioning itself to be a major player in 2025 and beyond. The presale is in full swing, with over $15 million raised, and the $TICS token price is expected to soar once the presale ends. Analysts predict massive returns, and with real-world use cases that solve actual problems, there’s no reason to sit this one out. Now’s the time to act. Qubetics is poised for a breakout, and missing out on this presale could mean missing a huge opportunity. So, jump in while the price is still low, and don’t let another top altcoin presale slip through your fingers.

The scam involved the fraudsters contacting victims and earning trust before directing them to websites masquerading as legitimate crypto investment platforms, Virginia’s Eastern District US Attorney’s Office said in a March 21 statement. Once victims made a deposit, the funds were funneled through over 75 bank accounts under the names of shell companies, then sent abroad “deceptively characterized” as domestic wires, despite being transferred to a bank outside the US. Source: US Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Virginia “The sites falsely represented to the victims that their investments were making sizeable gains,” Virginia’s US Attorney’s Office added in its statement. “When victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The United States Secret Service seized some of the stolen funds from a foreign bank in 2023 and began the civil forfeiture action by filing a claim in a US District Court. However, the bank also made a claim against the cash, and the US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the seized funds. Victims of the scam have been urged to contact the Secret Service to petition to recover their losses.

Gordon added that a cut could sway people to put their savings into shares of local companies, which could then spark other firms to go public in the UK and help the economy. In comparison, she called crypto “a non-productive asset” that “doesn’t feed back into the economy.” “Equities provide growth capital to companies that employ people, innovate and pay corporation tax. That is a social contract. We shouldn’t be afraid of advocating for that.” The country’s Financial Conduct Authority said in November that crypto ownership rose to 12% of adults, equivalent to around 7 million people. A majority of crypto owners, 36%, were under the age of 55 years old. Gordon said that many had “shifted to saving rather than investing,” which she claimed “is not going to fund a viable retirement.” A 2022 FCA survey found that 70% of adults had a savings account, while 38% either directly held shares or held them through an account allowing nearly 20,000 British pounds ($26,000) of tax-free savings a year — around three in four 18-24 years olds held no investments. A quarter of 18-25 year olds and a third of 25-44 year olds held any investment in 2022. Source: FCA But in a follow-up survey, the regulator reported that in the 12 months to January 2024, the cost of living crisis had seen 44% of all adults either stop or reduce saving or investing, while nearly a quarter used savings or sold their investments to cover day-to-day costs. Gordon is a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, a group of industry executives aiming to revive the local market, which Cavendish would benefit from as it advises companies on how to navigate possible public offerings. Related: Will new US SEC rules bring crypto companies onshore? Consulting giant EY reported in January that the London stock market had one of its “quietest years on record,” with just 18 companies listing last year, down from 23 in 2023. At the same time, EY said 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, with many saying they moved due to “declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to other markets” such as the US. However, Gordon claimed the UK is a “safe haven” compared to markets such as the US, which has lost trillions of dollars in its stock markets due to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a recession. Crypto markets have also slumped alongside US equities, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading down 11% over the past 30 days and struggling to maintain support above $85,000 since early March. In the past 24 hours, at least, Bitcoin is up 2%, trading around $85,640.

In 2022, the Treasury blacklisted Tornado Cash for its role in laundering $455 million stolen by the Lazarus hacking group. The Move Sparks Criticism From Grewal But the move has sparked strong backlash. In a latest X post, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has publicly criticized the U.S. Treasury for its handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting. He argues that the Treasury is wrongly trying to avoid a final court decision. Grewal is criticizing the U.S. Treasury for continuing legal actions against Tornado Cash, even after it was removed from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The Treasury now claims that a final court decision is unnecessary, but Grewal argues that this is against legal procedures. Relying on that decision, the Fifth Circuit rejected an agency’s argument that its withdrawal of a determination “unilaterally and avoid judicial review” did not moot the case, because the agency could decide to revisit the decision and issue a similar determination against the… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 23, 2025 He shared that this is only valid if the defendant can prove the issue won’t happen again. He also mentioned past cases where sanctions were lifted but the case stayed open, allowing them to be reimposed later. “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” noted Grewal. Grewal’s criticism comes during a long legal battle where Tornado Cash users challenged the Treasury’s decision to add the mixer to the SDN list. The users argued that the smart contract didn’t qualify as property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because it’s non-erasable. Although the court sided with the users, clarifying the status of the Tornado’s smart contract, despite this, Grewal criticized the Treasury for not fully following the court’s ruling. Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation Back Tornado Cash Tornado Cash has been supported by groups like Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation, which are backing lead developer Alexey Pertsev’s defense. The legal battle has been intense, with supporters claiming the Treasury’s actions were unfair and lacked clear legal grounds. Lifting the sanctions against Tornado Cash is an important step in the ongoing debate over how crypto mixers should be regulated. The Treasury lifted them after reviewing legal issues but still expressed concern over North Korea’s use of digital assets for hacking and money laundering.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 02:53:54

The Federal Reserve signaled in its March 18-19 meeting that it would also “look past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing,” Thielen added. “Powell’s mildly dovish tone suggests that the Fed's put remains intact, providing further support for a recovery in stock prices.” 10x Research’s Bitcoin reversal indicators have turned bullish as a result, with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 21-day moving average now at $85,200, Thielen noted. Bitcoin’s bottoming formations over the last two years. Source: 10x Research He said these weekly reversal indicators have pulled back to levels where past bull markets have resumed, such as in September 2023 — spurred on by the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund narrative — and August 2024 as the US election neared. “In short, the technical backdrop has now reset to a point where a renewed uptrend could plausibly unfold.” Thielen also noted that several altcoins are already breaking out of their downtrend channels and trading at more “attractive levels.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,720, up 2.1% over the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ), Tron ( TRX ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) have rebounded 4.3%, 6.4% and 8.9% respectively over the last week. The crypto research analyst, however, expects to see “significant resistance” at the $90,000 mark for Bitcoin, should it reach that level. Despite the more positive outlook, “no clear catalyst exists for an immediate parabolic rally” is in sight, Thielen said. Related: Bitcoin ‘in position’ for first key RSI breakout in 6 months at $85K He initially said Bitcoin wouldn’t drop below $73,000 — thereby avoiding a “deep bear market” — because the largest sum bracket of Bitcoin holders (wallets with 100-1000 Bitcoin) are likely family offices and wealth managers who are invested in Bitcoin for the long term. He also noted that the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs returned inflows for the first time last week since the last week of January. “We expect Bitcoin ETF selling from arbitrage-focused investors to wind down, as the arbitrage opportunities have primarily been closed for weeks,” Thielen added.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , Nabiullina told journalists at a press conference that she wants to “ban settlements made in cryptocurrencies between residents” outside the so-called experimental legal regime (ELR). Russian Crypto Ban – Still on the Table? The ELR, policed by the Central Bank, is a regulatory sandbox that the bank uses to allow certain Russian firms to buy and sell goods, using crypto as a payment tool. The Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking to journalists on March 21, 2025. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) The bank also appears to want to use the ELR as a mechanism for Russian crypto miners to sell their coins to global buyers. In recent days, the bank has suggested that it is prepared to allow “qualified investors” to trade crypto within the confines of the sandbox . But Nabiullina’s recent comments suggest she has lost none of her famous crypto-skepticism . The long-serving Governor has previously called for total bans on crypto exchanges and token trading . The bank even drafted a bill calling for a total ban on all forms of crypto trading and ownership, as well as crypto mining. Sanctions regimes have forced her to change her stand, however. With Russian companies and banks forced out of the SWIFT messaging network and dollar-denominated trade, many companies now use tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to trade with overseas partners.

These echo her previous calls to keep “private cryptocurrencies” out “of the Russian economy.” The Russian Central Bank. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) ‘Criminal Liability’ Nabiullina told journalists that Moscow should introduce criminal “liability” for anyone caught “violating the ban.” “We maintain our old position that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed as a means of payment. So we propose introducing a ban on settlements in cryptocurrencies between residents [of Russia] outside the ELR. We don’t only propose introducing a ban, but also establishing liability for violating the ban.” Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina Nabiullina claimed, however, that “it was time to take a step forward” in “relations with cryptocurrencies.” She said that Moscow must “build a regulatory environment” that would give “particularly qualified” investors the right to “invest in cryptocurrencies on the Russian market.” In recent days, some have suggested that the ELR could team up with the Moscow Exchange to launch crypto trading products for these “particularly qualified” investors.

The Russian state-run media agency TASS reported that the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Alexander Shokhin, wants the government to “analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies” after US President Donald Trump’s decision to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Shokhin said: “It seems that it has been agreed [in Moscow] that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements. After Trump said that the US will now become the crypto capital of the world and started accumulating crypto reserves – at least in Ethereum and Bitcoin – we also need to look at this somehow.” Alexander Shokhin, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. (Source: Moscow Financial Forum/YouTube/Screenshot) However, these comments will likely fall on deaf ears at the Central Bank. Nabiullina has previously stated that she “does not see any circumstances under which” cryptoassets “could end up in the reserves of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.” The Ministry of Finance, however, has expressed a more cautiously optimistic stance on the matter .

By March 14, 2025, XRP is being exchanged at around $2.31. Despite the fact that experts are very positive about the prospects of its future, the highest price scale forecast varies from $3.40 to $15, and the situation in which as impressive a rally as that of 2017 would take place again seems very far away. .

According to a Mar. 23 press release , Titan operates as a layer above standard DEX aggregators like Jupiter ( JUP ) and DFlow. To ensure traders receive the best price with no fees, it aggregates quotes from all available DEX aggregators rather than just sourcing liquidity from different DEXs. In addition to aggregation , Titan introduces Talos, a proprietary routing algorithm that, according to the press release, outperforms competitors 80% of the time. Compared to current Solana ( SOL ) solutions, Talos analyzes more liquidity sources and optimizes routing at a granular level to enhance trade execution. Quote slippage caused by execution delays is a major problem with on-chain swaps. Because Solana transactions take around 10 seconds (25 blocks) to complete, the price may fluctuate before the trade is executed. Titan wants to address this issue by continuously updating quotes in real-time to provide traders with the most accurate pricing. “Titan’s aim is to provide DeFi traders with the best possible prices while abstracting away the complexity involved. Today, crypto trading lags behind traditional markets in its order placement design. It’s time for us to upgrade our infrastructure and close this gap, and that’s what Titan is designed to do.” — Chris Chung, CEO and co-founder of Titan You might also like: Solana ETF set to debut in the U.S Titan previously raised $3.5 million in a September 2024 pre-seed round, backed by Round13 Digital Asset Fund and Beluga Labs. Solana is seeing record adoption alongside Titan’s launch. According to Ali Charts Mar. 22 post on X, the network now has over 11 million wallets holding SOL. Solana continues to lead in DEX trading volume , which hit a record $258 billion in January before cooling off to $105 billion in February amid a broader market downturn. Impressively, the stablecoin market cap on the network has grown to $12.36 billion, a three times increase from December 2024, according to DefiLlama data . Despite this growth, SOL’s price has seen volatility. It peaked at $298.31 in January before dipping to $118 on Mar. 11. The price has rebounded to $133 as of press time. With rising institutional interest, analysts speculate SOL could push toward the $300 mark in the coming months.

The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made its decisions, and the long-running XRP lawsuit was finally resolved, bringing relief to the community. However, the Pi Network faced some tough challenges. The migration and Know Your Customer (KYC) process are now complete, but many users were unable to claim their tokens. As a result, Pi fell behind the market, leading to doubts about whether now is a good time to buy. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi was the worst performer last week, losing more value than the rest. A big blow came when Binance refused to list Pi. They stated that any token not listed on the Binance Smart Chain is not eligible for a vote, disqualifying Pi from consideration. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? The Pi token dropped below the $1 mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3 following its Open Network launch on February 20. It hit the lows of around $0.70, leaving many investors uncertain about the future. However, it has now bounced back, trading at around $0.96. Despite the downturn, analysts are spotting potential for a rebound and there are signs that a breakout could happen. If the support level holds strong, Pi could push back toward $2. The trading volume saw an initial spike but later declined, showing that sellers are currently in control, weakening the momentum of buyers. Ater a 3% drop, the price is approaching the critical $0.70 support level, and if this breaks, it could lead to further drops, potentially down to $0.50 or $0.10.

While some users are taking profit, others are adding more coins, expecting another price rally. Even with market dips, digital assets have often bounced back. However, only a few manage to recover fully. Picking coins with solid use, high trading volumes, and strong tech backing can help in the long run. Based on market study and performance, five top bullish cryptos to buy now are Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and BlockDAG. These coins show strong signs of growth. Let’s explore what makes each one stand out and how they could offer high returns. BlockDAG: Record-Breaking Presale with Huge ROI Potential By using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure instead of a typical blockchain, BlockDAG (BDAG) handles many transactions at once. This leads to faster and smoother operations. Its structure offers more safety and better scaling compared to others. These features place it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Its presale is seeing massive support, with over $205 million raised and more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently, in Batch 27, the coin trades at $0.0248—jumping 2,380% from its $0.001 starting price. The quick sales show growing interest. With more batches selling fast, the $600 million target seems close, making it one of the biggest presales in years. The referral plan gives users 5% cashback in USDT when buying through shared links. With no caps on earnings or time limits, people are using it to earn rewards while getting BDAG coins. This helps keep buying active and adds more support to BDAG’s rise as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Bitcoin: Key Player with Strong Market Role As the earliest digital currency, Bitcoin still leads with its tight network security and known role as a value holder. Though prices go up and down, its supply cap and name value keep it in demand. News of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan could affect future price changes. Bitcoin also plays a role in money transfers and shields from rising costs. Though newer tech options exist, Bitcoin’s strong hold and network trust keep it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. BNB: Boosting DeFi Access and Trading Reach What began as Binance Coin has grown into a key part of the Binance system. It helps lower trading costs and unlocks special options on the platform. Beyond trading, BNB fuels dApps on Binance Smart Chain, offering quick service and low fees. New meme coins are gaining ground on BNB Chain, adding more use to the network. This boosts BNB’s status as a strong rival to Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi world. Because of its steady demand and wide reach, BNB holds a spot among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Solana: Fast Transactions Speeds Known for quick actions and cheap fees, Solana can handle thousands of steps every second. Its special Proof-of-History method gives it an edge in running smoothly and scaling well. Developers are turning to Solana thanks to its strong support for smart contracts and dApps. Even after network pauses, many still expect growth from Solana. There’s also talk of a spot ETF, which may boost its price. These signs make Solana one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Ethereum: Smart Contracts and Pectra Upgrade With strong use in smart contract building, Ethereum helps run many dApps today. Its shift to Proof-of-Stake in Ethereum 2.0 brings better speed and lower power use. This improves user and developer experience. The platform leads in DeFi and NFT growth, hosting thousands of active projects. While rivals like Solana and BNB grow, Ethereum’s strong base and planned Pectra changes help it keep its place. It stays one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Top Bullish Cryptos to Buy Now— Final Say! News of Bitcoin reserves, Ethereum’s Pectra update, BNB’s growing DeFi use, and Solana’s speed plus ETF hopes keep them among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Still, BlockDAG stands out with its fast-rising presale and broad use of DAG tech. With $205 million already raised and a target of $600 million, it’s setting new records. The DAG setup, high-speed power, and rewarding system help push BDAG ahead. It’s gaining attention from those who seek the top bullish cryptos to buy now for better returns.

Sonic, a rebranded high-speed blockchain, is moving ahead with the development of a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin despite lingering concerns following the Terra-Luna collapse. At the same time, Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser is predicting a shift toward gold-backed stablecoins, arguing they offer greater global trust and geopolitical neutrality than US dollar-pegged tokens. Sonic Blockchain Pushes Forward with High-Yield Algorithmic Stablecoin Amid Lingering Terra Ghosts The Sonic blockchain, a project that rebranded from the Fantom network and touts itself as the fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, is forging ahead with one of crypto’s most controversial innovations: an algorithmic stablecoin that promises yields of up to 23%. The bold move is reigniting conversations and concerns about the risks of such tokens, especially following the catastrophic collapse of TerraUSD (UST) nearly three years ago—a crisis that ushered in one of the longest crypto winters in history. The announcement came via Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs and founder of Yearn.finance, who revealed in a March 22 post on X that a proof-of-concept (POC) for the stablecoin was showing promising yield results. “POC looks good. Yielding > 200% APR @ 10m TVL, around 23.5% APR @ 100m, steady at around 4.9% at 1bn+. Will scale up and get team for a full release,” Cronje wrote. Despite his optimism, Cronje didn’t shy away from admitting the emotional burden associated with algorithmic stablecoins . Just one day earlier, he confessed to experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the fallout from Terra’s failure. “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement,” he added. Algorithmic stablecoins differ from fiat-backed stablecoins by using code-based mechanisms to maintain their peg to the US dollar or other fiat currencies. These mechanisms often rely on incentivizing traders or burning and minting partner tokens to maintain equilibrium. While elegant in theory, they have proven dangerous in practice. In May 2022, TerraUSD (UST), once a rising star in decentralized finance, lost its peg during a liquidity crisis that rapidly spiraled out of control. The token, which offered a tantalizing 20%+ APY through the Anchor Protocol, crashed from $1 to as low as $0.30. Its sister token, LUNA, used to help stabilize UST, saw a catastrophic collapse of over 98%, plunging from $120 to less than a dollar. The $40 billion implosion of the Terra ecosystem rattled the entire industry, tanking investor confidence and drawing the attention of global regulators. It also left investors—both retail and institutional—holding worthless tokens and prompted a wave of lawsuits and investigations into Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon. Unlike Terra, Sonic is attempting to address scalability and finality as foundational elements of its blockchain. The platform claims to be the fastest EVM chain, boasting a true 720 milliseconds (ms) finality—an industry record confirmed during its testnet launch on Sept. 8, 2024. Sonic’s revamped network has attracted considerable attention. Since rebranding from Fantom, its total value locked (TVL) has surged by 66% to $253 million. The network’s ability to finalize transactions faster than its competitors has positioned it as a promising infrastructure layer for high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps), including stablecoins. Now, with the development of a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin, Sonic is once again pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance—this time, in more dangerous waters. The move comes at a time when regulatory bodies are actively cracking down on algorithmic stablecoins. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation will effectively ban the issuance of such tokens in the bloc, specifically citing the need to avoid repeats of the Terra-Luna disaster. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and other global regulators have similarly taken a cautious stance, noting the lack of collateral backing and the systemic risks these coins can pose to broader crypto markets. Despite this, interest in algorithmic stablecoins hasn’t completely faded. Speculators continue to trade Terra’s resurrected LUNA token. This enduring appetite for risk sheds light on a key challenge facing projects like Sonic: the allure of high yields remains powerful, even as memories of devastating losses linger. Can Sonic Break the Algorithmic Curse? Sonic’s team believes their new algorithmic stablecoin is fundamentally different from its predecessors, with a more sustainable yield curve and enhanced mechanisms to avoid death spirals. The estimated yield decreases as more capital flows in, designed to maintain long-term equilibrium and reduce the reliance on overly generous incentive programs. However, with Cronje himself expressing hesitation and PTSD from the last cycle, even insiders recognize that the ghosts of Terra still haunt this sector. Whether Sonic’s version of an algorithmic stablecoin can survive where others have failed remains an open question. For now, all eyes are on the upcoming release as the industry holds its breath—again. Gold-Backed Stablecoins Poised to Challenge Dollar Dominance, Says Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser In related news, the battle for the future of digital money is heating up—and it may be fought not in Bitcoin or the US dollar, but in gold. According to Bitcoin maximalist and prominent financial commentator Max Keiser, gold-backed stablecoins are poised to overtake US dollar-pegged alternatives on the global stage due to gold’s inflation-hedging properties, minimal volatility, and geopolitical neutrality. In a series of recent statements, Keiser criticized the push by US lawmakers to preserve global dollar dominance through fiat-backed stablecoins. Instead, he predicted a coming wave of gold-backed digital tokens led by countries that oppose US financial hegemony. “Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a U.S. dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a gold one,” Keiser said, arguing that these nations see the dollar as a geopolitical weapon rather than a trusted reserve asset. “China and Russia have a combined 50,000 tonnes of gold — more than what is reported,” he added. Keiser’s comments bring attention to a growing ideological and strategic divide between Western and Eastern powers when it comes to the future of monetary systems. US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller, have recently emphasized the importance of stablecoins pegged to the dollar as tools for maintaining US financial influence abroad. At the March 7 White House Crypto Summit, Bessent announced that the Trump administration would make dollar-pegged stablecoin development a top national priority, citing the need to ”protect the dollar's reserve currency status” and prevent the global financial system from fragmenting into competing digital zones. In contrast, many foreign governments are exploring or already piloting alternatives, including stablecoins backed by hard assets such as gold. These efforts reflect growing resistance to dollar-centric financial infrastructure and the sanctions power it enables. The rise of gold-backed stablecoins like Tether’s Alloy (aUSD₮), launched in mid-2024, marks a significant shift in how value is being collateralized in the digital age. Alloy is backed by Tether’s XAU₮, a token that offers a claim to physical gold held in reserve. Gabor Gurbacs, founder of PointsVille and former VanEck executive, argued that XAU₮ represents a return to the sound money principles that underpinned the dollar before it was taken off the gold standard in 1971. “Tether Gold is what the dollar used to be before 1971,” Gurbacs noted in a March 19 post on X. “XAU₮ is up 15.7% year-to-date, while the broad crypto market is in the red. Foundations and businesses should hedge their holdings with XAU₮.” Indeed, XAU₮ recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by a historic rally in the global gold market amid fears of economic stagflation, geopolitical instability, and waning trust in central banks. Keiser and other critics argue that dollar-pegged stablecoins, while convenient, carry inherent political baggage. Since they are ultimately backed by dollar-denominated assets and often governed by US regulations, adversarial nations are unlikely to adopt them for large-scale cross-border transactions. The introduction of gold-backed alternatives, therefore, could allow countries like Russia, China, and Iran to participate in the digital economy without exposing themselves to US surveillance or sanctions. “Gold doesn’t come with a central bank or a central government,” Keiser pointed out. “It’s been money for 5,000 years, and that credibility is not something the dollar can easily replicate—especially not in the form of a token.” Lawmakers Push for Stablecoin Regulation Despite these geopolitical headwinds, US policymakers are pressing ahead with legislative efforts to support dollar-based stablecoins. The Stable Act of 2025 and the newly proposed GENIUS Stablecoin Bill aim to establish clear guidelines for issuance, reserve requirements, and regulatory oversight. Proponents argue that without such a framework, the US risks losing control over the most important financial innovation of the 21st century. They see dollar-pegged stablecoins as a necessary tool for preserving dollar supremacy in an increasingly multipolar world. However, the rise of gold-backed alternatives threatens to upend these plans. As more investors, corporations, and even governments begin to hedge with digital assets backed by physical gold, the appeal of fiat-pegged coins may diminish—especially in regions where trust in the US financial system is already eroding. The stablecoin market is approaching a critical inflection point. On one side is the US-led vision of regulated, fiat-pegged stablecoins tightly integrated into the existing financial system. On the other is an emerging movement toward decentralized, hard-asset-backed tokens that reject centralized control and seek to restore monetary neutrality. With gold-backed tokens like XAU₮ gaining traction and central banks worldwide accumulating bullion at record pace, the digital gold standard may no longer be a fringe idea—it could be the foundation of the next global monetary order. And as Max Keiser sees it, the race is already on.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|LUNA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 05:00:00

The $5.9t asset management heavyweight on Friday filed to tokenize a share class of its US Treasury money market fund on Ethereum, marking its first major move into asset tokenization. Its filing , submitted to the US SEC on March 21, outlines Fidelity’s plan to launch an “OnChain” share class of its $80m Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). The underlying assets — mainly US Treasury bills and cash — will stay in traditional custody. Investor share records, however, will also be logged on the Ethereum blockchain to improve transparency and traceability. The official ownership record will still be kept off-chain by Fidelity’s transfer agent. Blockchain entries will be reconciled with this official record on a daily basis. Source: US SEC TradFi Titans Embrace Tokenization to Modernize Markets Fidelity now joins a growing group of traditional finance giants exploring tokenization . Others in this space include BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. These firms see tokenization as a way to modernize financial infrastructure. It involves creating digital representations of real-world assets (RWAs) on a blockchain. The promise lies in real-time settlement, fractional ownership, improved transparency and broader access to financial products that were once difficult to reach. So far, that promise is catching on. According to data from rwa.xyz , the total market for tokenized US Treasuries has surged to $4.78b. Ethereum alone accounts for over $3.3b in value, far outpacing other blockchains like Stellar. BlackRock launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) just last year. It has already amassed $1.46b in tokenized assets. This shows that institutions are no longer just exploring blockchain. They are now actively building on it. Fidelity Experiments with Ethereum, Keeps Options Open Fidelity’s approach is cautious but deliberate. By keeping the core asset structure unchanged and only recording a secondary ledger on-chain, the firm can test blockchain benefits without disrupting regulatory compliance or investor expectations. The fund itself remains a conventional money market vehicle — focusing on capital preservation, income generation, and liquidity — but now with an optional tech-forward twist. Pending regulatory approval, the OnChain share class is expected to go live by May 30. Fidelity also noted that it may explore other blockchains beyond Ethereum in the future, signaling longer-term ambitions in the digital asset space.

The resolution has sparked optimism among XRP watchers, with analysts eyeing a potential climb to $10 by 2030, driven by regulatory clarity, the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and the possibility of a Ripple Labs IPO. Bitget’s Ryan Lee noted a breakout from the current trading range of $2.35 to $2.55 could lead to extensive moves in either direction. “Short-term price targets range from $2.00-$2.17 on the downside to $2.65-$3.00 on the upside,” Lee said, adding, “Long-term forecasts suggest $4.20-$10+ by 2030 if Ripple capitalizes on payment adoption, though $2.50 remains a pivotal level to watch for the next breakout or breakdown.” He attributed the medium-term range of $1.50-$5.89 to the SEC’s retreat and potential XRP ETF approvals, though technical indicators like a neutral RSI and bearish MACD suggest consolidation. The RSI, or relative strength index, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100, signaling overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions. MACD, or moving average convergence divergence, is a trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a price, with its signal line crossovers indicating bullish or bearish momentum shifts. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, added relatively lesser volatility in XRP’s price-action was a further sign of sentiment leaning bullish: “XRP has fared well under the past months’ crypto selloff and has room to potentially continue upward, though momentum can be lost if U.S. macroeconomic factors and tariffs disrupt the industry.” The forecasts come as IPO chatter is heating up, which Garlinghouse mentioned was “possible” in a Wednesday interview last week, providing further cues for bullish positioning.",Markets|XRP|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 05:03:38

Meanwhile, the US is exploring innovative ways to fund Bitcoin purchases by using revalued gold certificates. In the private sector, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is preparing for another major BTC acquisition after raising $711 million. Pakistan Joins Global Crypto Wave Pakistan is making a bold move toward embracing cryptocurrency after Bilal Bin Saqib, the CEO of the newly-formed Crypto Council, proposed the use of the country’s surplus energy to mine Bitcoin. This proposal was brought forward during the council’s inaugural meeting on March 21, which signaled a major shift in the country's stance on digital assets. The meeting gathered high-profile figures, including lawmakers, the governor of the Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and the federal IT secretary. The main goal of the initiative is to lay the groundwork for a robust crypto ecosystem in Pakistan, focusing on attracting foreign investment and establishing the nation as a major crypto hub. Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb praised the efforts, and stated that it was the start of a new digital era for the country, one that promotes transparency, economic empowerment, and technological leadership. This change in policy is especially interesting when considering the government's previously rigid opposition to cryptocurrencies. In May of 2023, then-Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha stated that crypto will never be legalized in Pakistan, due to concerns over anti-money laundering compliance under FATF guidelines. However, the tide turned on Nov. 4, 2024, when the government officially moved to regulate cryptocurrencies as legal tender. This was during the same time that elections were held in the United States. The global shift toward pro-crypto policies seems to have influenced Pakistan’s decision. After his re-election, President Donald Trump very quickly implemented several digital asset-friendly policies. On Jan. 23, 2025, he signed an executive order forming the Working Group on Digital Assets to explore broad regulatory reform. Donald Trump signing executive orders The same order also banned any government-led research or issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In another show of support, Trump signed another executive order in March of 2025 to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve along with a digital asset stockpile composed of US-origin cryptocurrencies. Pakistan’s pivot seems to align with this emerging international trend. US Gold to Bitcoin Plan Gains Momentum The Trump administration is also exploring creative, budget-neutral ways to expand the United States’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to Bo Hines , the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. On the Crypto in America podcast, Hines revealed that one of the most promising strategies under consideration involves using the government's undervalued gold certificates. These certificates are currently priced at a statutory value of $42.22 per troy ounce, which is much lower than the current market price of gold, which exceeds $3,000 per ounce. Hines referenced Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, which proposes revaluing these gold certificates to reflect their true market worth, thereby enabling the government to buy Bitcoin without it impacting taxpayers. The legislation recommends that Federal Reserve banks submit all outstanding gold certificates to the Treasury Secretary, who will then issue updated certificates based on the fair market value of the underlying gold. This mechanism could potentially unlock substantial funds for Bitcoin purchases, which certainly aligns with the Trump administration’s push for a strategic, fiscally responsible accumulation of digital assets. Currently, the US government holds approximately 207,000 BTC, primarily from seizures in criminal and civil cases. This makes it the largest known national holder of Bitcoin . According to Hines, the strategic reserve is being treated as a separate entity from the broader digital asset stockpile, a distinction driven by Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a commodity with no issuer and widely accepted status as a store of value. He stated that Bitcoin’s special status had been carefully defended by the administration, even as other digital assets were being considered for inclusion in the new national stockpile. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other officials agreed with this sentiment that Bitcoin occupies a privileged position in the administration’s digital asset framework. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also making legislative progress on crypto-related policies, with bipartisan momentum building behind a stablecoin bill and a broader crypto market structure bill. Representative Ro Khanna is very optimistic that both measures could be passed this year. Strategy Signals More BTC Ahead It is not only countries interested in gathering more Bitcoin. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at yet another potential Bitcoin purchase after the company’s recent capital raise through a preferred stock offering. In a post on X , Saylor shared a Bitcoin price chart with the caption “needs more orange,” teasing the possibility of another BTC acquisition once markets reopen. According to SaylorTracker, the company’s last purchase took place on March 17, when it bought 130 BTC for approximately $10.7 million. This brought its total holdings to 499,226 BTC. Although it was a relatively small buy compared to its previous acquisitions, it followed a brief two-week pause in activity. On March 21, Strategy announced the pricing of a new tranche of preferred stock , sold at $85 per share with a 10% coupon, expected to generate about $711 million in revenue. This capital infusion may set the stage for another large-scale Bitcoin purchase, which is consistent with the company’s long-term accumulation strategy. Michael Saylor is still one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, and he uses both financial and political channels to promote the asset. He also called for the US government to buy 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2035, when almost all of the 21 million coins will have been mined. He also published a proposal titled “A Digital Assets Strategy to Dominate the 21st Century Global Economy,” urging the government to adopt a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. At the recent Blockworks Digital Asset Summit, Saylor delivered his “21 Truths of Bitcoin” address, in which he placed a lot of emphasis on Bitcoin’s superiority over traditional commodities. He argued that gold continues to underperform the S&P Index and claimed that Bitcoin is the only non-garbage investment commodity in human history. Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Strategy saw some very impressive returns on its Bitcoin holdings. The company is currently sitting on more than $9.3 billion in unrealized gains, with its investment up more than 28%.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 05:10:03

Last week, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows for six consecutive days in a row showing strong resumption in demand. Additionally, corporate players like Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet have continued with their Bitcoin purchases. In the early trading hours in Aisa on Monday, Japan’s Metaplanet announced buying an additional 150 Bitcoin, taking its total holdings to 3,350 BTC. Earlier today, the company announced an investment of $12.6 million, for an average purchase price of $83,801 per BTC. The cumulative investment stands at approximately $278.8 million, averaging $83,224 per BTC. Notably, Metaplanet has achieved an impressive year-to-date BTC yield of 68.3%. Last week, Eric Trump joined Metaplanet’s board of advisers to take further its Bitcoin acquisition plans. Strategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor has also hinted at more BTC purchases coming ahead.

Investors are at a crossroads weather to invest, sell, or stay firm in the market. One expert blames it on a lack of education. Here’s an enigmatic eye-opener for those who are dealing with the fear of missing out. Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again made a strong case for why some people remain financially stagnant while others build wealth. According to him, it’s not just Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) that holds people back, but something deeper—Fear of Making Mistakes (FOMM). He argues that this fear keeps many from taking advantage of life-changing financial opportunities, particularly Bitcoin. Bitcoin: The Greatest Wealth Opportunity? Robert Kiyosaki believes that many people invest blindly, relying on social media, friends, or financial news instead of doing proper research. He warns that this mindset turns investing into gambling, increasing the risk of losses. Hence, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as one of the biggest wealth-building opportunities in history, yet he believes many will hesitate due to FOMM. He predicts that as Bitcoin crosses $200,000 , skeptics will say, “It’s too expensive,” just as they did when it was at $10,000, $20,000, and beyond. Meanwhile, those who understand its long-term value position themselves for generational wealth. The Importance of Learning From the Right People Rather than simply urging people to buy Bitcoin, Kiyosaki encourages learning from both supporters and critics to form an educated perspective. He follows well-known Bitcoin advocates like Michael Saylor , Samson Mow, Max Keiser, and Raoul Pal, while also advising people to listen to Bitcoin skeptics. A major point in Kiyosaki’s argument is that traditional education conditions people to avoid mistakes, equating errors with failure. He compares this to how babies learn to walk—through falling and trying again. If schools taught babies, he jokes, they’d never learn to walk. This, he believes, is why many highly educated people remain financially poor despite their intelligence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Boosts BTC Holdings to 3,350 with Latest Purchase , Education Is Free—Take Advantage of It Kiyosaki emphasizes that the best financial education doesn’t come from schools or Wall Street but from free resources like YouTube and independent thinkers. He urges people to take control of their financial learning rather than relying on outdated traditional education systems. President Trump shutting down the Department of Education. He is draining the swamp of filled with slithering Marxists. God bless him. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 6, 2025 Not all Agree With Him… Crypto Analyst CA Vivek Khatri pushes back against Kiyosaki’s view, arguing that poverty isn’t just about mindset but structural barriers. He points out that the poor often lack disposable income, work multiple jobs just to get by, and don’t have time or insider access to research investments. While Bitcoin made early adopters rich, he warns against selling false hope, emphasizing that not everyone can afford to take financial risks when survival is the priority. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In August 2022, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash after alleging the protocol helped launder crypto stolen by North Korean hacking crew the Lazarus Group , leading to a number of Tornado Cash users filing a lawsuit against the regulator. After a court ruling in favor of Tornado Cash, the US Treasury dropped the mixer from its sanctions list on March 21 , along with several dozen Tornado-affiliated smart contract addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, and has now argued “this matter is now moot.” Because Tornado Cash has been dropped from the sanctions list, the US Treasury Department argues there is no need for a final court judgment in the lawsuit. Source: Paul Grewal “Because this court, like all federal courts, has a continuing obligation to satisfy itself that it possesses Article III jurisdiction over the case, briefing on mootness is warranted,” the US Treasury said. However, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the Treasury’s hope to have the case declared moot before an official judgment can be made isn’t the correct legal process. “After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it,” he said. “Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant’s decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’” Grewal pointed to a 2024 Supreme Court ruling that found a legal complaint from Yonas Fikre, a US citizen who was put on the No Fly List, is not moot by taking him off the list because the ban could be reinstated again at a later date. Source: Paul Grewal “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” Grewal said. Six Tornado Cash users led by Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, with the support of Coinbase, sued the Treasury in September 2022 to reverse the sanctions under the argument that they were unlawful. Crypto policy advocacy group Coin Center followed through with a similar suit in October 2022 . In August 2023, a Texas federal court judge sided with the US Treasury, ruling that Tornado Cash was an entity that may be designated per OFAC regulations. On appeal, a three-judge panel ruled in November that Treasury’s sanctions against the crypto mixer’s immutable smart contracts were unlawful. US Treasury had a 60-day window to challenge the decision, which it did; however, the US court sided with Tornado Cash, overturning the sanctions on Jan. 21 and forcing the government agency to remove the sanctions by March. Related: US Treasury under Trump could take a different approach to Tornado Cash Its founders are still facing legal strife, however. The US charged Roman Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov in August 2023, accusing them of helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. Semenov is still at large and on the FBI’s most wanted list. Storm is free on a $2 million bond and expected to face trial in April. Meanwhile, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was released from prison after a Dutch court suspended his “pretrial detention” as he prepared to appeal his money laundering conviction.

According to analysts, XRP’s market dominance is painting a more bullish picture for the cryptocurrency in 2025. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend in market dominance since its peak in 2017. However, a recent break above this downward trend suggests a possible reversal. This could set XRP on a path to reclaiming higher market dominance, much like it did during the 2017 bull run. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , XRP’s price on the 3-day chart, the market is still showing signs of a bearish divergence. This suggests that any significant bullish movement is unlikely in the near future. Over the past few months, this pattern has continued, with only occasional small price increases that don’t lead to any major rallies. Support and Resistance Levels to Watch In the short-term, XRP has solid support around $2.24 to $2.30, with additional support between $1.95 and $2.05. On the resistance side, there is a significant level just above $2.60, with stronger resistance between $2.65 and $2.80, and another key level around $3. Sideways Movement Expected Currently, XRP’s price is mostly moving sideways, bouncing between support and resistance levels. This range-bound action has been ongoing for the last month, which results in relatively slow and uneventful price movement. While the price action may seem boring, there are still opportunities for profit if the right strategies are applied. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is XRP’s Price Not Going Up After the SEC Lawsuit Win? , What’s Next for XRP?

Investor buzz has surrounded Pepe Coin, Sui, Litecoin, and a revolutionary new Defi project that has caught attention throughout the previous 2 months. Market volatility is compelling experienced investors to look for projects that demonstrate solid fundamentals and generate high potential value. The unique project Remittix continues to establish itself as an upcoming exponential growth project for 2025. Let us find out why. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin That Continues to Surprise The cryptocurrency market still recognizes Pepe Coin among its most popular meme coins. Currently trading at $0.0000073, Pepe has risen by 9.3% over the past week amid renewed interest in meme coins across social media platforms. PEPE has staged a comeback from its established support area while establishing conditions to break out from its trading bracket between $0.00000722 and $0.00000724. The market participants with bullish positions are buying near the midpoint and expect PEPE to reach resistance at $0.00000739 in the short term. Analysts predict Pepe is able to reach $0.0000260 by Q2 2025 if it continues to ride its community hype and develop its ecosystem. While Pepe and other meme coins are required to go past mere speculative investments by creating genuine real-world applications, Remittix already possesses an advantage in this area. Sui: A New Contender in Layer-1 Blockchains The price of Sui stands at $2.26 with a 2% weekly gain because institutional investors along with developers show increasing interest. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) partnered with SUI to push its price toward $2.75 during the trading session after WLFI decided to add SUI tokens to its “Macro Strategy” token reserve and explore blockchain applications. The market predicts Sui will reach $7.9 by mid 2025 as its adoption expands across DeFi platforms and gaming platforms. The blockchain development field has chosen Sui as its top preference because developers seek practical solutions to enhance their projects. Litecoin: The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin remains one of the most experienced cryptocurrencies in the market, touted as “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Currently trading at $92 , Litecoin has experienced steady gains in the past month, buoyed by its reputation as a stable and secure payments network. The upcoming LTC mining rate halving in August 2025 has also generated optimism about Litecoin’s price trajectory. At present the LTC market shows substantial liquidity accumulation across bidding zones and asking zones. Market makers make strategic position increases as they expect a forthcoming market movement. The LTC market promises an intense upward price movement when trading crosses above $94.6 as entry into the blue zone will trigger elevated trading activity and volatility. Analysts have projected that Litecoin could reach $150 by this time in 2026 if adoption among merchants and payment processors continues to rise. However, with newer projects with practical c features entering the arena, Litecoin is coming under increasing pressure to stay relevant among investors and users. Remittix: Changing the Game in Cross-Border Payments The Defi sector is eager to see Remittix solve global remittance system inefficiencies through blockchain technology which offer less expensive and transparent cross-border payment solutions that deliver faster results. Remittix distinguishes itself from speculative meme coins and older cryptocurrencies through its dual use case of payment and innovation which targets real world problems. Remittix presale activities have proven spectacular, as investors have contributed more than $14 million to the project demonstrating strong belief in its future potential. The ERC tokens have reached $0.0734 per token making sure early investors can access an entry point that provides vast potential for growth. The listing of Remittix on major exchanges including OKX and Binance and Coinbase will likely result in substantial profits during the first several months after public launch. Market analysts project Remittix tokens will increase by 10,000% in value by Q4 2025 due to partnerships between remittance operators combined with continuous technological improvements for global expansion. The single platform of Remittix combines the payment network excellence of Litecoin with the dApps scalability solutions of Sui to create an optimal solution for efficient and scalable remittance operations. The Remittix presale presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join the promising crypto project of 2025 so participate right now to achieve huge profits as the revolutionary platform accelerates its growth.

The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Trump said on Truth Social on March 23 at 2:33 am UTC. Source: Donald Trump Nearly $250 million was added to the TRUMP token’s $2.5 billion market cap by 3:11 am before the memecoin fell back down to $11.38 about 90 minutes later, CoinGecko data shows and is now trading at $11.82. Despite being the 53rd largest coin by market cap, Trump’s post contributed to it being the eighth most-traded token over the last 24 hours with $1.4 billion in trading volume. Not everyone who bought TRUMP walked away a winner on March 23. One whale who previously banked around $108 million on TRUMP lost $207,000 from a recent trade; blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain pointed out.

Source: CoinGecko Tornado Cash goes live on MegaETH testnet A largely unknown crypto developer who goes by the name “GUNBOATs” on X has launched crypto privacy mixer Tornado Cash on MegaETH testnet — a new Ethereum layer 2 blockchain looking to resolve Ethereum’s scalability issues. The crypto developer showed a command-line interface (terminal window) of the Tornado Cash smart contract “0x0cB…65142” deployed on the MegaETH testnet at block 1,397,845 — which was timestamped on March 21 at 5:41 pm UTC, according to the MegaETH explorer. Source: GUNBOATs The integration occurred shortly after the US Treasury Department removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list on March 21 and two months after a US appeals court said the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control couldn’t sanction Tornado Cash smart contracts because they are not the property of a foreign national. MegaETH also launched its testnet on the same day the Tornado Cash sanction was lifted. While it isn’t clear if and when a full launch will occur, the company behind the MegaETH public testnet claims it offers “unparalleled performance” with 10 millisecond block times while processing around 20,000 transactions per second. Solo Bitcoin miner wins BTC block, banking $266K A solo Bitcoin miner believed to have been using a miner with less than one terahash per second (TS/s) has solved one of the blockchain’s blocks and earned a $266,552 reward. “Another solo miner found a block!! This time on a self hosted Public Pool. We can’t be sure but the guess is it was a miner with less than 1 TH/s,” Nerdminer Store said in a March 23 X post. The Bitcoin miner snared a total of 3.15 BTC for solving block 888,989, which was timestamped on March 23 at 1:30 am UTC, mempool.space data shows. That bounty included the current 3.125 Bitcoin subsidy and another 0.027 Bitcoin ($2,254) from transaction fees. If Nerdminer is correct in believing a miner with less than 1 TH/s was used to mine the block, the machine likely would have been a hand or pocket-sized rig that possesses a fraction of the hashrate that industrial-scale application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) have. Example of a pocket-sized Bitcoin mining rig that may have solved Bitcoin block 888,989. Source: ASIC Miner Value For context, the Bitcoin mining marketplace estimates that the odds of the 1.2TH/s rig mining a solo block on any day is one in 4.6 million chance. It comes after a 0.48 TH/s mining machine solved Bitcoin block 887,212 on March 10, banking $263,000 in total rewards. No, the IMF did not say Bitcoin is “digital gold” Bitcoin was mentioned several times in the International Monetary Fund’s seventh edition of its “Integrated Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual,” which was published on March 20 — but none of which referred to it as “digital gold,” contrary to some reports. The IMF provided classifications on “crypto assets” such as Bitcoin as a “medium of exchange” while stating that many new digital assets are designed to also act as a “store of value.” The IMF’s comment on digital assets was misinterpreted by members of the crypto industry. Source: IMF “This is a massive stretch to jump to: ‘IMF says bitcoin is digital gold,’” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said in a March 23 X post. “[It’s] a good sign that the IMF is recognizing this but definitely not an endorsement of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’” The IMF also distinguished fungible tokens from non-fungible tokens and classified the latter as either a token designed to act as a medium of exchange or as a security. Related: Who’s running in Trump’s race to make US a ‘Bitcoin superpower?' Bitcoin and “crypto assets” were among nine “major changes” to the seventh edition, which comprised 1,076 pages. The IMF’s seventh edition was released as it continues to negotiate with El Salvador over narrowing the scope of the country’s Bitcoin activities.

42247575,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24923,1742794071,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,DeSci Là Gì?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/desci-la-gi/,"Khoa học phi tập trung (DeSci) đang khuấy đảo thế giới khoa học bằng cách giải quyết những vấn đề lớn như thiếu hụt tài trợ, khó tiếp cận nghiên cứu và hạn chế hợp tác. Các mô hình nghiên cứu truyền thống thường bị bóp nghẹt bởi sự kiểm soát của các tổ chức lớn, cơ chế tài trợ cứng nhắc và rào cản chia sẻ kiến thức – làm chậm tiến độ khoa học. DeSci thay đổi điều này bằng cách sử dụng công nghệ blockchain và các tổ chức tự trị phi tập trung (DAO). Với DeSci, cộng đồng gồm nhà nghiên cứu, nhà tài trợ và người yêu thích khoa học có thể trực tiếp hỗ trợ các dự án mình quan tâm. Những lĩnh vực mới nổi như nghiên cứu tuổi thọ, y học AI hay robot mã nguồn mở giờ đây sẽ dễ dàng nhận được tài nguyên để phát triển. Ngoài ra, kho lưu trữ dữ liệu phân tán giúp loại bỏ phí, cho phép mọi người truy cập và xác minh thông tin một cách minh bạch. Vậy DeSci Thay Đổi Nghiên Cứu Khoa Học Như Thế Nào? DeSci là một phong trào mới mẻ tận dụng Web3 để biến đổi nghiên cứu khoa học. Nó phá vỡ hệ thống cũ kỹ bằng cách sử dụng tính minh bạch của blockchain, hợp đồng thông minh và DAO, tạo ra một hệ sinh thái nghiên cứu mở và công bằng hơn. Một trong những đột phá lớn nhất của DeSci là cơ chế tài trợ mới. Thay vì phụ thuộc vào tài trợ chính phủ hoặc tổ chức tư nhân, nhà nghiên cứu có thể nhận hỗ trợ từ DAO. Tại đây, bất kỳ ai – từ cá nhân, quỹ đầu tư mạo hiểm đến cộng đồng bệnh nhân – đều có quyền bình chọn chọn dự án họ muốn tài trợ. Hợp đồng thông minh cũng giúp việc giải ngân trở nên nhanh chóng, minh bạch và giảm thiểu thủ tục hành chính. Ngoài tài trợ, DeSci còn cải thiện khả năng tiếp cận dữ liệu khoa học. Kho lưu trữ phi tập trung cho phép nhà nghiên cứu xuất bản và chia sẻ công trình của mình mà không phải lo về chi phí cao ngất của tạp chí. Blockchain đồng thời cung cấp sổ cái bất biến để ghi nhận đóng góp, đánh giá ngang hàng và xác minh dữ liệu. Điều này tăng cường tính tái lập và đáng tin cậy cho nghiên cứu. Tầm Quan Trọng Của Việc Mở Rộng Tiếp Cận Nghiên Cứu Khoa Học DeSci đang thúc đẩy nghiên cứu trên nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau, đặc biệt là những ngành từng gặp khó khăn trong việc nhận tài trợ truyền thống. Trong lĩnh vực y tế, DeSci đang đẩy mạnh nghiên cứu về tuổi thọ, phát hiện thuốc mới và y học cá nhân hóa. Ví dụ, VitaDAO đã tài trợ cho các dự án chống lão hóa, trong khi mô hình phi tập trung giúp thử nghiệm lâm sàng diễn ra nhanh chóng và minh bạch hơn. Trong AI và robot, DeSci hỗ trợ các dự án mã nguồn mở nhằm dân chủ hóa tiến bộ công nghệ, giảm thiểu thành kiến trong phát triển AI và xây dựng các mô hình AI phi tập trung, không bị kiểm soát bởi một vài tập đoàn lớn. Việc chia sẻ nghiên cứu AI theo cách phi tập trung đảm bảo rằng những đột phá quan trọng luôn sẵn sàng cho mọi người. Tiếp cận nghiên cứu là vô cùng quan trọng trong các lĩnh vực mới nổi như AI, robot, blockchain và y tế. Những lĩnh vực này phát triển nhanh chóng và có mối liên kết sâu sắc với nhau. Ví dụ, AI giúp cải thiện chẩn đoán y tế, tự động hóa robot và thậm chí cả bảo mật blockchain. Nếu nghiên cứu bị khóa trong các tổ chức tư nhân, tiến độ sẽ bị trì hoãn và chỉ một nhóm nhỏ được hưởng lợi.

However, President Trump suggested there could be ""flexibility"" in the tariff plans, and recent reports indicate the scope might be narrower than expected, potentially exempting some industries from the full impact. Adding to market unease, tensions in the Middle East escalated as Israel resumed strikes targeting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, investors also continue to monitor the impact of recently announced U.S. sanctions on Iran, which could further influence oil market dynamics. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.03% to above 37,700, while the Topix Index slipped 0.3% to 2,795 in mixed trading on Monday. The Japanese yen slipped toward 150 per dollar on Monday, extending losses from the previous session, as disappointing business activity data countered a hawkish Bank of Japan outlook. In March, Japan’s private sector activity contracted for the first time in five months, with the manufacturing downturn extending to a ninth month and services activity also turning negative. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.29% to below 3,360 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.4% to 10,645 on Monday, extending losses from last weekand, and the offshore yuan edges lower to around 7.26 per dollar, reaching its lowest level in two weeks, pressured by rising concerns over a potential escalation of US-China trade disputes as the deadline for Trump’s reciprocal tariffs approaches. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.02% were little changed in early trading on Monday, hovering around 23,686 after sharp losses in the prior two sessions. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.85% The HSBC India Services PMI fell to 57.7 in March 2025 from 59.0 in the previous month, marking the 44th consecutive month of growth in services activity, preliminary estimates showed. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.04% dipped 0.15% to around 7,920 on Monday, trimming last week’s gains. The Australian dollar climbed toward $0.63 on Monday, snapping a four-day losing streak, as upbeat private sector activity data boosted market sentiment. In March, the manufacturing sector saw its fastest expansion in over two years to 52.6 in March 2025 from 50.4 in February, while services sector growth also picked up to 51.3 in March 2025 from 50.6 in February. Australia will unveil its 2025 federal budget on Tuesday, March 25, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers emphasizing cost-of-living relief and economic resilience amid global uncertainty. Key measures include extending electricity bill subsidies until the end of 2025, costing AUD 1.8 billion, and expanding a shared equity scheme to help first-home buyers. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher as President Trump suggested some “flexibility” on tariffs, while several megacap stocks made a recovery. U.S. stock futures gapped higher on Monday as Wall Street looked to extend last week's gains, with investors seeking fresh market catalysts: Dow +0.56% ; S&P 500 +0.65% ; Nasdaq +0.81% .

Pi Coin just bounced 8% after a short dip. XRP claimed a historic legal win that may reshape U.S. crypto laws. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) stands at $0.0734, with over $14 million raised and 521+ million tokens sold—offering a straightforward path to cheaper, faster cross-border payments. Below, we explore why these three tokens might give you a strong chance to turn a $1,000 investment into life-changing profits. Pi Coin: Can It Stay Above $1? Pi Coin at $1. Source: CoinGecko Pi Coin, now at $1.00 , recently slipped to $0.86 before rebounding 8%. It remains popular thanks to its easy mining model and focus on mainstream adoption. However, unlocking more Pi tokens each month can put downward pressure on its price unless demand remains strong. A lot also hinges on official exchange listings— rumors of a Binance listing boosted Pi’s price before nothing materialized. If Pi’s upcoming events, such as PiFest 2025, successfully expand its real-world uses and push more developers to build on Pi’s platform, the token might maintain a solid floor above $1 or climb higher. But Pi’s future is uncertain without more liquidity and big exchange support. XRP: After the SEC Win, What’s Next? XRP at $2.41. Source: CoinGecko XRP trades at around $2.41 , fresh off a big legal triumph. The SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, removing a long-running legal cloud. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and legal chief Stuart Alderoty view it as more than a court success—it’s a turning point for clearer U.S. crypto regulation. In response, the SEC has changed its tone, dropping or pausing cases against several exchanges. Ripple also wrote a letter urging the SEC to develop clear guidelines instead of relying on random enforcement. Now that the legal pressure is gone, many see XRP as ready for a new phase. Some watchers even say an XRP ETF might be next. Whether it hits $100 or not, the removal of legal uncertainties could spur bigger institutional interest in XRP. Remittix (RTX): The Simple Path to Riches While Pi and XRP have big communities, Remittix (RTX), at $0.0734, takes a more direct route by solving real-world remittance problems. Already $14 million has poured in, with 521 million tokens sold—proof that many believe in RTX’s plan. Families, freelancers, and small stores can avoid costly wire fees by converting crypto (BTC, ETH, or others) into local currency, usually within a day, depositing the money into a standard bank account. Think of a mom in Kenya receiving funds from her kid in Canada—no need for advanced steps or heavy fees. Observers say if Remittix secures major e-commerce ties or payroll integrations, daily use could surge, driving the token’s price far above its modest starting point. The token uses locked reserves and an audited contract, helping calm fears of a scam. For those wanting to turn $1,000 into a potential fortune, a practical coin like Remittix might outshine more hype-driven projects in the long run. Conclusion: Which Coin Could Make You a Family Crypto Pioneer? Pi Coin, Remittix (RTX), and XRP each offer a distinct path to wealth. Pi aims at mainstream adoption but needs stronger liquidity and listings to push higher. XRP overcame the SEC lawsuit, clearing a big hurdle and reigniting hopes of major partnerships. Yet Remittix (RTX), at $0.0734 with $14 million raised, solves an everyday concern—fast, affordable cross-border payments—and might see rapid growth if normal people embrace it. If your goal is to be the first crypto millionaire in your family, picking the coin that best tackles a huge real-world need could be your winning ticket. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

Publicly available data shows that GCash, which is similar to China's Alipay or WeChat Pay, does over $65 billion (3.8 trillion Philippine Pesos) in annual transaction volume. Filipino remittances reached a record $38.3 billion in 2024, and account for approximately 8%-10% of the country's GDP. Alipay owner-Ant Group, Ayala Corporation and Manilla-based Globe Telecom's 917Ventures own GCash operator Mynt. GCash offers crypto services via its GCrypto subsidiary, which has partnered with locally licensed crypto exchange PDAX. In total GCrypto offers 39 different assets to trade on its platform, including Paypal's PYUSD stablecoin. Stablecoin-based transfers are growing as a share of the market but remain relatively small, with less than 5% of all inbound remittances using crypto rails. Recently, Bloomberg reported that GCash could seek an IPO valuation of at least $8 billion by the end of 2025. The company, reportedly, is in no rush to go public as it recently completed a funding round that raised its valuation to $5 billion, giving it enough capital and flexibility to wait for favorable market conditions.",Markets|USDC|Jeremy Allaire|Philippines,EN,0,0,USDC|MARKET|ASIA|EXCHANGE|PYUSD,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 05:32:49

As attention shifts toward altcoins and early-stage projects, sentiment is increasingly influenced by speculation, technical indicators, and forecasts of what might fuel the next wave of growth. Among the coins under scrutiny, Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a key technical test, while at the same time, emerging presale projects like The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are gaining traction and attracting bullish sentiment from analysts. Dogecoin Tests Resistance at $0.21 – Will It Hold or Break? Dogecoin has hovered in the $0.16 to $0.18 range in recent days, with $0.21 acting as a significant resistance level. This price point has served as a ceiling that DOGE is struggling to break through. Analysts suggest that a decisive move above $0.21 could validate a bullish breakout and potentially push the price toward $0.25 or beyond. So far, attempts to clear this zone has been met with selling pressure, revealing a lack of strong conviction among traders. If the asset fails to break this level, a period of sideways movement or a retracement toward $0.15 remains possible. While Dogecoin still enjoys strong brand recognition and community backing, its reliance on social media hype and the absence of major development updates continues to raise questions about its long-term viability. As a result, some investors are beginning to explore more utility-driven alternatives that offer not just speculative upside, but also real-world use cases and token utility. Investors Rotate into High-Upside Presales Historically, crypto presales have offered some of the best opportunities for outsized returns, allowing investors to enter projects at discounted prices before wider market exposure. In 2025, this trend remains strong, especially as market participants look for the “next big thing” beyond the top 20 coins. As capital rotates out of larger, slower-moving assets like DOGE, early-stage projects that integrate real utility and tap into fast-growing sectors are gaining momentum. Among these, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is quickly emerging as a standout. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – Where Gaming and Crypto Investing Converge The Last Dwarfs is pioneering a new model in crypto with its Play-to-Invest system, an evolution of the traditional play-to-earn concept. Instead of simply rewarding users with tokens for game participation, TLD allows players to mine resources, upgrade characters, and earn crypto by engaging with the platform. These in-game actions directly increase the farming of the $TLD token, which acts as an alternative to traditional staking. Through its Gamified Launchpad, players also gain early access to vetted blockchain projects, turning the act of gaming into an interactive and strategic investment experience. This approach makes The Last Dwarfs a fully-fledged crypto investment ecosystem. Unlike most presales, The Last Dwarfs already has a live platform and a user base of over 300,000 players. It’s also natively integrated with Telegram and the TON blockchain, offering one of the most frictionless Web3 onramps available today, ideal for both crypto veterans and newcomers alike. Stage 2 of the $TLD Presale is Live – Still Early, But Not for Long Following a successful Stage 1 sellout, the $TLD presale has moved into Stage 2, with tokens currently priced at $0.00852. This tiered system rewards early participants and builds organic demand ahead of listings. Investors can also benefit from: An exclusive Ref2Earn program which grants 15% bonus tokens for every referred purchase 300% APY Staking Rewards As the platform continues to scale and its token utility expands, many analysts see $TLD as one of the most promising early-stage tokens in 2025. Final Thoughts – From Meme Coins to Ecosystem Tokens Dogecoin’s future now hinges on whether it can finally break and hold above the $0.21 resistance level. While it remains popular, the lack of new development or broader use cases limits its growth potential. In contrast, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) offers a novel and sustainable model. With analysts forecasting that $TLD could potentially reach $0.50 or even $1 over the next market cycle, the project is gaining attention not just as a presale opportunity, but as a high-utility altcoin that could lead the next wave of growth in Web3 gaming and crypto investing.

Unlike traditional mining, it does not require purchasing expensive hardware or mastering complex technical skills, making it accessible to investors worldwide. However, as Bitcoin’s market volatility increases and mining difficulty continues to rise in 2025, investors are becoming more concerned about the profitability of cloud mining. Choosing a stable, secure, and consistently paying platform is the key to ensuring returns. Among the many cloud mining services, SpeedHash stands out as an industry leader, thanks to its high mining efficiency, flexible investment plans, and daily payouts, making it a preferred choice for miners worldwide.

This eliminates the need to purchase mining rigs and bear additional costs such as maintenance and electricity. In 2025, cloud mining is becoming increasingly significant due to the rising entry barriers of Bitcoin mining and the global shift towards green energy solutions. According to CoinMarketCap, the cloud mining industry grew by 25% in 2024, driven by increasing institutional interest and the demand for sustainable mining solutions.

According to Metaplanet’s Mar. 24 official statement , this brings its total Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings to 3,350 BTC, purchased at an overall cost of ¥42.22 billion ($270 million), averaging ¥12.60 million ($80,200) per BTC. Since formally embracing Bitcoin as a key part of its business, Metaplanet has quickly grown its holdings to become the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia. The company has used stock acquisition rights through EVO FUND and zero-coupon bonds to finance its acquisitions. In March alone, Metaplanet redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule and raised another ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) through a new bond issuance . This strategy has allowed the company to continue buying Bitcoin without taking on debt with interest.

After rising 309.8% in Q4 2024, the Bitcoin Yield has so far reached 68.3% for the first quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, since starting to accumulate Bitcoin in April 2024, Metaplanet’s stock price has risen by over 3,000%, indicating high investor confidence. In other related news, on Mar. 21, Metaplanet announced the creation of a new advisory board, with Eric Trump serving as its first member. Trump, who has a background in real estate and finance, is expected to contribute business expertise to the firm’s mission of becoming a leading Bitcoin Treasury Company. Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, noted that the advisory board will include influential voices, speakers, and thought leaders committed to advancing Bitcoin adoption. While the company did not disclose specific details on Trump’s role, it described his appointment as part of a broader effort to attract top-tier advisory talent.

Top New Meme Coin to Buy For 2025 as Turbo and Dogwifhat Skyrocket,https://thecoinrise.com/lightning-strikes-arctic-pablos-presale-sells-out-fast-will-you-cash-in-or-miss-out-top-new-meme-coin-to-buy-for-2025-as-turbo-and-dogwifhat-skyrocket/,"Have you ever wondered which meme coin could deliver life-changing gains in 2025? As the crypto market continues to expand, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning heads with its groundbreaking presale rewards and soaring investor interest. While Turbo and Dogwifhat have captured attention with their strong market performance, Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves with its high-yield staking, ultra-low presale price, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Turbo, and Dogwifhat, with a special focus on Arctic Pablo Coin’s thrilling presale momentum. Arctic Pablo Coin Offers 66% APY Staking During Presale – Earn While You Hold For investors looking to maximize their holdings, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unmatched opportunity: a 66% APY staking reward during its presale phase. This feature allows holders to grow their tokens passively even before the coin is officially launched. With staking rewards this high, early investors can capitalize on the presale gains while earning additional tokens. Meme coins rarely provide such an incentive, making Arctic Pablo Coin stand out as one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. As interest surges, early adopters are locking in their APC tokens, ensuring they benefit from both price appreciation and staking rewards. The question is—will you secure your APC before the presale ends? Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Reaches Nippy Nook – Time is Running Out! The Meme Coin presale has officially reached Nippy Nook, the 15th phase of its journey. At this stage, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000079, making it a golden entry point for investors before the price climbs higher. The potential ROI from Nippy Nook to the launch price of $0.008 is an astonishing 10,027.85%. This means a $100 investment today would secure 1,265,686 APC tokens, which could be worth $10,125.49 at launch. With over $1.96 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is gaining momentum fast. However, as each presale phase progresses, the price increases—meaning those who wait could be buying at a significantly higher price later. The current entry price is among the lowest available before Arctic Pablo Coin hits major exchanges. With supply tightening and demand skyrocketing, securing APC tokens now could be a strategic move for investors looking to maximize gains. Turbo Sustains Robust Market Performance in Meme Coin Arena Turbo continues to demonstrate resilience and strong market activity, currently trading at $0.002236 per TURBO/USD. The meme coin has achieved a substantial market capitalization of USD 154.28 million, reflecting its growing prominence in the cryptocurrency landscape. Bolstered by an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $31.84 million, Turbo showcases significant liquidity and investor enthusiasm. With steady momentum and sustained trading interest, the coin remains a formidable contender in the competitive meme coin space. As of March 19, 2025, Turbo’s consistent performance underscores its appeal among traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. Dogwifhat Solidifies It’s Standing in the Meme Coin Market Dogwifhat is currently priced at $0.480656 per WIF/USD, reflecting its strong presence in the cryptocurrency market as of March 19, 2025. With an impressive market capitalization of USD 480.10 million, the coin demonstrates significant value and widespread recognition. Its 24-hour trading volume of USD 160.86 million underscores robust investor engagement and exceptional liquidity, key indicators of its popularity. As demand continues to surge, Dogwifhat is cementing its status as a leading contender in the dynamic meme coin ecosystem, attracting attention from traders and enthusiasts seeking high-potential digital assets. Final thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Way for Meme Coin Investments The meme coin market is heating up, and investors are looking for the next big opportunity. Turbo and Dogwifhat continue to hold strong in the market, but Arctic Pablo Coin is creating a frenzy with its high APY staking, ultra-low presale price, and immense ROI potential. With APC priced at just $0.000079 in the Nippy Nook phase, early investors have the opportunity to lock in massive gains before prices rise. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, proving that investor confidence in Arctic Pablo Coin is surging. For those searching for the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo Coin is an unmissable opportunity. With the presale moving fast and prices set to increase, the time to secure APC at the lowest possible price is now.

In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm announced plans to create a blockchain-based version of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). This move aims to tap into the rapidly growing tokenized asset market and use blockchain for more efficient transfers. FYHXX Fund Set to Launch on Ethereum FYHXX is an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills, which was launched late last year. The fund’s OnChain class currently operates on the Ethereum (ETH) network, with plans to expand to other blockchains in the future. The registration is pending regulatory approval, and the product is expected to launch on May 30. The filing comes amid a growing trend where global banks and asset managers are adopting blockchain technology to tokenize traditional financial assets like government bonds, credit, and funds. This shift, known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), offers the potential for enhanced operational efficiency, reduced costs, and the ability to settle transactions around the clock. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets, is the latest financial giant to dive into the booming tokenized U.S. Treasuries market. Previously, BlackRock, in collaboration with Securitize, launched the BUIDL tokenized T-bill fund last March, quickly dominating the market with $1.5 billion in assets. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s 2021 on-chain money market fund has gathered $689 million. Over $3.3 billion worth of real-world assets (RWAs) have been tokenized on the Ethereum network, with Stellar following at $465.6 million. BlackRock’s head of crypto, Robbie Mitchnick, recently stated that Ethereum is the “natural default” for traditional finance (TradFi) firms looking to tokenize RWAs. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is booming, now worth $4.77 billion—a staggering 500% growth in just one year. Besides, Fidelity is also a leading issuer of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the U.S., with its FBTC ETF valued at $16.5 billion and FETH ETF at $780 million, based on SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund Sparks Confidence Amid Regulatory Shift The U.S. regulatory environment held back the growth of tokenized securities for years, with crypto seen as too risky by banks. However, things are changing quickly with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies. BlackRock’s launch of the BUIDL fund marked a turning point, giving other firms the confidence to dive into the space. Fidelity and others, like Visa and Mastercard, are now embracing tokenization, with Visa launching a platform for banks and Tether introducing its own tokenization platform. Mastercard is also using blockchain for business payments. The Boston Consulting Group predicts tokenized assets could hit $600 billion by 2030, a major jump from the current $2 billion. Besides, even the CFTC is exploring new guidelines for tokenized assets as collateral.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 05:49:33
42248217,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142538,1742795434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Surge of Hope? Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs to 45, Still Cautious Market Mood",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-climbs/,"Cryptocurrency markets are known for their wild swings, keeping investors on their toes. One crucial tool to gauge these emotional shifts is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Imagine a barometer for crypto sentiment, swinging between extreme fear and unbridled greed. Recently, this index has shown a notable shift, sparking conversations among traders and analysts alike. Let’s dive into what this movement signifies for the current state of the crypto market. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is not just another metric; it’s a composite gauge designed to reflect the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple 0-100 scale: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone suggests investors are excessively worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity. 26-49: Fear – While still cautious, the market is less panicked than in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. 50-75: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic, potentially leading to market rallies. 76-100: Extreme Greed – This signals excessive optimism, which can be a warning sign of a potential market bubble or correction. Understanding this index is vital because market emotions—fear and greed—are powerful drivers in the volatile crypto world. High fear can lead to undervaluation and potential buying opportunities, while extreme greed can inflate prices beyond sustainable levels, often preceding market corrections. The Latest Shift: A 15-Point Jump in Crypto Sentiment As of March 24th, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 45. This marks a significant 15-point increase from the previous day. This jump is noteworthy, suggesting a considerable shift in crypto sentiment . Think of it as the market taking a collective, slightly deeper breath. However, despite this positive movement, it’s crucial to note that the index remains in the “Fear” zone. This situation presents a mixed bag. On one hand, the rise indicates that the extreme pessimism might be easing. On the other hand, the persistent “Fear” zone suggests that underlying anxieties and uncertainties still dominate the market sentiment . Decoding the Components: What Drives the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t based on a single data point. It’s a weighted average of several factors, providing a holistic view of market emotions. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values to gauge market uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume against recent averages to assess buying or selling pressure. Social Media Sentiment 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit to understand public perception of the crypto market. Surveys 15% Periodic surveys (currently paused) gauging investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment, while a falling dominance might suggest higher risk appetite in altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and attention. Analyzing the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Context While the index is often referred to as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , it’s heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and sentiment due to Bitcoin’s market dominance. Therefore, understanding the Bitcoin Fear and Greed dynamic is crucial for interpreting the overall index. The recent increase to 45, while still in fear, could be influenced by several factors related to Bitcoin, such as: Bitcoin Price Movements: Positive price action in Bitcoin can naturally reduce fear and nudge the index upwards. Bitcoin News and Developments: Positive news, like institutional adoption or regulatory clarity, can improve sentiment. Broader Market Conditions: Macroeconomic factors and global financial market sentiment also impact Bitcoin and, consequently, the index. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Analysis and You? For traders and investors, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index serves as a valuable supplementary tool for crypto market analysis . Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes presented opportunities to buy crypto assets at potentially lower prices, betting on a market rebound. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ can be a signal to exercise caution and potentially take profits. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your own market analysis. If your fundamental analysis is bullish, but the Fear and Greed Index is showing ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a signal of strong underlying opportunity. Risk Management: Be aware of the prevailing market sentiment. High greed environments might warrant tighter risk management strategies. Not a Standalone Indicator: Remember, the Fear and Greed Index is just one indicator. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for informed decision-making. Navigating the Fear Zone: A Cautious Glimmer of Hope? The 15-point rise in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is indeed a positive signal, indicating a lessening of extreme fear in the cryptocurrency market. However, the index firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ zone serves as a reminder that caution is still warranted. The crypto market remains sensitive to various factors, and while sentiment has improved, significant uncertainties persist. This upward tick could be the beginning of a sustained positive trend, or it might just be a temporary reprieve in a longer period of market anxiety. Keeping a close watch on the index, alongside other market indicators and news developments, will be crucial for navigating the crypto landscape in the coming days and weeks.

WLFI purchased about 3.54 million MNT for nearly $3 million USDC for an average purchase price of 84 cents, according to data sources Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence . The recent purchase has increased WLFI's coin holdings, which include tokens like ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, and others, to over $340 million. However, the Trump family-backed outlet still faced a paper loss of $111 million as of writing. MNT is the native cryptocurrency of the Mantle Network, serving as a utility token for gas fees and a governance token for the layer 2 ecosystem focused on scaling Ethereum. The Mantle Mainnet hard fork, or backwards-incompatible upgrade, took effect on March 19, activating EigenDA on the network. EigenDA is a secure, high-throughput, decentralized data availability service on Ethereum. The EigenDA integration is said to boost Mantle Network's scalability without hitting data rate limits, reportedly resulting in a 15 MB/s throughput. In other words, the network can process more transactions per block. Additionally, the upgrade has made the Mantle Network better compatible with Ethereum's impending Pectra upgrade.

She pointed out that more than half of people under 45 now own digital currencies but have no investments in stocks, a trend she believes could harm both individual wealth and the economy in the long run. The Importance of Stock Market Growth She said that stocks are crucial for company growth. Unlike cryptocurrencies, stocks provide funding for businesses, creating jobs, driving innovation, and contributing to the economy through taxes. “Cryptocurrencies are non-productive assets and don’t help the real economy,” she said. Gordon argues that while crypto may offer speculative gains, it lacks the tangible economic benefits that stocks provide. To address this, Gordon suggests reducing the 0.5% stamp duty on London-listed stocks and applying a similar tax to cryptocurrency transactions. She believes this could encourage more investment in traditional assets that support economic growth. Urging Action for the UK’s Financial Future As a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, Gordon also called for better public understanding of capital markets to boost economic growth. While acknowledging the current challenges in the market, Gordon remains positive about the UK’s role as a financial hub. She urges the government to take action to attract more investments back into UK markets, which she believes is essential for maintaining London’s competitiveness in the global financial sector. The Cooling UK Stock Market Investment interest in stocks has been declining, with many investors turning to cryptocurrencies. According to a report from EY, only 18 companies were listed on the London Stock Exchange last year, while 88 companies either delisted or moved elsewhere.

There is no reason to build an L2. L1s can be faster, cheaper, and more secure. They aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack, or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. https://t.co/Ov3YAfz9U4 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 Yakovenko claimed that L2s heavily depend on the L1 scale for data availability and may entail intricate fraud proofs and multi-signature updates. He explained that Solana does not face such problems because it has separate execution and data layers on an efficient base layer. Yakovenko reacted negatively to Solana’s data generation, referring to it as “measly” at 80 terabytes per year while arguing that L1s cannot scale because of storage. He also warned users against creating baseless L2s, as he said at the beginning of this month, “You can skip creating a valueless L2 and just launch a token.” Solana competes with all Ethereum L2s, not Ethereum itself Yakovenko states that Solana’s architecture enables it to rival every Ethereum L2 solution directly, unlike Ethereum itself. He noted that there are many L2s, but it should not be like that because, ideally, there should be an L2 that can meet the present need and at the same time has the potential to fulfil all the functions thanks to the design. “There is no point to multiple L2s … if a single L2 can handle parallel execution, then it can use up all the blobspace and run every use case.” – Yakovenko His comments align with the perspective that only a few important smart contracts exist, hence the apparent overproduction of L2s. He further claimed that L2s act parasitically since they perpetuate their language ecosystems to the detriment of the L1. Ethereum’s strategy faces questions as L2 networks multiply Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has also recently taken the opposite view. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Lubin stated that Ethereum’s future is in L2 scaling networks. He said that one of the most significant accomplishments of Ethereum was Linea, a product of ConsenSys. He also mentioned MegaETH, which is planned to be further developed, implying faster and cheaper operations. Lubin pointed to Ethereum’s security and the readiness of L2s to create their basis on that platform as its main benefits. However, an upgrade in March 2024 caused the Dencun transaction fees to reduce by 95%, which raised some questions. While it was beneficial for L2s, Ethereum base-layer revenue declined by 99% to the end of the year. More than 140 scaling solutions and 60 roll-up networks are currently on Ethereum, causing concern for fragmentation and value capture on the top chain. Ethereum users have also criticized the blockchain for lacking permission-less characteristics. Naveen Spark, a commentator on X, said that Ethereum is permissioned as of now since new entrants into the network have to invest in know-your-customer (KYC) checks to acquire ETH. He also notes that privacy tools are not pre-built-in, leaving new users in what he called a ‘surveillance world.’ However, another user, rip.eth, was quick to counter the argument, stating that Ethereum is still permissionless and enhances different levels of privacy. However, Naveen maintained that the beginning has shifted for new users since Ethereum has switched to proof-of-stake. Ethereum faces support test Ethereum is close to a key support zone, and more than 3 million addresses hold 6.12 million ETH at a price range of between $1,886 and $1,944. As a tweet from ali_charts pointed out, this range has become the main barrier to a deeper decline so far. The current ETH price is at $2,003, just above the support band, which focuses much on whether the buyers will hold this level. According to the on-chain data, 70.43% of all ETH can be classified as “in the money,” with 29.08% in loss. More than 99.5% of ether holders are at breakeven, which means they have yet to make a profit. Finally, the support cluster has very high buying signals, which means that prices will likely react at these levels. Ethereum balance on exchanges. Source: ali_charts on X A sudden decline in exchange balances has raised a new significant factor in the market during the past few weeks. In the last 48 days, more than 1,200,000 ETH has been moved out of exchanges. Data obtained from Glassnode reveals that centralized exchange reserves of ETH reduced from 18,155,000 in early February to about 16,967,000 on March 22nd.

The winds of institutional adoption are blowing stronger than ever. In a monumental leap for digital assets, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has just smashed through the $1 billion mark in Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t just another number; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence and significant capital flowing into the crypto space, spearheaded by one of the world’s largest asset managers. Let’s dive deep into what this explosive milestone means for the future of finance and Ethereum. Why is BlackRock BUIDL’s $1 Billion ETH Milestone a Big Deal? Reaching $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) is a significant achievement for any fund, but for BUIDL, it’s particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Institutional Validation: BlackRock, a traditional finance behemoth, venturing deeper into crypto sends a resounding message to the market. It signals that institutional investment in digital assets is not just a fleeting trend but a serious and growing area of interest. Tokenization Taking Center Stage: BUIDL is a tokenized fund on a public blockchain. Its success underscores the increasing appeal and practicality of tokenization – representing traditional assets on the blockchain for enhanced efficiency and accessibility. Ethereum’s Expanding Ecosystem: The fact that BUIDL holds over $1 billion in ETH directly benefits the Ethereum ecosystem. It demonstrates institutional demand for ETH and contributes to the network’s growth and maturity. Broader Market Impact: This milestone can act as a catalyst, encouraging other institutional investors to explore and allocate capital to crypto assets, further fueling market growth and innovation. Decoding Tokenized Funds: What Exactly is BUIDL? For those still wrapping their heads around tokenization, let’s break down what BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents: Traditional Finance Meets Blockchain: BUIDL is essentially a bridge connecting traditional financial products with the world of blockchain. It’s a fund managed by BlackRock, but its units are issued as tokens on a public blockchain. USD-Denominated and Stable: As the name suggests, BUIDL is a USD-denominated fund. This likely aims to offer stability and reduce volatility compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies, appealing to more risk-averse institutional investors. Liquidity and Accessibility: Tokenization can enhance liquidity and accessibility. Tokenized fund units can potentially be traded more easily and efficiently than traditional fund shares, especially in a 24/7 global market. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology provides transparency and efficiency benefits. Transactions and holdings of tokenized funds can be publicly verifiable on the blockchain, fostering trust and potentially reducing operational costs. Institutional Investment in Crypto: Why Now, and Why Ethereum? The increasing institutional interest in crypto, exemplified by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, is driven by several converging factors: Maturing Crypto Market: The crypto market has matured significantly over the years. While volatility remains, the infrastructure, regulatory clarity (in some regions), and range of investment products have improved, making it more palatable for institutions. Demand for Diversification: Institutional investors are constantly seeking diversification to optimize portfolio returns and manage risk. Crypto assets, with their relatively low correlation to traditional markets, offer a compelling diversification avenue. Potential for Higher Returns: Despite the risks, crypto assets have demonstrated the potential for significant returns, attracting institutions looking for alpha generation opportunities in a low-yield environment. Ethereum’s Smart Contract Advantage: Ethereum’s role as the leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) makes it particularly attractive for institutional investment. Tokenized funds like BUIDL often leverage Ethereum’s infrastructure. Benefits and Challenges of Tokenized Funds like BUIDL Tokenized funds like BUIDL offer a range of potential benefits, but also come with certain challenges: Benefits Challenges Increased Efficiency: Streamlined processes, faster settlement, and reduced administrative overhead. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized securities is still evolving globally, creating uncertainty. Enhanced Liquidity: Potential for 24/7 trading and fractional ownership, improving market liquidity. Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and custody risks associated with digital assets. Greater Accessibility: Potentially opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of investors. Interoperability Issues: Challenges in seamless interaction between different blockchain platforms and traditional systems. Transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency enhances trust and auditability. Adoption Hurdles: Requires education and adoption from both traditional financial institutions and investors. Examples of Other Institutional Crypto Moves BlackRock’s BUIDL success is part of a broader trend of institutional adoption in crypto. Here are a few other examples showcasing this growing interest: Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the US marked a watershed moment, providing a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings: MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth of BTC. Institutional Custody Solutions: Companies like Coinbase Custody and Fidelity Digital Assets are providing secure custody solutions specifically tailored for institutional investors holding digital assets. Pension Fund Investments: While still nascent, some pension funds and endowments are starting to cautiously allocate a small percentage of their portfolios to crypto assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The rise of BlackRock’s BUIDL and broader institutional interest in crypto offers several actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Tokenization: Tokenization is poised to revolutionize various industries beyond finance. Understanding its potential applications can be valuable. Ethereum’s Continued Relevance: Ethereum remains a critical infrastructure layer for the crypto ecosystem and institutional adoption, solidifying its long-term relevance. Institutional Crypto is Here to Stay: The involvement of major players like BlackRock signals that institutional crypto investment is not a fad but a long-term trend. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While institutional interest is encouraging, always conduct thorough research before investing in any crypto asset. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Conclusion: A Billion-Dollar Bet on the Future of Finance BlackRock’s BUIDL fund surpassing $1 billion in ETH is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of finance. It underscores the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world, with tokenization and Ethereum playing pivotal roles. As institutions like BlackRock continue to explore and invest in digital assets, the future of finance is undeniably becoming more decentralized, transparent, and accessible. This is a journey just beginning, and the $1 billion mark is simply one giant leap in what promises to be an explosive evolution.

Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), said in a March 21 note that Trump administration officials, including Elon Musk, have floated using a blockchain to track US gold and government spending — an idea supported by crypto executives. “Here’s the thing about blockchains. They’re not very smart,” Cipolaro said. “They’re limited in the information they convey. For example, Bitcoin has no idea what the price of Bitcoin is or even the current time.” He said the tokenization or tracking of gold reserves on a blockchain could help with audits and transparency but would still “rely on trust and coordination with central entities” compared to Bitcoin, which “was designed to explicitly remove centralized entities.” Cipolaro added that tokenization and blockchain-tracking ideas aren’t competitive with the crypto market and might help to increase awareness of it, which “could ultimately benefit Bitcoin.” It comes amid calls from some for an independent audit of the United States’ gold reserves. Republican Senator Rand Paul last month seemingly called on Musk’s federal cost-cutting project to investigate the US government’s gold stash at the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, which the US Mint says holds around half of the country’s gold. The Treasury audits and publishes reports on gold holdings at Fort Knox and other locations across the US every month, but President Donald Trump and Musk have both parrotted decades-old conspiracy theories about the gold and questioned whether it’s all still there. Source: Elon Musk Related: Who’s running in Trump’s race to make US a ‘Bitcoin superpower?' They have both pushed for an independent audit of Fort Knox. The vaults were last opened in 2017 for Trump’s then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to view the gold and before that, in 1974 to a congressional delegation and a group of journalists. The Mint’s website says that no gold has gone in or out of Fort Knox “for many years,” except for “very small quantities” used to test the gold’s purity during audits. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last month that Fort Knox is audited every year and “all the gold is present and accounted for.” Magazine: Elon Musk’s plan to run government on blockchain faces uphill battle",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-24 05:57:01

But now things are changing, Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana saw strong gains early Monday as reports suggested that the upcoming Trump tariffs on April 2 might not be as aggressive as previously feared. This shift in expectations helped improve market sentiment, leading to a rally in both equities and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Solana Lead the Charge Following the news, Bitcoin climbed 2.7% in the last 24 hours, trading around $86,500, while Solana (SOL) jumped nearly 6% to $138. XRP also moved higher, rising 2.5% to $2.44, holding above its 50-day moving average after two weeks of positive price action. The rally came as U.S. stock futures, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, saw a 0.5% boost, while the VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, dropped 2.5%. Trump’s Tariffs: A Softer Approach? Initially, concerns over Trump’s planned tariffs had sent markets lower, with Bitcoin dropping nearly 17.6% in February. However, recent reports indicate that the tariffs could be more targeted than previously expected. Some countries may be exempt, and the additional levies on steel and other metals might not be cumulative. This news has calmed investors, sparking optimism across financial markets. Federal Reserve and Market Outlook The Federal Reserve recently updated its outlook, raising inflation expectations but sticking to its plan for two interest rate cuts this year. It also dismissed worries that tariffs would cause lasting inflation, calling the impact temporary. This has boosted confidence in riskier investments like Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes Bitcoin will hit $110,000 before dropping to $76,500 again. He argues that the Fed’s shift from tightening to easing policies will keep the crypto market strong despite inflation fears. Will it Backfire? While the news has improved sentiment, analysts warn that unexpected developments or a tougher stance from Trump could still impact markets in the coming days. Crypto expert Peter Schiff criticized Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff plan, arguing that instead of restoring America’s wealth, it will expose the country’s deep reliance on global productivity and savings. He suggests that the U.S. is no longer as strong as it once was and that these tariffs may highlight economic weaknesses rather than solve them. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Warning: Fear of Mistakes Is Costing You Wealth , Key Events to Watch All eyes are now on two key events that could shape market sentiment in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Friday’s PCE reading, the Fed’s go-to inflation measure, will offer more insights into future monetary policy. With tariff worries easing and the Fed staying accommodative, the crypto market is regaining momentum, hinting at more upside in the near term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After reaching a local peak in December, LINK faced significant selling pressure. However, a new structure is now forming on a broader time frame, suggesting a potential shift in momentum, according to the analyst firm. The analyst firm has identified the following as key levels to watch in the LINK price: $16.5 – $17.3: Current test zone, aligned with previous support and intersecting with the downtrend line. $20.2 – $21.7: A strong resistance area, a break above this level could open the way to LINK’s upper trading range. $12.6: A key support level that marks the lower uptrend line. Holding this level could be a bullish sign. At the time of writing, LINK is trading at $14.34. According to the analytics firm, Chainlink is currently at a crossroads balancing between structural support and a potential breakout. The range around $17 remains the key short-term turning point that could determine whether LINK continues its uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

Leading crypto exchange Bybit has just announced a significant expansion to its trading platform. Mark your calendars for March 24th because Bybit is set to list new spot trading pairs featuring USDQ, a stablecoin with a unique regulatory edge. This move is generating buzz among traders and investors alike. Let’s delve into what this exciting development means for you and the crypto market. What’s the Buzz About Bybit Listing USDQ Pairs? Bybit, renowned for its robust trading infrastructure and diverse offerings, is continuously evolving to meet the demands of the dynamic cryptocurrency market. The upcoming listing of USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ pairs is a testament to Bybit’s commitment to providing users with access to innovative and compliant digital assets. Specifically, the introduction of USDQ stablecoin pairs opens up new avenues for trading and portfolio diversification. But what makes USDQ stand out? According to Bybit’s official announcement, the listing schedule is as follows: USDQ/USDT Spot Pair: Launching at 08:00 UTC on March 24 BTC/USDQ Spot Pair: Launching at 09:00 UTC on March 24 This staggered launch provides traders with a phased entry into these new markets, allowing for careful observation and strategic positioning. The addition of these pairs signifies Bybit’s proactive approach to incorporating regulated stablecoins into its ecosystem, potentially attracting a broader range of users who prioritize compliance and stability. Understanding USDQ Stablecoin and MiCA Compliance The spotlight is undoubtedly on USDQ. It’s not just another stablecoin; it’s designed with a keen eye on regulatory frameworks, particularly Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). This is a crucial detail because MiCA is poised to become a landmark regulatory framework for the crypto industry in Europe, setting standards for transparency, consumer protection, and operational integrity. Being designed to comply with MiCA from the outset gives USDQ stablecoin a distinct advantage in the evolving regulatory landscape. Here’s a breakdown of why USDQ’s MiCA compliance is noteworthy: Regulatory Foresight: USDQ’s proactive approach to MiCA compliance demonstrates a forward-thinking strategy, anticipating future regulatory requirements rather than reacting to them. Enhanced Trust: Compliance with regulations like MiCA can boost investor confidence in USDQ, as it signals a commitment to operating within established legal frameworks. European Market Access: Being MiCA compliant could potentially facilitate easier access to the European market for USDQ, opening up opportunities for wider adoption and usage within the EU. Dutch Regulation: USDQ is licensed under Dutch regulation, adding another layer of credibility and oversight to its operations. In essence, USDQ is positioning itself as a regulated and reliable stablecoin option, particularly for users and institutions seeking to navigate the increasingly regulated crypto space. This focus on compliance could be a major draw for traders looking for stablecoins that prioritize legal clarity and operational transparency. Exploring BTC/USDQ Pair and Spot Trading Opportunities The introduction of the BTC/USDQ pair alongside USDQ/USDT presents exciting new spot trading opportunities for Bybit users. Spot trading, in its essence, is the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery. This differs from futures or derivatives trading, where contracts are traded rather than the underlying assets themselves. Let’s examine the potential benefits of spot trading these new pairs: Direct Exposure to USDQ: Spot trading allows traders to directly acquire and hold USDQ, providing exposure to this MiCA-compliant stablecoin. Diversification: The BTC/USDQ pair offers an alternative trading avenue for Bitcoin holders, allowing them to diversify their trading strategies beyond traditional fiat or major stablecoin pairings. Hedging Opportunities: In volatile market conditions, USDQ could serve as a hedging instrument against Bitcoin price fluctuations, particularly for users who believe in the stability and regulatory advantages of USDQ. Arbitrage Potential: The launch of new pairs can sometimes create arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges, although these are often short-lived and require rapid execution. For traders familiar with spot trading , the addition of USDQ pairs expands the trading landscape on Bybit, offering fresh instruments for portfolio management and market participation. It’s crucial to understand the dynamics of spot trading and the specific characteristics of USDQ to effectively leverage these new opportunities. Why Crypto Exchange Listings Matter for Traders Listings on prominent crypto exchanges like Bybit are pivotal events in the lifecycle of any cryptocurrency or token. These listings can significantly impact a digital asset’s visibility, liquidity, and accessibility. For traders, exchange listings often translate into a range of benefits and considerations. Here’s why exchange listings are so important: Benefit Description Increased Liquidity Listing on a major exchange like Bybit typically leads to a surge in trading volume, enhancing the liquidity of the listed pairs. Higher liquidity means tighter spreads and easier order execution for traders. Enhanced Visibility Exchange listings expose the asset to a wider audience of traders and investors. Bybit’s user base will now have direct access to USDQ and BTC/USDQ trading, boosting its market presence. Price Discovery Listings contribute to price discovery by facilitating more trading activity and market participation. The interaction of buyers and sellers on a reputable exchange helps establish a more transparent and market-driven price for the asset. Accessibility Listing on a user-friendly platform like Bybit makes the asset more accessible to a broader range of traders, including both retail and institutional participants. For USDQ, being listed on Bybit is a significant step forward in its journey to broader adoption and market recognition. For Bybit users, it means more trading options and the opportunity to engage with a stablecoin that is proactively addressing regulatory requirements. Navigating Spot Trading on Bybit: A Quick Guide If you’re keen to explore spot trading of USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ pairs on Bybit, here’s a quick guide to get you started: Account Setup: Ensure you have a verified account on Bybit. If you’re new to Bybit, the registration process is straightforward. Fund Your Account: Deposit USDT or other cryptocurrencies supported by Bybit into your spot account to trade USDQ/USDT, or deposit BTC to trade BTC/USDQ. Navigate to Spot Trading: Once logged in, navigate to the ‘Spot’ trading section on the Bybit platform. Select Trading Pair: Search for ‘USDQ/USDT’ or ‘BTC/USDQ’ in the trading pair selection. Place Your Order: Choose your order type (limit, market, etc.), enter the amount you wish to trade, and execute your trade. Monitor Your Trades: Keep an eye on your open orders and positions in the ‘Orders’ and ‘Positions’ sections. Bybit offers a user-friendly interface for both beginners and experienced traders, making it easy to navigate the spot trading environment. Remember to always conduct your own research and understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency trading before engaging with new trading pairs. Conclusion: Embrace the New USDQ Trading Era on Bybit Bybit’s decision to list USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ spot trading pairs marks an exciting development for both the exchange and the broader crypto community. The introduction of USDQ stablecoin , with its focus on MiCA compliance and Dutch regulation, adds a layer of regulatory assurance to the stablecoin landscape. For traders, this means new opportunities for portfolio diversification, spot trading strategies, and exposure to a potentially groundbreaking stablecoin. As March 24th approaches, the crypto market eagerly anticipates the launch of these new pairs, ready to explore the possibilities they unlock.

Notably, marketing lead Lucie revealed key factors that make the dog-themed meme coin a perfect fit for an ETF product. In the wake of recent broader global pro-crypto shifts, traders and investors anticipate a SHIB price rally to kick off, given this feat actually happens. Simultaneously, a phenomenal +8000% surge in the dog-themed coin’s burn rate intraday solidified bullish market sentiments about price. Is Shiba Inu ETF Filing Possible? Lucie’s Post Sparks Optimism According to a recent X post by Lucie , the dog-themed meme coin shows strong characteristics that make it a good pick for a Shiba Inu ETF. Lucie reveals that the meme coin is available on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs, including all the top crypto trading platforms. In the wake of this aspect, the marketing lead calls the crypto an absolute pick for an ETF product due to its global accessibility. “Because SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s decentralized, community-driven, and built to last,” she concluded. Primarily, these statements gained significant traction across the broader market in sync with the recent optimistic waves generated by crypto-backed ETF filings. CoinGape reported that Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 for SUI ETF approval with the U.S. SEC. Also, the odds of a DOGE ETF approval soared as the US SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for it previously. The speculations of a Dogecoin ETF filing by BlackRock also remain on the rise amid broader crypto-ETF filings. Altogether, these developments inject significant optimism towards the odds of a Shiba Inu ETF filing ahead. SHIB Burn Rate Surge Adds Market Optimism A staggering 8454% surge in the SHIB burn rate this Monday added to investors’ bullishness on price. Slightly over 1 billion coins were burnt in the past 24 hours, dealing a massive hit to the meme coin’s circulating supply. In turn, bullish investor sentiments about price prevail, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the burn mechanism permanently reduces the meme coin’s supply by sending tokens to a null address. As a result, market sentiments about future price action take a paradigm bullish shift. Source: Shibburn site The total circulating supply after the massive blow was evaluated as 584.35 trillion coins. When coupled with the Shiba Inu ETF filing speculations, these developments signal that a price rally looms. SHIB Price Overview Today As of press time, SHIB price witnessed a 1% increase in value, closing in at $0.00001303. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.0000128 and $0.00001309 in the past 24 hours. Notably, the rising action falls in line with the recent burn rate surge and soaring optimism for an ETF filing ahead. Simultaneously, Coinglass data underscored rising market interest in the asset. Shiba Inu futures OI was up by 3.5% to $121.69 million. Also, the derivatives volume spiked by 24% to $71.18 million. Overall, the current sentiment for the meme coins appears to be bullish amid recent advancements, such as a burn rate surge and Shiba Inu ETF odds on the rise.

The digital asset world is buzzing with news of a colossal 250 million USDC minted directly from the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a significant injection into the stablecoin ecosystem, and naturally, the ever-watchful eyes of the crypto community are trying to decipher what this means. Was this a planned move? Does it signal increased institutional demand? Or is there something else brewing beneath the surface? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing development and explore the potential ripples across the crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About USDC Minting? First things first, for those newer to the crypto space, let’s quickly break down what USDC is and why minting it is a noteworthy event. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Think of it as a digital dollar designed for the internet age. It’s issued by Circle, a reputable financial technology company, and Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins like USDC aim to maintain a stable value, making them ideal for transactions, trading, and as a safe haven in the often turbulent crypto market . Minting , in the context of stablecoins, is the process of creating new tokens. When demand for USDC increases, or when Circle anticipates future demand, they can ‘mint’ more USDC. This process is usually backed by reserves of fiat currency (in this case, US dollars) held in custody, ensuring that each USDC token is indeed equivalent to one US dollar. The recent whale alert from transaction trackers indicates a substantial increase in the USDC supply, prompting questions and speculations across the crypto community. Decoding the 250 Million USDC Mint: Why Should You Care? So, 250 million USDC is a large number – but what does it actually mean for you, the average crypto user or investor? Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Increased Market Liquidity: A larger supply of USDC generally translates to increased liquidity within the crypto market. More USDC available means more capital readily available for trading and investment across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized platforms. This can lead to tighter spreads and smoother trading experiences. Potential Indicator of Bullish Sentiment: Large mints of stablecoins are sometimes seen as a precursor to increased buying activity in the broader crypto market. Traders and investors often move funds into stablecoins like USDC when they anticipate deploying capital into other cryptocurrencies. This massive mint could suggest that significant players are preparing to increase their positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. However, it’s crucial to remember correlation doesn’t equal causation, and other factors could be at play. Growing Institutional Interest?: Large USDC mints can also indicate growing institutional adoption of stablecoins and the crypto space in general. Institutions often require stable and regulated on-ramps and off-ramps to the crypto market, and USDC, with its regulatory compliance and backing, is a popular choice. A 250 million USDC mint might suggest a significant institutional player is entering or expanding their crypto holdings. Operational Needs of Circle: It’s also important to consider that this mint could simply be for Circle’s operational needs. They might be anticipating increased redemption requests or preparing for partnerships and integrations that require a larger USDC reserve. While less market-moving than the other points, it’s a plausible explanation. USDC vs. Other Stablecoins: What’s the Difference? The stablecoin landscape is becoming increasingly crowded, with USDT (Tether), BUSD (Binance USD), and DAI (Dai) being some of the other major players. So, why does USDC stand out, and why is its minting so closely watched? Here’s a quick comparison: Feature USDC USDT (Tether) BUSD (Binance USD) DAI (Dai) Issuer Circle & Centre Tether Limited Binance & Paxos MakerDAO (Decentralized) Peg USD USD USD USD (Algorithmic) Transparency & Audits Regular audits, transparent reserves Historically less transparent, improving transparency Audited, transparent reserves Transparent on-chain, decentralized governance Regulatory Compliance Strong focus on compliance Facing regulatory scrutiny Regulated, issued by Paxos Trust Company Decentralized, less regulatory clarity USDC is often perceived as a more regulated and transparent stablecoin compared to some of its competitors, particularly USDT. This focus on compliance and transparency makes it attractive to institutions and users who prioritize security and regulatory clarity. Therefore, significant movements in USDC supply, like this 250 million mint, often garner more attention and are interpreted with a greater degree of seriousness by the market. Whale Alert : Following the Big Crypto Moves The news of this USDC minting originated from Whale Alert , a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These ‘whale alerts’ are invaluable for understanding the movements of significant players in the crypto market. Large transactions can often foreshadow market trends, shifts in sentiment, or strategic maneuvers by institutions or wealthy individuals (‘whales’). Following whale alerts related to stablecoin mints, especially USDC, can provide early signals of potential market activity. While not every large mint translates to immediate price action, it’s a crucial data point to consider alongside other market indicators. For instance, monitoring inflows and outflows of USDC to and from exchanges, as tracked by whale alert systems, can offer insights into buying and selling pressure. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information about the 250 million USDC mint? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts in the coming days and weeks. Does Bitcoin or Ethereum see a price surge? Are altcoins gaining momentum? While the USDC mint isn’t a guaranteed predictor, it’s a potential catalyst to watch. Monitor USDC Supply and Circulation: Track the total supply of USDC and its circulation across exchanges and DeFi platforms. Significant increases in circulating supply following a mint can indicate actual deployment of these funds into the market. Stay Informed with Whale Alerts: Continue to follow services like Whale Alert for further insights into large crypto transactions, including stablecoin movements and significant transfers of other cryptocurrencies. This real-time data can help you stay ahead of potential market shifts. Diversify Your Research: Don’t rely solely on one data point. Combine information about USDC mints with other forms of market analysis, including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental research, for a well-rounded understanding of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Massive Mint and the Crypto Market’s Next Chapter The shocking 250 million USDC mint is undoubtedly a significant event in the stablecoin and broader crypto market narrative. Whether it’s a signal of impending bullish momentum, institutional accumulation, or simply operational adjustments by Circle, it warrants close attention. By understanding the nuances of USDC , minting processes, and utilizing tools like whale alerts , you can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape with greater awareness and make more informed decisions. The crypto world never sleeps, and developments like this USDC mint keep the story constantly evolving, offering both opportunities and challenges for those who dare to participate.

The total crypto market cap has edged 1 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $2.94 trillion on Monday, March 24, during the early European session. Last week’s gold price rally to a new all-time high of above $3k has significantly boosted the bullish sentiment for the wider crypto market. Moreover, global markets have largely factored in the U.S.-led tariff wars. What to Expect of Bitcoin this Week Bitcoin price opened earlier today with a bullish outlook after closing the last two weeks in the green. The renewed interest in Bitcoin from whale investors, as shown by the declining supply of BTC on centralized exchanges and notable cash inflows of U.S. spot BTC ETFs, helped the flagship surge to nearly $87k at the time of this writing. From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price is aiming for $91k in the coming days after piercing through a previously established falling logarithmic trend. However, Bitcoin price must consistently close above $87k in the coming days to invalidate a potential selloff below $80k. Ethereum Price Prediction According to on-chain data, the overall demand for Ethereum remains low compared to Bitcoin. However, Ether’s price has a high correlation with Bitcoin, based on historical trends. Moreover, Ether’s price gained over 7 percent last week to trade at about $2,048 on Monday. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $247 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $10 billion, has also signaled a possible momentum reversal. After closing last week with a bullish outlook, Ether’s price is likely to regain $2,100 as a support level by the end of this week. XRP Price Forecast Following the closure of the Ripple vs SEC case last week , XRP price has signaled the onset of the second bullish trend toward price discovery. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $245 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $2.5 billion, closed the past two weeks on the green. In the past 24 hours, XRP price surged over 3 percent to trade at about $2.46 at the time of this writing. With the renewed interest in XRP by institutional investors, the altcoin is well-positioned to rally towards $2.9 by the end of this week. FAQs Is Bitcoin expected to reach new highs in 2025?

A stablecoin tied to the Korean won could give South Korea a stronger footing in the global stablecoin race, according to a recent report from think tank Hashed Open Research and Four Pillars. The report , published on Mar. 24, suggests that launching a won-based stablecoin might make the currency more practical for digital transactions while also bridging the gap between Korea’s crypto market and international digital asset ecosystems. According to the report, the introduction of a KRW stablecoin “could help address structural inefficiencies in the Korean crypto market,” as well as “serve as the foundation for various fintech industries that emerge from this ecosystem.” Hashed Open Research notes that the high liquidity of Korean exchanges could provide an advantage for a KRW stablecoin over alternatives like the yen or euro. You might also like: South Korean FIU unveils more AML restrictions in light of crypto crimes While boosting the use of won-pegged stablecoins, the report also highlights concerns over the rapid rise of dollar-based stablecoins, such as Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ), which could be exacerbating capital outflows from the country. The report cautions that capital outflows from Korea’s crypto market could grow into a bigger issue, potentially impacting the country’s financial stability and the strength of the won. In the report, Hashed Open Research calls for a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins, saying these assets “possess characteristics of both payment instruments and investment assets, requiring a dedicated regulatory framework.” The report suggests allowing both banks and non-banks to issue stablecoins under strict licensing and security requirements. Additionally, it proposes that foreign-issued KRW stablecoins should be regulated domestically, while foreign stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies should only be allowed if they meet equivalent regulatory standards.

The community’s attention has shifted to MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, over whether he could start diversifying his crypto portfolio with XRP. If this happens and Saylor sells half of MSTR’s Bitcoin holdings to buy Ripple, can XRP price reach $1,000? XRP Price Target If Michael Saylor Swaps $21B BTC to Ripple MicroStrategy, which was recently rebranded to Strategy, currently holds 499,096 BTC valued at $43 billion. The institution is the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, and BlackRock. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, despite being a Bitcoin maxi, Saylor recently told CNBC that buying tokens such as XRP was a way of supporting US investments. This sparked speculation that Saylor could dip his toes in the Ripple ecosystem, possibly buying XRP. MicroStrategy’s most realistic portfolio diversification would be swapping half of its Bitcoin holdings for Ripple. This would mean that the institution buys $21 billion worth of XRP. If this purchase happens, the impact on XRP price would be phenomenal. Impact of $21B XRP Purchase on Price For context, XRP price today trades at $2.46. This means that Saylor’s $21 billion purchase would give the company 8.5 billion Ripple tokens. This is equivalent to 15% of the total XRP supply. The additional buying pressure and the reduction of the circulating supply considering Saylor’s HODL strategy for crypto holdings will easily propel XRP price to all-time highs. Ripple would reach $10 within a few hours of the purchase. A $100 price target could also be achieved within weeks. If Saylor buys XRP , the price could also easily shoot up to $1,000. Buying such a large number of tokens would spark massive retail trading activity, and see XRP outperform the rest of the crypto market. Is $1,000 a Realistic Target for XRP Price? A $1,000 price target for XRP is not impossible, but it is also not realistic under the current tokenomics. XRP has a supply of 58 billion tokens. This would mean that its market cap will reach $58 trillion if Saylor’s purchase pushed XRP price to $1,000. At a $58 trillion market cap, XRP would be worth more than the annual US GDP. This is also around 20 times higher than the current market cap of the entire crypto industry. Nevertheless, Ripple might choose to change its tokenomics to make a $1,000 XRP price target possible. The company can do this in two ways: placing more XRP tokens in escrow or conducting massive token burns. If the tokenomics change and the XRP supply dropped to 1 billion, it would attain a $1 trillion market cap and rival Bitcoin’s dominance. Ripple Technical Analysis Top market analyst and early Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie has given a bullish XRP price prediction . He believes that Ripple will not only reclaim its $3 price target, but also rally to more than $20. “Although I hate XRP and I think it’s a bad idea as a cryptocurrency, I have to admit that according to technical analysis, it’s going a lot higher than $3. I think it will get as high as $20.” The analyst’s prediction comes as the four-hour XRP price chart revealed that bullish momentum was building. Ripple has been making a series of higher lows, as the RSI line also tips north. This confirms Jeremie’s bullish analysis that XRP could go higher than $20. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart To sum up, XRP price could go on a parabolic rally if Saylor swaps $21B BTC for Ripple. However, for XRP to attain the $1,000 target, Ripple would have to change its tokenomics. XRP’s four-hour price chart shows that positive momentum is building, which could spark a rally to $20 soon.

TVL Crosses $10 Billion! The total value locked (TVL) in RWAs surpassed $10 billion, marking a growing trend towards tokenizing real-world assets for faster settlements, fractional ownership, and 24/7 trading. BUIDL- The Largest Tokenised RWA Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is gaining momentum , proving to be one of the most resilient sectors during the crypto market slump. Major players like Maker, BlackRock’s BUIDL, and Ethena’s USDtb each hold over $1 billion in TVL, with USDtb seeing a remarkable 1,000% TVL growth last month. BlackRock is now the largest tokenized RWA. Meanwhile, Hashnote, the issuer of a tokenized money market fund acquired by Circle in January, ranks second with nearly $900 million, showing the biggest one year change. Treasury-backed tokens hit a record $4.2 billion market cap in Q1, led by Ondo Finance’s OUSG and USDY, BlackRock and Securitize’s BUIDL, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, and Superstate’s USTB. Tokenized commodities follow at $1.26 billion, with Paxos Gold leading at over $500 million in TVL. Key Developments The top RWA crypto projects are Mantra, which hit an all-time high on Feb. 23, and ONDO. PENDLE, once a top 100 player, has dropped to 131 in 2025. Crypto analyst rektdiomedes remains extremely bullish on RWAs, especially Maple Finance, predicting a major growth in securitization and capital market infrastructure within the crypto industry. If the trend continues, Maple Finance could benefit greatly, as it specializes in institutional credit and on-chain capital markets. Beesdies, key developments include partnerships like RWA Inc. and Novastro, which bring AI-driven solutions for better security and compliance. This shift is seen as a key moment for DeFi, making financial markets more accessible and efficient, with predictions that RWAs could become dominant in the sector. RWA Value Doubled In The Past Year The DeFi Investor also recently shared that the total value of RWAs has doubled in the past year, now surpassing $18 billion, with most of that value coming from Private Credit. The total RWA value doubled in the past 12 months alone.

On Mar. 21, the U.S. Department of the Treasury officially removed Tornado Cash and several associated smart contract addresses from its sanctions list, reversing the August 2022 sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Regulators had accused the platform of facilitating money laundering activities, including transactions linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The move followed a November 2024 ruling by a federal appeals court, which found the Treasury had overstepped its authority in sanctioning the crypto mixer’s immutable smart contracts. Following the Mar. 21 ruling, the Treasury Department said in a statement that the case should now be considered resolved, arguing that because Tornado Cash and the related smart contracts had been delisted from the specially Designated Nationals list, the lawsuit was effectively “moot.” The US Treasury asserted that the court should assess whether it still has jurisdiction over the case, noting that, like all federal courts, it has a “continuing obligation to satisfy itself” on matters of Article III jurisdiction, and for that reason, “briefing on mootness is warranted.” Grewal, however, argued in a Mar. 24 X post that this approach doesn’t align with the law. “Power does not recede voluntarily. It’s gasps and it gasps until it no longer can After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it.” Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase You might also like: US Treasury lifts sanctions on Tornado Cash, allowing access for Americans According to Grewal, this is a textbook example of what’s known as voluntary cessation, a legal principle where a defendant ends a contested action in an attempt to avoid a court ruling. However, this only applies if there is clear assurance that the behaviour will not recur. In Grewal’s view, the Treasury has provided no such guarantee. He referenced a 2024 Supreme Court decision involving a U.S. citizen who had been removed from the No Fly List. The court found that the case was not moot, as the government had failed to offer any assurance that the individual would not be placed back on the list. While Tornado Cash may have been removed from the sanctions list, Grewal noted that the Treasury has given “no assurance” it won’t be added again. “That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” he added. Recent developments come a month after Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was released from prison under electronic monitoring after a Dutch court suspended his pretrial detention, allowing him to focus on appealing his conviction. Meanwhile, Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm is currently out on a $2 million bond and is expected to face trial in April. He was charged by U.S. authorities in August 2023, along with fellow co-founder Roman Semenov, for allegedly helping launder over $1 billion in cryptocurrency through the platform.

Analysts Have Identified These 2 Tokens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trying-to-find-the-next-shiba-inu-shib-analysts-have-identified-these-2-tokens/,"SHIB enjoyed an astonishing surge from unknown status to dominate the meme coin realm while its initial investors amassed considerable wealth. Crypto fans currently question whether any new project could replicate the success that Shiba Inu (SHIB) achieved. Analysts highlight Neiro alongside Remittix as two upcoming tokens which pursue separate tokenization methods through AI meme energy capabilities and swift cryptocurrency network conversions. The Search for a New SHIB Few people anticipated Shiba Inu would experience an explosive rise after its initial launch. Present-day traders monitor projects that show identical powerful storytelling along with loyal community involvement. Neiro and Remittix have gained significant market attention because of their alliances between innovative approaches and high user participation coupled with effective promotions. The crypto market seeks new meme coins which resemble altcoins capable of making massive price rises. The two projects seem to match every classification category in unique ways. Neiro: An AI-Powered Meme Ecosystem Source: tradingview Neiro brings together artificial intelligence with meme coin playfulness according to their description. The August 2024 debut marked the launch of this platform where no part of its operation is centralized. The team behind the platform states that developers hold no tokens nor can they assess any fees during token transactions. Neiro operates through community-powered controls that consist of platform roadmap development and the activation of artificial intelligence creative functions. Neiro presents 420,690,000,000 tokens based on meme coin methodology though it distinguishes itself with AI implementation throughout. The main attraction of Neiro includes plans to build an AI-powered interactive meme world that adapts based on user participation. The project has released hints about an AI-produced NFT collection which brings together contemporary technological advancements with common internet memes. The possibility for short-term viewers to take interest in an AI-centric meme coin appears promising. Meme coins struggle to create buzz on their own which makes an original approach such as basing them on AI technology beneficial to market standing. When the core group of users share creativity and strong dedication the project will demonstrate characteristics similar to Shiba Inu during its early development phase. Remittix: The New Payments Token Remittix focuses on meeting customers’ direct need to perform swift cryptocurrency to fiat currency transfers while Neiro relies on meme power for success. So far Remittix has succeeded in raising $14 million+ and distributing more than 521 million tokens at a price of $0.0734 per token. Remittix serves users who need to convert digital assets into traditional money while Neiro focuses on providing the lighter side of Shiba Inu entertainment. The fundamental goal of Remittix is to provide users with an easy way to convert tokens into fiat currency before distributing funds to bank accounts within any global region. User support should increase when Remittix solves the complex problem of off-ramping coins. Those who exchange frequently or receive crypto-based payments through their work would strongly benefit from this system. The success of Shiba Inu grew exclusively from the large community that propelled its price changes. Remittix might succeed through providing daily utility to its users. The numerous traders and users dissatisfied with time-consuming cashout approaches may turn towards Remittix. The accumulated funds in presale demonstrate the confidence of people in the core business concept. A strong rising trend like SHIB could occur if Remittix manages to distinguish itself among payment coins. Evaluating Their Paths to “Next SHIB” Status Neiro, an AI-powered meme coin, highlights imaginative memes and community-driven governance. Remittix, on the other hand, focuses on user-friendly crypto payments with real-world usage. Neiro uses AI with viral memes for playful purposes but Remittix addresses off-ramp difficulties through its utility-based operations. Neiro will probably replicate Shiba Inu’s success by achieving massive social media recognition along with new NFT releases and continuous user retention. Remittix may achieve success through partnerships with remittance or e-commerce providers while continuously demonstrating that the system functions as intended. Both face a crowded market. The different core ideologies of Neiro and Remittix as creative meme generators and crypto-bank connector solutions could develop thriving business models together. Final Thoughts Traders intensely monitor emerging projects because they strive to discover assets similar to Shiba Inu. The meme ecosystem developed from artificial intelligence at Neiro represents its differentiating platform due to its aim to duplicate Shiba Inu’s viral success. The Remittix platform operates to connect cryptographic assets with standard financial systems through fast transaction processing scenarios. Numerous investors are focusing on Neiro and Remittix because they consider these two coins to be among the frontrunners for an upcoming altcoin breakthrough.

His latest venture, a startup called Vast Space, plans to launch Haven-1—the first commercial space station —by 2026. McCaleb, who earned billions from selling XRP, is expected to provide major financial backing for the project. Vast Space’s CEO, Max Haot, explained that the station is not meant for tourism. Instead, the goal is to create an environment focused on work, team efficiency, safety, and communication. The station is designed to support government astronauts as well as privately funded missions with serious objectives in orbit. If successful, Vast could even help replace the aging International Space Station and become a strong contender for NASA contracts. McCaleb, known for launching major crypto projects like Mt. Gox and Ripple, is fully committed to this mission. He admitted that he could lose up to $1 billion if things don’t go as planned, but said the long-term vision is worth the risk. He emphasized the need for people to support the idea of human life beyond Earth and believes few are willing to take that level of risk. The XRP community has mixed feelings about McCaleb’s move. After leaving Ripple in 2013 due to internal disputes, McCaleb sold off his XRP holdings from 2014 to 2022. His sales—totaling around $3.3 billion—sparked criticism from some XRP supporters who claimed he hurt the project’s value. McCaleb defended his actions, saying he was transparent about leaving Ripple before selling his tokens, giving others a chance to act first. He also reminded the community that he never forced anyone to switch to Stellar Lumens, though that option was available. “I didn’t do that at all. I told the ripple community I was leaving ripple and no longer believed in the project. I did that before I sold my XRP,” McCaleb said on X. “The intent was to let people front run me.” Despite the backlash, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has voiced support for the space initiative . He praised Vast as an example of American innovation and said he’s hopeful about its success. According to Larsen, this kind of bold ambition is something the country used to embrace.

However, the price remains beneath the middle band, implying that broader momentum is still bearish. The RSI value is at 46.44, climbing from oversold conditions but not yet entering bullish territory.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends.

Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance?

42252110,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142549,1742801123,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Biggest Opportunity Ever? Kiyosaki’s Shocking Bitcoin Prediction Ignites Crypto Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kiyosaki-bitcoin-biggest-opportunity/,"Is Bitcoin the golden ticket to wealth in the 21st century? According to Robert Kiyosaki, the acclaimed author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” the answer is a resounding yes! He’s not just dipping his toes into the crypto waters; he’s diving headfirst, declaring the current Bitcoin price as nothing less than the “biggest opportunity in history.” Let’s delve into why Kiyosaki is so bullish on Bitcoin and what this could mean for you. Robert Kiyosaki’s Bold Bitcoin Prediction: A Historic Investment Opportunity In a recent buzz-generating post on X (formerly Twitter), Kiyosaki didn’t mince words. He stated emphatically that Bitcoin represents a monumental investment opportunity . He even took a jab at the potential future FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) crowd, predicting, “If history is any indicator the FOMM crowd will wait till Bitcoin passed $200 k this year and say ‘Bitcoin is too expensive.'” This statement highlights Kiyosaki’s belief in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory and the tendency of many to jump in only after significant price appreciation. [img]Image of Robert Kiyosaki holding ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ book with Bitcoin chart in the background[/img] But why is Kiyosaki so convinced about this opportunity ? It boils down to his long-held investment philosophy and his understanding of Bitcoin’s unique value proposition in today’s economic landscape. He views Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. In a world grappling with economic uncertainties, Bitcoin, with its decentralized and limited supply, stands out as a potentially safe haven asset. Why Bitcoin Now? Understanding the Crypto Investment Landscape Kiyosaki’s endorsement isn’t just a fleeting opinion; it’s rooted in a deeper understanding of the crypto market and Bitcoin’s role within it. Here’s a breakdown of why now might indeed be a significant time for Bitcoin, according to proponents like Kiyosaki and others he recommends: Scarcity: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect driving its value. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed at will, Bitcoin’s scarcity is mathematically enforced, potentially making it an effective store of value. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of central banks and governments. This decentralization is a key appeal for those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems, especially in times of economic instability. Growing Institutional Adoption: We are witnessing increasing interest and investment in Bitcoin from institutional players. This institutional adoption lends further legitimacy and stability to the Bitcoin market. Hedge Against Inflation: With inflation rates rising globally, many investors are looking for assets that can preserve their purchasing power. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering a hedge against inflationary pressures. Navigating the Crypto World: Insights from Bitcoin Experts While Kiyosaki’s enthusiasm is contagious, he wisely advises a balanced approach to crypto investing. He urges his followers, “Don’t take my word for it,” encouraging them to seek diverse perspectives. He specifically recommends listening to prominent Bitcoin proponents: Jeff Booth: Known for his deep understanding of monetary policy and Bitcoin’s role in a changing financial system. Booth often emphasizes Bitcoin’s potential to fix the flaws in the current monetary order. Michael Saylor: The Chairman of MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company that has heavily invested in Bitcoin. Saylor is a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and speaks extensively on its long-term value proposition. Samson Mow: A Bitcoin maximalist and CEO of Jan3, a Bitcoin technology company. Mow is known for his strong conviction in Bitcoin’s superiority over other cryptocurrencies and its potential to become the global reserve currency. By listening to these experts, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the bullish arguments for Bitcoin and the factors driving its potential growth. The Skeptic’s Corner: Considering the Challenges of Bitcoin Investment To make truly informed decisions, it’s equally crucial to consider the counterarguments. Kiyosaki wisely suggests listening to Bitcoin skeptics as well. What are some potential challenges and risks associated with Bitcoin investment ? Challenge Description Volatility Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Significant price swings can occur rapidly, which can be unsettling for some investors. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Security Risks While the Bitcoin network itself is secure, exchanges and individual wallets can be targets for hacking and theft. Secure storage and practices are essential. Complexity Understanding the technology and economics behind Bitcoin can be complex for newcomers. Education and due diligence are necessary. Acknowledging these challenges is not about dismissing Bitcoin’s potential but about approaching investment with realistic expectations and a clear understanding of the risks involved. FOMO and Bitcoin: Are You Ready for the Ride? Kiyosaki’s mention of FOMO is particularly relevant. The “fear of making mistakes” (FOMM), as he cleverly puts it, can often lead investors to hesitate and miss out on potentially significant opportunities. His prediction that people will only jump in when Bitcoin hits $200k highlights this common investor behavior. Are you going to be part of the FOMO crowd, or will you take a proactive approach to understanding and potentially investing in Bitcoin now? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Educate Yourself: Dive deep into understanding Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the crypto market. Resources are abundant online, from articles and videos to courses and communities. Start Small: You don’t need to invest a fortune to begin. Start with a small, manageable amount that you’re comfortable with losing. This allows you to learn and gain experience without significant risk. Diversify (Wisely): While Kiyosaki is bullish on Bitcoin, diversification is generally a sound investment strategy. Consider how Bitcoin fits into your overall portfolio. Secure Your Holdings: If you do invest in Bitcoin, prioritize security. Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for long-term storage. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market trends, news, and regulatory developments. Conclusion: Seizing the Bitcoin Opportunity with Informed Confidence Robert Kiyosaki’s declaration of Bitcoin as the “biggest opportunity in history” is a powerful statement from a respected voice in the financial world. While his enthusiasm should be considered alongside a balanced perspective, his core argument about Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties is compelling. By educating yourself, understanding the risks and rewards, and listening to diverse viewpoints, you can position yourself to potentially benefit from what many, including Kiyosaki, believe is a transformative asset class. The future of finance is evolving, and Bitcoin is undoubtedly a key player in this revolution. Are you ready to explore this exciting frontier?

The move aims to help Pi Coin better reflect its true market value, instead of being influenced by third-party platforms that reportedly distort its price through artificial activity. PiDaoSwap is now in the final stages of development and is expected to launch soon on the Pi Network mainnet. According to community sources, including Pi Network VietNames, the DEX will allow the PI token to trade based on actual market supply and demand, without interference from centralized exchanges. The platform is currently waiting for Know Your Business (KYB) approval from the Pi core team before it can officially launch. Supporters argue that some exchanges and price tracking platforms use bots and fake data to manipulate Pi’s market perception. These alleged activities have led to frustration in the Pi Network community, which claims that these distortions hurt the project’s reputation and adoption. A recent report from BeInCrypto highlighted concerns about suspicious bot activity affecting Pi’s listed value on platforms like CoinMarketCap. Despite growing support for Pi Coin, Binance has yet to list it, further fueling community disappointment. In the meantime, PiDaoSwap has secured verification status on Twitter, showing that the project is gaining momentum even before its official launch. However, the Pi Network team has clear rules when it comes to branding. The project’s intellectual property policy restricts the use of names and domains containing “Pi” or “Pi-related” references without permission. As a result, the developers behind PiDaoSwap may need to consider a name change or rebranding to meet those guidelines. The team has reached out to the Pi core developers to clarify whether their current naming and domain can remain or must be adjusted. The platform’s goal is to support a more transparent and community-led financial system. By removing dependency on third-party exchanges, PiDaoSwap hopes to provide an accurate pricing system for Pi Coin and restore trust among its users. As the launch nears, the Pi Network community remains focused on pushing forward, despite regulatory hurdles and branding restrictions. If successful, PiDaoSwap could become a key tool in preserving the integrity of Pi Coin’s value within its native ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:25:41

On March 17 alone, the market experienced its strongest daily gain in over a month, with notable interest from institutional players suggesting that confidence may be returning to the crypto space. The reversal comes after a tough period in February when ETFs saw over $5 billion in outflows, much of it due to institutional sell-offs during volatile market conditions and uncertain macroeconomic signals. March, however, has brought signs of recovery, as more capital has flowed back into Bitcoin-focused funds over six consecutive trading days. Leading the rebound is BlackRock’s ETF product, which saw particularly strong buying activity, while Grayscale’s GBTC continued to show outflows, marking a contrast in institutional behavior between ETF providers. Although some platforms remained flat, the overall movement reflects growing interest from large investors. Crypto figure Zia ul Haque highlighted this shift, suggesting that institutional accumulation may point to behind-the-scenes developments. He noted that many large players sold off earlier in March, contributing to market panic and price dips, but are now quietly accumulating again—a move he sees as a positive sign. While the inflow trend is encouraging, not all market observers believe this signals a full recovery. Some analysts argue that the recent surge in ETF interest may be linked more to arbitrage strategies than genuine long-term investment. These strategies often involve using the price differences between spot ETFs and futures markets to make low-risk gains, which may inflate the appearance of true demand. Kyle Chasse, a well-known analyst, explained that while the demand for ETFs is real, a portion of it was purely tactical. Without actual long-term buyers, market volatility could persist, despite the strong inflow numbers. According to him, until committed investors step in, the market may remain uncertain. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have continued on a negative trend, posting over two weeks of consistent outflows. This contrast highlights differing investor sentiment between the top two cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin currently viewed as the more stable and favored asset in the eyes of institutions. Bitcoin’s price has not responded significantly to the influx of ETF investments and remains just below key psychological levels. While investor behavior is shifting, the broader market has yet to show clear signs of a sustained rally. Still, the current movement of funds may hint at changing dynamics ahead.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:28:40

During the period, almost all the top ten cryptos, including Bitcoin, have experienced growth . The Bitcoin market has witnessed a significant surge of 3.5%. Currently, the BTC price stands at $87,178.13 – nearly 3.43% above where the market was at the beginning of this month. However, analysts predict a possible pullback. Here is what traders should watch out for. Market Sentiment Restored After Liquidations At a point on March 20, the Bitcoin market touched $87,452.17. Unfortunately, on the same day, the market plummeted by nearly 3.03%. In fact, between March 20 and 22 alone, the market slipped by over 3.51%. However, yesterday, the trend overtuned, as the market rebounded by nearly 2.65%. Currently, the Bitcoin price remains at nearly 2.30% above where the market was at the start of March 23. This indicates that people’s confidence in Bitcoin has been restored. Short-Term Pullback Expected in 1-2 Weeks A post on X by CrypNuevo suggests that the Bitcoin market may experience a retracement within the next one or two weeks. $BTC Sunday update: Market sentiment has been restored after hitting the short liquidations at $87.1k. Now, it could be a good opportunity for the MM to shake out the market again. We may see a pullback from here over the next 1-2 weeks, a retrace of this recovery. ↓ (1/5): pic.twitter.com/ahMmA11IVF — CrypNuevo (@CrypNuevo) March 23, 2025 Pointing out certain crucial patterns observed by him in the one-week chart of Bitcoin, the crypto analyst asserts that the overall bullish trend in the market remains intact. The 50-day EMA of Bitcoin in its one-week chart is $77,726.95. Recently, the BTC market retested this level. Staying above this level is very crucial for Bitcoin, as it is an extremely important bull market support level of this market. The analyst states that as long as the BTC market stands above this support level of $77K, the bullish trend of Bitcoin remains valid. He also warns that if the BTC price drops below this level, the market could experience deeper corrections. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction for This Week , Support Trendline Exist, But Stop-Losses Below It CrypNuevo notes that there exists a support trendline. He shares the one-hour chart of Bitcoin to justify his argument. Source : CrypNuevo X Post However, he warns that there are also a lot of stop-losses below it. This increases the likelihood of a price dip to trigger liquidations. In conclusion, Bitcoin remains bullish in the long term, but traders should be cautious about a short-term pullback.

This New Token Could Be a Safer Bet",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-price-mirrors-its-2017-pattern-turning-point-or-new-lows-this-new-token-could-be-a-safer-bet/,"Ripple (XRP) is showing a price pattern eerily similar to its legendary 2017 run, leaving investors wondering if it will this be a major turning point or a signal for new lows. Back then, XRP surged from under $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.92, currently at $2.47 and has struggled to gain momentum amid regulatory uncertainty and market headwinds. Meanwhile, some investors are turning to a newer, high-upside token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It launched its third phase of funding during its altcoin presale where investors bought it at $0.02 while contributing over $4.5 million. More than 6400 investors have entered at the current price levels of $0.025 because they expect a projected 25% price surge before the upcoming stage. The launch price at $0.06 gives investors who enter during this period the potential to receive a 200% profit. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance attracts significant investor attention because it implements decentralized finance solutions for crypto loans together with decentralized finance funding mechanisms for its financial service development. The project grows steadily because it acquired more than $4.5 million from investors and now engages a growing number of 6400 investors. Investors face limited entry choices given a $0.02 Phase 3 token price because an approaching 25% price boost will finalize available early investment opportunities. Over 60% of the phase has already been sold out showing that investors have limited time before the window closes. Investors who participate in the current presale period will receive 200% profits from their investment because the platform already set a future price at $0.06. Mutuum Finance steers the Decentralized market market ahead using its innovative lending solution and its established market position. The Dual-Model System of Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance operates a contemporary lending platform which combines Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models to enable better access to assets and transparency for user empowerment. Smart contract pools benefit from Peer-to-Contrast model users who supply their stablecoins for instant borrowing access by platform users and receive passive income. Thanks to automated interest rate modification through smart contracts both lenders get better earnings and borrowers experience less expense in borrowing. The P2P model enables users to form decentralized lending relationships without middlemen while obtaining full negotiation freedoms. The transparent system allows borrowers and lenders to build customized loan arrangements for transactions so they can achieve better user-friendly options. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is actively expanding its community by offering lucrative incentives. A million-dollar giveaway will distribute $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to 10 lucky participants, while an innovative referral program rewards users for introducing new investors. Early adopters also benefit from exclusive staking pools, governance privileges, and VIP updates, reinforcing long-term engagement with the platform. Transforming Crypto Lending The Mutuum Finance stablecoin operates through Ethereum to maintain price stability through USD fund deposits. This stablecoin system operates through a resistant structure to prevent algorithmic stability problems that are necessary for financial transactions. Mutuum Finance achieves decentralized finance development potential through its integration of advanced financial lending practices with strong infrastructures. Ripple (XRP) maintains market attention through 2017-styled price movements although investor doubt persists between market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers better opportunities through its successful presale phase resulting in 6,400 investor participation and a total funding of $4.5 million. Mutuum Finance presents itself as an appealing chance in decentralized finance which markets find promising. Hurry to invest now to take advantage of the current price momentum which might rise further before the following price increase. Investors should join Mutuum Finance presale operations right now to obtain their stake prior to the window’s closure.

CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that discussions are ongoing, aiming to meet requirements expected under upcoming U.S. stablecoin regulations . These regulations would mandate independent audits as a condition for stablecoin issuers looking to operate in the American market. Ardoino emphasized that securing an audit is now a top priority for the company, especially with rising interest from the U.S. government in integrating stablecoins into the financial system. His comments follow a recent statement from former President Donald Trump , who spoke about stablecoins as a way to strengthen the U.S. dollar's global role. Ardoino suggested that this high-level support could push major auditing firms to take Tether’s request more seriously. Despite this, community skepticism remains high. Tether has made similar promises in the past but has never followed through with a full, independent audit. While internal reports are published regularly and a new CFO has taken over, critics argue these moves fall short of true transparency. Some believe Tether may seek a limited audit focused only on its reserves, but full audits are expected under the proposed GENIUS Act, which outlines strict rules for stablecoin issuers. Under the GENIUS Act, companies issuing stablecoins would be required to undergo external audits and maintain reserves in secure assets like U.S. Treasury bonds. Tether claims it already holds a significant amount in such assets, reporting $33 billion in Treasury purchases last year. However, most of these assets are held by Cantor Fitzgerald , a financial firm closely connected to Tether. This link has raised concerns, especially since Cantor Fitzgerald’s former CEO, Howard Lutnick, recently became the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Critics like Jason Calcanis argue that Tether’s reputation and political ties warrant stronger oversight. He insists Tether should not be allowed to hold U.S. Treasuries until it passes an in-depth audit going back to its early operations. Tether made massive profits last year, suggesting it has the resources to fund a full audit. Still, doubts remain about whether the company is willing to undergo the level of scrutiny required. Without compliance, Tether’s ability to operate in the U.S. may be at risk, despite its strong positioning and influence. The crypto community is watching closely to see whether Tether will finally deliver on its audit promise. As stablecoin regulations move forward, passing a proper audit will be crucial for the company to secure its future in the regulated U.S. market and potentially form partnerships with government entities .",,EN,0,0,USDT|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:31:42

If completed, this move could dramatically expand Coinbase’s presence in the crypto trading space, especially in the high-volume derivatives market. Deribit recorded close to $1.2 trillion in total trading volume last year across options, futures, and spot products. In comparison, Coinbase has seen limited activity in derivatives, despite launching Coinbase Derivatives in 2021. A successful acquisition would provide Coinbase access to a new and highly profitable market segment. This development follows a period of growth and expansion for Coinbase, particularly after the SEC ended its legal action against the exchange. Coinbase has since introduced new features like verified liquidity pools aimed at both institutional and retail traders. According to a recent Bloomberg report, talks with Deribit are ongoing, though no deal has been finalized. The potential merger is being viewed by some in the industry as a turning point that could help transform Coinbase into a global crypto powerhouse . Market watchers note that derivatives trading offers much higher volumes and revenue opportunities than regular spot markets. In January, Deribit was reportedly in acquisition talks with Kraken, with an estimated valuation of $5 billion, but that deal did not move forward. If Coinbase closes the deal, it could mark one of the most significant mergers in the recent history of the crypto sector. Social media commentators have taken notice of Coinbase’s strategy. Analyst Zach Humphries pointed out that Coinbase is building a “crypto empire,” especially by targeting the growing derivatives space. He noted that this market is where most of the volume — and opportunity — exists. At the same time, Deribit has faced some operational setbacks. Last month, it exited the Russian market due to EU sanctions , impacting its regional reach. A deal with Coinbase, a publicly traded company in the U.S., could bring stability and open up new pathways for growth. There are still no public details about the acquisition price or timeline. However, if the deal goes through, it would give Coinbase an immediate foothold in a space where it has previously lacked scale — positioning the company to compete more aggressively with global players in the derivatives space. As interest in crypto derivatives continues to grow, Coinbase's potential acquisition of Deribit may signal a broader trend of consolidation and expansion in the crypto industry, with derivatives becoming a key revenue driver for leading platforms.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:34:09

Leading crypto exchange Bithumb has just dropped a major announcement that’s set to streamline how you interact with digital assets. Get ready for seamless Korean Won (KRW) deposits and withdrawals directly through KB Kookmin Bank. This development marks a significant step forward for the accessibility of crypto in South Korea. Let’s dive into what this partnership means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Bithumb KB Kookmin Bank Partnership: What’s the Buzz? On [date of announcement, inferring from ‘starting on March 24’], Bithumb officially announced on their website that they are joining forces with KB Kookmin Bank, one of South Korea’s largest banks. This collaboration is all about making it easier for users to move their KRW into and out of the Bithumb exchange. Starting March 24th at 02:00 UTC, you can directly deposit and withdraw KRW through KB Kookmin Bank accounts. This is a game-changer, simplifying the process and potentially opening doors for wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in the nation. Here’s a quick breakdown of what this means: Direct KRW Transactions: Say goodbye to complicated intermediary steps. Deposit and withdraw Korean Won directly between your KB Kookmin Bank account and your Bithumb account. Enhanced Accessibility: For KB Kookmin Bank customers, accessing the crypto market via Bithumb becomes significantly more convenient. Increased Trust: Partnering with a major traditional bank like KB Kookmin Bank can boost confidence in Bithumb and the crypto exchange industry as a whole. Why is Banking for Crypto Important in South Korea? South Korea is a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity. However, navigating the regulatory landscape and securing reliable banking partnerships has been a persistent challenge for crypto exchanges. Traditional banks have often been hesitant to fully embrace the crypto sector due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks. This reluctance has sometimes led to hurdles for users trying to fund their crypto accounts or cash out their crypto holdings into fiat currency. The partnership between Bithumb and KB Kookmin Bank is significant because it signals a growing acceptance and integration of crypto within the traditional financial system in South Korea. It suggests that regulatory frameworks might be becoming clearer, encouraging established financial institutions to collaborate with crypto exchanges. This improved banking access is crucial for the sustained growth and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country. KRW Deposits and Withdrawals: Benefits for Bithumb Users The introduction of direct KRW deposits and withdrawals via KB Kookmin Bank brings a host of benefits for Bithumb users. Let’s explore some key advantages: Convenience and Speed: Direct banking channels are generally faster and more straightforward than alternative methods. Expect quicker deposits and withdrawals, allowing you to react swiftly to market opportunities. Reduced Fees: Depending on the previous methods used for KRW transactions, this new integration could potentially lead to lower transaction fees. Direct bank transfers often have more competitive fee structures.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-analyst-says-xrp-mathematically-points-toward-10/,"Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared his insights on XRP’s potential price trajectory in a new market cycle. The analyst linked to a YouTube video where he used historical data, Fibonacci extensions, and the XRP-to-Bitcoin ratio, to outline a possible path for the altcoin to reach between $8 and $10, noting that the chart mathematically points toward this target range. XRP Price Chart Mathematically Points to $8-10 with XRPUSD and XRP vs Bitcoin https://t.co/R81AaGowVF — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) March 21, 2025 Price Target Based on Fibonacci Extensions According to Blockchain Backer’s analysis, XRP’s price movements align with historical Fibonacci extensions observed in past market cycles. In previous rallies, assets such as Ethereum and Litecoin have followed similar patterns, reaching 4.236 Fibonacci extensions from key breakout levels. Applying this method to XRP suggests a price target of approximately $8.68 to $10.40 at the next peak. The projection relies on a key assumption: Bitcoin’s price movement will guide XRP’s trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches an estimated cycle top of $127,000, then XRP achieving 8,200 sats (its value relative to Bitcoin) would result in a price of $10.40. If Bitcoin instead tops out at $116,800, the expected XRP price would be $9.57. Bitcoin’s Influence on Market Performance Bitcoin’s market cycle has historically dictated the performance of altcoins. However, Blockchain Backer pointed out that altcoins typically do not peak at the same time as Bitcoin but rather during its retracement phase. This means the XRP’s highest price would likely occur when Bitcoin is cooling off from its peak, rather than during Bitcoin’s all-time high. Furthermore, XRP’s price has followed a pattern of strong rallies when Bitcoin dominance begins to decline . This pattern suggests that the altcoin’s next major breakout could occur in a post-peak Bitcoin environment, as capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Realistic Expectations A significant factor in evaluating XRP’s potential is its market capitalization. Blockchain Backer emphasized that without an extreme Bitcoin rally beyond $200,000 to $300,000, XRP exceeding $10.40 is unlikely. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.28, and the projected increase of over 300% aligns with the historical altcoin cycle, making the $8–$10 range a reasonable target based on past performance. Notably, other analysts have also shared similar targets for the digital asset. If Bitcoin surpasses expectations and reaches significantly higher prices, XRP’s upper limits could expand. However, based on the current market structure and previous cycles, the $8–$10 range remains the most probable outcome.

However, he later realized he shared the news ‘too early.’ On Mar. 24, Chen apologized to users after admitting that he had revealed the news about the standalone wallet app “too early.” This is because the app is not yet available in some regions and devices. Moreover, he does not mention which regions are able to access the app during this time nor does he reveal when the app will be available for all users. “It may not be available for users in some regions and devices. Please be patient. My colleagues in the marketing department are going to scold me,” wrote Chen in a translated post . In a previous X post , Chen revealed to his followers that the crypto exchange has launched an independent app for its wallet service. According to Chen’s post, users can download the application by searching for it on the Google Play Store. “The bull is coming back fast! Open the app market and search for OKX Wallet to download the standalone OKX Wallet app,” said Chen, adding that it is not yet available on Apple’s App Store.

The new feature would enable users to view real-time market sentiments, including long and short position insights and the latest online discourse from X. He also hints that “bigger features are on the way” for OKX Wallet. However, Chen said these features would not be exclusive for the app. For users that are unable to download the application because it is unavailable in their regions, he explained that they can access the Token AI Narrative Summary through the website. “To view [insights on] the DEX Market or any popular token, click on insights to see the AI ​​analysis summary of the token. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!” said Chen. Earlier this month, OKX announced that it would temporarily suspend its decentralized exchange aggregator service in light of an attempted hack.

He stated, “My Dogecoin Community it is about that time where I must provide you the Alpha you all desire. If we take a look at DOGE on the weekly time frame we can see that we received a weekly demand candle last week at the ‘Last line of bull market support’ that I pointed out a couple of weeks ago.” Analyst Sees Big Move Coming For Dogecoin He emphasized the significance of $0.139, calling it vital that Dogecoin maintain this level and explaining that, in his opinion, this zone represents a rare opportunity with “phenomenal” risk-reward potential. He noted, “It will continue to be absolutely vital that Dogecoin hold this level while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3 Day MACD, Weekly Stoch RSI and 2W Stoch RSI all of which are getting very close to being fully reset.” By referencing these oscillators, Kevin underscored that Dogecoin’s momentum profile seems to be approaching a state in which downward pressure could dissipate and bullish forces could resurface. He explained that the Weekly Stoch RSI, for example, is already fully reset, and that the 3-Day MACD is “getting closer to fully resetting,” while the Two-Week (2W) Stoch RSI may still need around another month before it is aligned with the lower, reset region. This combination of technical conditions often attracts traders who regard such convergences as signals that a market may be primed for a marked price move. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate Over 120 Million Dogecoin In Past Week – Analyst Kevin framed his outlook by saying, “In my opinion this continues to be a spot where the risk reward ratio on Doge is absolutely phenomenal given that if we lose $0.139 durable on weekly closes you can cut your trades/losses but your upside potential outweighs your downside risk by miles.” In essence, he is placing the onus on Dogecoin’s ability to remain above $0.139 on a weekly closing basis, because in the event of a sustained break below that line, the bullish thesis could be nullified and traders would likely reduce or exit long positions. Kevin also tied the coin’s fate to the broader crypto landscape, making it clear that a resilient Bitcoin price would be critical if Dogecoin is to maintain its footing near $0.139. He stated, “As long as BTC holds these levels and does not lose 70K then I absolutely love this spot on DOGE,” which reveals his assumption that a weakening Bitcoin would threaten bullish altcoin setups. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces 1929-Style Reckoning, Bloomberg’s McGlone Warns Even so, he said, “If I were ever looking to properly allocate into Doge then I would definitely take advantage of this spot from a trade perspective,” reflecting his belief in the coin’s potential to remain stable in this range and potentially rally once those higher time frame indicators fully reset. This does not guarantee an imminent Dogecoin rally, but it underscores why Kevin believes the current market structure could allow for greater upside than downside, and why many traders and on-chain enthusiasts are closely monitoring these specific conditions. In summarizing his view of what may come next, Kevin explained, “From a holders perspective it is pretty simple. You have to hold $0.139 while these higher time frame indicators reset and get ready for the next big move.” This sentiment hinges on the notion that once these key momentum and trend-following signals swing from reset levels back toward an upswing, a rally could unfold if external factors (particularly Bitcoin’s performance) remain supportive. He has thus labeled the $0.139 zone as a make-or-break support level—one that, if breached on the weekly chart, could invalidate his bullish stance. If it holds, however, Kevin believes Dogecoin is “ready for the next big move.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17534.

42252924,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142542,1742802327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Stablecoins: The Powerful Force Second Only to Bitcoin in Digital Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoins-second-bitcoin-digital-assets/,"In the ever-evolving world of digital currencies, where new projects and technologies emerge almost daily, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. But amidst this whirlwind of innovation, some voices cut through the static, offering clarity and insight. Recently, Dennis Porter, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, made a statement that’s resonating across the crypto sphere: stablecoins are second only to Bitcoin (BTC) in their importance within the digital asset realm. This bold declaration prompts us to delve deeper into why stablecoins are garnering such high praise and what it means for the future of crypto adoption and the continued rise of Bitcoin. Why are Stablecoins Considered Second Only to Bitcoin? Dennis Porter’s statement, shared on X, wasn’t just a casual remark. It’s a reflection of the growing recognition of stablecoins as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. To understand why they hold such significance, let’s break down the key aspects: Stability in a Volatile Market: The name itself gives it away. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability is a stark contrast to the price fluctuations often seen with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. On-ramp to Crypto: For many newcomers, the volatility of cryptocurrencies can be daunting. Stablecoins offer a less intimidating entry point. Users can familiarize themselves with digital assets without the immediate fear of dramatic price swings. Facilitating Global Transactions: Stablecoins enable faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border transactions compared to traditional banking systems. This is especially crucial in regions with limited access to banking infrastructure. Fueling DeFi and Web3: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems heavily rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, trading, and various other applications. Their stability is essential for the smooth functioning of these innovative platforms. Porter emphasized that wider access to dollar stablecoins could unlock the door for billions of people to participate in the digital economy. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about providing individuals worldwide with tools for financial inclusion and empowerment. The Dollar Stablecoin Advantage: A Gateway for Billions The focus on dollar stablecoins is particularly noteworthy. The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, and its widespread acceptance makes dollar-pegged stablecoins instantly recognizable and trustworthy for a global audience. Imagine the implications: Global Accessibility: For individuals in countries with unstable local currencies or limited access to US dollars, dollar stablecoins offer a readily available and reliable alternative. Simplified International Commerce: Businesses can use dollar stablecoins for international payments, reducing exchange rate risks and transaction costs. Remittances and Cross-border Payments: Migrant workers can send remittances back home more efficiently and affordably using stablecoins, bypassing traditional and often expensive channels. Savings and Investment: In regions with high inflation, dollar stablecoins can serve as a store of value, protecting savings from devaluation. They also provide a pathway for individuals to start saving and planning for future investments, including, as Porter points out, Bitcoin. How Stablecoins Positively Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Adoption Porter’s statement highlights a crucial link between stablecoins and Bitcoin. He suggests that increased access to dollar stablecoins is a positive development for BTC. But how exactly do these two digital assets complement each other? Enhanced Bitcoin Investment Strategy: For those looking to invest in Bitcoin, stablecoins provide a valuable tool for strategic planning. Investors can hold stablecoins during periods of market volatility and easily deploy them to purchase BTC when they see an opportune moment. Reduced Friction in Bitcoin Purchases: Using stablecoins to buy Bitcoin can be more efficient and cost-effective than using traditional fiat currencies in many cases. This streamlined process can encourage greater participation in the Bitcoin market. Expanding the Bitcoin User Base: As more people become comfortable with using stablecoins, they are more likely to explore other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Stablecoins act as a gateway, introducing a wider audience to the potential of the entire digital asset ecosystem. Dollar Users and Bitcoin Demand: Porter specifically mentions “dollar users” as major buyers of Bitcoin. By providing easier access to dollar-pegged stablecoins, the crypto market can tap into a vast pool of potential Bitcoin investors who are already familiar with and trust the US dollar. In essence, stablecoins are not just about their own utility; they play a vital role in fostering broader crypto adoption and strengthening the Bitcoin network. They create a more accessible, stable, and user-friendly environment for everyone to participate in the digital asset revolution. Navigating the Challenges: Regulation and Trust in Stablecoins While the potential of stablecoins is undeniable, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and concerns surrounding them. The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving, and issues of transparency, reserves, and potential risks need careful consideration. Key Challenges Include: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty Lack of clear and consistent regulations across different jurisdictions creates uncertainty for stablecoin issuers and users. Reserve Transparency Ensuring that stablecoin issuers hold sufficient and high-quality reserves to back their pegs is crucial for maintaining trust. Centralization Risks Some stablecoins are centralized, raising concerns about censorship and single points of failure. Algorithmic Stablecoin Risks Algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on algorithms rather than reserves to maintain their peg, have faced stability challenges in the past. Addressing these challenges is paramount for the long-term success and widespread acceptance of stablecoins . Ongoing dialogue between regulators, industry players, and the crypto community is essential to develop responsible and effective frameworks. The Future is Stable and Bright for Digital Assets Dennis Porter’s assertion that stablecoins are second only to Bitcoin in importance is a powerful statement that underscores the transformative potential of these digital assets. They are more than just a stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies; they are a critical infrastructure component for the entire digital asset ecosystem. By providing stability, accessibility, and a bridge to traditional finance, stablecoins are paving the way for mass crypto adoption and unlocking new opportunities for individuals and businesses worldwide. As the regulatory landscape clarifies and trust in stablecoins grows, their role in the digital economy is only set to become more prominent, further solidifying their position as a cornerstone of the future of finance, right alongside the pioneering force that is Bitcoin.

With the Bitcoin price closing the weekly trade above the 200-day MA at $85,058, the altcoins have also gained immense strength. As a result, Ethereum price eyes a bullish close above $2500 while XRP is marching towards $2.5. With the top 3 cryptos gaining strength, here’s what’s expected from BTC, ETH, and XRP prices in Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for April 2025 From a wider perspective, the Bitcoin price has been maintaining a steep ascending trend regardless of the short-term pullbacks. The price is trading within a rising parallel channel and is trying hard to rise above the average bands of the channel. However, the bearish influence over the token has dropped to a large extent, which suggests a strong bullish continuation for the BTC price rally. The weekly chart of BTC shows the price has triggered a rebound before testing the previous highs close to $72,000. This indicates the prices were allowed to drop to accumulate at the bottom, and as a result, the star token underwent a strong bullish action. The weekly RSI has triggered a bullish divergence, while the weekly MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure after 6 consecutive weeks. This suggests the BTC price is gearing up for massive bullish action, aiming to form a new ATH. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction for April 2025 Ethereum price has rebounded from a pivotal support zone around $1800, which mounted some confidence among the market participants. However, the bulls are trying to push the price within a crucial resistance zone between $2067 and $2169, which may validate a rise above the bearish influence. Meanwhile, the technicals trigger a bullish divergence but fail to validate it. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close is expected to be a pivotal one. As seen in the above chart, the ETH price has rebounded from the lower support of the decisive symmetrical triangle. The RSI has flipped from the lower threshold, while a rise above the MA may validate a rise from the bearish influence. On the other hand, the CMF has dropped and is about to test the crucial range at ‘0’, as a drop below the range may validate a bearish trend. Hence, the upcoming monthly close could have a large impact, as a close above $2300 may lay a strong foundation for an extended bullish trend towards upper targets. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction for April 2025 The XRP price has been consolidating above the gains within a parallel channel after a magnificent rise of over 300%. The price is displaying massive strength and is trying to surpass the crucial threshold above $2.5, which could elevate the levels within a bullish zone. However, the technicals do support a bullish narrative as the XRP price is gearing up for another 300% rise and will mark a double-digit figure soon. The weekly chart of XRP suggests the token is consolidating within a bullish flag and the latest rebound from the support hints at a strong presence of bulls. Previously, the price remained consolidated for over 24 months and hence the price is expected to remain within an accumulated range for a few more days.

With the crypto losing the brief $1 support, speculations are high among market watchers over the future performance of the asset. Amid this, a renowned expert has how Pi Coin might retain the $1 support. Pi Network Price Slips Below $1 Pi price today has traded at $0.9432, down 6.3% from yesterday and its one-day volume rose 12% to $284.36 million. Notably, the crypto has managed to soar past the $1 mark today in the last 24 hours, while dropping to a low of $0.9109. Besides, a Pi price prediction indicates that the crypto might slip to $0.71 in April. Notably, it appears that the recent decline comes due to a lack of any positive catalysts in the market. For context, the leading crypto exchange Binance hasn’t confirmed the listing on its platform, which has dampened the investors’ confidence. On the other hand, the lack of any major announcement from the Pi Core team has further weighed on the sentiment. What’s Next For The Crypto? According to Pi Coin enthusiast Dr Altcoin on X , the recent influx of unlocked Pi coins on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has led to a surge in circulating supply. To counter this, the Pi Team may need to burn an additional 60-100 million coins in the coming days. This move, which Dr Altcoin believes, could help drive Pi Network price back to the $1 mark. While investors remain cautious, Dr. Altcoin’s prediction offers a glimmer of hope for Pi Coin’s future. However, with the upcoming token unlocks and other factors, he urged investors to exercise due diligence before putting their bets into the asset. Pi Network Unlock Looms: Here’s All With the upcoming token unlocks, market watchers are speculating over the future trajectory of the Pi Coin. For instance, a total of 97.65 million Pi, worth around $93 million at the current price, will be unlocked over the next 30 days. The average unlock stands at 3.25 million tokens a day and the highest unlock will be around 6.8 million Pi coin on April 3. On the other hand, PiScan data showed that 115.57 million tokens will be unlocked in April, followed by 182 million and 222 million in May and June, respectively. Having said that, these massive unlocks might continue to add pressure on the token’s future performance. But, as Dr Altcoin suggested, if the Pi Core Team decides to conduct the token burns, it could help offset the pressure on the Pi Network price.

Bitcoin has been highly volatile, dropping below $80K before rebounding to $85K last week, but price swings continue. However, this week’s start, Bitcoin is showing renewed strength , climbing toward $87,000 ahead of a key US inflation report. Former BitMEX CEO arthur hayes arthur hayes Arthur Hayes is a Bitcoin advocate and fintech pioneer, best known as the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform. Launched in 2014, BitMEX has traded trillions in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Hayes, a former Deutsche Bank and Citigroup derivatives trader, became interested in Bitcoin in 2013 after reading Satoshi Nakamoto's white papers. He stepped down as CEO of BitMEX in 2020 following regulatory challenges, including being the first crypto exchange charged under the Bank Secrecy Act. Hayes is recognized as the youngest African American crypto billionaire.DetailsOrganization: BitMexLocation: Hong KongEducation: Bachelor of Science in Economics, Finance from the University of Pennsylvania and Bachelor of Science in Economics and finance from The Wharton SchoolSkills: Trading and SwapsExperience:Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom from Dec 2022 - PresentCo-Founder at 100x Group from Oct 2020 - PresentCo-founder and CEO at 100x Group from Jul 2019- Oct 2020CEO at BitMEX from Jan 2014 - Oct 2020Delta One Trader (Associate) at Citi from Jun 2011 - May 2013Associate at Deutsche Bank from Jul 2008 - Jun 2011Synthetic Equity Trader at Deutsche Bank from Jun 2008 - Jun 2011FAQ's1.

With institutional demand surging and economic data in focus, Bitcoin’s rally appears far from over. Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin’s Next Stop Is $110K Arthur Hayes is confident that Bitcoin will surge to $110,000 before testing the $76,500 mark again. His optimism stems from expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon shift from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE), a move that could inject more liquidity into risk assets. Hayes also dismissed concerns over Trump’s tariffs, aligning with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s stance that any inflationary effects will be temporary. Bitcoin is already showing signs of strength, jumping 3.5% to trade above $86,700. Trading volume has surged by 74%, with futures open interest rising 7.79% to over $56 billion. Short sellers have faced heavy liquidations, with $50 million wiped out in the past 24 hours. Overall, the crypto market is also seeing a strong rally, with most altcoins rising alongside Bitcoin. Ethereum is up 3.3% to $2,069, while XRP gained 3.1%. Solana led with a 6.2% jump, followed by Cardano and Polygon at 2% and 2.8%, respectively. Meme coins also surged, with Dogecoin up 3.5% and TRUMP soaring 9.4%, reflecting renewed bullish momentum. Inflation Data Set to Influence Market Sentiment This week, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s core PCE price index, the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts expect a slight uptick from 2.6% to 2.7%, which could shape market sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Fed will also release its final one-year inflation forecast, offering further clues on its monetary policy direction. Key Events This Week: 1. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI data – Monday 2.

42253280,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142540,1742802953,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Guide: Key US Economic Events This Week,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/key-economic-events-crypto-impact/,"Are you ready for another week of potential market shifts? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, staying ahead of the curve means not just watching Bitcoin charts, but also keeping a close eye on broader economic indicators. This week is packed with crucial US economic events that could ripple through the crypto market . From Federal Reserve speeches to vital GDP and inflation data, let’s dive into what you need to watch out for to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. Decoding This Week’s Key Economic Events: Why They Matter for Crypto Why should crypto investors care about traditional economic events ? The answer is simple: interconnectedness. The cryptocurrency market, while operating on its own unique principles, is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Decisions made by the Federal Reserve, for example, directly impact the dollar’s strength, inflation expectations, and overall investor sentiment – all of which can trigger significant movements in crypto prices. Understanding these events provides a crucial edge in making informed trading decisions. Federal Reserve Speakers: Gauging the Pulse of Interest Rates This week features a series of speeches from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. These aren’t just routine talks; they are opportunities to glean insights into the Fed’s current thinking on monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates . Here’s a breakdown of who’s speaking and when: Monday, March 24 17:45 UTC: FOMC Member Bostic Speaks 19:10 UTC: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Speaks Tuesday, March 25 12:40 UTC: FOMC Member Kugler Speaks 13:05 UTC: FOMC Member Williams Speaks Wednesday, March 26 14:00 UTC: FOMC Member Kashkari Speaks Thursday, March 27 20:30 UTC: FOMC Member Barkin Speaks Friday, March 28 16:15 UTC: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Speaks 19:45 UTC: FOMC Member Bostic Speaks What to Watch For: Pay close attention to the tone and key phrases used by these speakers. Are they leaning hawkish (suggesting potential rate hikes to combat inflation) or dovish (indicating a preference for maintaining or lowering rates to support growth)? Hawkish comments can sometimes lead to a stronger dollar and potentially dampen risk assets like crypto, while dovish remarks might have the opposite effect. Keep an ear out for any hints about future policy direction, as this can significantly influence market sentiment. Thursday’s Double Whammy: GDP and Initial Jobless Claims Thursday, March 27th, is a day circled in red on many economists’ calendars, and it should be on yours too. At 12:30 UTC, two critical data points for the US economy are released simultaneously: GDP (QoQ) (Q4): This is the second estimate for the fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. It’s a broad measure of the US economy ‘s health. Initial Jobless Claims: This weekly report indicates the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. It’s a timely gauge of the labor market’s strength. Why These Matter: GDP: A strong GDP reading can signal a robust economy, potentially leading to increased investor confidence in risk assets, including crypto. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected GDP could raise concerns about economic slowdown and trigger risk-off behavior. Initial Jobless Claims: Rising jobless claims might suggest a weakening labor market, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider a more dovish stance on interest rates . Falling claims indicate a strong labor market, potentially supporting a hawkish stance. Actionable Insight: Compare the released figures against economists’ forecasts. Significant deviations from expectations are what usually trigger the biggest market reactions. For example, a surprisingly strong GDP print combined with lower jobless claims could be interpreted positively for the US economy and potentially for crypto, at least in the short term. Friday’s Inflation Focus: Core PCE Price Index Wrapping up the week on Friday, March 28th, at 12:30 UTC, we get the Core PCE Price Index for February. This is a key inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Core PCE Price Index (Feb.): The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index measures the prices paid by people for domestic purchases. The “core” reading excludes volatile food and energy prices, giving a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. Inflation and Crypto: Inflation is a critical factor influencing the value of fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as a hedge against inflation. Higher-than-expected inflation figures could reinforce this narrative, potentially driving demand for cryptocurrencies as investors seek to preserve their purchasing power. Conversely, if inflation data comes in lower than expected, it might ease concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes and could still be viewed positively by the market , though the immediate “inflation hedge” narrative might weaken slightly. The Fed’s Stance: The Core PCE is arguably the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. If this data shows persistent or rising inflation, it strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to maintain or even increase interest rates . Conversely, easing inflation could give them room to pause or even consider future rate cuts. The market reaction will heavily depend on how this data aligns with, or deviates from, prevailing expectations. Navigating the Week Ahead: Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This week presents a dynamic landscape for crypto traders. By carefully monitoring these economic events , particularly the Federal Reserve speakers, GDP, jobless claims, and the Core PCE inflation data, you can gain a significant advantage in understanding potential market movements. Remember: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on economic news releases and analyst commentary throughout the week. Context is Key: Don’t just look at the numbers in isolation. Understand how they fit into the broader US economy and global economic picture. Prepare for Volatility: Economic data releases and Fed speeches can trigger increased volatility in the crypto market . Manage your risk accordingly. Long-Term Perspective: While these events can cause short-term fluctuations, remember to maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments. By staying informed and understanding the interplay between traditional economic events and the crypto market , you can navigate this week with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities.

Keep your eyes peeled on the token unlock schedule as a significant amount of tokens are set to enter circulation. Notably, a massive token unlock event is on the horizon, with over $154 million worth of GT tokens leading the charge. Let’s dive into the details of this week’s key crypto unlocks and what they might mean for the market. Decoding This Week’s Token Unlock Schedule: What You Need to Know Token unlocks are a crucial aspect of cryptocurrency tokenomics . They represent the release of previously restricted tokens into the circulating supply. These events can impact a token’s price and market dynamics, making it essential for investors and traders to stay informed. This week, from March 24th to 30th, several projects are scheduled to unlock tokens, with GateToken (GT) taking center stage due to the sheer value and percentage of its circulating supply being released. According to data from DropsTab, here’s a breakdown of the significant token unlocks to watch this week: Worldcoin (WLD): 5.02 million tokens ($4.16 million) will be unlocked on March 25th at 00:00 UTC. This represents 0.42% of the circulating supply. Celestia (TIA): 998,404 tokens ($3.55 million) are scheduled for unlock on March 26th at 18:00 UTC, accounting for 0.19% of the circulating supply. GateToken (GT): The highlight of the week! A whopping 6.67 million GT tokens ($154 million) will be unlocked on March 26th at 00:00 UTC. This substantial release constitutes 7.77% of the current circulating supply. Axelar (AXL): 12.46 million tokens ($5.2 million) will be unlocked on March 27th at 05:00 UTC, representing 1.33% of the circulating supply. GRASS: 3.68 million tokens ($5.09 million) are set to unlock on March 28th at 00:00 UTC, which is 1.34% of the circulating supply. MAV: 54.31 million tokens ($4.4 million) will be unlocked on March 28th at 00:00 UTC, a significant 10.79% of the circulating supply. Echelon Prime (PRIME): 910,248 tokens ($3.44 million) are scheduled for unlock on March 30th at 00:00 UTC, representing 1.62% of the circulating supply. Optimism (OP): Rounding out the week, 32.21 million OP tokens ($27.54 million) will be unlocked on March 31st at 00:00 UTC, accounting for 1.99% of the circulating supply. Why is the GT Token Unlock a Big Deal? Among all the scheduled unlocks, the GT token unlock stands out due to its sheer size. A $154 million unlock is not insignificant in the crypto world, especially when it represents almost 8% of the circulating supply. Such a large influx of tokens can potentially exert downward pressure on the price of GT. Why? Because unlocked tokens are often distributed to early investors, team members, or advisors, who may choose to sell a portion of their newly acquired tokens to realize profits. However, it’s not always a straightforward negative scenario. Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Price Impact: Increased supply can lead to selling pressure, potentially causing a short-term price dip. Traders should be aware of this possibility and exercise caution. Long-Term Vision: Token unlocks are often pre-planned and are part of the project’s tokenomics strategy. They can be designed to gradually decentralize token ownership and incentivize long-term participation in the ecosystem. Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment surrounding GateToken and the broader crypto market will also play a crucial role. A bullish market might absorb the increased supply more easily than a bearish one. Use Case and Adoption: If GateToken continues to demonstrate strong use cases and adoption within the Gate.io ecosystem, the market might view the unlock as a sign of growth and development, potentially mitigating negative price impacts. Navigating Crypto Unlocks: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider when navigating crypto unlocks : Stay Informed: Keep track of upcoming token unlocks using resources like DropsTab and other crypto data providers. Do Your Research: Understand the tokenomics of the projects you are invested in. Know the unlock schedules and the reasons behind them. Manage Risk: Be mindful of potential price volatility around unlock events, especially for tokens with significant unlock percentages like GT and MAV this week. Consider adjusting your trading strategies accordingly. Long-Term Perspective: Don’t solely focus on short-term price fluctuations. Evaluate the long-term potential of the project and whether the unlock is a part of a healthy, sustainable token distribution strategy. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Game This week’s token unlock schedule presents both opportunities and potential risks in the cryptocurrency market. The massive GT token unlock is undoubtedly the highlight, warranting close attention. By staying informed, understanding tokenomics , and managing risk, you can navigate these events effectively and make informed decisions in the dynamic world of crypto. Keep an eye on market reactions and always conduct thorough due diligence.

On Mar. 23, Binance founder and former CEO opened a 24.7x leveraged long position on Mubarak (MUBARAK) with 0.04 BNB as collateral on APX Finance. The transaction was reported on X by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, to which CZ replied “Doing a little on-chain testing on Sunday, as usual. Nothing to be excited about.” Despite CZ’s downplaying, ai_9684xtpa reported that in the 7 minutes since opening the position, APX (APX) surged by 26%, from $0.64 to $0.081, while MUBARAK rose by 5.5%, from $0.146 to $0.154. The trade was conducted using a public donation address and the position has now been closed. https://twitter.com/ai_9684xtpa/status/1903851756364415027 This market reaction aligns with a familiar trend—whenever CZ trades or tweets, buying pressure follows. Recently, Zhao purchased 20,150 MUBARAK for 1 BNB (valued at $600 at the time), which sent MUBARAK surging , briefly claiming the top spot on BNB Chain’s memecoin rankings by market cap and trading volume soaring past $180 million, as reported by Root Data . However, Zhao’s perpetuals trade on MUBARAK was conducted as a test, as he later explained in his post on X, stating “Just trying the experience, also trying to see how if there is still MEV.” https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1903858760256307322?t=Bu9LhwnyUz5X6cFSFyVsdA&s=19 You might also like: New memecoin on BNB Chain MUBARAK up over 100% over the week, buoyed by CZ’s support Zhao has yet to share any findings from his testing related to Maximal Extractable Value. His perpetuals test follows his Feb. 7 poll on X, where he asked whether BNB Chain should eliminate or significantly reduce MEV issues. Although MEV is more commonly associated with the Ethereum ( ETH ) network, BNB Chain users have also faced significant losses due to MEV—where validators reorder or rearrange transactions waiting to be included in the block to maximize their profits. In 2024 alone, BNB users reportedly lost around $1.5 billion due to MEV.

XRP price is up 5% over the last seven days, rising 31% above its local low of $1.89 reached on March 11, as most crypto prices flashed green amid improving market sentiment. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: CoinTelegraph/ TradingView Let’s look at the factors behind XRP’s bullishness today. XRP rises in tandem with the crypto market The bullish sentiment was not only exclusive to XRP as crypto prices also rose across the board, buoyed by Bitcoin’s weekly close above $86,000 on March 23. Key points: Bitcoin ( BTC ) led the gains and was up 2.3% on the day to trade around $87,300. Ether ( ETH ) had gained more than 1.7% over the last 24 hours to trade just above $2,000. Other top-cap cryptocurrencies such as Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Cardano ( ADA ) also posted significant gains, as shown in the chart below. The global crypto market capitalization had increased by 2.85% to $2.84 trillion at the time of writing. 24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360 This performance is accompanied by a significant improvement in market sentiment over the last month. Over the past 30 days, the Fear and Greed Index has risen from a dismal 10, signaling “extreme fear,” to a more balanced 45, indicating a shift toward neutral territory. Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me This rebound reflects growing confidence across the cryptocurrency market and renewed interest in altcoins. Increased trading volume (up 54% on March 24) and buyer activity today underscore this sentiment shift, pushing XRP’s price higher. While not yet in ""greed"" territory, this improvement suggests the market is warming up, boosting XRP. Expectations of legal clarity after SEC appeal drop Perhaps the most significant catalyst for XRP’s price increase today is the positive impact of the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. This is it – the moment we’ve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright. Let's build. pic.twitter.com/7WsD0C92Cm — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 19, 2025 In the protracted lawsuit , which began in 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. This overhang suppressed XRP’s price and adoption for years as exchanges delisted the token. However, a pivotal development emerged when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on March 19, 2025, that the SEC intends to drop its appeal . This news, widely discussed across crypto communities, has sparked optimism that the cloud of regulatory uncertainty could finally lift. Regulatory clarity would affirm XRP’s status as a non-security for retail sales—consistent with prior court rulings —and pave the way for broader institutional adoption and potential spot XRP ETF approval . Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the decision “provides a lot of certainty for Ripple” and that the case is effectively over. As reported by Cointelegraph, the SEC’s decision to drop the Ripple case provides no legal precedent , and the industry still has no legal framework it desires.

Key levels to watch: The bulls now have their eyes set on breaking resistance at the 100-day SMA around $2.52. Key levels to watch above the 100-day SMA are $2.80, the psychological level at $3.00 and the major resistance at $3.20.

If you’re navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency investments, you need to pay close attention to a key market indicator: the Altcoin Season Index . The latest reading is flashing a clear signal, and it’s pointing towards a significant shift in power within the crypto sphere. Buckle up, because we’re diving deep into what this means for you and your portfolio. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What’s the Buzz? The Altcoin Season Index might sound like complex jargon, but it’s actually a straightforward and incredibly useful tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a crypto weather vane, telling you which way the winds are blowing – towards Bitcoin or towards altcoins. This crucial metric, provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), helps traders and investors gauge whether Bitcoin is outperforming alternative cryptocurrencies, or vice versa. And right now, the index is shouting one thing loud and clear: it’s Bitcoin Season . Let’s break down the mechanics of this fascinating index: What it measures: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, to give a pure view of market sentiment. Timeframe: It looks at the performance of these coins over the past 90 days. This longer timeframe provides a more stable and less volatile view of market trends, filtering out short-term pumps and dumps. The Benchmark: Bitcoin ($BTC). The index essentially compares how well altcoins are performing against the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The Scoring System: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. Index Score Market Season Condition 75 – 100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. 1 – 25 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at a mere 17, as of 00:30 UTC on March 24th. This is a clear indicator, according to the index’s methodology, that we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . The index even dropped a point from the previous day, strengthening this signal. Why Does Bitcoin Season Matter to the Crypto Market? Understanding whether we are in Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season is more than just market trivia; it’s a crucial piece of the puzzle for strategic crypto investing. Here’s why it’s so important: Portfolio Allocation: Knowing the prevailing market season can significantly influence your portfolio strategy. In Bitcoin Season , investors might lean towards increasing their Bitcoin holdings, anticipating Bitcoin’s potential dominance and stronger performance relative to altcoins. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally considered riskier assets compared to Bitcoin. During Bitcoin Season , the risk associated with holding altcoins might increase as they tend to underperform. Being aware of this allows for more informed risk management and potentially reducing exposure to higher-risk altcoins. Trading Strategies: Traders often adjust their strategies based on market seasons. In Bitcoin Season , strategies focused on Bitcoin trading or Bitcoin-paired trades might be favored. Conversely, Altcoin Season might see a shift towards altcoin-focused trading and exploring opportunities in smaller cap cryptocurrencies. Market Sentiment Analysis: The Altcoin Season Index serves as a broader gauge of market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin Season might indicate a flight to safety, with investors preferring the perceived stability of Bitcoin during times of market uncertainty or volatility. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Dominance: Actionable Insights With the Altcoin Season Index firmly in Bitcoin Season territory, what should crypto enthusiasts and investors actually do ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Take a hard look at your current crypto holdings. Are you heavily weighted in altcoins? If so, consider rebalancing your portfolio to increase your Bitcoin allocation, especially if you believe Bitcoin Season will persist. Focus on Bitcoin Analysis: Now is the time to sharpen your Bitcoin analysis skills. Stay updated on Bitcoin price predictions, Bitcoin news, and factors influencing Bitcoin’s price movements. Understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory is key in a Bitcoin Season . Exercise Caution with Altcoins: While opportunities can still arise in altcoins, approach them with increased caution during Bitcoin Season . Thorough research and due diligence are more critical than ever. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals and real-world use cases if you choose to invest. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you’re a long-term believer in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Season can present an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin through dollar-cost averaging. This strategy helps mitigate risk by averaging your entry price over time. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is incredibly dynamic. Keep a close watch on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Be prepared to adjust your strategies as market conditions evolve. Challenges and Considerations During Bitcoin Season While Bitcoin Season presents certain advantages and strategic shifts, it’s also important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Altcoin Opportunities Still Exist: Even in a Bitcoin Season , promising altcoin projects can still emerge and thrive. Don’t completely disregard altcoins, but be selective and focus on quality over hype. Innovation and disruptive technologies can still be found within the altcoin space. Market Cycles are Inevitable: Crypto markets are cyclical. Bitcoin Season won’t last forever. Understanding market cycles and preparing for the eventual return of Altcoin Season is crucial for long-term success. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events can dramatically shift market dynamics. Geopolitical events, regulatory changes, or major technological breakthroughs can disrupt even the most established trends. Remain vigilant and adaptable. Emotional Investing: Market seasons can trigger emotional responses. Fear of missing out (FOMO) during Altcoin Season and fear of losses during Bitcoin Season can lead to impulsive decisions. Stick to your strategy and avoid emotional trading. The Power of the Altcoin Season Index: A Summary The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into the prevailing dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Currently signaling a definitive Bitcoin Season with a score of just 17, it underscores the present dominance of Bitcoin and the relative underperformance of altcoins. For crypto investors, understanding and leveraging this index can lead to more informed portfolio decisions, strategic risk management, and a more nuanced approach to navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape. By staying informed and adaptable, you can position yourself to thrive, regardless of whether the crypto winds favor Bitcoin or altcoins.

42253728,https://coingape.com/?post_type=blog&p=245579,1742803554,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,More is Less: Feature Fatigue is Driving Web3 Users Away,https://coingape.com/blog/more-is-less-feature-fatigue-is-driving-web3-users-away/,"Prominent Web3 platforms have attempted to be all things to all people, including Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Theta. Unfortunately, the bloated experiences that resulted from their well-intentioned integration of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and gaming confused users and reduced interest. Originally promoted as a metaverse for social, gaming, and virtual real estate experiences, Decentraland’s attempt to integrate play-to-earn, DAOs, and NFTs led to a convoluted and slow user interface. In a similar vein, the Sandbox attempted to integrate social interactions, NFT-based assets, play-to-earn gaming, and land ownership. Although it was successful in creating hype, the technological complexity and learning curve made it unaffordable for the general public. When NFTs, staking, and edge computing were added, Theta’s original goal of decentralized video streaming was abandoned. Although Steemit presented the novel idea of a blockchain-based social media platform, users were eventually overwhelmed by its intricate staking procedures and curation incentives. Flow was intended by Dapper Labs to be a one-stop shop for decentralized apps (DApps), gaming, and NFTs. But developer uptake was poor, and the environment was disjointed. The “Ethereum killer” EOS, which attempted to support DeFi, DApps, and other things, is the last example. Although it had some success, its governance mechanism was still difficult to operate, and staking made it difficult to manage resources like CPU and RAM. Where did they go wrong? These platforms were characterized by poor user experiences and interfaces, a steep learning curve, excessive features, an unsuccessful attempt to offer an all-in-one Web3 solution or a combination of these downsides. Trying to be a marketplace, a game, a DAO, and a DeFi hub at once leads to scattered focus. Overly complex interfaces make engagement difficult, and mainstream users tend to struggle with concepts like staking, governance, and tokenomics. Web3 platforms that succeed hone in on a single, well-defined use case before expanding. They are full-featured, robust solutions that focus on a specific problem. A mission to simplify and improve user experience SONEX , an AI-powered decentralized exchange hub, was founded to simplify and improve users’ experience with top DeFi , making the segment more accessible across ecosystems. SONEX optimizes AI integration and provides automated trading and predictive analytics, giving users a more effective and potentially lucrative trading experience. With cross-chain integration, flexible solutions, and a ZK coprocessor, it achieves its goal. The modular solutions are designed for developers, guaranteeing uptake, while the coprocessor improves DeFi smart contract hooks for security, performance, and scalability. With data-driven insights, AI-driven strategies will maximize return and capital efficiency. By combining multichain assets with ease, SONEX strengthens its standing as a cutting-edge DeFi aggregator and fosters innovation. Beyond fulfilling its main purpose, SONEX’s status as the AI-powered DeFi hub on Sony’s Soneium blockchain allows it to benefit from the conglomerate’s vast resources, global presence, and technical expertise. Soneium has been dubbed “the entertainment blockchain” and combines blockchain tech with Sony’s entertainment portfolio to create more demand and markets for DeFi services. SONEX combines DeFi and GameFi , enabling users to trade digital assets while enjoying blockchain games, and the hub also hopes to become the leading memecoin launchpad on Soneium. Addressing complexity, security, and regulatory uncertainty While some Web3 platforms have done well for themselves, mass adoption of Web3 technologies will largely remain an uphill battle. Blockchain, as a super-complex technology, undergirds Web3. Cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and digital wallets are concepts that are not unfamiliar anymore, so they remain somewhat intimidating. This complexity spills over into the UI. In Web2, you just buy something online with a few clicks and your credit card information. In Web3, you buy cryptocurrency, load it on a digital wallet, and manage it there. That whole process is something only a highly tech-savvy person would be able to pull off. Uncertainties in regulation deter companies from investing in the adoption of Web3 technologies, as they fear change or complexity in law. Cryptocurrencies are at the center of any transaction in Web3, but with extreme volatility, they come with price fluctuations that have deterred many from using them. According to analysts, Trump has announced the intention of establishing a strategic government-backed crypto reserve to facilitate more effective regulation, thereby stabilizing the market rather than damaging it recently. This stability might be extended to crypto prices, as well.a Security remains a concern. The FBI recently accused North Korean-linked hackers of stealing Ethereum worth $1.5 billion from Dubai-based exchange Bybit. The theft was perpetrated by distributing cryptocurrency trading apps infected with malware. In a changing world of cyber threats, effective protection of digital assets requires the secure communication solution. Decentralized backup systems, which do not use mnemonics instead of phone number or email for authentication. End-to-end encryption ensures full security and privacy, preventing third-party access, including the security solution itself. Centralized systems hold undeniably sensitive content that removes the possibility of abuse and secures it from another centralized platform’s surveillance. Thus, all third parties are kept from accessing the content within the encrypted layer, including the security solution itself. Further, cryptocurrencies require different wallets, setting up a barrier to interactivity across ecosystems. Shared communication and common environment that allow interoperability are given by Polkadot and Cosmos. The development of interoperability enhances scale efficiency across systems, as many blockchains struggle with scale. Low scalability is majorly limiting for any technology aiming toward mass adoption, as it severely restricts the performance when handling high volumes of transactions. Thus, it is expected that the drop of transaction fees with Layer-2 integration like Soneium will open the availability of network use to more projects and ordinary users. According to a survey by Deloitte, 86% of senior executives believe blockchains are broadly scalable and will eventually go mainstream. Private and consortium blockchains are currently more scalable than public ones. The scalability of PBFT-based (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) blockchains is limited, while those utilizing delegated PoS enable scalable governance. Operators can simulate high-volume transactions (e.g., over 10,000) using Hyperledger Caliper or a similar tool to assess scalability.

The firm has been accelerating its acquisitions throughout 2025, adding 1,288 BTC in the first 11 weeks of the year. Details From the Latest Purchase According to a March 24 statement posted on X, the Japanese investment firm purchased the Bitcoin at an average price of $83,801 each. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin acquisition cost to $278.8 million, with an average purchase price of $83,224 per BTC. Metaplanet tracks its performance using BTC Yield, a metric that measures the growth of its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted shares. After surging 309.8% in Q4 2024, the metric has reached 68.3% so far in Q1 2025. The outfit has financed its purchases through stock acquisition rights via EVO FUND and zero-interest bonds. In March alone, it redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule and issued another ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in new bonds. This was used to fund multiple purchases, including 156 BTC on March 3, 497 BTC on March 5, 162 BTC on March 12, and 150 BTC on March 18. The goal is to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026, a milestone that would make it the holder of 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Market Reaction and Developments Reacting to the latest development, Google Finance data shows that Metaplanet’s stock is trading at ¥5,060, recording a 6.98% increase in the past 24 hours. The company also recently achieved a milestone, becoming Asia’s largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder and ranking among the top 10 publicly listed Bitcoin holders globally. Last week, it announced the formation of an advisory board, appointing Eric Trump as its first member. While it did not disclose specific details about Trump’s role, CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the board will consist of influential figures committed to advancing Bitcoin adoption. He described Trump’s appointment as a major step toward the goal of becoming one of the world’s leading Bitcoin treasury companies. The investment firm’s growth coincides with Japan’s shifting stance on crypto regulation. On March 6, the country’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed lowering crypto capital gains taxes from 55% to 20%, marking a 35% reduction. The plan also seeks to classify crypto as its own asset class, separate from securities, under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

Trump Family's WLFI Project Invests $3 Million in MNT, Faces Overall Loss of $109 Million This move is part of a broader investment strategy that sees WLFI allocating approximately $343 million across 11 different cryptocurrencies. Distribution of Investments: WLFI's portfolio includes Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), TRON (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE, Ethena (ENA), Move (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), Sei (SEI), Avalanche (AVAX) and Mantle (MNT). Current Market Performance: Despite significant investments, the project currently faces an unrealized loss of approximately $109 million, indicating that its crypto assets have lost value since they were purchased. The Trump family’s involvement in the crypto space has been particularly notable as former President Donald Trump has increasingly voiced his support for digital assets. However, the volatile losses highlight the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, where large investments can face significant fluctuations in valuation. It remains to be seen whether WLFI's strategy will yield long-term gains or whether losses will continue to mount amid market volatility. *This is not investment advice.

In a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, officials say they have recovered and cleared the title to $7 million of investment fraud proceeds using civil asset forfeiture. The Justice Department (DOJ) says that the government will now begin inviting the victims of the fraud to submit petitions to have those funds returned to them. Citing court documents, the DOJ says it uncovered a fraud scheme in which perpetrators used social engineering to lure victims into investing in crypto assets using websites that mirror legitimate platforms. “The social engineering involved the perpetrators getting to know the victims and earning their trust before introducing them to cryptocurrency investment ideas through the spoofed websites. These websites were set up to mimic legitimate cryptocurrency investment platforms, but funneled victim funds to the perpetrators through over 75 bank accounts in the names of shell companies. The sites falsely represented to the victims that their investments were making sizeable gains. However, when victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The DOJ did not name any individual or organization involved in the case. US authorities began seizing some of the investment fraud’s proceeds from a bank account set up with a foreign bank in June of 2023. The US subsequently filed a complaint with a District Court to start the civil forfeiture process against the seized funds. The government ultimately reached a settlement, freeing up $7 million of the seized funds so it could be forfeited to the United States and given back to the victims.

According to the recent announcement, the firm has listed Bitcoin Core ETP (CBTC), the Solana Staking ETP (ASOL), and the XRP ETP (AXRP) on Nasdaq Stockholm. 21Shares Expands Reach With New Crypto ETPs 21Shares has expanded its European foothold with the listing of three crypto exchange-traded products on Nasdaq Stockholm. The asset manager, with more than $7.5 billion in assets under management, announced the listing, sparking market interest. According to the announcement, the products include low-cost Bitcoin ETP, a Solana staking ETP, and XRP ETF, which are primarily designed for both retail and institutional traders. The firm’s Head of Financial Product Development has lauded the update, highlighting this expansion as a key milestone for the firm. Meanwhile, she also noted that 2024 marks a crucial year for crypto adoption in Europe, driven by regulatory clarity under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Mandy Chiu stated : “As institutional adoption of cryptoasset ETPs accelerates and regulatory clarity strengthens across Europe, we remain committed to expanding our product offerings to meet growing investor demand.” A Closer Look Into 21Shares Crypto ETPs Bitcoin Core ETP (CBTC) As per the announcement, CBTC comes with one of the lowest management fees in Europe, standing at just 0.21%. This cost-effective approach might help attract more investors seeking direct BTC exposure. Solana Staking ETP (ASOL) ASOL offers a unique staking model, allowing investors to earn staking rewards while maintaining exposure to Solana. Solana’s blockchain innovations in gaming, finance, and identity security make it a valuable asset. Having said that, this ETP helps investors tap into the benefits of staking without the technical complexities. XRP ETP (AXRP) AXRP is fully backed by XRP, providing transparent and regulated exposure to Ripple’s native assets. Meanwhile, as XRP continues to play a vital role in cross-border payments, this ETP presents an accessible way for European investors to gain exposure. 21Shares: A Leading Name In US Crypto Sphere Apart from the European expansion, 21Shares has gained notable traction in the US. With the shifting regulatory stance in the US amid the global push for digital assets, the firm has gained notable traction from investors. Recently, Nasdaq has submitted 19-4 filing for 21Shares Polkadot ETF with the US SEC, which has caught the eyes of the investors. Besides, this latest announcement also comes as investors’ focus on the crypto products has regained momentum. For context, the US Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded an inflow of $785 million last week, after gloomy trading during the broader market retreat. Having said that, these new offerings might drive more investment and attract more traders into the digital assets space from the European region.

42256537,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104042,1742807782,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Pakistan Plans Using Surplus Energy To Mine Bitcoin,https://zycrypto.com/pakistan-plans-using-surplus-energy-to-mine-bitcoin/,"Pakistan announced plans to use surplus energy for crypto mining. The country is keen on the digital assets market and is creating special tariffs to attract more crypto developers. Pakistan will use the surplus power, available at marginal costs, to build crypto data centers. The Energy Department of Pakistan has contacted various stakeholders to implement the plan. The country wants to attract more investors but needs to balance the power supply so that it will be in a good position to boost the crypto industry. Bitcoin alone is a power-intensive operation, using proof-of-work mining, estimated to consume 130 terawatts per hour (TWh), a rate greater than that used by some countries such as Argentina and the Netherlands. Pakistan has an estimated 20 million active crypto users and $20 billion in transactions. Its relatively young workforce has a lot of potential for Web3 development and a growing market for tech-savvy young entrepreneurs. The potential for growth in this market is promising and could be enhanced with governmental support. Awais Leghari, Federal Minister of Energy, met with Bilal Bin Saqib, executive of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), to discuss how crypto mining could use Pakistan’s excess electricity. Bitcoin mining can only work if electricity is affordable. The process consumes a lot of energy and reportedly consumes 60% of a miner’s income. Pakistan could offer attractive tariffs to bring down the cost of electricity. This move may attract more investors worldwide to invest in the new industry. 2021 China banned the mining industry, citing concerns about power consumption and environmental impacts. Many countries, such as China, have noticed Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and have introduced tariffs or banned the technology outright. In October 2024, Teheran faced multiple blackouts for weeks, with many citing mining operations as the cause. Iran offers electricity discounts for crypto miners but frequently shuts down operations with high electricity demand. Pakistan has a young working population, 60% of the 240 million population under 30 years old. The blockchain industry is popular amongst younger workers and may provide more job opportunities for people. The government wishes to engage with the PCC and get them to reach out to all crypto stakeholders in Pakistan, providing access to key individuals in the industry and creating a space for public officials to work directly with the private sector. The Pakistani government wishes to collaborate with the sector and encourage teamwork. “This is the beginning of a new digital chapter for our economy,” said a government official. We are committed to building a transparent, future-ready financial ecosystem that attracts investment, empowers our youth, and puts Pakistan on the global map as a leader in emerging technologies.“ Muhammad Aurangzeb, Pakistan’s Finance Minister, presided over the discussions, presenting the idea of leveraging the nation’s excess electricity with Bitcoin, converting liabilities into assets. Various ministers attended the meeting, including ministers for IT and law. In December 2024, Pakistan reported a $582 million account surplus, doubling the previous year’s surplus. Pakistan now wants to boost its economy even further by leveraging excess electricity. It wants to convert wasted electricity into economic wealth. However, it will need to strike the right balance between good regulation, energy supply, and well-built infrastructure. The World Bank, from the 2020 index, ranks Pakistan 108 out of 190 countries, citing excessive red tape, corruption, and inefficient regulation. Pakistan will need to create a fair playing field for crypto entrepreneurs so startups will succeed with minimal interference. In August 2024, Russia created a new law legalizing crypto mining. Russia has an abundance of natural gas, making crypto mining affordable. Individuals and businesses must register with the Russian Ministry of Digital Development before mining crypto. However, if the amount of energy consumption is below a certain threshold, an individual can mine without registering their operations.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|pakistan,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-24 09:16:22

She encouraged Britons to invest their savings into shares instead of cryptos. Gordon described crypto investing as “a non-productive asset”. “It doesn’t feed back into the economy,” she said, according to The Times report . “It should terrify all of us that over half of over-45s own crypto and no equities.” Further, she said that the UK should tax crypto buyers and scrap taxes on stock purchases in order to boost the economy. “I would love to see stamp duty cut on equities and applied to crypto.” UK’s Rapid Crypto Adoption Rate Per FCA research, more than seven million UK adults – roughly 12 per cent of the adult population – now own crypto, with both awareness and average portfolio values increasing year-over-year. Bivu Das, UK general manager at Kraken noted that the UK is “on the brink of mass crypto adoption,” after the crypto exchange recently secured an EMI license with the UK regulator. The UK jumped from 14th place in 2023 to 12th place in 2024, per Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index , despite the Financial Conduct Authority’s scrutiny of digital asset service providers in the country. Awareness and ownership of crypto is on the rise in the UK. Crypto is currently largely unregulated and high risk. If you buy crypto you should be prepared to lose all your money.

She added that many have “shifted to saving rather than investing,” which is “not going to fund a viable retirement.” Although, Gordon claimed that when compared to other markets like the US, Britain is a “safe haven.” Due to the US President Trump’s tariff threats and recession fears, the country has lost trillions of dollars in its stock market.

According to a statement shared with Cointelegraph, Dohrnii Labs deposited 12,649.99 Dohrnii (DHN) tokens — valued at more than $500,000 — with Blynex. On March 23, the company said it used 8,650 of those tokens as collateral for a 30-day loan in exchange for 80,000 Tether’s USDt ( USDT ). Dohrnii claims the exchange never delivered the USDT. Furthermore, the team said Blynex liquidated its entire 8,650 DHN position on Uniswap, receiving 149,151 USDT and causing a drop in the token’s market value. Attempts to withdraw the remaining 4,000 DHN tokens were unsuccessful, the company said. Source: Dohrnii Labs Blynex claims it was automated risk management Blynex co-founder Mike Baskes told Cointelegraph the incident was part of their “automated risk management system.” Baskes claimed their system detected a high risk that the collateral would drop significantly in the event of liquidation. The Blynex executive said that when the tokens were sold, it only generated 145,000 USDT instead of its original amount. He noted that DHN token liquidity was limited, estimating just $315,000 available at the time of the transaction. The executive claimed Blynex took action to prevent financial losses: “Given this liquidity constraint, the system recognized a high risk of further loss if the collateral wasn’t liquidated immediately, as the tokens would be difficult to sell at a favorable price in the current market.” Dohrnii Labs has challenged that explanation, calling Blynex’s justification “misleading” and alleging that the exchange liquidated collateral worth nearly double the value of the loan. Related: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization project Dohrnii Labs threatens legal action against Blynex In response, Dohrnii Labs filed the police report in the UAE and threatened to take legal action against the crypto exchange. A Dohrnii Labs representative told Cointelegraph that the police report was only a “first step.” The representative said if Blynex ignored their communications, they would legally escalate the matter: “Since the project and the individuals responsible are based in the UAE, we are also getting in touch with local regulators, including VARA, ADGM, and other relevant authorities. Furthermore, we’re in contact with other affected projects and are actively exploring the possibility of joint legal action.” The team said they want to ensure accountability through the legal system and regulatory oversight. Dohrnii told Cointelegraph that Blynex attempted to settle the matter by offering them 80,000 USDT and allowing the withdrawal of 4,000 DHN tokens. However, the exchange added a condition that the platform would drop all legal action. “That is unacceptable,” Dohrnii Labs said. “The 4,000 DHN tokens in question are user deposits — not negotiable assets. The right to withdraw these funds should never be up for discussion,” Dohrnii Labs added.

Giza’s automated financial strategies Unlike traditional automated strategies, Giza’s agents do not merely follow instructions prepared in advance; rather, they make independent decisions based on the available data to optimize liquidity flows and financial strategies in real time. The impact of this model is already visible, with over $6 million in transaction volume being generated through these agents — a 6.08x increase in capital productivity index. Likewise, more than 21,400 users are already leveraging personalized treasury managers to replace the one-size-fits-all vaults decentralized finance ( DeFi ) has traditionally been known for. Finally, nearly 40,000 on-chain transactions have been executed without human oversight and with no security incident. The future of liquidity on Giza Giza is building a future where static liquidity is replaced by intelligent capital that enables decentralized systems to operate automatically and democratize finance . To realize this vision, Giza will rely on liquid restaking token (LRT) agents to optimize restaking strategies in real time as well as adapt to yield curves and risk thresholds. Memecoin agents, on the other hand, will act as hyper-responsive market participants to mitigate volatility and provide more structured liquidity. In addition, delta-neutral agents will be responsible for market-making and hedging strategies across fragmented venues, while protocol-specific agents will automate complex financial primitives. Ecosystem agents will embed intelligence directly into rollups, appchains, and layer-2 ( L2 ) networks to ensure sustainable market activity. The future of Giza Tech Giza’s broader vision for the future thus revolves around a decentralized economy characterized by autonomous financial intelligence. In other words, agent-native wallet integrations will replace traditional dashboards and manual inputs to remove the need for constant execution micromanagement. As a result, DeFi solutions will become more accessible, with a network of autonomous agents working behind the scenes to address all complexity issues.

He stated that Layer2 protocols rely on L1s to access data and could include complex multi-sig updates and fraud proofs. The co-founder believes Layer 1 platforms such as Solana, Aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. Notably, Yakovenko’s claims come as markets debate scalability in the blockchain sector. L2 networks are crucial for platforms like Ethereum (ETH) as they improve transaction throughput. Solana’s co-founder believes L1 platforms can attain the objectives without the inadequacies inherent in L2s. Yakovenko challenges Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem The SOL co-founder criticized Ethereum’s capability to scale L2 solutions. Ethereum developers advocate for L2s to reduce gas charges and network congestion. Meanwhile, Solana optimizes its Layer1 infrastructure to handle multiple transactions without extra layers. The different approach to scaling has magnified competition between Solana and Ethereum. However, one user trusts Yakovenko’s claim could hurt innovation in the financial space. SOL price outlook Yakovenko’s remarks triggered interest in Solana. The blockchain has established itself as a rival to Ethereum’s L2 solutions with its speedy transactions and friendly costs. Meanwhile, analysts speculated SOL’s potential rebound as participants explore scalable Layer1 solutions. SOL displayed an upside stance at press time, gaining nearly 6% in the past day to $138.

Also, the MACD’s bullish crossover suggests extended upsides for Solana. The Relative Strength Index has approached the neutral region (50) after continued uptrends since March 10. The RSI’s upswings demonstrate strengthening momentum amid buyer resurgences. SOL should hold above $136 and test the level as support to confirm breakouts towards $150. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s performance might influence SOL’s actions. Bitcoin trades at $87,122, targeting the crucial resistance at $90K.

42256753,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142642,1742808292,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Signs: Bitcoin Trend Reversal Unleashed as Selling Pressure Eases – Matrixport Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-trend-reversal-analysis/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the crypto sphere! Are you feeling the market jitters lately? Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, might just be on the cusp of a significant shift. Leading crypto service provider Matrixport suggests that after a period of persistent downtrend, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing compelling signs of a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . Let’s dive into the factors fueling this optimistic outlook and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Is a Bitcoin Trend Reversal Truly on the Horizon? According to a recent report from JinSe Finance, Matrixport points towards a confluence of factors that are working in Bitcoin’s favor. These elements suggest that the relentless selling pressure that has characterized recent market activity might be finally abating, paving the way for a possible upturn. But what exactly are these factors? The Dovish Stance of the U.S. Federal Reserve One of the primary drivers cited by Matrixport is the evolving stance of the U.S. Federal Reserve. In recent times, the Fed has adopted a more ‘dovish’ approach to monetary policy. What does this mean for Bitcoin? A dovish Fed generally implies: Lower Interest Rates: A less hawkish stance often translates to maintaining or even lowering interest rates. Lower rates can make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income investments. Increased Liquidity: Dovish policies can inject more liquidity into the financial system. This increased liquidity can find its way into various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting demand for Bitcoin. Weaker Dollar: A dovish Fed can sometimes lead to a weaker U.S. dollar. As Bitcoin is often priced against the dollar, a weaker dollar can make Bitcoin relatively more appealing to investors holding other currencies. In essence, a dovish Federal Reserve can create a more favorable macroeconomic environment for Bitcoin to thrive. This shift in macroeconomic winds is a significant tailwind for a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . Trump’s Tariff Adjustments: An Unexpected Catalyst? Another intriguing factor highlighted by Matrixport is the impact of President Donald Trump’s targeted tariff adjustments. While seemingly unrelated to crypto, these adjustments can have ripple effects across global markets, indirectly influencing Bitcoin. How so? Economic Uncertainty: Tariffs can create economic uncertainty and volatility in traditional markets. In times of uncertainty, investors often look for alternative assets to hedge against risk. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, can be perceived as a safe haven asset in such scenarios. Dollar Volatility: Tariff policies can impact the strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned earlier, dollar fluctuations can directly influence Bitcoin’s price dynamics. Geopolitical Tensions: Trade disputes and tariffs can escalate geopolitical tensions. These tensions can drive investors towards decentralized and borderless assets like Bitcoin as a store of value, away from traditional assets more susceptible to political risks. While the connection might seem indirect, Trump’s tariff adjustments introduce an element of global economic and political uncertainty that can inadvertently bolster Bitcoin’s appeal and contribute to a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . Easing Selling Pressure: The End of the Downtrend? Beyond macroeconomic factors, Matrixport points to internal market dynamics within the crypto space itself that are signaling a change. Specifically, they mention the easing of selling pressure. What does this entail? Quarter-End Arbitrage Selling Subsides As the end of financial quarters approaches, institutional investors and arbitrage traders often engage in selling activities to rebalance portfolios or realize profits. This quarter-end selling pressure can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, Matrixport notes that as the current quarter nears its end, this arbitrage-driven selling pressure is beginning to subside. This reduction in sell-side pressure can remove a significant headwind for Bitcoin, allowing for potential upward movement and a crypto market analysis indicating a shift in momentum. Low Funding Rates: A Sign of Reduced Bearish Sentiment? Funding rates in perpetual futures markets provide insights into market sentiment. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying short positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while negative funding rates indicate the opposite. Matrixport highlights that funding rates are currently low. This can be interpreted as: Reduced Bearish Bets: Low funding rates can suggest that fewer traders are aggressively betting against Bitcoin. This diminished bearish sentiment can reduce selling pressure and create a more conducive environment for price appreciation. Potential for Short Squeezes: Low or negative funding rates can also set the stage for potential short squeezes. If positive catalysts emerge and the price starts to rise, short sellers might be forced to cover their positions, further amplifying upward price momentum. Low funding rates, therefore, are another indicator suggesting that the intense selling pressure might be waning, supporting the narrative of a possible Bitcoin trend reversal . Reduced Sell-offs: Are We Seeing Capitulation? Matrixport also notes a reduction in sell-offs. Large and rapid sell-offs often indicate panic selling or capitulation – a point where sellers have exhausted themselves, and the market might be poised for a turnaround. A decrease in these dramatic sell-offs could signify: Weak Hands Have Sold: Reduced sell-offs might suggest that the ‘weak hands’ – those more prone to panic selling – have already exited the market. This leaves behind a base of more resilient holders, reducing the likelihood of further sharp downward moves. Accumulation Phase: A period of reduced sell-offs can sometimes precede an accumulation phase, where strategic investors start to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices, anticipating future gains. The observed reduction in sell-offs, according to Matrixport, adds another layer of evidence to the argument that selling pressure is easing, and the market might be transitioning towards a more positive phase, potentially leading to a BTC price outlook improvement. Will These Factors Trigger a New All-Time High? While Matrixport suggests that these improved market conditions might not be enough to propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high immediately, they do indicate a significant improvement in the overall landscape. It’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. A crypto market analysis needs to be realistic. Table: Factors Supporting Potential Bitcoin Trend Reversal Factor Potential Impact on Bitcoin Dovish U.S. Federal Reserve Increased liquidity, lower interest rates, potentially weaker dollar – favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin. Trump’s Tariff Adjustments Increased economic uncertainty, dollar volatility, geopolitical tensions – can drive investors to Bitcoin as a hedge. Easing Quarter-End Arbitrage Selling Reduced sell-side pressure, allowing for potential price recovery. Low Funding Rates Reduced bearish sentiment, potential for short squeezes. Reduced Sell-offs Sign of potential capitulation, stronger holder base, possible accumulation phase. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does this mean for you as a crypto investor? Here are some actionable insights based on Matrixport’s analysis and the current market conditions: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, especially pronouncements from the Federal Reserve and global trade policies. These factors can significantly impact the crypto market. Monitor Funding Rates: Pay attention to funding rates in Bitcoin perpetual futures markets. Sustained low or negative funding rates, coupled with positive price action, can signal potential upward momentum. Analyze On-Chain Data: Track on-chain metrics like exchange flows and whale activity. Significant reductions in exchange inflows and accumulation by large holders can be positive indicators. Manage Risk: While the outlook might be improving, the crypto market remains volatile. Practice sound risk management principles, diversify your portfolio, and avoid over-leveraging. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, consider employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to gradually build your position, especially during periods of perceived market bottoming. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin? Matrixport’s analysis offers a hopeful perspective on Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. The combination of a potentially more dovish Federal Reserve, the unpredictable influence of global trade policies, and easing internal selling pressure within the crypto market presents a compelling case for a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . While the path to new all-time highs might still be some distance away, the signs of improved market conditions are undeniable. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this could signal a crucial turning point – a moment to reassess, strategize, and potentially capitalize on the evolving dynamics of the crypto market analysis . Keep your eyes peeled on market movements and stay nimble – the crypto landscape is ever-changing, and opportunities often arise when least expected.

Considering the fact that there are only nine more days to go before the activation of Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan, this week’s economic events will explain how prepared the US economy is to absorb the impact of the aggressive policy. Let’s analyze the top economic events of the week and how they will impact the cryptocurrency market. Ready? Top Economic Events in the US This Week S&P Global Manufacturing PMI On Monday, March 24, the US S&P Global Composite PMI Flash, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI Flash and S&P Global Services PMI Flash indices will be released. The Global Composite PMI Flash index slipped from 52.7 to 51.6 in February. The Manufacturing PMI index surged from 51.2 to 52.7, and the Services PMI dropped from 52.9 to 51 in the same month. The expectation is that the Composite index would drop to 51.5, the Manufacturing index would decline to 52.1, and the Services index would grow to 51.1. CB Consumer Confidence Data The Conference Board Consumer Confidence index, which measures the level of confidence consumers have in the economy, will be released on Tuesday, March 25. In the previous month, the index was around 98.3. The expectation is that it would decrease from 98.3 to 94.4 or even 94. A drop in consumer confidence can negatively impact stock markets, which could then spill over into the crypto market. New House Sales On Tuesday, March 25, the market will also witness some other impactful events as well. The release of the US New House Sales index is a prominent one that demands attention. In January, the index declined from 734K units to 657K units. The market consensus expects that the index would rise from 657K to either 660K or even 680K. Strong housing sales reflect a healthy economy, and a healthy economy can create a climate where investors feel more comfortable investing in riskier assets like crypto. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today: Bitcoin, Altcoins Recover from Trump’s Tariff Shock , US GDP Growth Rate The US GDP Growth Rate QoQ Final will be released on Thursday, March 27. The market consensus expects that it would decline from 3.1% to 2.3% in Q4. A lower GDP growth rate indicates a slowing economy. This can trigger fears of a recession or economic instability. If the economy slows down, people are less likely to invest in risky assets. PCE Price Index The US Core PCE Price Index MoM, which tracks the changes in prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the US (excluding food and energy costs), will be released on Friday, March 28. In January, it grew from 0.2% to 0.3%. The market consensus expects that the index would remain unchanged this time. In conclusion, these key US economic events will influence the cryptocurrency market through market sentiment and liquidity shifts. A drop in consumer confidence or GDP growth could trigger risk-off sentiment, reducing demand for crypto. However, strong housing sales and stable inflation data may encourage risk appetite, benefiting Bitcoin and altcoins. Investors should watch for market reactions to economic reports, as volatility could rise depending on actual data versus expectations. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

When ETH launched in 2015 at $0.75, it took years before skyrocketing to over $4,800, rewarding patient holders. Now, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum after launching its presale. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 60% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $4.5 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 6400 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. MUTM could be the fastest wealth-building opportunity in less than 5 months. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 6400 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $4.5 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Ethereum’s early investors waited years for exponential gains, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an opportunity to achieve life-changing returns in a fraction of the time. With over 6,400 investors, $4.5 million raised, and a presale price set to rise from $0.02 to $0.025 before launching at $0.06, early adopters stand to gain up to 200%. Don’t miss out, join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your share before the next price increase.

While major institutions continue to embrace Ethereum for asset tokenization, on-chain data suggests a cooling in network usage — raising questions about how the protocol balances long-term utility, value capture, and its role amid the growing prominence of Layer 2 solutions. Fidelity Joins Blockchain Race with Ethereum-Based Tokenized Money Market Fund Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s largest asset managers with $5.8 trillion under management, is making a significant leap into blockchain technology by filing to tokenize one of its money market funds on Ethereum. This move aligns Fidelity with other financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton in a growing trend that is reshaping the traditional finance landscape through blockchain-based asset tokenization. In a March 21 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fidelity revealed plans to introduce an Ethereum-based tokenized share class — dubbed “OnChain” — for its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), an $80 million vehicle invested predominantly in US Treasury bills. The OnChain class aims to provide transparent, verifiable tracking of share transactions via Ethereum’s public blockchain, without altering the official record-keeping process maintained by traditional means. While regulatory approval is still pending, Fidelity noted that the OnChain share class is expected to launch on May 30, 2025. The OnChain initiative is not a direct tokenization of the underlying US Treasury bills themselves. Instead, it represents a blockchain-based layer of transactional transparency — akin to a mirror ledger — allowing stakeholders to trace movements of shares while maintaining the original ownership records through book-entry systems. Fidelity emphasized that the blockchain entries will not replace the official ownership ledger. Rather, a transfer agent will reconcile the blockchain data with official records on a daily basis, ensuring accuracy and regulatory compliance. The strategic embrace of Ethereum by Fidelity further cements the blockchain’s position as the network of choice for institutional adoption. Ethereum already hosts over $3.3 billion worth of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) — by far the largest share among all blockchain networks, according to analytics from rwa.xyz. Tokenization of real-world assets, particularly US Treasury bills, bonds, and private credit, has become a growing focus among asset managers in recent years. The market for tokenized Treasury products now stands at $4.78 billion, led by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which alone holds $1.46 billion in tokenized value. Franklin Templeton, another early mover in this space, has also made headlines by tokenizing parts of its money market funds. Fidelity’s entry into this arena not only validates the movement but also adds immense credibility to the thesis that blockchain technology is becoming integral to modern asset management infrastructure. Fidelity also hinted at future expansions of the OnChain platform to other blockchains, though Ethereum remains the centerpiece for now. Ethereum: The “Natural Default” for TradFi Tokenization The dominance of Ethereum in the tokenized asset space was recently reaffirmed by Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Crypto. Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 20, Mitchnick stated unequivocally that Ethereum was the obvious choice for launching tokenized financial products. “There was no question that the blockchain we would start our tokenization on would be Ethereum, and that’s not just a BlackRock thing, that’s the natural default answer,” Mitchnick said. He cited Ethereum’s credibility, decentralization, and security as key factors that give it a competitive edge in institutional adoption. His remarks signal a growing consensus in the traditional finance sector — Ethereum is not just a speculative asset platform, but the foundational layer for the next generation of financial infrastructure. Fidelity’s move may serve as a catalyst for more widespread institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial products. As trust builds around the technology’s transparency and efficiency, more funds — ranging from Treasuries to corporate debt and private equity — could find their way onto blockchains. Moreover, tokenized funds offer numerous benefits to investors, such as near-instant settlement, 24/7 trading, and improved liquidity, all of which contrast starkly with the friction-prone nature of traditional financial markets. As of now, the OnChain class is not available for direct trading on decentralized exchanges. However, the infrastructure being laid out by firms like Fidelity and BlackRock suggests that a future where tokenized assets are freely tradable across global markets — both institutional and retail — may not be far off. Ethereum Burn Rate Hits Historic Low as Network Activity Slumps In other news, Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, is showing signs of significantly reduced demand as network activity declines across the board. The amount of ETH burned on Saturday as part of Ethereum’s transaction fee mechanism hit an all-time low of just 53.07 ETH — a stark indicator of waning usage of Ethereum’s blockspace. This dramatic slowdown in ETH burning reflects broader declines in on-chain activity, with key metrics such as active addresses, transaction volumes, and new address creation all trending downward in recent weeks. The ETH burning mechanism was introduced with EIP-1559 in August 2021, a pivotal update that restructured Ethereum’s transaction fee model. Under the new system, users pay a base fee for each transaction, which is algorithmically adjusted based on network demand. Crucially, this base fee is burned — permanently removing ETH from circulation — with the intent to offset inflation and, during high usage, potentially make Ethereum a deflationary asset. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism is heavily dependent on network activity. The more transactions occur, the more ETH is burned. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the burn rate drops — and that's exactly what’s happening now. According to data from Ultrasound.money, based on current burn rates, Ethereum’s supply is now projected to grow by 0.76% annually — signaling a return to net inflationary dynamics. The low burn rate is just one symptom of Ethereum’s recent malaise. The seven-day moving average of active addresses has fallen to its lowest level since October 2024. Similarly, new address creations, daily transaction counts, and on-chain volume have all seen marked declines throughout March. These metrics point to a broad cooling-off period for Ethereum’s mainnet, despite the proliferation of Layer 2 solutions — scaling platforms built atop Ethereum to reduce congestion and fees. Layer 2s Gaining Traction — at Ethereum’s Expense? One factor in Ethereum’s on-chain slowdown may ironically be the success of its Layer 2 ecosystem. Platforms such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base (developed by Coinbase) have grown rapidly in scale and adoption, siphoning off transactions that would have otherwise been processed directly on Ethereum’s base layer. This shift has led some analysts to question the long-term economic impact on Ethereum’s mainnet. Notably, Standard Chartered recently slashed its Ethereum price target for 2025 from $10,000 to $4,000, citing the rise of Layer 2s and their increasing control over Ethereum’s transaction flow. While some see the decline in activity as temporary — perhaps a result of broader market cooldowns or anticipation of future upgrades — others view it as a structural shift in Ethereum’s role within its own ecosystem. As more users and developers migrate to faster, cheaper Layer 2 chains, the base layer risks becoming a low-volume settlement layer rather than a vibrant hub of decentralized activity. Still, Ethereum’s core developers have long anticipated this shift and continue to prioritize upgrades that will optimize the network’s role as a secure, decentralized foundation for scalable blockchain applications. The question now is whether Ethereum can continue to deliver enough economic value to support its long-term bullish thesis — particularly as competitors like Solana and Avalanche push forward with their own low-cost, high-speed networks. Ethereum’s burn mechanism was hailed as a game-changer in 2021, with early post-EIP-1559 burn rates triggering speculation about ETH becoming a “ultrasound money.” But as this past weekend’s record-low burn shows, the mechanism’s power is tied directly to user demand — and that demand appears to be fading, at least for now. Unless usage picks up, either via a broader crypto market rally, major application launches, or a new wave of institutional interest, Ethereum’s supply may continue to inflate — challenging a key pillar of the bullish ETH narrative.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 09:30:00

From macroeconomic indicators to significant protocol upgrades and regulatory deadlines, here are the key points to watch in the week ahead. #1 Crypto Awaits February PCE Inflation Data – Friday All eyes in the crypto sphere remain on macroeconomic signals, with the release of February’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation figures scheduled for Friday, March 28. This metric is widely recognized as the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, and analysts say it could prove critical for short-term price action across digital assets. Economists predict core PCE (which excludes food and energy) to register between 0.3% and 0.4% month-over-month, translating to an annualized rate potentially near 2.6%–2.8%. As for headline PCE, forecasts suggest a year-over-year range of 2.5%–2.7%, with a monthly gain of around 0.3%. These projections come on the heels of January’s data (2.5% headline, 2.6% core) and reflect ongoing inflationary pressures spurred by, among other factors, tariff policies championed by US President Donald Trump. Should the PCE print higher than expected, it may bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to keep its policy rate elevated—signaling a potentially delayed timeline for any rate cuts beyond June. #2 Grayscale’s Spot Solana ETF – Monday Regulatory clarity around crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to be a focal point for investors , especially in the altcoin arena. Two weeks ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed decisions on several Solana (SOL) ETFs (including those by 21Shares, Canary, and VanEck). Now, the next deadline for the Commission to act on Grayscale’s proposed spot Solana ETF (GSOL) arrives on March 23. Grayscale filed in December 2024 to convert its existing Grayscale Solana Trust into an ETF, and NYSE Arca intends to list the product under the ticker “GSOL.” The SEC acknowledged an amended 19b-4 filing on February 6, which appeared in the Federal Register on February 18. #3 AAVE Buybacks Rumored To Start Decentralized finance (DeFi) mainstay Aave could see heightened price activity if rumors of impending crypto token buybacks pan out. Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), revealed that the governance proposal to revamp the Aave protocol’s tokenomics—known as Aavenomics—has passed quorum.Zeller said: “If the implementation, review & AIP vote is done on time, SAAVE buybacks will likely start this month.” The Aavenomics framework introduces a “fee switch,” enabling the protocol to share part of its revenue with staked token holders. A core component is a “Buy & Distribute” process, which, according to the proposal, would allocate $1 million from Aave’s excess revenue every week for six months to buy back AAVE tokens. These tokens would then be distributed to participants who have staked or locked their AAVE. Community support has been overwhelming, with over 813,000 votes in favor of the proposal against just three votes opposing it. Aave co-founder Stani Kulechov described the initiative as a “fee switch on steroids,” and Zeller called it the “most important proposal in ACI history.” Traders are now eagerly awaiting an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) vote for final implementation. #4 Ethereum’s Pectra Activates On Hoodi – Wednesday Ethereum developers continue their march toward enhanced scalability and functionality with the Pectra upgrade, scheduled to go live on the newly launched Hoodi testnet on March 26. Last week, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko confirmed the details: “A new testnet, Hoodi, has been launched to help wrap up Pectra testing. Stakers, this is your new testing ground Pectra will activate on it next Wednesday (March 26). Holesky will be maintained until September. It still works to test everything, except for validator exits.” Pectra , a combination of the Prague and Electra upgrades, aims to bring several significant features, including transaction batching, crypto gas fee payments in ERC-20 tokens, sponsored transactions, a higher staking limit, and blobspace expansion to improve scalability. If Hoodi’s fork is successful, mainnet activation could follow roughly 30 days later, potentially as early as April 25. #5 XRP Lawsuit – All Eyes On Ripple In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to drop its appeal against Ripple as of March 24, 2025, attention now turns to Ripple’s cross-appeal . Filed in October 2024, this cross-appeal seeks to overturn both the $125 million fine and the ruling that institutional XRP sales constituted securities offerings. With the SEC’s appeal off the table, Ripple must decide whether to proceed with its own challenge. If it does, its response brief is due by April 16, 2025. Should Ripple continue, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals will review the penalty and institutional sales ruling. If the crypto firm chooses to withdraw, the August 2024 judgment becomes final—meaning a $125 million fine stands, but no securities violation for programmatic sales. At press time, BTC traded at $87,330.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto Watchlist|cryptocurrencies|Weekly Crypto Preview|Weekly Crypto Watchlist,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-24 09:30:38

Although Cardano (ADA) has long been regarded as a powerful competitor, its delayed price action and continuous network development issues make it less tempting than newly developing alternatives. Instead, three tokens— Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX)—are offering profitable prospects. Now at less than $0.50, each of these cryptocurrencies could explode 34x, transforming a $1,200 investment into an astounding $40,800 before ADA ever targets $5. Rexas Finance (RXS) – The Top Pick for a 34x Surge Leading the charge among low-priced tokens, Rexas Finance (RXS) is drawing interest as a new platform bridging the digital and real-world asset (RWA) markets. With only a few clicks, the initiative lets users tokenize almost any real-world asset—from real estate and intellectual property to commodities and art—enabling worldwide ownership. This unique value proposition has attracted much investor interest, hence its presale, which is propelled through several stages with exponential expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) has jumped over 6x from its starting price, generating an impressive $47.15 million. It is currently in its last presale stage at $0.20. RXS is scheduled to open at $0.25 on June 19, 2025; it has already sold at about 91.15% of the present stage. Experts estimate that given the fast demand, RXS will soar 34x post-launch and reach over $6.80. This makes a $1,200 investment prime potential for exponential development since it would become $40,800. Rexas Finance (RXS) has more legitimacy since Certik has thoroughly audited it, boosting investor confidence. The ongoing $1 million giveaway on its site, which already draws over 1.64 million entries, shows the project's increasing appeal even more. Rising in the vanguard of the RWA revolution and scheduled for a significant gathering, RXS is the best token to watch in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Memecoin with a Strong Community After a minor decline, Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at about $0.19. Based on past price movements, DOGE can significantly increase during optimistic cycles. DOGE's expansion depends on its general acceptance and encouragement by influential people. DOGE payments are becoming increasingly integrated into companies, and as the crypto market picks up positive momentum, its price might skyrocket. Strong breakouts over critical resistance levels—about $0.26—could set off a 34x rally that would drive DOGE's price past $6.70. DOGE is still an excellent choice for investors seeking a well-known but very explosive asset. Although ADA's slow ascent toward $5 could take longer, DOGE's volatility offers quick returns that might turn a $1,200 investment into $40,800 should the historical trend repeat. Tron (TRX) – The Blockchain Powerhouse with Steady Growth TRX has established a firm basis with actual use cases, unlike other cryptocurrencies that primarily rely on hype, especially in the digital entertainment and decentralized finance (DeFi) industries. TRX, which is currently trading at $0.24, has maintained a positive trend and increased by 7.84% over the week. It's growing acceptance and almost $700 million of 24-hour trading activity indicate great market confidence. Tron's blockchain's rising usage for DeFi protocols and stablecoin transactions highlights its long-term viability even more. Under appropriate market conditions, TRX might have a breakout that increases its price 34x, above $8.10. This would reflect the spectacular rises of past bull runs, enabling investors to turn a $1,200 investment into an impressive $40,800. With its solid technical basis and continuous advancements, TRX is a potential cryptocurrency worth looking at for significant returns. Conclusion Although Cardano (ADA) has the potential to reach $5, its slower growth rate makes it less tempting to investors looking for quick gains. For a 34x surge in the near term, Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX) stand out as the best choices. Among these, Rexas Finance (RXS) is the most exciting because of its creative real-world asset tokenizing approach, excellent presale performance, and forthcoming launch at $0.25. RXS provides the best chance to turn a $1,200 investment into $40,800 since professionals estimate a jump over $6.80. Securing holdings in these three tokens before their expected breakouts will help those wishing to profit from the forthcoming crypto bull run maximize returns.

Other major cryptocurrencies also posted strong gains: XRP (XRP): +3% to $2.46 Solana (SOL): +5.6 up to $138 GMCI 30 Index: +3%, tracks top 30 cryptocurrencies Markets Rebound as Trade War Fears Ease The rally came as investors digested recent signals from the White House that appeared to be taking a more “targeted” approach rather than a broad implementation of Trump’s proposed tariffs, according to Bloomberg. The administration’s softened stance has eased fears of an all-out trade war, providing support for risk assets including cryptocurrencies and stocks. “Crypto markets are rallying as investors respond positively to Trump’s more cooperative stance on tariffs set to go into effect on April 2 and the Federal Reserve’s focus on long-term inflation trends,” said Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research. Economic Data Boosts Investor Confidence Recent economic indicators have also reassured investors that the U.S. economy remains resilient despite concerns about tariffs. Key data highlights include: US Jobless Claims: Increased slightly by 2,000 to 223,000, indicating that the labor market remains strong. February Inflation Data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation slowing to 2.8%, a positive sign for Federal Reserve policy expectations. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-flashes-td-sequential-buy-signal-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted a TD Sequential buy signal on XRP’s four-hour chart, signaling a potential short-term price rebound. The appearance of a buy signal suggests that the ongoing downward momentum may be weakening, which could lead to a recovery. Ali shared a chart of XRP/USDT on Binance, showcasing the formation of the buy signal and hinting that the asset might be preparing for a bounce. He stated that this could mark the beginning of a short-term uptrend, drawing attention from traders monitoring XRP’s price movements. $XRP just flashed a TD Sequential buy signal on the 4-hour chart. This could be the start of a short-term rebound pic.twitter.com/PXERVCxbPI — Ali (@ali_charts) March 22, 2025 Market Reactions Remain Divided Despite the technical buy signal, the reaction from the crypto community was mixed. Some traders were skeptical, arguing that XRP has struggled to sustain meaningful rallies and that selling pressure remains a major hurdle. One user pointed out that XRP often experiences short-lived price increases but usually vanishes within 48 hours, making it difficult for the asset to maintain an upward trajectory. They also mentioned that significant supply above the $2.50 level acts as strong resistance, limiting XRP’s ability to break higher. Others echoed concerns about the broader market environment, emphasizing that current conditions do not support an explosive bull run. They argued that XRP’s price movements have become highly volatile, resembling a pattern of quick spikes followed by equally rapid declines. This sentiment reflects a broader uncertainty among traders regarding whether XRP can sustain any recovery soon. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ali responded to the skepticism by pointing to XRP’s historical price performance, reminding traders that the asset had previously surged from $0.40 to $3.40. He suggested that such a price increase was a clear example of an explosive rally, contradicting claims that XRP no longer has the potential for strong upward moves. Current Market Conditions and Outlook Despite the TD Sequential buy signal, XRP has not shown any strong signs of a reversal. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.36, reflecting a 1.69% decline in the last 24 hours. The price action remains subdued, with the asset hovering around a key support level. While some traders see the TD Sequential signal as a reason for optimism, others remain cautious, noting that XRP has struggled to break through resistance in recent weeks. The broader market sentiment could aid in determining whether XRP can sustain any potential rebound. If Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies fail to maintain strength, XRP could face continued pressure. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ripple is making waves again, but some investors are turning their attention to Remittix, a next-gen payment solution promising faster transactions, lower fees, and a potential 5000% rally. Table of Contents Ripple: Is the long-awaited breakout finally coming? Remittix redefines cross-border transactions Investors secure their RTX tokens Ripple (XRP) is back in the headlines, with analysts throwing out bold predictions of a surge to $9 or even $10 in 2025. With legal clouds clearing and payment adoption rising, XRP finally seems poised for a serious breakout. But as hype builds, many investors are looking past Ripple and eyeing what some are calling its more scalable, next-gen rival: Remittix (RTX). With faster transactions, lower fees, and a PayFi model designed for practical real-world use, Remittix is aiming to leap ahead. And with talk of a potential 5000% rally, it might just pull it off. Ripple: Is the long-awaited breakout finally coming? Ripple has been hovering in the shadows for a while, but it might be ready to step into the spotlight after a 4.8% lift in the last week. After clearing most of its legal mess with the SEC, Ripple is starting to look like a legit comeback story. It’s still trading well below its all-time high, but analysts over at FXStreet recently pointed to a bullish setup that could send XRP flying toward the $9–$10 range in 2025, especially if macro trends stay in its favor. On the tech side, Ripple is doubling down on cross-border payment infrastructure with enhanced Liquidity Hub integrations and CBDC collaborations, aiming to make XRP the go-to bridge asset for institutional money. They’re also working on upgrading the XRPL’s smart contract capabilities to compete more directly with Ethereum and Solana. If those features roll out smoothly and adoption picks up, Ripple might finally deliver on the potential it’s been teasing for years. Still, with competition heating up, it’s now or never.

Remittix redefines cross-border transactions Crypto has long been marketed as the future of money, yet spending digital assets remains inconvenient and costly. That’s where Remittix is doing things differently. By providing instant crypto-to-FIAT conversion, Remittix allows users to send funds directly to any bank account without delays, hidden costs, or unnecessary complications. For Luis, a freelancer in Argentina, these issues meant that his stablecoin salary from international clients was stuck in processing before he could access it in Pesos. Now, with Remittix, he receives his funds instantly, avoiding the wait and hidden fees. Similarly, Rachel, an expat in Germany, previously had to pay high remittance fees just to send money back home to her family in the Philippines. With Remittix, she now transfers stablecoins, and her family receives Pesos in their bank account within hours, without losing a large chunk to intermediaries. With financial institutions increasing their grip on transaction monitoring, more users are seeking ways to move their money securely and privately. Remittix provides a solution that prioritizes user control. When transactions are processed through Remittix, the recipient receives a standard bank deposit with no visible connection to cryptocurrency, allowing for greater financial privacy without interference. For individuals in regions with heavy banking restrictions, this feature offers a valuable way to maintain control over personal finances. Investors secure their RTX tokens With over $14 million already raised, the Remittix presale is moving quickly, and RTX tokens remain available at $0.0734 for now. Analysts anticipate an 800% increase before the presale concludes, with a further rally expected after the launch. As blockchain payments become a mainstream necessity, Remittix is primed to capitalize on this shift, providing a frictionless bridge between crypto and real-world finance. For investors hoping to stay ahead of the curve, this certainly isn’t a project to overlook in 2025. To learn more about Remittix, visit its website and socials.

Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto recently highlighted this development , pointing out that XRP is on track to complete a Full Body Candle formation for the quarterly close. If this scenario unfolds as predicted, it will mark a significant moment in XRP’s price history, signaling strong bullish momentum. EGRAG Crypto’s analysis is based on a linear regression framework applied to a logarithmic scale. It forecasts potential price targets for XRP between $6.4 and $27.5 by March or November 2025. This projection is rooted in technical indicators such as Fibonacci retracement levels, historical price movements, and momentum shifts in the broader cryptocurrency market. #XRP – Quarterly Close: In the next 7 days, #XRP is on track to complete a Full Body Candle formation for the quarterly close (Q1 2025), marking its first-ever all-time high in the history of #XRP ! ………………. and you wonder why I’m so #bullish ! #XRPFamily STAY… pic.twitter.com/HM6pmPKi9w — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 23, 2025 XRP’s Current Market Performance As of report time, XRP trades around $2.46, with intraday price swings between $2.39 and $2.47. This upward momentum aligns with EGRAG Crypto’s previous forecasts, suggesting that XRP could enter a significant price discovery phase. The cryptocurrency market, particularly assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has witnessed renewed bullish activity, further strengthening the case for XRP’s continued growth. As capital flows into the market, XRP’s ability to sustain its bullish trajectory will depend on various factors, including investor sentiment, liquidity, and technical support levels. Key Factors Driving XRP’s Bullish Momentum Regulatory Clarity and Legal Developments: One of the most significant drivers behind XRP’s bullish momentum is its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been engaged in a high-profile lawsuit regarding whether XRP should be classified as a security. Recent legal victories for Ripple have improved market confidence. Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Beyond legal battles, XRP’s technological evolution is another major factor influencing its price trajectory. Ripple launched RLUSD , a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on the XRP Ledger. This move will enhance liquidity, facilitate cross-border payments, and improve XRP’s utility within the crypto ecosystem. Furthermore, the XRP Ledger’s continued development—including enhancements to on-chain liquidity, smart contracts, and interoperability with other blockchain networks—positions XRP as a key player in the digital finance landscape. These advancements could further solidify XRP’s role as a bridge asset for global financial institutions. Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence in institutional interest, with major firms increasing their exposure to digital assets. XRP, in particular, has attracted attention due to its unique use case in cross-border payments. Historically, XRP has been recognized for its ability to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions, making it a valuable asset for financial institutions seeking efficient payment solutions. With increasing global adoption of blockchain-based financial services, XRP’s value proposition is becoming more attractive to institutional investors.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent legal victories, the regulatory landscape for XRP remains uncertain. Any unexpected setbacks in Ripple’s legal proceedings could negatively impact price momentum. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and price fluctuations are common. A sudden shift in market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, or Bitcoin’s price action could influence XRP’s trajectory. Competitive Landscape: While XRP holds a strong position in the payment sector, competition from emerging blockchain projects could impact its adoption rate and market dominance. A Defining Moment for XRP As XRP approaches its Q1 2025 quarterly close, it stands on the verge of making history with its first-ever all-time high at a quarterly level. EGRAG Crypto’s projections, supported by technical analysis, regulatory progress, and ecosystem growth, suggest that XRP could be poised for a transformative phase. However, while the technical indicators and market conditions point toward a bullish scenario, investors should remain cautious and well-informed. Given cryptocurrencies’ inherent volatility, conducting thorough research and maintaining a balanced investment approach is essential. Whether XRP successfully closes the quarter with a full-body candle and reaches new price heights remains to be seen. But one thing is sure—this moment could be a turning point in XRP’s history.

On-chain indicators are also showing strength with ETH exchange supplies falling significantly. Ethereum Price Recovery Very Soon? Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Patel stated that Ethereum’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached extreme oversold levels. Previously, only on two such occasions, the ETH RSI has hit these low levels. “This oversold signal has consistently preceded massive multi-week rallies,” Patel noted in a recent statement. Source: Crypto Patel As Ethereum continues to trade below key resistance levels, this historical trend suggests the potential for a substantial price rebound in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the analyst has advised investors to buy every dip ahead. “Accumulate every dip between $2,000 and $1,300,” Patel advised. He said that this range provides a significant buying opportunity for long-term investors. Thus, he laid out a bullish roadmap for Ethereum price, targeting a price of $12,000. ETH On-Chain Metrics Show Strength The strength in ETH’s on-chain metrics has helped the Ethereum price reclaim $2,000 levels recently. As of press time, ETH price is trading at $2,082 with daily trading volumes surging 60.6% to over $10.89 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that the ETH futures open interest has surged 6.66% to $21.61 billion. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reported a significant surge in Ethereum (ETH) whale activity. Over the past week, large investors have accumulated approximately 470,000 ETH, reflecting strong confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. This surge in the whale accumulation shows heightened interest in Ethereum among institutional players. Source: Ali Martinez Additionally, Martinez also stated that more than 1.2 million ETH coins have left exchanges over the past 48 days. This comes amid the heightened demand for ETH staking in recent times. ETH Downside Remains Protected On the other hand, the downside for Ethereum remains protected amid heavy accumulation for the altcoin. On-chain data reveals that more than 3 million investors have accumulated 6.12 million Ethereum (ETH) in the price range of $1,886 to $1,944. This activity establishes this range as a critical support level for Ethereum price. Markets analyst have shared an ETH price prediction expecting ETH to flirt above $2,000 for the next month before any decisive rally ahead.

In South Korea, this question is sparking a heated debate, with the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), stepping into the ring. They’re raising serious red flags about the potential conflict of interest inherent in crypto exchanges’ ability to remove tokens from their platforms. Let’s dive into why this is a crucial issue for the Korean crypto market and what it could mean for investors. Unpacking the Controversy: Crypto Exchange Delisting Power Under Scrutiny At the heart of the matter is the significant authority wielded by crypto exchanges in South Korea. DPK lawmaker Min Byoung-dug voiced these concerns directly at a National Assembly meeting on March 24th, emphasizing that the power to delist tokens raises fundamental questions about the fairness and transparency of exchange operations. This isn’t just about theoretical concerns; it’s about real-world impact on investors and the integrity of the Korean crypto market . Here’s a breakdown of the key points raised by the DPK: Conflict of Interest: The core argument is that exchanges, by having the power to delist tokens, might be influenced by their own financial interests or biases, potentially harming investors who hold those tokens. Lack of Transparency: The criteria and processes for delisting tokens are often opaque, leading to uncertainty and a lack of accountability. Market Dominance: The concentration of power in a few major exchanges amplifies these concerns, as their decisions can have a disproportionate impact on the entire market. Lawmaker Kang Jun-hyeon further highlighted the structural imbalance within the Korean crypto landscape. He pointed out that while crypto investments are primarily accessible to individuals, the real power lies firmly with the exchanges. This creates a scenario where retail investors are potentially vulnerable to decisions made by centralized entities. This imbalance is a critical aspect of the ongoing discussion around South Korea crypto regulation . Why is Crypto Exchange Delisting a Problem? Delisting isn’t just a procedural matter; it can have significant consequences for token holders. Imagine investing in a cryptocurrency, only to find out it’s being delisted from a major exchange. What could happen? Price Crash: Delisting often triggers a sharp decline in the token’s price as investors rush to sell before trading ceases on the exchange. Liquidity Issues: Once delisted, it becomes harder to trade the token, leading to liquidity problems and making it difficult to sell at a fair price. Loss of Investment: In extreme cases, especially for smaller or less liquid tokens, delisting can lead to significant or even total loss of investment for holders. Erosion of Trust: Frequent or seemingly arbitrary delistings can erode trust in the crypto market and exchanges themselves. These potential downsides underscore the importance of clear, fair, and transparent delisting processes. It’s not just about protecting investors financially; it’s about fostering a healthy and sustainable opposition party crypto ecosystem. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation in South Korea? The DPK’s criticism signals a growing political awareness of the issues within the crypto sector in South Korea. This could be a precursor to more stringent South Korea crypto regulation aimed at: Enhanced Transparency: Demanding exchanges to publicly disclose their delisting criteria and processes. Independent Oversight: Exploring the possibility of an independent body to oversee delisting decisions, reducing potential conflicts of interest. Investor Protection Measures: Implementing stronger safeguards to protect investors from the negative impacts of delisting. Fair Market Practices: Promoting fair competition and preventing excessive concentration of power within the crypto exchange industry. The debate around crypto exchange delisting power is part of a broader global conversation about regulating the cryptocurrency industry. As crypto adoption grows, governments worldwide are grappling with how to balance innovation with investor protection and market stability. South Korea, being a major player in the crypto space, is at the forefront of these discussions. The stance taken by the opposition party indicates a potential shift towards stricter oversight, aiming to create a more equitable and trustworthy environment for crypto in the nation. The coming months could be pivotal for the future of Korean crypto market regulation. Whether the DPK’s concerns will translate into concrete policy changes remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the spotlight is now firmly on crypto exchange practices, and the pressure for greater transparency and accountability is mounting.

He built a company in the ‘80s, gave his product away for free, turned that into a fortune, walked away, and then spent decades running from governments, building private compounds, hacking police, dodging assassination attempts, and predicting his own death. On June 23, 2021, Spanish authorities found him dead in a prison cell after the United States requested his extradition for tax evasion. He was 75. Johnny was born in 1945 in England and raised in Virginia, where his father, a violent alcoholic, died by gunshot when John was 15. John found the body himself. The story people don’t tell is that some believe John pulled the trigger. Nobody could prove it. What’s confirmed is that he was already brilliant. In the 1960s, NASA brought him on to work on the Apollo missions. While others were just learning to type, John was coding software that helped launch astronauts to the moon. McAfee created antivirus, became rich, then disappeared In the 1980s, John was working at Lockheed Martin, drinking hard but still ahead of his peers in tech. In 1986, when the world’s first computer virus, called Brain, started spreading, John locked himself in his apartment, cracked it, and built a tool to destroy it. He named it McAfee Antivirus. He gave it away for free, knowing companies would pay to keep using it. By the early 1990s, 67% of the world’s biggest corporations were using it. They were paying millions. By 47, Johnny was a multimillionaire. At his peak, Johnny made Forbes’ Top 100 list with a net worth of $100 million. He left the company in 1994, selling all his shares. Then, he vanished from the corporate world. He used his fortune to buy properties, luxury cars, and a helicopter he used to fly to work. He moved to Belize, where he built a private compound guarded by ex-soldiers, equipped with its own surveillance network and personal drug lab. According to John, people in power were after him. That paranoia led him to hack police radios, monitor government offices, and create systems to spy on everyone. By the mid-2000s, locals in Belize were scared of him. Rumors began spreading that Johnny was testing drugs, experimenting with weapons, and possibly involved in human trafficking. John David McAfee. Source: John McAfee X/Twitter Then, his neighbor was shot in the head. John was the main suspect. He ran. He took his girlfriend, who had originally been hired to assassinate him. Instead, she fell in love and joined him. While on the run, Johnny sent free laptops to government workers—each rigged with spyware. He claimed to have hacked into multiple government systems, including Hillary Clinton’s office. He told people he had information that could bring powerful figures down. When Guatemalan police arrested him in 2012, he faked a heart attack to stall for time, then escaped. When asked why he was running, John said, “If they catch me, they’ll kill me.” Johnny used the growing Bitcoin market to rebuild his wealth. He endorsed crypto projects, pumped coins, and posted nonstop on Twitter. He claimed to be a Bitcoin billionaire. He also said, “I haven’t paid taxes in 10 years because I blackmailed the U.S. government.” He got into politics, fled on a yacht, and warned the world about his death In 2016, John ran for U.S. President under the Libertarian Party. He ran again in 2020. His campaign was focused on ending government surveillance, legalizing drugs, and stopping what he called “the war against freedom.” His slogan was, “Privacy is freedom.” By 2019, U.S. authorities filed federal charges for tax evasion. He didn’t show up. Instead, he boarded a yacht in the Caribbean, posted videos of himself surrounded by prostitutes and armed bodyguards, and mocked the government. He refused to cooperate. He was wanted in three countries and didn’t care. In 2021, he was arrested by Spanish police. Facing 30+ years in prison if extradited to the U.S., he was found hanging in his cell on June 23, 2021. Before his death, Johnny had tweeted: “Know that if I hang myself, it will be no fault of mine.” He also had a tattoo that read “$WHACKD.” Hours after his death, a photo of a black “Q” was posted to his Instagram account, a clear reference to QAnon. Some people still believe he faked his death. John didn’t just build products. He built stories. His life was a non-stop stream of surveillance, paranoia, crypto, and media stunts. In 1994, he also started Tribal Voice, a company that built one of the world’s first instant messaging platforms called PowWow. By August 2009, John’s net worth had dropped to $4 million, down from $100 million. The 2008 crash wiped out his investments. But in 2016, he became CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a tech holding firm. The company planned to rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies, but Intel blocked it because of trademark issues. So, the company pivoted to cybersecurity. John said, “Antivirus software is dead, it no longer works,” and pushed a new product called Sentinel, which was supposed to stop hackers before they could attack. Soon after, Johnny said his team had found a flaw in Android that let him read encrypted WhatsApp messages. When Gizmodo found out he had sent out infected phones, John responded: “Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.” John then moved MGT into Bitcoin and crypto mining to make money and to gain experience with blockchain technology. In August 2017, he stepped down as CEO and took a new role as “chief cybersecurity visionary.” In January 2018, he cut ties with the company entirely. He said he wanted to focus on crypto full-time. MGT claimed investors had pressured them to distance from him. On August 13, 2018, he became CEO of Luxcore, a company focused on enterprise-level crypto products. By July 2017, Johnny made another wild statement. He tweeted that Bitcoin would reach $500,000 in three years. Then, in 2019, he raised the prediction to $1 million by the end of 2020. He said if it didn’t, he’d “eat his own dick on national television.” But in January 2020, John tweeted that the prediction was fake. He called it “a ruse to onboard new users and added that Bitcoin had limited use and was “an ancient technology.” “I understand Bitcoin completely. I was the world’s 6th largest Bitcoin miner in 2016 while running MGTi. If you think Bitcoin has value then you are the one who understands nothing.” – John McAfee So there you have it. John McAfee spent his life building, running, hacking, tweeting, and surviving. His story didn’t end with the company that still bears his name. It ended with a body in a Spanish prison and a tattoo that warned the world it would happen. Whether he’s dead or not, John changed how people saw privacy, surveillance, and crypto. He made enemies, millions, headlines, and chaos, which is just how he wanted it. And now, nearly four years after he died—or maybe didn’t—President Trump is back in office, crypto is still alive, and McAfee’s name keeps popping up. Some men disappear. Others turn themselves into a myth. And oh, Johnny’s Twitter account is still active.

Crypto trading firm DWF Labs is launching a $250 million Liquid Fund to support mid and large-cap crypto projects, saying it aims to accelerate adoption and expansion in the industry. In a March 24 blog announcement , DWF Labs said that the fund will provide investment sizes ranging from $10 million to $50 million per project. The firm says it has already committed $25 million and $10 million to two undisclosed projects, with more deals expected in the coming months. Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs, says the firm is looking to expand its efforts in accelerating web3 adoption, emphasizing that the team believes “strategic capital, coupled with hands-on ecosystem development, is the key to unlocking the next wave of growth for the industry.” DWF Labs suggests that the fund will go beyond traditional investments as each deal will include a tailored growth strategy, which may involve stablecoin liquidity support, lending market development, and marketing efforts.

In a March 23 interview with The Times, Gordon argued that the growing preference for crypto over traditional stock investments poses a threat to the UK economy. “It should terrify all of us that over half of under-45s own crypto and no equities,” Gordon said. She proposed applying stamp duty to crypto transactions—similar to the 0.5% tax currently levied on shares listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE)—while simultaneously reducing the same tax on equities. Currently, the LSE stamp duty generates around £3 billion ($3.9 billion) in annual tax revenue. Gordon believes that by reducing this tax and shifting the burden to crypto , more people would be incentivized to invest in local companies, boosting capital markets and potentially prompting more firms to go public. Concerns Over Crypto’s Economic Impact Gordon dismissed cryptocurrencies as “non-productive assets” that fail to contribute to the broader economy. In contrast, she emphasized that equities fund companies that “employ people, innovate, and pay corporate taxes”, reinforcing the economic social contract. Her remarks come as crypto ownership in the UK continues to rise. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 12% of British adults—roughly 7 million people—now own crypto, with the majority being under 55 years old. The FCA also revealed that 44% of UK adults reduced or stopped saving or investing altogether in the 12 months leading up to January 2024, largely due to the cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of Brits used their savings or sold investments to cover daily expenses. In November 2024, Bloomberg reported that the FCA was planning to finalize its crypto regulation laws by 2026, with key focus on trading platforms, crypto lending, and stablecoins. Slumping Markets Gordon’s plea comes at a time when the London stock market is struggling to attract new listings. According to consulting firm EY, only 18 companies listed on the LSE in 2024, down from 23 the previous year. In contrast, 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, citing declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to rival markets like the US. While Gordon acknowledged the challenges, she still believes the UK offers stability compared to the US , which she claims has become more volatile due to former President Trump’s tariff threats and recession fears.

In South Korea, a legislative proposal that could mandate the reporting of personal crypto wallets has ignited a firestorm of protest. Crypto enthusiasts and privacy advocates are banding together, and their collective voice is getting louder. An online petition challenging this controversial bill has not only gained traction but has officially crossed the threshold for parliamentary review. This means the South Korean government must now seriously consider the concerns raised by its citizens regarding crypto wallet reporting . What’s Fueling the Crypto Privacy Uproar in South Korea? The heart of the matter lies in a bill proposed by Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) lawmaker Ahn Do-geol. This bill seeks to amend existing legislation in a way that would require individuals to report their personal cryptocurrency wallets to the government. The petition, launched on February 25th, argues that this move could grant the South Korean government unprecedented and potentially intrusive access to monitor personal crypto wallets around the clock. Think about it – the inherent transparency of blockchain, while beneficial in many ways, could be weaponized to track and monitor citizens’ financial activities in the digital realm. This has sparked significant concerns about privacy violations and government overreach within the burgeoning South Korean crypto community. Let’s break down why this is such a hot topic: Round-the-Clock Monitoring: The petition highlights the fear that this bill could enable continuous surveillance of personal crypto wallets. Imagine every transaction, every holding, potentially under the government’s watchful eye. Privacy Erosion: For many crypto users, privacy is a fundamental principle. The idea of mandatory cryptocurrency privacy reporting clashes directly with this ethos. It raises questions about the extent to which governments should have access to individuals’ financial data, especially in a decentralized and often pseudonymous space like cryptocurrency. Potential for Misuse: The petition voices apprehension about the potential for government misuse of this information. While proponents might argue for regulatory oversight and combating illicit activities, critics worry about mission creep and the erosion of civil liberties. Impact on Innovation: Some argue that such stringent regulations could stifle innovation within the South Korean crypto sector. The country has been a hotbed for crypto activity, and overly restrictive rules could push talent and investment elsewhere. The Power of Petition: How Did the Crypto Community Respond? The response from the South Korean crypto community has been swift and decisive. The online petition platform became a battleground for digital rights. To trigger a parliamentary review, a petition needs to garner the support of at least 50,000 citizens within 30 days. This threshold wasn’t just met; it was surpassed, demonstrating the strong public sentiment against the proposed bill. This achievement underscores the power of collective action and the determination of the crypto community to safeguard their financial privacy. South Korea Crypto Regulation: A Balancing Act? South Korea has been at the forefront of South Korea crypto regulation globally. The government has been grappling with how to regulate this burgeoning industry while fostering innovation and protecting consumers. On one hand, regulations are essential to combat money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit activities often associated with cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, overly burdensome rules can stifle growth, drive innovation underground, and infringe upon individual liberties. The proposed crypto wallet reporting bill is a clear example of this tension. The government likely sees it as a necessary step to enhance transparency and control within the digital asset space. However, the crypto community views it as an overreach that could have detrimental consequences for privacy and innovation. The parliamentary review triggered by the petition now presents an opportunity for dialogue and a potential recalibration of the regulatory approach. Parliamentary Review: What Happens Next? The fact that the petition has reached the threshold for parliamentary review is a significant victory for the crypto community. It means that relevant parliamentary committees will now be obligated to examine the petition and the concerns it raises. This process typically involves: Committee Review: The petition will be reviewed by the relevant standing committees within the National Assembly. This could involve committees focused on legislation, justice, or technology. Public Hearings: Committees may choose to hold public hearings to gather input from stakeholders, including petitioners, government officials, industry experts, and privacy advocates. Debate and Deliberation: Parliamentarians will debate the merits of the petition and the proposed bill. This could lead to amendments, revisions, or even the withdrawal of the bill. Recommendations: The committees will issue recommendations based on their review, which will then be considered by the full National Assembly. While the review process doesn’t guarantee the bill will be scrapped or significantly altered, it does provide a crucial platform for the crypto community’s voice to be heard at the highest levels of government. It’s a chance to advocate for a more balanced approach to digital asset monitoring – one that protects legitimate users and fosters innovation while addressing genuine concerns about illicit activities. Beyond Petition: What Can Crypto Users Do? The South Korean petition serves as a powerful example of how collective action can influence policy. But what can individual crypto users and the broader community do to safeguard their privacy and advocate for responsible regulation? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and globally. Understanding the proposed rules and their potential impact is the first step. Engage with Policymakers: Participate in public consultations, contact your elected representatives, and make your voice heard. Petitions are one tool, but direct engagement is also crucial. Support Advocacy Groups: Organizations dedicated to digital rights and crypto advocacy play a vital role in shaping policy. Support their work through donations or volunteer efforts. Educate Others: Spread awareness about the importance of crypto privacy and the potential implications of intrusive regulations. The more people understand, the stronger the collective voice becomes. Utilize Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: Explore and utilize privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and tools that can enhance transaction anonymity and protect personal data (while being mindful of legal compliance in your region). The Fight for Crypto Privacy: A Global Movement? The situation in South Korea is not isolated. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The push for greater transparency and control is a global trend, and so is the pushback from privacy advocates and the crypto community. The Korean petition could be a bellwether, signaling a growing global movement demanding a more balanced approach to cryptocurrency privacy and regulation. The outcome of this parliamentary review will be closely watched, not just in South Korea, but around the world, as it could set a precedent for how governments engage with the crypto industry and address the crucial issue of digital privacy in the years to come. The fight for digital privacy in the crypto space is far from over. It’s a continuous dialogue, a push and pull between regulators and innovators, between control and freedom. The South Korean petition is a powerful reminder that the crypto community is not just a passive observer; it’s an active participant in shaping its own future.

Up until now, only Berachain’s ( BERA ) native exchange, BEX, was used to distribute rewards. Other decentralized applications will be able to apply for incentives through new reward vaults starting on Mar. 24, according to Berachain’s official announceme nt . This will help them expand by drawing liquidity. https://twitter.com/berachain/status/1902854165883167167?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Liquidity pools from multiple decentralized finance platforms have been included in the initial set of vaults, with more to be added later. This has opened up a more transparent system where users have more control over how incentives are allocated and projects vie for rewards. With Berachain’s PoL model, assets remain active in DeFi, in contrast to traditional proof-of-stake blockchains, where users lock up tokens for security. Network activity is limited in PoS systems because staked tokens are frequently not available for lending or trading. You might also like: Unichain, Berachain, and Iota lead blockchain growth in active users The system used by Berachain ensures that validators send back some rewards to the network rather than keeping them. Applications that boost activity on the blockchain and aid in its growth receive these rewards. The governance token, BGT, gives holders the ability to vote on which validators and projects receive support, thereby determining how these rewards are distributed. The first approved vaults focus on DEX liquidity pools, which allow users to swap tokens easily. These pools were selected based on their liquidity, security, and importance to the network. Liquidity pairs on BEX, Kodiak, Beradrome, and other protocols featuring key assets like BERA, HONEY, and BGT, as well as major stablecoins, are among the first approved vaults. Berachain has grown rapidly since launching its mainnet on Feb. 6. The platform now has $3.1 billion in total value locked and almost $1 billion in circulating stablecoins. The trading volume in February alone was $1.9 billion, according to DefiLlama data . Following launch , BERA hit an all-time high of $18.82 before falling to its present range of $6.03–$6.93. The network has a fully diluted volume of $3.37 and a $728 million market capitalization as of Mar. 24. The new governance initiative is expected to attract more users and contribute to further growth of the blockchain.

42258203,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142531,1742810407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Browser Use Secures $17M to Empower AI Agents for Effortless Website Navigation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-agents-browser-website-navigation/,"In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, the underlying technology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various sectors. One particularly exciting area is the development of AI ‘agents’ – intelligent systems designed to automate tasks online. Navigating the web, a seemingly simple task for humans, presents a significant hurdle for these agents. Enter Browser Use, a groundbreaking tool that’s making waves by simplifying website navigation for AI agents. This innovative startup has just announced a significant milestone: a seed funding round of $17 million, signaling strong investor confidence in their vision to streamline browser automation . Decoding Browser Use: Simplifying Website Navigation for AI Agents While the precise definition of an AI agent is still under debate, the ambition to create tools that empower these agents to perform online tasks autonomously is undeniable. Browser Use is at the forefront of this movement, capturing the attention of both developers and investors with its unique approach. Instead of relying on complex, often unreliable, vision-based systems, Browser Use transforms websites into a format that AI agents can readily understand – a text-like structure that breaks down website elements into digestible components. This dramatically improves the efficiency and reliability of AI agents when interacting with the web. Here’s how Browser Use is changing the game: Text-Based Website Representation: Browser Use moves away from screenshot-based navigation, converting website elements into a text format. This allows AI agents to ‘read’ and interpret websites more effectively, similar to how humans process text-based information. Enhanced Reliability and Cost-Efficiency: By understanding the underlying structure of websites, AI agents powered by Browser Use are less likely to encounter errors and breakdowns during navigation. This leads to more consistent task execution and reduced operational costs. Open-Source Foundation: Born from an open-source project, Browser Use encourages community collaboration and innovation. This approach has fostered rapid development and widespread adoption within the AI community. The $17 Million Seed Funding: Fueling the Future of Browser Automation The impressive $17 million seed funding round, led by Felicis and backed by prominent investors like Paul Graham and Nexus Venture Partners, underscores the immense potential of Browser Use. This financial injection will enable the company to further develop its technology, expand its team, and solidify its position as a foundational layer for web-navigating AI agents. The funding round, previously unreported, highlights the quiet but significant progress Browser Use has made in a short time. Key Investors in Browser Use Seed Round: Investor Firm Notable Participants Felicis Astasia Myers (Lead Investor) Individual Investors & Firms Paul Graham, A Capital, Nexus Venture Partners From ETH Zurich to Y Combinator: The Genesis of Browser Use The story of Browser Use began at ETH Zurich’s Student Project House accelerator, founded by Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic. Their journey, starting in 2024 during their master’s degrees in data science, reflects a blend of academic rigor and entrepreneurial spirit. Müller’s prior experience in web scraping combined with Zunic’s data science expertise proved to be a potent mix. Their breakthrough idea was to leverage data science principles to guide browser actions, effectively teaching AI agents how to interact with websites programmatically. The rapid development of a Browser Use demo in just five weeks, followed by its open-sourcing, speaks volumes about the team’s capabilities and the immediate appeal of their solution. Being part of Y Combinator’s prestigious Winter 2025 batch further validates their innovative approach and potential for growth. The Viral Impact of Manus: Showcasing Browser Use’s Capabilities Browser Use gained significant traction thanks to its integration into Butterfly Effect’s viral Manus tool. This Chinese startup leveraged Browser Use to power Manus, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of the technology in real-world scenarios. The virality of Manus significantly amplified awareness of Browser Use, propelling it into the spotlight and attracting wider developer interest. Addressing the Challenges of Dynamic Websites: LinkedIn Example One of the core challenges in browser automation is dealing with frequently changing websites. Platforms like LinkedIn, known for their dynamic updates, often break vision-based AI agents. Browser Use offers a robust solution to this problem. By understanding the underlying structure rather than relying on visual elements, it can adapt to website changes more effectively, ensuring consistent and reliable navigation even on dynamic platforms. Investor Perspective: Why Felicis is Betting Big on Web AI Agents Astasia Myers from Felicis highlights the strategic rationale behind their investment in Browser Use. Felicis has been closely monitoring the AI agents space for several years, recognizing its potential to revolutionize automation. Browser Use stood out due to its founding team, its open-source ethos, and its groundbreaking technology. Myers emphasizes the crucial role of web AI agents as a “dynamic bridge” connecting static AI models with the ever-changing digital landscape, enabling true end-to-end automation of human tasks. The Future is Agentic: Browser Use as a Foundational Layer Magnus Müller envisions Browser Use becoming a “fundamental layer” for the burgeoning field of web-navigating AI agents. With an increasing number of companies seeking to integrate AI agents into their workflows, the need for reliable and efficient website navigation tools is paramount. Browser Use is poised to meet this demand, providing a crucial infrastructure for the next generation of AI-powered applications. The fact that over 20 companies in the current Y Combinator batch are already utilizing Browser Use underscores its immediate relevance and widespread appeal within the tech ecosystem. In conclusion, Browser Use’s $17 million seed funding is not just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful validation of their vision to transform how AI agents interact with the web. By simplifying website navigation through their innovative technology, Browser Use is paving the way for a future where AI agents can seamlessly automate a vast array of online tasks, unlocking unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, Browser Use is strategically positioned to be a cornerstone of this transformative journey.

The meme coin has flipped resistance at $0.0000128, and speculation is now rife among traders about whether it will maintain the bullish trajectory and attract high buy volumes. In this article, we dive into how high SHIB will go if it records $50 billion to $100 billion in daily buy volumes. Impact of Volumes on Shiba Inu Price Trading volumes tend to have a major impact on the price. Each time buy volumes are high, the price reacts by trending higher while sell volumes push the price lower. Tradingview data highlights the correlation between buy volumes and Shiba Inu price. Whenever there is an uptick in buying activity, the ADX rises higher, indicating a strong bullish trend. Additionally, past trends show that high buying volumes have stirred gains of as high as 1,300% within days as seen on the SHIB weekly chart. SHIB/USDT: 1-week Chart This data suggests that if traders were to buy between $50 billion and $100 billion worth of SHIB, the resulting price rally would be parabolic. SHIB Price Potential with $50B or $100B Buy Volume If Shiba Inu attracted $50B to $100B daily buying volumes, the meme coin could attain the highly anticipated $0.01 SHIB price target . Here’s how: Scenario 1: SHIB attains $50B in daily buy volumes For context, SHIB’s daily trading volumes stand at around $138M at press time, which is 1.78% of the current Shiba Inu market cap of $7.76 billion. Assuming a direct relationship between volume and market cap, a 362% rise in trading volumes to $50B would push SHIB’s new market cap to $2.78 trillion. With this market cap and a supply of 589 trillion, 1 SHIB token will be worth $0.0047. Scenario 2: SHIB attains $100B in daily buy volumes On the other hand, to attain $100B in daily buy activity, this top meme coin would have to record a 724% rise in volumes, This would push its market cap to $5.55 trillion, where the price of 1 SHIB token will be worth $0.0094. This is close to the coveted $0.01 price target. Reasons Why SHIB May Not Attain These Targets in the Near Term Attaining $50 billion to $100 billion in buying volumes would push Shiba Inu to between $0.004 and $0.01. However, this Shiba Inu price prediction cannot be attained in the near term due to several reasons. The first is that with a market cap of between $2.7 trillion and $5.5 trillion, SHIB would surpass Bitcoin. This cannot be achieved in the near term because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and other top altcoins, Shiba Inu has yet to see a surge in institutional interest. Secondly, attaining daily buy volumes of between $50B and $100B is not realistic under the current market conditions. Bitcoin’s current daily volumes stand at $21 billion. For SHIB to attract more interest than Bitcoin and record an over 362% rise in volumes it would have to achieve high utility and intense adoption. Nevertheless, this price target can be achieved if there is a reduction in the total Shiba Inu supply through SHIB token burns . The filing of Shiba Inu ETF and the subsequent approval could also aid in increasing volume, making the $0.004 and $0.01 price targets achievable. Summary Shiba Inu price could rally to between $0.004 and $0.01 if daily buy volumes reached $50 billion to $100 billion. However, to attain such high volumes, the SHIB meme coin would have to record a massive surge in usage, adoption and institutional interest.

The altcoins have followed suit, led by AVAX’s impressive surge. In contrast, Pi Network’s PI token continues to bleed out. BTC Reclaims $87K The previous business week was quite eventful in terms of news, but not so much when it comes down to BTC price movements. The most volatile day turned out to be Wednesday, which was expected to an extent as the US Fed concluded its second meeting for the year. Although it refused to change the interest rates, bitcoin went on the move by going up and down by a few grand within hours. The fluctuations were also influenced by the statement from Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that the SEC would drop its lawsuit against his company. BTC flew to $87,500 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session but was quickly halted and pushed south by several grand. Nevertheless, it recovered most of the lost ground and returned to $84,000, where it spent most of the weekend. It went on the offensive late last night but kept climbing earlier today and surpassed $87,000. It even briefly tapped $87,600 (on Bitstamp) for the first time in over two weeks. Although it has retraced slightly since then, BTC still trades above $87,000. Its market cap has jumped to $1.730 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is up to 58.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AVAX Runs Wild As mentioned above, most alts are well in the green today. Ethereum is close to $2,100 after a 3.5% daily surge, XRP has surpassed $2.45 following a similar increase, while SOL, LINK, and SUI have marked gains of somewhere between 5-7%. Avalanche has stolen the show, though, charting a substantial 12% surge in the past day. As a result, AVAX has neared $22 for the first time in weeks. In contrast, PI continues to bleed out, dumping by another 6% in the past 24 hours to well below $1. The total crypto market cap has added around $80 billion since yesterday and is up to $2.960 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Adding to the woes, the Pi Network has seen its price dip below the crucial $1 mark from its all-time high of $3, leaving many Pioneers questioning its long-term potential. Despite efforts to expand the ecosystem with projects like PiDaoSwap and the launch of .pi domains, concerns over the network’s structure have overshadowed its progress. Now, fresh scrutiny over its SuperNodes has sparked debate over whether Pi Network is truly decentralized or just another centralized system in disguise. SuperNodes: A Centralization Problem? Pi Network claims to be a decentralized, community-driven project, but in reality, its core team (PCT) controls the SuperNodes that validate transactions. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where thousands of independent nodes secure the network, Pi’s system remains tightly managed. Initially, only three SuperNodes existed, all controlled by PCT in Canada and Finland. While the number has now grown to 42 as per Piscan.io , there’s little transparency. The team hasn’t shared a list of these SuperNodes or explained how they are selected, leaving many Pioneers confused about the process. Community Frustration Reaches Boiling Point However with the recent price drop, KYC details, controversy over its claims of decentralization. Many Pioneers are growing frustrated with the lack of rewards and participation opportunities. A Reddit post asking, “What is a SuperNode?” received vague responses from the team, only detailing their technical role without clarifying how one could become a SuperNode. On the other side, regular Pioneers who have been running nodes for months report no progress or rewards, further fueling skepticism. Some fear that only a select group with insider knowledge or powerful hardware can qualify, contradicting Pi Network’s vision of making crypto accessible to all. If participation is restricted, then is Pi Network really as decentralized as it claims to be? Whom to Blame? Meanwhile, the Pi Network Core Team reassured users that they are working hard behind the scenes to give Pi the value it deserves. They blamed the price drop on Pioneers who are only selling Pi instead of buying. According to them, once people start buying, the price will surge. Is Pi Network a Scam? Crypto analyst Justin Bons, Founder & CIO of Cyber Capital, has openly called Pi Network a scam. He pointed out flaws in its technology, tokenomics, and centralization, arguing that Pi relies heavily on Stellar’s technology and lacks true decentralized finance (DeFi) potential. Bons also criticized its mining model, likening it to a Ponzi scheme. For Pi Network to regain trust, PCT must address these concerns by making the SuperNode selection process transparent, publishing a list of approved nodes, and ensuring fair rewards for participants. Until then, doubts will continue to overshadow Pi’s vision, and its price may struggle to recover.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 10:14:58
